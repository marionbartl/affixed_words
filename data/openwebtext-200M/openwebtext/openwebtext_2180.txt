Social crisis in Detroit :
An investigative report
Part 1 : The spiraling cost of food
By Lawrence Porter and Naomi Spencer
20 June 2008
The following is the first of a three - part series .
Part two , " The impact of gas prices , " followed on June 21 ; and part three , " Collapse of an American city , " concluded the series on June 23 .
Over the past month , the World Socialist Web Site has conducted an investigation into the impact of rising food and gasoline prices on working class families in the Detroit metropolitan area .
Detroit , historically known as the auto capital of the world , has been transformed into the biggest poor city in America , according to the US Census Bureau , with an official poverty rate of 31.4 percent .
Detroit has earned this designation several times over the past 30 years as the auto industry destroyed tens of thousands of decent paying jobs .
This once booming city of 2 million has lost more than half of its population , now standing at 900,000 , with the exodus accelerating yearly .
In some areas only the poorest people remain and the tax and employment bases have collapsed .
As a result of the decline , Detroit has the highest high school dropout rate of any big city in the country — over 50 percent .
It also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the US and is listed among the top 10 cities in home foreclosures .
The city also has recently been determined to have the highest rate of families needing food assistance .
Historical comparisons , while never adequate , can often help to provide a point of reference for the transformation that has taken place over years or decades .
During the postwar period of the late 1940s and early 1950s , Detroit was the auto capital of the world .
At that time , 80 percent of the world ’s cars were built in the US , with a large percentage of them produced in Detroit .
During the 1950s , due to the relatively higher living standard of autoworkers , Detroit and the state of Michigan boasted one of the highest single - home ownership rates in the US .
Today , 5 percent of all homes in Detroit are in some form of foreclosure , a rate five times the national average .
According to some estimates , in the last year foreclosure auctions accounted for some 30 percent of home sales in counties surrounding Detroit .
It was also during the postwar period that the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) set the trend for wage gains and benefits for US workers through bitterly fought strikes against the Big Three auto companies .
In contrast , in 2007 , the UAW negotiated contracts with General Motors , Ford and Chrysler that cut the wages of new hires to half of previous levels , down to $ 14 an hour with limited benefits .
While the workers lost wages , the union won control over the multibillion - dollar retirement health care program known as VEBA ( Voluntary Employees ’ Beneficiary Association ) .
The recently concluded strike of auto workers against American Axle Manufacturing has resulted in cutting wages for existing workers from $ 28 an hour to as low as $ 10 an hour , a rate below the official poverty level for a family of four and amounting to insufficient income to support a mortgage .
Just as in the immediate post - WWII period the relatively high living standards of auto workers set the standard for American society at large , so today every concession and claw - back granted to the auto bosses by the UAW sets the stage for lowered wages and layoffs throughout the US economy .
The situation confronting Detroit is a particularly sharp expression of a growing trend in Michigan , the Midwest , and across the country .
Detroit , like many industrial cities , has been severely hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs — in this case in auto and supporting industries — that has left whole communities devastated .
The Detroit metropolitan area alone has lost 150,000 jobs since 2000 , affecting both the inner city and the surrounding suburban area .
The protracted deterioration of living standards for the majority of the city ’s working class population has accelerated sharply as a result of the spiraling of food and energy prices , a worldwide phenomenon that has provoked mass demonstrations , rioting and the fall of governments in other countries .
During the weeks in which we gathered the information and interviews for this report , the cost of gasoline shot up from $ 3.65 to $ 4.09 a gallon .
Food price increases have been almost as dramatic .
In the past year , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the price of bread increased by 16.3 percent , eggs by 34.8 percent , milk by 23.1 percent and flour by 37 percent .
Signs of distress are readily apparent .
On May 11 , the Detroit Free Press published an article noting the increase in food aid throughout the state .
The article featured an unemployed auto parts designer who lived in one of the more affluent Detroit suburbs , Grosse Pointe Woods .
The article reports that according to the Michigan Department of Human Services a record number of Michigan residents — 1.26 million adults and children in 590,600 households — are using government - issued food stamps .
Three out of ten recipients in the state live in Wayne County , where Detroit is located , and the overwhelming majority are residents of the city itself .
According to the Free Press , Michigan has seen a 53 percent increase in food stamp need since 2003 , with one in five children living in a household qualifying for food stamps .
Underscoring the fact that the development is far from a localized problem , however , Michigan was third in the line of increased need , with Massachusetts experiencing a 77 percent increase and Iowa a 63 percent increase .
Nationwide , a staggering 27.7 million people received food stamps in the month of January 2008 , with food and fuel prices jumping substantially since the beginning of the year .
The impact of food inflation in Detroit
Over the past month , the WSWS has conducted interviews with local residents , food bank suppliers and charity workers on the impact of recent food and fuel price increases on working class families in Detroit .
Jada Browning , 29 , recently lost her job as a waitress after the restaurant where she worked closed down .
She spoke to the WSWS of the difficulties she faced in providing for her three children , aged two , four and twelve .
“ Some weeks we have less meals , no one can have seconds if they are still hungry , ” she said .
“ You have to ration portions out better .
It ’s ridiculous . ”
Asked if her family ’s situation had worsened in relation to the inflation of the last year , Jada said , “ Yes , the last year or year and a half . ”
Even at the discount grocery store where she did her shopping , she told us , “ You used to be able to get things for a dollar or a dollar - fifty .
Now it is two - fifty .
A gallon of milk is almost four dollars .
It ’s insane . ”
Ola Horne , a retiree living on a fixed income , noted the growing hardships in Detroit .
“ Times are bad .
People are losing their homes .
You ca n’t keep up with this economy .
Utilities are up .
People ’s salaries are being decreased — the cost of living is increasing .
“ I ’m a 67 - year - old senior , and it ’s impossible , ” she said .
“ There are no dreams .
Your dream is you wake up tomorrow and your house is still on the block , or your utilities have n’t been shut off , or you can buy $ 5 worth of gas , which used to get you five gallons .
Now you ca n’t get one gallon . ”
“ If I was employable , that would be one thing , ” Ola said , “ but who ’s going to hire ? ”
Dwayne Wells , president of Gleaners Food Bank , the largest food bank distributor in the Detroit metropolitan area , told the WSWS that in the last year alone the agency distributed over 25 million pounds of food to 420 partner agencies , such as the Salvation Army , the Capuchin Soup Kitchen , and others .
Wells said the 40 tons of food distributed daily last year was still not sufficient to meet the growing need for food .
In particular , he said , agencies were straining to meet the needs of “ first time people coming to them looking for assistance .
More working poor , more seniors who are having trouble making ends meet — and therefore are not able to meet the food needs for themselves or their families . ”
Low - income working families and those living on fixed incomes are especially vulnerable to inflation , Wells noted .
“ If you factor in increases in utility costs , transportation costs and medical costs , there is typically for those folks not enough money by the end of the month to help them purchase food and other things that they need .
And that ’s where Gleaners and their partners come in . ”
Gleaners recently issued an urgent appeal for funds after seeing their donations go down as the food need rises .
Wells said the individual donations and the corporate donations have dropped because of the “ tough times ” presently being experienced in Detroit and Michigan .
“ Overall you could say the entire economy in the US is suffering , but Michigan is one of the places where the need is heightened . ”
Wells felt strongly that the economic problems witnessed in Detroit were not race - based .
“ They cross all the demographics of age , race and culture ... inner-city , suburban , rural .
It is widespread . ”
Wells also noted that the problems confronting the working poor were not short - term or simply a matter of individual hardships , personal “ hard times . ”
“ In the past , ” he said , “ people with families would come for the first two or three months [ after losing a job ] , they would find employment and get through the temporary crisis they might have been having , then they would stop coming . ”
“ Now those people are not cutting off after three months , ” he said .
“ They are continuing to have to rely , so they are coming every 30 days now or taking a longer period of time to right themselves .
It is becoming less of an emergency food system and becoming more of a regular ‘ gap ’ filler . ”

Not only has IBM 's Roadrunner supercomputer come on - line , it 's now the world 's fastest -- twice as fast as the old BluGene / L champ -- and churning through 1.026 quadrillion calculations per second .
The $ 133 million supercomputer achieved the milestone with the help of 12,960 " improved " Cell processors ( yes , like those powering your PS3 ) and a smaller number of AMD Opteron processors -- 116,640 processor cores in total .
Unfortunately ( or fortunately depending upon your perspective ) , Roadrunner is for military use only so you 'll have to solve the traveling salesman problem on your own time .
While not quite into Exaflop territory , we 're definitely on the way .

There ’s been quite a bit of work going on in Mocha over recent months , but a release is long overdue .
The API is now pretty stable and so this release jumps from version 0.5 to 0.9 .
Much of the work has been refactoring Mocha ’s internals to support new features and make the code more maintainable .
Before attempting the refactoring , extensive acceptance tests were added .
One of the benefits of this is that it should now be easier to write new acceptance tests if you want to suggest new features or illustrate a bug ;-)
Here ’s a quick summary of the changes in the release .
I ’ll try to post some code examples here in the near future .
Ordering constraints
Based on the JMock constraints with the same names …
Added “ sequences ” for constraining the order of expected invocations .
See Standalone #sequence and Expectation #in_sequence .
Added “ states ” for constraining the order of expected invocations .
See Standalone#states , Expectation #then , Expectation #when and StateMachine .
Configurable warnings or errors
When a method on a non-public method is stubbed
When a method on a non-existent method is stubbed
When a method on a non-mock object is stubbed ( partial mocking )
When a method is stubbed unnecessarily ( i.e. the stubbed method is not called during the test )
See Configuration for more details .
Improved error messages
A more readable and complete list of unsatisfied expectations , satisfied expectations and state machines .
Display more sensible failure message for any_instance expectations .
Parameter matchers
New to this release : optionally ( allows matching of optional parameters if available ) , yaml_equivalent ( allows matching of YAML that represents the specified object ) , responds_with ( tests the quack not the duck ) .
Nesting of matchers is now supported .
Syntax shortcut
An optional block can be passed into the Standalone # mock method .
The block is evaluated in the context of the new mock instance and can be used as a shortcut to set up expectations .
Ruby & Rails compatibility
Tested with Ruby 1.8.4 , 1.8.5 , 1.8.6 & 1.9 .
All related bugs and warnings believed to be fixed .
Tested with Rails 1.2.3 & Rails 2.1.0 .
Deprecation
There is no longer any need to have a “ require ‘ stubba ’ ” statement in your code .
A deprecation warning has been added to this effect , because the file will be removed in a future release .
Bug fixes
The irony in Stephen Lendman 's article " Chavez Revamps His Intelligence Services : The Corporate Media React " is so deep and obvious it 's amazing that he does n't see it .
Here we go .
Mr. Lendman wrote :
He referred to the new Law on Intelligence and Counterintelligence that passed by presidential decree under the legislatively - granted enabling law .
He failed to explain that the 1969 law passed the same way , and that Venezuela 's Constitution then and now permit it .
Dictators rule by decree .
There was a dictatorship in Venezuela before Chavez and there continues to be one under him .
Mr. Lendman 's own words point this out .
Remember " meet the new boss , same as the old boss " ?
In the words of Simon Bolivar , " Huid del pais donde uno solo ejerce todo el poder : es un pais de esclavos . "
( Flee from the country were one man exercises all power for it is a country of slaves . )
Mr. Lendman also wrote :
New tools will be used and current personnel retrained and vetted for their Bolivarian commitment .
Would he aprove of that being implemented here ?
Should Bush vet people at the FBI , CIA , ad nauseum to see how Republican they are ?
I 'll assume the answer is no .
So why does he think it 's OK for the Red Paratrooper to do it ?
What seems strange about progressives is that they correctly see Bush as a dictator yet are blind to Chavez 's dictatorial ways .
They 're both doing all the same things .
They have much more in common than they have differences .
A better translation of the decree 's title is The National System for Intelligence and Counterintelligence Act .
The most problematic aspects of this decree are to be found in chapter five :
Article 20 ( Capitulo V , Articulo 20 ) allows the intelligence organs to operate without judicial oversight .
Article 21 of the same chapter allows the government to keep secret all " proof & indications " related to any investigation until they decide to release them .
Which will most likely be never .
Article 22 states that the government can take whatever steps it deems necessary to protect informants , without judicial oversight .
They can do anything to anyone by claiming to be protecting an informant .
Article 24 requires people to cooperate with the government in any investigation .
This is how one creates a national snitch system .
Sounds like a dictatorship to me .
One is reminded of the last century 's progressives defending the USSR .
It all sounded great at the time , but when the truth came out it was pretty ugly .
As we can see , so it is with Venezuela .
********************************
6/8/08 update : After all the debate about this issue it looks like Chavez realized he went too far .

Chavez Knocked Down Again
Radiation still so intense , the area is highly dangerous A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan , India , covers a three - square mile area , ten miles west of Jodhpur .
Scientists are investigating the site , where a housing development was being built .
For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of birth defects and cancer in the area under construction .
The levels of radiation there have registered so high on investigators ' gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region .
Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic blast dating back thousands of years , from 8,000 to 12,000 years , destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half - million people .
One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945 .
The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the continent .
" A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe ...
An incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns , rose in all its splendor ... it was an unknown weapon , an iron thunderbolt , a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race .
" The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable .
Their hair and nails fell out , pottery broke without any apparent cause , and the birds turned white .
" After a few hours , all foodstuffs were infected .
To escape from this fire , the soldiers threw themselves into the river . "
Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings are full of such descriptions , which sound like an atomic blast as experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
He says references mention fighting sky chariots and final weapons .
An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva , a section of the Mahabharata .
" The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate entire armies , causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees , " says Ganguli .
" Instead of mushroom clouds , the writer describes a perpendicular explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant parasols .
There are comments about the contamination of food and people 's hair falling out . "
Archeologist Francis
Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city .
" It 's so mid-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear technology before we did .
The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare . "
Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the investigation .
The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley , who pioneered the investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered .

Thanks to Lauren Davis for life - saving research help .
Reddit today announced that it is open - sourcing almost all the code that powers its site and community .
Ars Technica interviewed reddit co-founder Steve Huffman on why one of the web 's most popular social news sites would hand over the technological keys to its success .
As one of the first social news sites to appear in 2005 , reddit now sports over 4.5 million monthly unique visitors who generate 120 million pageviews a month .
The site experienced its largest growth spurt — a whopping 1,033 percent — in December 2007 with just over 4.1 million unique visitors , and 23 percent of reddit 's users have registered just this year after the company introduced its user - generated category area , called reddits .
With all this impressive growth in the past year , my first question for Huffman was : " why ? "
Many could argue that open - sourcing the back end of a site that 's on a roll like reddit 's would be grounds for getting someone committed .
But Huffman is n't worried .
Reddit " offers an alternative to mainstream media , " according to its co-founder , and they are n't worried about competitors trumping them with their own technological bread and butter .
If the competition was going to pounce , " they would 've replaced reddit by now . "
Most of reddit 's formula for success is already public .
The site offers a comparatively minimal , text - centric UI for voting on stories , leaving comments , and browsing reddits .
Clearly , the user - generated nature of reddits and their ability to be public , restricted to select users , or completely private was a major traffic boost for the site , and open sourcing almost all of its code is a move to bring in even more traffic .
Surprisingly , reddit is powered by a team of just five members , including Huffman .
The decision to open source was also fueled by the potential for building the site based on community ideas and code .
" We have a huge community of programmers on reddit who are constantly telling me how to do my job , " Huffman explained .
" Now we have a chance to see if they can walk the walk and actually help us out . "
Reddit fully plans to accept new features programmed for the site from the community , though it does n't quite have a solid process in place for incorporating user - contributed code just yet .
Another major contributing factor in reddit 's decision is the company 's commitment to both the community and transparency .
A major criticism of social news sites , especially digg , is that they are either easily gamed , rigged by a secret society of editors and " news mafia , " or both .
By making all of its code available — including the front page 's algorithm — reddit wo n't have to worry about those accusations anymore .
" Our value is more in the loyalty of our community than it is in our technology , " Huffman said .
The majority of reddit is built from open - source technologies anyway .
" It seems only fair that we release the code of reddit " back to the community .
" I know I have learned an incredible amount in the last three years working on reddit , " Huffman continued .
" I hope others might find value in it . "
Not all of reddit 's code will be released , however .
Huffman told me that while about 95 percent of reddit 's code base is getting released at code.
reddit.com under the CPAL license ( the same one Facebook used to open source its own platform ) , including the rating algorithm that chooses which stories float to the front page , the company will keep specific portions of code under wraps .
For obvious reasons , these code portions that will remain locked away are related to preventing cheating , gaming the system , and fighting spam .
Disclosure : Reddit is owned by Condé Nast , Ars Technica 's new parent company .
IT WAS THE biggest corporate deal in the history of sub-Saharan Africa : Last October , a foreign firm spent nearly $ 6 billion for a chunk of Standard Bank , the South African company that has long dominated finance on the continent .
Yet the foreign suitor was not Citigroup , or UBS , or some other titan of private commerce .
It was the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , a company owned wholly by the Chinese government .
On a business level , the deal gave ICBC's Chinese customers access to banking across Africa , and set the stage for closer relations between Chinese companies and African nations .
In a bigger sense , it embodies a change that is reshaping the dynamics of global business .
In the past five years , governments around the world have been transforming themselves into deal makers and business players on a scale never seen in the modern era .
In China , state - owned oil giant PetroChina has become the largest company in the world , worth more than $ 1 trillion .
In Russia , state - owned Gazprom has grown into the world 's largest gas company .
States are also wielding influence by directly buying into major private firms :
The investment fund run by the Arab emirate of Abu Dhabi is now the world 's largest , and recently spent $ 7.5 billion to become the top shareholder of the American financial giant Citigroup .
Singapore 's state - controlled wealth fund , Temasek Holdings , sank $ 5 billion into Merrill Lynch , the largest US brokerage .
By 2015 , according to an estimate by Morgan Stanley , such state - owned funds will control a staggering $ 12 trillion , far outpacing any private investors .
The rise of states as global economic players marks a sharp reversal from decades in which private enterprise seemed an unstoppable force in global finance , commerce , and culture .
It represents a new and unexpected fusion of state control with the business principles of capitalism .
And it is already causing a significant shift in global power .
The new state capitalists - China , the United Arab Emirates , Russia , and others - are primarily authoritarian nations .
And as they become bigger commercial players , they are gaining new influence in a realm once dominated by the democratic West .
Some political scientists , such as Azar Gat of Tel Aviv University , who coined the phrase " authoritarian capitalism " to describe the trend , see these countries as the first major threat to the idea of free - market democracy since fascism and communism .
One striking recent study by the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington think tank , shows that the economies of politically unfree nations have grown faster than those of politically free nations over the past decade , often through forceful use of business and financial power .
A recent report by the global monitoring organization Freedom House found that " a group of market - oriented autocracies " were an important force in an overall decline in world freedom .
Arch Puddington , Freedom House 's director of research , sees these countries ' new financial clout as having significant consequences for the world .
" These autocracies are unapologetic and increasingly assertive , at home and abroad , " he writes .
In modern times , business and government have occupied increasingly separate spheres in Western economies - separation that has laid the groundwork for their economic ascendancy .
By the end of the 20th century , many economists and political scientists assumed there was no other path to growth .
The modern record of state - controlled business , by contrast , was chiefly one of failure .
When the fascist and communist governments of the 20th century seized the reins of domestic industries , they ended up undermining development and bringing misery to millions of their own citizens .
As private enterprise flourished in the West , the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union were widely seen as a repudiation of the idea that governments could successfully control the business sector .
But the wake of the Cold War also sowed the seeds of a new discontent with free - market private enterprise .
Many emerging nations were stung by ill - planned privatization strategies in the 1990s .
In Latin America , a decade of privatization proved so unpopular that , in a regionwide poll taken in 2001 , a majority of people across 17 countries viewed privatization unfavorably .
Across Africa , this era , known as the " lost decade , " resulted in rising poverty , and even longing for some nations ' authoritarian past .
The failure of those privatization strategies helped create a ready audience for a different model .
Perhaps the most dramatic example is China .
Over the past 25 years , while keeping firm control over its economy , China has adopted many of the tools of capitalism - ceding some operational power to a Western - trained executive class , inviting foreign investment and partnerships , and buying and selling on the global open market .
Beijing has also selected a range of strategic industries to develop , from oil to telecommunications to automobiles .
By creating the state - owned China National Chemical Corporation in 2004 , Beijing birthed a plastics manufacturing giant , one that quickly swallowed foreign companies like Qenos , one of the biggest plastics firms in Australia .
State - owned Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile bought up famed British car brand MG Rover , while Huawei , boosted by massive loans from state - linked Chinese banks , has expanded around the globe , even trying to take over US tech giant 3Com , a deal essentially scuttled by Congress .
The result has been the most staggering economic development in modern history - all with a firm government hand on the tiller , and without the liberal political reforms considered by many in the West essential to economic growth .
China has become the third - largest economy in the world ; the city of Shanghai has transformed into a soaring business district packed with skyscrapers and luxury hotels .
Even smaller provincial cities have grown into high - rise centers whose shopping malls are packed with moneyed Chinese buying up cars , lattes , and all the other fruits of capitalist prosperity .
The Chinese example is proving immensely influential .
Though China does not explicitly promote itself as a model of development , its government runs training programs for thousands of technocrats from across the globe , who hail from nations as wide ranging as Cuba and Vietnam .
At last year 's African Development Bank summit , held in Shanghai , President Marc Ravalomanana of Madagascar told the hosts , " You are an example of transformation .
We in Africa must learn from your success . "
Even officials from wealthier developing nations come home impressed .
When I interviewed one leading Thai businessman , a titan who owns a slew of industrial estates , he could n't stop talking about China 's development .
He marveled at how quickly investments could be set up in a Chinese city :
If the government decided it wanted that company , it would make permits so easy they could be done in a day .
In Syria , the government of Bashar Assad has launched plans to emulate China , while in Iran both reformers and conservatives have discussed how to copy China .
Raul Castro , who has visited China several times , reportedly wants to emulate Beijing in revamping Cuba 's economy .
Other nations are building their own powerhouse companies .
In Russia , Vladimir Putin essentially has shut down most of Russia 's privately held natural resources companies in order to build up the national gas firm Gazprom and other state companies .
Gazprom alone controls roughly one - fifth of all gas production in the world , far larger than any private sector rival .
( And its financial power translates into political power : Presumptive next Russian president Dmitry Medvedev , anointed by Putin , previously ran Gazprom . )
Under Putin , the Kremlin also has extended its reach into industries from titanium manufacturing to aviation .
Across Latin America and Central Asia , governments like Bolivia , Venezuela , and Kazakhstan also have reasserted state control over their oil and gas resources .
Already , many of these national companies dwarf any rivals .
State - owned oil companies around the world now control nearly five times the reserves of their private rivals ; Saudi Aramco , the Saudi government 's oil company , can pump roughly three times as much oil as any other firm , and has launched a massive $ 50 billion expansion program that will make it even more powerful .
Corporate behemoths such as ExxonMobil and Shell may be among the largest private corporations in the world , but they are no longer the biggest players in their own industry .
In aviation , an industry that requires vast amounts of capital , state - linked airlines now dominate private firms .
From virtually nothing two decades ago , Dubai has built Emirates airlines , backed by the state , into a world leader and the second - most profitable airline in the world .
The most profitable , Singapore Airlines , also enjoys state support - Singapore 's state - owned fund owns nearly half the airline , as well as six of the country 's other largest corporations .
Nations are entering global business in another way as well .
Besides building companies , states are using their cash reserves to create their own investment funds , and have rapidly become major players in global finance .
The rising price of oil has put a gusher of cash in the hands of authoritarian petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Russia , all of which now want to invest their cash hoards .
With their pile of reserves , oil producers like the United Arab Emirates and Asian exporters have developed massive state - controlled funds that can buy into companies around the globe .
Abu Dhabi's fund alone controls nearly $ 900 billion , while China 's controls $ 200 billion and Kuwait's $ 250 billion .
Overall , state - controlled funds control as much as $ 7 trillion , according to several estimates , more than the entire hedge - fund industry .
And they are growing .
" The [ funds ] will become absolutely massive in size in the not - too - distant future , and will have powerful implications for the financial markets , " notes Morgan Stanley 's Stephen Jen , an expert on state funds .
As the global business momentum shifts from private companies to national governments , the implications are far reaching .
Many authoritarian governments realize that , in the post - Cold War era , a wealthy nation can extend its power very effectively without trying to build an army to compete with the US in military force in the short term .
In Beijing , policy makers have developed a definition of China 's strength called " comprehensive national power , " which goes far beyond military strength to include economic might .
China is now becoming a major aid donor across Africa , which it can than leverage to help Chinese companies win access to African resources .
The state capitalists also are gaining influence through their power in global finance .
As firms like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have found out , state funds provide a vital new source of investment across a world in need of capital .
The funds are increasingly bailing out American banks , giving them significant leverage over the US financial sector .
They also are forcing the financial world , accustomed to a tight circle of power concentrated in places like New York and London , to woo developing nations .
As shown by this winter 's deals , leading banks have begun aggressively courting Middle Eastern and Asian state funds .
Global institutions , too , understand the power shift : Recognizing China 's growing economic might , the International Monetary Fund has revamped its voting structure to give Beijing more power .
Yet these state funds are often far more opaque than major investors in the West .
Even the largest , like Abu Dhabi's , reveal little about their workings .
And unlike hedge funds , which are also secretive , they could be acting on political motives rather than purely financial ones .
When a Russian fund buys into companies in Eastern Europe , for example , it is impossible to tell if it is doing so for financial reasons or to boost the Kremlin 's political influence over its neighbors .
On May 22 , researchers at Osaka University presented the first demonstration of cold fusion since an unsuccessful attempt in 1989 that has clouded the field to this day .
To many people , cold fusion sounds too good to be true .
The idea is that , by creating nuclear fusion at room temperature , researchers can generate a nearly unlimited source of power that uses water as fuel and produces almost zero waste .
Essentially , cold fusion would make oil obsolete .
However , many experts debate whether money should be spent on cold fusion research or applied to more realistic alternative energy solutions .
For decades , researchers around the world have been simply trying to show that cold fusion is indeed possible , but they´ve yet to take that important first step .
Now , esteemed Physics Professor Yoshiaki Arata of Osaka University in Japan claims to have made the first successful demonstration of cold fusion .
Last Thursday , May 22 , Arata and his colleague Yue - Chang Zhang of Shianghai Jiotong University presented the cold fusion demonstration to 60 onlookers , including other physicists , as well as reporters from six major newspapers and two TV studios .
If Arata and Zhang´s demonstration is real , it could lead to a future of new , clean , and cheap energy generation .
In their experiment , the physicists forced deuterium gas into a cell containing a mixture of palladium and zirconium oxide , which absorbed the deuterium to produce a dense " pynco " deuterium .
In this dense state , the deuterium nuclei from different atoms were so close together that they fused to produce helium nuclei .
Evidence for the occurrence of this fusion came from measuring the temperature inside the cell .
When Arata first injected the deuterium gas , the temperature rose to about 70° C ( 158° F ) , which Arata explained was due to nuclear and chemical reactions .
When he turned the gas off , the temperature inside the cell remained warmer than the cell wall for 50 hours , which Arata said was an effect of nuclear fusion .
While Arata´s demonstration looked promising to his audience , the real test is still to come : duplication .
Many scientists and others are now recalling the infamous 1989 demonstration by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons , who claimed to produce controlled nuclear fusion in a glass jar at room temperature .
However , no one - including Fleischmann and Pons - could duplicate the experiment , leading many people to consider cold fusion a pseudoscience to this day .
But one witness at the recent demonstration , physicist Akito Takahashi of Osaka University , thought that the experiment should be able to be repeated .
" Arata and Zhang demonstrated very successfully the generation of continuous excess energy [ heat ] from ZrO2 - nano - Pd sample powders under D2 gas charging and generation of helium - 4 , " Takahashi told New Energy Times .
" The demonstrated live data looked just like data they reported in their published papers [ J. High Temp .
Soc. Jpn , Feb. and March issues , 2008 ] .
This demonstration showed that the method is highly reproducible . "
In addition , researchers will have to repeat the experiment with larger amounts of the palladium and zirconium oxide mixture in order to generate larger quantities of energy .

The Internal Revenue Service has concluded that Senator Barack Obama ’s church , the United Church of Christ , did not violate nonprofit tax laws when Senator Obama addressed the denomination ’s 50th anniversary General Synod in June 2007 .
You may recall that the IRS was investigating the denomination claiming that it had “ reasonable belief ” that the circumstances surrounding the speech had political overtones .
Nonprofit organizations , including churches , are prohibited from engaging in behavior that urges support for a political candidate .
The IRS determined that the UCC had made several attempts to stay in compliance noting that the invitation to Obama came “ well before he announced his candidacy and that [ he ] was invited to speak … in a non-candidate capacity , on how his personal faith intersected with his public life . ”
Additionally , the IRS found that the UCC had advised those in attendance that Senator Obama was there as a member of the church and not as a candidate for office , that the audience should not attempt to engage in any political activities , and that the church ’s legal counsel had advised Senator Obama ’s campaign on the ground rules for the speech .
The IRS also concluded that the UCC did not authorize campaign volunteers to set up tables near the entrance of the Hartford Civic Center and that the UCC website provided a link to the IRS fact sheet on prohibited campaign - related activities by non-profit groups .
The church ’s legal counsel was also found to have properly advised UCC leaders regarding their responsibilities .
The UCC was represented in the matter by the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr on a pro bono basis .

Rush is sometimes described as the whitest rock band in the world .
Geddy Lee ’s high - pitched banshee - like wail can sometimes even make Morrissey sound as buttery as Al Green .
I think that even when one Anglophile finds out another Anglophile listens to Rush , they are like , “ Damn , you ’re white ! ”
As a member of a minority in the U.S. ( which I am ) , admitting to your family that you ’re a fan might possibly be the ultimate taboo .
It might even transcend the turbulence and alienation of confessing homosexuality .
The shock .
The horror .
The confusion .
Most likely your family wo n’t even know who Rush are , and if so , you might be in the clear — but one can only be so lucky .
It would n’t surprise me if there were a black kid somewhere , as I type this , who is attempting to extol the virtues of Geddy Lee ’s bass chops on “ Overture / The Temples of Syrinx ” just before being shamed back into secrecy by his lesbian sister .
Living in South San Diego in the early ’ 80s , I was a typical preteen .
On sunny Saturdays my dad would blast his soul and funk records and the cholos would drive by in their impeccably waxed cars bumping oldies .
When I was about 8 , I received my first hip - hop mix tape , and witnessing a B - boy ’s greasy Jheri - curled head gyrating effortlessly on the marble floor in front of the local theater was probably the single most exciting public spectacle I had experienced up to that point .
Then I found rock .
The kids I hung out with were a motley bunch from various ethnic backgrounds : Mexican , Guamanian , and , in my case , African - American and Filipino .
We got into rock music to escape the predictable doldrums of neighborhood life .
Rush seemed to be the puzzle piece that fit perfectly into the obsessive trajectory toward male puberty .
First it was insects , next military weaponry , after that Star Wars ( duh ) , then Dungeons & Dragons , and , of course , Neal Peart ’s drum set .
Neal Peart ’s drum set was fodder for hours of adoration and debate within my group of friends .
It was bigger , shinier , and more accessorized than anyone else ’s — and he could play it with a level of technicality that was just incomprehensible to us .
We would stare at live pictures trying to identify which piece made what sound on which song : “ That ’s gotta be the glockenspiel ! ” I remember one of my friends practically getting into a fistfight with this fat loudmouth kid over the pronunciation of Neil ’s name .
“ Puurrrrt , ” my friend said .
“ Peee - urrrrt , ” the other kid snidely claimed .
They had to be separated .
My friends and I had a quasi- rehearsal space in my garage that resembled Fat Albert and the gang ’s junkyard jam studio .
We had a chalkboard set up with our band name , “ YYZ ” ( Rush ’s classic instrumental track , complete with multiple time signatures ) , drawn on it .
My drum set consisted of whatever crap was lying around that I could beat on .
I vividly remember that for my snare drum I used a little wooden recipe box , and for drumsticks I repurposed some old nunchucks I ’d made from a thick broomstick handle when we were all going through our martial - arts phase .
I had originally painted the nunchucks silver , and when I drummed the paint would bleed off onto my hands .
By the end of rehearsal , I looked like one of those gas - huffing Romanian kids covered in Auralac .
My dad was a man ’s man originally from southern Texas , a hardened Vietnam vet .
Most of my leisure activities evoked bewilderment and regret from my pops , but this newfound music interest seemed to take his feelings of perplexity to a new level .
He would peer into the garage and just shake his head .
“ Actin ’ like a fool , ” he ’d say to me .
I used to try make my mom listen to Rush on my portable Panasonic cassette player .
Looking back , I guess it was a bit of a stretch to think I could turn her on to a Canadian prog-rock power trio that put out concept albums based on dystopian tales set in the year 2112 , since she was still just getting a grasp on American culture .
Listening to AM Gold and Freddie Aguilar was probably the most adventurous she had ever gotten with music .
I would think to myself , “ She ’ll love the intro to ‘ The Trees , ’ she just has n’t heard it enough . ”
I ’d turn up a highly technical passage for her to hear , and she would just grimace and in her hard Filipino accent say , “ Aye , it ’s soooo ogly ! ”
As I got older , I obsessed less over Rush and moved on to other bands .
I knew I wanted to hang out with girls , and telling them you ’re a Rush fan usually is n’t your biggest selling point .
It ’s kind of like saying , “ Hey , I still play with toys while I take a bath , do you wanna make out ? ”
Like so many people , I honestly felt the albums following Moving Pictures just did n’t do it for me , though I was , and still am , a fan at heart .
I eventually graduated to playing real instruments .
As a musician , I ’ve always embraced the music - nerd side of me cultivated by hours of listening to Rush .
I ’ve learned that no matter what type of musician you are , if you have the mettle to flawlessly execute Rush riffs , you will be highly revered .
But if you can flawlessly execute Rush riffs , wear clothes that fit , are n’t a virgin , and do n’t hang around Guitar Center entering contests called “ Guitarmageddon ” and “ Bass Wars ” — then you will be a god .

Women 's reports of persistent , recent - onset symptoms linked to ovarian cancer -- abdominal or pelvic pain , difficulty eating or feeling full quickly and abdominal bloating -- when combined with the CA125 blood test may improve the early detection of ovarian cancer by 20 percent , according to new findings by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center published online in CANCER .
Research has found that when used alone , a simple four - question symptom - screening questionnaire and the CA125 ovarian - cancer blood test each detect about 60 percent of women with early - stage ovarian cancer and 80 percent of those with late - stage disease .
This study found that when used together , the questionnaire and blood test may boost early - detection rates to more than 80 percent and late - stage detection rates to more than 95 percent .
" Of course , it is the increase in the detection of early - stage disease that is the most exciting , " said lead author M. Robyn Andersen , Ph.D. , an associate member of the Public Health Sciences Division at the Hutchinson Center .
Cure rates for those diagnosed when the disease is confined to the ovary are approximately 70 percent to 90 percent .
However , more than 70 percent of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced - stage disease , when the survival rate is only 20 percent to 30 percent .
" This research suggests that if a woman has one or more symptoms that are new for her , having begun within the past year , and if the symptoms happen nearly daily or at least 12 times a month , that may well be a signal to go in and discuss those symptoms with her doctor , " Andersen said .
" It 's probably not going to be ovarian cancer , just as most breast lumps are not breast cancer , but it 's still a sign that it might be worth checking with her doctor to see if a CA125 blood test and transvaginal ultrasound may be appropriate . "
Assessing the symptoms included in the symptom - screening index may already be done by some doctors based on a consensus statement issued last year by the National Institutes of Health .
The researchers hope their symptom index will help doctors know which among their patients who complain of symptoms such as abdominal swelling and pelvic pain might have cancer .
The symptom - screening index , developed in 2006 by paper co-author Barbara A. Goff , M.D. , professor and director of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Washington School of Medicine , is not used proactively in clinical general practice , but Andersen and colleagues are conducting a pilot study to assess the value of using it as a screening tool among normal - risk women as part of their routine medical - history assessment .
For the just - published study , the researchers administered the symptom questionnaire to 75 women about to undergo surgery for pelvic masses who were later diagnosed with ovarian cancer ( the case group ) , and 254 healthy women at high risk for ovarian cancer due to a family history of the disease ( the control , or comparison , group ) .
The cases were recruited through Pacific Gynecology Specialists at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle , and the controls were recruited through the Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Study , a joint project of the Hutchinson Center and the Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer Research .
The National Institutes of Health / National Cancer Institute , the Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer Research and the Canary Foundation supported this research .
Since / programmes first went live we 've been working to ensure that programme data was accessible to people and machines alike .
The API design was baked in at the application design stage .
Similarly we 've worked on adding microformats to HTML pages as a lightweight API .
All broadcasts use the hCalendar microformat to add start times , end times , broadcast channels etc .
Unfortunately there have been a number of concerns over hCalendar 's use of the abbreviation design pattern .
This uses the HTML abbreviation element to add machine data to pages .
Our concerns were :
the effect on blind users using screen readers with abbreviation expansion turned on where abbreviations designed for machines would be read out
the effect on partially sighted users using screen readers where tool tips of abbreviations designed for machines would be read out
the effect of incomprehensible tooltips on users with cognitive disabilities
the potential fencing off of abbreviations to domains that need them ( travel - airport codes , finance - ticker symbols etc )
Until these issues are resolved the BBC semantic markup standards have been updated to prevent the use of non-human - readable text in abbreviations .
As I type the revised standard has not been published - I 'll update this post with a link when that happens .
Updated standard is here .
For this reason we 've taken the decision to remove the hCalendar microformat from / programmes until :
either the BBC accessibility group does further testing and declares the abbreviation design pattern to be safe to use
or the microformats community settles on an accessible alternative to the abbreviation design pattern .
The conversation about this has already been started by Frances Berriman .
h Calendar will be gone from / programmes by the next deploy ( probably this Thursday ) .
In the meantime we 'll be looking at the possible use of RDFa ( a slightly bigger S semantic web technology similar to microformats but without some of the more unexpected side - effects ) .
Apologies to anyone who 's been using hCalendar to help with screen - scraping of / programmes .
We know we 've been promising a full API for a while now and the / programmes development team will be campaigning to bring this up the product backlog .
In the meantime schedules are already available as json and xml .
Leave a comment if there are specific views / formats you 'd like to see next .
Probably best to note that this only affects microformats using the abbreviation design pattern .
Any rel based and hCard microformats will remain ( at least until / if we fully embrace RDF - a ) .
And probably also best to note that this is not a decision that has come down from on high by the BBC equivalent of suits .
The / programmes team has been concerned about this issue for a few months now and it's good to get some clarity here .
Stay tuned to radiolabs and we 'll keep you updated if / as things change .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices rebounded to another record high Wednesday afternoon after initially plummeting when a government report said supplies of crude and gasoline had risen much more than expected .
In afternoon trading , U.S. light crude for April delivery surged to a high of $ 110.20 before closing at $ 109.92 .
Oil had traded as low as at $ 107.09 following the report 's release on Wednesday morning .
In its weekly inventory report , the U.S. Energy Information Administration , a government agency that measures oil and gas supplies , said crude stocks rose by 6.2 million barrels last week .
Analysts were looking for a rise of 1.6 million barrels , according to a Dow Jones poll .
Gasoline supplies rose by 1.7 million barrels , significantly more than the 300,000 barrel rise that analysts had forecast .
The government said gasoline stockpiles are well above average for this time of year .
" The big number is the build in gasoline , " said Stephen Schork , publisher of the industry newsletter the Schork Report .
" We usually see a 2 million barrel draw at this time , not a surplus . "
Since September , gasoline stockpiles have increased from a 16 million barrel deficit to a 22 million barrel surplus , which Schork believes is due primarily to the continuing low demand for gasoline .
Rising prices in spite of supply and demand .
Typically , an increase in supply and low demand would result in much lower crude prices .
But crude and gas prices continue to rise .
" This is all driven by speculation , " said Schork , who believes that investors have poured money into the commodity to make some interest in a slumping economy .
" That 's why we 've seen a jump from 20,000 to 90,000 contracts this month . "
About an hour after the government report 's release , oil rebounded to around the level of Tuesday 's settle as investors continued to pour money into commodities .
" This market is not about supply and demand , it 's about the dollar , " said Alaron senior analyst Phil Flynn .
" The dollar is weaker and investors are buying anything they can get their hands on . "
Gas demand much lower .
Still , oil 's rebound is somewhat surprising given continued low demand for gasoline .
Gas demand held steady last week , still averaging 9.1 million barrels per day over the past month .
Demand is 0.4 % higher than the same period last year .
The EIA revised its U.S. oil and gasoline demand forecasts downward Tuesday , citing a slow economy and high oil prices .
The government agency now expects oil demand in the United States to grow just 40,000 barrels a day , or 0.2 % , in 2008 , down from 0.5 % or 100,000 barrels a day in its previous forecast .
Since 2001 , oil demand has grown an average of 0.9 % annually or 175,000 barrels a day .
In 2007 , oil demand was statistically flat , growing only 10,000 barrels a day .
Gasoline demand has grown an average of 1 % annually over the past six years , but this year 's demand for gas is expected to increase only 0.3 % from last year , down from last year 's annual growth of 0.4 % .
But vapid demand has n't caused gas prices to come down at all .
The average price of regular gasoline rose overnight to $ 3.246 a gallon , according to motorist group AAA , setting a record high .
" Motorists who rely on their automobiles ... are understandably upset , " said AAA President & Chief Executive Robert L. Darbelne in a statement .
" Every extra dollar needed to fill up the car is a dollar not available for groceries , housing , education , vacations , paying off debt , and other key aspects of American families ' lives , " added Darbelne , who called on Washington to develop a long - term energy solution , as high fuel prices have dragged down consumer spending in an already struggling U.S. economy .
Though gasoline is selling at its highest price in history , gas prices are still below their peak when adjusted for inflation , according to the EIA .
The record on that basis was $ 3.405 and set in March 1981 .
The government report also showed distillates , used to make heating oil and diesel fuel , fell by 1.2 million barrels , which was slightly less than the 2 million barrel drop analysts had expected .
And refinery usage was a bit lower than the previous week , operating at 85 % capacity last week , falling slightly short of estimates .
Refineries tend to lower their capacity in March , as they retool to produce summer fuels .
After oil prices settled above $ 100 a barrel for the first time on Feb. 26 , they have set record intraday highs in 11 of the last 12 trading sessions , including today 's record high .
Oil has not traded below $ 100 a barrel since March 5 .
Oil prices have risen more than five - fold since 2002 and about 10 % already in 2008 .
Most analysts blame rising demand and tight supply .
That has also attracted floods of investment money , and exaggerated the effects of supply disruptions .

Molten Salt May Be Solution to Solar Energy Storage
June 29th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
While adoption of solar energy steps up around the world , two key challenges remain : how to store the energy created during the day so it can be used through the night and how to dispatch the energy to where it is needed .
Both of these problems may be solved by coupling molten salt with concentrating solar power ( CSP ) , according to a June 26 article in Renewable Energy World .
You will recall from previous CleanTechnica postings that CSP technology concentrates the sun ’s power to create steam , which turns a turbine to make electricity .
But how did molten salt get into the picture ?
“ Terry Murphy , Chief Executive Officer for SolarReserve , who along with others helped develop the molten salt technology at Rocketdyne .
‘ Molten salt is a heat storage medium that retains thermal energy very effectively over time and operates at temperatures greater than 1000 °F , which matches well with the most efficient steam turbines .
Second , it remains in a liquid state throughout the plant ’s operating regime , which will improve long - term reliability and reduce operation and maintenance costs .
And third , it ’s totally ‘ green , ’ molten salt is a non -toxic , readily available material ….. ' ”
Molten salt storage was a key component of the Solar Grand Plan , published in Scientific American in December 2007 , which outlined a plan to supply 69 % of U.S. electricity and 35 % of its total energy by 2050 .
The Grand Plan , written by By Ken Zweibel , James Mason and Vasilis Fthenakis , proposes molten salt storage concentrating solar , among other proven technologies , and calls for an aggressive plan of government subsidies to allow solar energy to compete fairly with oil and other fossil fuels .

Barack Obama has created a persona that 's equal parts everyman and superstar .
Young voters start political phenom
WASHINGTON - For a generation that 's come of age with shows like " American Idol , " the idea of creating a countrywide political phenom from the ground up is right up their alley .
And this year 's presidential election is giving them that chance .
The days of authoritative , hierarchical campaigns are waning .
Now reaching the masses , particularly the younger masses , means putting the power in their hands .
Advertisement
Thousands of messages flooded Meredith Segal 's inbox in 2006 , responding to her Facebook petition to get Barack Obama into the presidential race .
" I was absolutely amazed .
What I was most amazed about was the number of messages I got from young people saying , ` I want to do more . ' "
" This campaign has been a campaign about regular Americans getting involved , " said Segal , 22 , a senior at Bowdoin College in Maine .
" This is a very real movement . "
Campaign spokespeople are no longer the only ones delivering the candidate 's message , said Pete Snyder , CEO of New Media Strategies , which specializes in online and word - of - mouth marketing .
" It 's not one press secretary , it 's hundreds or tens of thousands if you look at all the comments out there on blogs .
It 's a much more collaborative way to run a campaign . "
It 's collaborative in a way that looks increasingly familiar in today 's pop culture environment of accessible and attainable celebrity .
Much of the social discourse these days is rooted in flashy competitions where voters decide who stays or goes on reality shows .
So it 's no surprise that the race for the presidency , one of the most high - profile competitions of all , has adopted characteristics of a televised popularity contest .
It 's a game young people know how to play .
" There is a growing participatory element to contemporary popular culture .
More and more , people feel like they have a role in creating celebrities , stars and leads , " said Bob Lichter , president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University .
" People feel they have more of a right to create candidates instead of just vote for them . "
Obama , more than any other candidate , has reaped the benefits .
He has drawn a lot of momentum from the buzz generated by young people , whose cultural upbringing has been in a highly fragmented media world of online social networking .
" A lot of politicians are smart , " said Helen Duan , 23 , a student at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County .
" But I do n't think they motivate us in the same ways as Obama does . "
Obama 's success has validated the larger cultural decentralization , which replaces the old , vertical , expert - to - layman approach with horizontal , peer - to - peer interactivity .
" There 's a lot of uplift that 's connected to this , a lot of excitement in terms of what can happen in the future and what we 're a part of , what our generation is a part of now , " said Shaka Dickerson , 22 , a recent Columbia University graduate .
And young people have become increasingly accustomed to holding that new media celebrity - making power in their hands .
" If you literally vote someone into celebrity , it 's like voting them into office .
People have a stronger sense of their right to decide who becomes important , " Lichter said .
" We 're living in a world of ' celebrities are us . ' "
The path to success , Lichter said , means finding the balance between approachability and star power .
The current pop culture landscape demands complete access and distant idolatry at the same time , and it's a tightrope walk for celebrities and politicians alike .
But Obama may have come closest to finding the sweet spot .
He 's created a persona that 's equal parts everyman and superstar .
And , throughout this process , young people have been right there beside him – molding a candidate out of someone who seems eager to accept their help .
" The truth is , it was young people who drew ( Obama ) into this race , " David Axelrod , top adviser to Obama , told a student journalist in an interview that appeared on the video blog MeetthePrez.net .
" Groups started spontaneously to urge him to run on Facebook and elsewhere , and I think he was moved by that . "
" Definitely this generation is very eager to become involved , " said Segal , who launched the Obama petition in Facebook and , in true bottom - up fashion , has soared from organizing such petitions to serving as executive director of Students for Obama , a volunteer arm of the official campaign .
Like so many others , she knows what she 's looking for .
" I think it would be wonderful if we could create a system in which being honest and being down to earth could make you a rock star in Washington , " she said .
Kurt Cobain Family Victims of Fraud
Recently we did a story aboutgoing to the police with accusations of her late husbands identity being stolen .
Since that article appeared , more damning evidence has surfaced and it looks like Kurt 's mother and sister are losing their homes because of this .
The estimated amount of money taken from the estate is $ 200 million .
It sounds like Love knows who has taken the money and right now the man and woman remain unidentified until proper paperwork is filed .
A total of 188 credit cards were opened , 62 bank accounts , several very expensive cars were purchased .
In addition , many homes were refinanced by the thieves including the home of Cobain 's mother , Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor .
Cobain 's sister Kim has already had her home repossessed by the bank .
Love , who has never refinanced her home , has found out that records show that it has been refinanced 4 times .
The matter has been turned over to the FBI in Orange County and Scotland Yard .
Hopefully they will be able to recoup some of their losses .
Cobain 's
Will left his mother 15 % of the estate and the rest went to Love and their daughter Francis Bean .
The proceedings have been tied up in probate for 14 years , in an open state that is supposedly why access to Cobain 's social security information could have been the source of the scams .
There is also reportedly a forged document that had Love turning over power of attorney to others because she was in an incapacitated state .
She claims to have never signed any such agreement .
Something seems a little fishy here so we 'll just have to see how it all turns out .
Ignorance of ones own financial situation over a prolonged time frame seems to be the case here - at least in part .
Was no one guarding the hen house ?

Extreme Upcycling : Creative Recycled Art , Architecture & Design
Many people associate environmentalism with gloom - and - doom predictions about the planet .
While climate change is a serious issue , many artists , architects and other designers are also working on smaller scale green projects that both effect the environment and cause change by sparking discussion and reflection .
While the actual direct impact of any given artwork or design may be small the cumulative result of their efforts is palpable and grows bigger with each creative and sustainable design or art project .
Trash and Garbage Art ( and Part Two ) :
Have you ever been to the art store to buy materials ?
They do n’t come cheap .
While saved expenses are a bonus , most garbage artists use trash to create their artworks for other reasons .
Some try to make direct statements about the nature of waste in our society while others employ recycled materials simply to get us to think about ordinary objects in a new and different way .
Recycled Material Used in Furniture Design and Construction :
While some of these works could be considered kitsch a number of these are not only functional but also aesthetically compelling .
Many recycled furniture designs flaunt their former lives as anything from bicycle tires to bath tubs .
Instead of simply going for an ultra - sleek piece of modern hipster furniture , why not try something a bit out of the ordinary that is also good for the environment ?
Amazing Examples of Adaptive Reuse in Architecture ( and More Recycled Adaptive Reuse Buildings ) :
Recycling trash into art or furniture is one thing , but buildings are at another scale entirely .
Gigantic structures and massive vehicles can be recycled into alternative offices , homes and recreational structures .
These adaptive reuse projects span the spectrum from small to large , conventional to uncanny and everything in between .
Shipping Container Buildings ( and Part Two ) :
Once a cargo container is too old or damaged to be used for its intended purpose where does it go ?
Shipping containers provide a seemingly never - ending supply of raw prebuilt structural boxes that can be used in all kinds of ingenious architectural ways .
These two articles present some great examples of home , office , school , museum and other residential , commercial and industrial building types that have used shipping containers as the basis for creative and unique architectural designs .
Recycled Materials Used in Architectural Designs and Buildings :
If it works for furniture , there seems to be no reason not to use small recycled objects in a much bigger way .
Whether one starts with bottles , cans or hay bales there are a number of clever ways to turn ordinary recyclables into full - scale architectural creations .
Very few designers have figured out how to do this on a larger and more sustainable scale yet but many are working on it .

Computer graphics researchers have made great strides towards simulation of complex phenomena for special effects and other off - line applications .
A much less explored but equally important domain is interactive virtual worlds including training simulations , computer games , and other situations where interactivity is required .
This project explores the use of model reduction to achieve drastically faster simulations of complex , high - dimensional phenomena .
Our current work focuses on incompressible fluids .
Within this context we have found that : Speedups of up to 5 orders of magnitude are possible .
Kinetic energy can be preserved .
Moving objects can be correctly incorporated into the flow .
We plan to extend this work to a wider range of phenomena , and to general pair - wise interactions between model - reduced phenomena .
Roberta Ritter of Parma thinks she knows Victoria 's Secret , and she wants everyone else to know it , too .
Ritter , 36 , contends in a class - action lawsuit that the intimate apparel merchant sold her bras soaked in chemicals that caused itchy rashes and painful burns on her breasts .
She filed the lawsuit last month against Victoria 's Secret and its Columbus - based parent , the Limited Brands Inc. , in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court .
A judge has yet to decide whether to grant the suit class - action status .
In court papers , attorney John Climaco accused Victoria 's Secret of peddling dangerous and defective products , of failing to warn customers about unhealthy potential side effects and of fraud and negligence for selling unfit merchandise .
" I do n't want any other women to have to go through what I did , " Ritter said in a phone interview on Friday .
A spokeswoman for Victoria 's Secret said the company is taking the complaints seriously and has launched an internal review .
" We will do everything we can to ensure our customers ' continued confidence in and satisfaction with our products , " said Tammy Roberts Myers in an e-mailed statement .
She said she believes the company will prevail in the lawsuit .
In January , Ritter bought two bras -- a black satin Angels Secret Embrace and a pink satin Very Sexy push - up model -- for $ 42 apiece from the Victoria 's Secret store at the Parmatown Mall .
She said her skin began to itch after she wore the bras for a few days .
The itch turned into a rash , and the rash developed into ugly red painful welts that were hot to the touch , she said .
" I flipped out , " Ritter said .
" I knew it had to be the bra .
I had perfectly shaped burns where the cups were . "
Only then did she notice that her old reliable bras were made in India , but her new bras bore tags " Made in China . "
Ritter contacted Victoria 's Secret , where she said a service representative offered her replacement bras and a warning : " I guess you know what bras not to wear now . "
The company reps asked her to return the bras , but Ritter refused until she had figured out what had caused her skin problems .
A dermatologist told her the cause was likely formaldehyde , a chemical used as a preservative in fabrics to help retain their shapes .
Ritter said her skin problems went away after about a month of cortisone cream and aloe treatments .
But her concerns remain .
" I tell you , that scared me , " Ritter said .
" It put me out of commission for a month .
I do n't want to ever go through that again . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama has opened an 8 - point national lead on Republican John McCain as the U.S. presidential rivals turn their focus to a general election race , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .

Obama , who was tied with McCain in a hypothetical head - to - head matchup last month , moved to a 48 percent to 40 percent lead over the Arizona senator in May as he took command of his grueling Democratic presidential duel with rival Hillary Clinton .
The Illinois senator has not yet secured the Democratic presidential nomination to run against McCain in November .
The poll also found Obama expanded his lead over Clinton in the Democratic race to 26 percentage points , doubling his advantage from mid-April as Democrats begin to coalesce around Obama and prepare for the general election battle with McCain .
“ Obama has been very resilient , bouncing back from rough periods and doing very well with independent voters , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ The race with McCain is going to be very competitive . ”
The poll was taken Thursday through Sunday during a period when Obama came under attack from President George W. Bush and McCain for his promise to talk to hostile foreign leaders without preconditions .
Obama ’s gains followed a month in which he was plagued with a series of campaign controversies and suffered two big losses to Clinton in Pennsylvania and West Virginia .
The poll was conducted after Obama denounced his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , who made a series of public appearances that rekindled a controversy over his inflammatory comments on race and religion .
Obama also survived a furor over his comments about “ bitter ” small - town residents who cling to guns and religion out of frustration over their economic concerns .

Obama edged closer to clinching the Democratic nomination on Tuesday when he split two nominating contests with Clinton , beating the New York senator in Oregon and losing in Kentucky to gain a majority of pledged delegates won in state - by - state nominating contests .
The results put him within easy range of the 2,026 delegates needed for the nomination .
Just three Democratic nominating contests remain before voting concludes on June 3 .
OBAMA BETTER ON ECONOMY
The poll found Obama was seen as a better steward of the economy than McCain , leading 48 percent to 39 percent .
McCain led Obama by 3 points last month on an issue that is certain to be crucial in their campaign .
Obama led McCain among independents , 47 percent to 35 percent , and led among some groups of voters who have backed Clinton during their Democratic primary battle , including Catholics , Jews , union households and voters making less than $ 35,000 a year .
McCain led among whites , NASCAR fans , and elderly voters .
McCain led with voters who believed the United States was on the right track , and Obama led with the much higher percentage of voters who believed it was on the wrong track .
“ Clearly voters are looking for change .
Every problem Obama has had in consolidating his base and reaching to the center , John McCain has the same sort of problem , ” Zogby said .
“ It ’s McCain ’s lead among voters over the age of 65 that is keeping him within shouting distance of Obama , ” he said .
The poll found Clinton , who has shrugged off calls to quit the Democratic race , tied at 43 percent with McCain in the national poll .
She led McCain by 47 percent to 40 percent on who would be the better manager of the economy .
Obama and Clinton have refrained from attacking each other in recent weeks as Obama has turned his focus to McCain .
But Zogby said the attacks on Obama by Bush and McCain , who have been critical of his willingness to talk to leaders of countries like Iran , did not appear to hurt Obama .
If anything , he said , it reminded voters of McCain ’s ties to Bush , whose approval rating is still mired at record lows .
“ The president is so unpopular .
To inject himself into a presidential campaign does not help John McCain , particularly when McCain is tied to Bush , ” Zogby said .
The national survey of 516 likely Democratic primary voters had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points .
The poll of the national race between McCain and the two Democratic contenders surveyed 1,076 likely voters with a margin of error of 3 percentage points .

While hunting in my archives for something else I dug up this exercise in scenarios .
It was a small game Brian Eno and I played to loosen up our expectations of what might happen in the near future .
We were both struck at how improbable current events would be to anyone in the past , and how incapable we are at expecting the improbable in the future .
This list of unthinkable futures — probabilities we tend to dismiss without thinking — was published 15 years ago in the Summer , 1993 issue of Whole Earth Review .
Our intent was less to correctly predict the future ( thus the silliness ) and more to predict how unpredictable the actual future would be .
Improbability is still a strong bias to overcome .
Much that is happening today would have been dismissed as unbelievably bad science fiction only 15 years ago .
The US with secret prisons torturing Muslims ?
Street sweepers in India with their own cell phones ?
Obesity a contagious disease ?
A trusted encyclopedia written by anyone ?
Yeah , right , give me a break .
Believing in the improbable is quickly becoming a survival skill .
Note : 15 years ago some of these predictions were far more outrageous than today , and some are more outrageous today than back then .
We made short lists of ideas and emailed them to provoke each other .
This is the aggregate of several rounds .
I do n’t think we are especially better at it than others ; anyone can play the game .

This sets off religious and scientific eugenics cults and social weirdness around “ healthy ” genes .
* Pills make a comeback .
Psychedelics , smart pills , power drugs and a host of newly invented non-addictive head pills seep into the young generation , who have no memory of the last drug phase .
* Twenty - five years from now , the American public becomes even more conservative at the grass - roots level than it is now , and the Reagan years are viewed as “ moderate . ”
BRIAN ENO :
* Everybody becomes so completely cynical about the election process that voter turnout drops to 2 percent ( families and relatives of prospective politicians ) until finally the “ democratic process ” is abandoned in favour of a lottery system .
Everything immediately improves .

People visit “ plastic psychiatrists ” to get interesting neuroses and obsessions added into their makeup .
* Meanwhile , as the cult of youth fades away , plastic surgeons find a profitable new market in making people look interestingly wrinkled , wisely aged , and experientially weatherbeaten .
Also , as Oriental aesthetics sweep the West , the traditional values of physiological symmetry and freedom of blemish are seen as naive and uninteresting .
Perfect youngsters from Colorado , after years of fretful mirror - gazing , finally save enough money to get their noses put on wrong , or to have a few teeth blackened .

Aid to developing countries ceases .
Hospitals become “ viability assessment centres ” and turn away or terminate poor specimens .

People are subjected to exhaustive tests ( occupying large amounts of their time ) to check the originality and scope of their ideas .
* A new profession , meme - inspector , comes into being .
* Schools abandon the attempt to teach the three Rs , concentrating instead on wacky and controversial “ personhood ” therapies .
Everyone grows up bonkers in some way or another .
The whole of the next century is like the late sixties .
* A highly successful new magazine — Ordinary People , edited by the nonagenarian Studs Terkel — focuses only on people who have never done anything in particular to deserve attention .
* A new type of artist arises : someone whose task is to gather together existing but overlooked pieces of amateur art , and , by directing attention onto them , to make them important .
( This is part of a much larger theory of mine about the new role of curatorship , the big job of the next century . )
* The first Bio-Olympics , where athletes can have anything added to or subtracted from their bodies , take place in 2004 .
* News is understood to be a creation of our attention and interests ( rather than “ the truth ” ) and news shows are redesigned as “ thinktanks , ” where four interesting minds from different disciplines are asked the question , “ So what do YOU think happened today ? ”

Congress bows to pressure and legislates rest .
KEVIN KELLY :
* AFRICA AWAKES — Centrally located , Africa becomes the breadbasket of Europe , the Mideast , and the wider markets of North America .
It becomes a postindustrial continent , a combination of high - and low - tech agriculture .

After a steady increase in mean temperature , the Earth starts cooling off .
Dire warnings are issued ; no one pays any attention .

Hitting where it hurts most , a radical group with access to nukes threatens to destroy the Library of Congress if their demands are not met .
No action is taken until the American public realizes that all the great TV shows from the past are stored there .

All social action becomes paralysed , or is evaluated in purely negative language : “ Is this course of action less harmful than that ? ”
* Traveling as a process enjoys a revival .
People abandon the idea of “ getting from A to B ” and begin to develop ( or re-discover ) a culture of traveling : semi-nomadism .
Lots of people acquire super new faxed - and - modemed versions of the mobile home .
It becomes distinctly “ lower - class ” to live in a fixed location .
Fast forms of transport come to be viewed like fast food is viewed now — tacky , undesirable , fake .

* Prince Charles converts to Catholicism , thus avoiding becoming king ( the monarch is head of the Church of England ) without actually abdicating .
( This is my wife ’s theory . )
* Big changes in education : A combination of monetarism and liberalism creates a new paradigm wherein schools are expected to be profitable manufacturing and research enterprises .
This leads to :
* The infant think - tank , where the innocent genius of children is routinely tapped by captains of industry for large sums of money . . .
* Various highly original manufacturing industries : hand - painted wallpaper and postcards , naive sculpture and pottery , clothing design and manufacture . . .
* Teachers chosen ( by the kids , of course ) on the basis of their performance record and likely profitability .
They are subjected to grueling and penetrating interviews by kids . . .
* The old concept of education “ in the abstract ” ( i.e. , unrelated to real tasks ) is only practiced in the most be -nighted outposts of the civilized world ( England , USA etc. ) . . .
* Successful children are traded between schools for huge transfer fees . . .
* Schools completely abandon divisions based on age .
People of all ages turn up and sort themselves into effective and profitable groups . . .
* People with lots of money give their children small companies as birthday and Christmas gifts .
* Television producers , impressed by the phenomenal success of the Clarence Thomas hearings , routinely stage semi-surrogate “ hearings ” where emotional issues are vented .
These take the place of staged wrestling matches and roller derby for the thinking classes .
Nobody is ever sure if it ’s all fixed , or partly fixed , or actually for real .
* The commonly held notion that it is correct to surround children with love , security and affection suffers a serious decline in credibility when it becomes apparent that kids reared thus are entirely unequipped for a world that is cruel , dangerous and insecure .
Enlightened parents begin experimenting with new forms of toys : teddies with sharp teeth , building bricks with abrasive surfaces , mildly toxic crayons , unsafe play areas .
* Disabled people finally come into their own as remote operators of telerobots .
They are the only ones prepared to commit the immense amount of time necessary to learn the finesse of working inside another body .
Astronomers have discovered a speedy spinning pulsar in an elongated orbit around an apparent Sun - like star , a combination never seen before , and one that has them puzzled about how the strange system developed .
" Our ideas about how the fastest - spinning pulsars are produced do not predict either the kind of orbit or the type of companion star this one has , " said David Champion of the Australia Telescope National Facility .
" We have to come up with some new scenarios to explain this weird pair , " he added .
Astronomers first detected the pulsar , called J1903+0327 , as part of a long - term survey using the National Science Foundation 's Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico .
They made the discovery in 2006 doing data analysis at McGill University , where Champion worked at the time .
They followed up the discovery with detailed studies using the Arecibo telescope , the NSF's Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) in West Virginia , the Westerbork radio telescope in the Netherlands , and the Gemini North optical telescope in Hawaii .
The pulsar , a city - sized superdense stellar corpse left over after a massive star exploded as a supernova , is spinning on its axis 465 times every second .
Nearly 21,000 light - years from Earth , it is in a highly - elongated orbit that takes it around its companion star once every 95 days .
An infrared image made with the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii shows a Sun - like star at the pulsar 's position .
If this is an orbital companion to the pulsar , it is unlike any companions of other rapidly rotating pulsars .
The pulsar , a neutron star , also is unusually massive for its type .
" This combination of properties is unprecedented .
Not only does it require us to figure out how this system was produced , but the large mass may help us understand how matter behaves at extremely high densities , " said Scott Ransom of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
Pulsars are neutron stars whose strong magnetic fields channel lighthouse - like beams of light and radio waves that whirl around as the star spins .
Typical pulsars spin a few times a second , but some , like PSR J1903+0327 , are much faster , rotating hundreds of times a second .
They are called millisecond pulsars .

Astronomers think most millisecond pulsars are sped up by material falling onto them from a companion star .
This requires the pulsar to be in a tight orbit around its companion that becomes more and more circular with time .
The orbits of some millisecond pulsars are the most perfect circles in the Universe , so the elongated orbit of the new pulsar is a mystery .
" What we have found is a millisecond pulsar that is in the wrong kind of orbit around what appears to be the wrong kind of star , " Champion said .
" Now we have to figure out how this strange system was produced . "
The scientists are considering three possibilities .
The first , that the pulsar simply was born spinning quickly , seems unlikely to them .
Another possibility , they say , is that the pulsar was formed in a tight group of stars known as a globular cluster , where it had a companion that spun it up .
Later , a close encounter with another star in the cluster stripped it of its companion and flung it out of the cluster .
For several reasons , including the fact that they do n't see a nearby cluster from which it could have come , they do n't like that explanation either .
A third scenario says the pulsar may be part of a triple , not a double , star system .
In this case , the pulsar 's 95 - day orbit is around a neutron star or white dwarf , not the Sun - like star seen in the infrared image .
The Sun - like star would then be in a more - distant orbit around the pulsar and its close companion .
" We 've found about 50 pulsars in binary systems .
We may now have found our first pulsar in a stellar triple system , " Ransom said .
The international research team is busy trying to get their answers .
They will study the star in the infrared image further to confirm the indications that it is similar to our Sun and that it actually is a companion to the pulsar .
Additional radio observations will study the pulsar 's orbit and seek to measure its motion in space .
" This is a fascinating object that has a lot to teach us about physics .
It 's going to be exciting to peel away the mystery of how this thing came to be , " Champion said .
Meanwhile the survey with Arecibo goes on .
Other , more conventional millisecond pulsars have been found , but it is almost certain that there will be more surprises , said Jim Cordes of Cornell University , chair of the consortium that is doing the survey .
The large volume of data for the survey is archived at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing , and is then processed using computer clusters at several consortium - member sites around the world .
“ Pulsars like this are why you do these surveys , ” Dr Champion says .
“ You do n’t want to just find hundreds of objects , you want to find the two or three that are plain weird and we ’ve found one . ”
SFLC Files Another Round of GPL Violation Lawsuits on Behalf of BusyBox Developers
The Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) today announced that it has filed two more copyright infringement lawsuits , on behalf of two principal developers of BusyBox , alleging violation of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
The defendants in this new round of lawsuits are Bell Microproducts , Inc. and Super Micro Computer , Inc .
BusyBox is a lightweight set of standard Unix utilities commonly used in embedded systems and is open source software licensed under GPL version 2 .
One of the conditions of the GPL is that re-distributors of BusyBox are required to ensure that each downstream recipient is provided access to the source code of the program .
Both companies have continued to distribute BusyBox illegally without complete source code , despite having been contacted by SFLC .
The complaints request that an injunction be issued against each company and that damages and litigation costs be awarded to the plaintiffs .
Copies of the complaints are available at http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2008/jun/10/busybox/
“ Before filing these lawsuits , we contacted both companies and gave them the opportunity to remedy their violations privately , but they were continually unresponsive , ” said Aaron Williamson , SFLC Counsel .
“ When companies are contacted by SFLC or anyone else about a GPL violation , they need to respond by taking good faith steps toward compliance .
If they do not , lawsuits like these are the predictable consequences . ”
The lawsuits filed yesterday are the latest in a series of GPL enforcement lawsuits filed on behalf of BusyBox developers Erik Andersen and Rob Landley .
All of the previous lawsuits have resulted in out - of - court settlements requiring the defendants to distribute source code in compliance with the GPL .
The lawsuits announced today were both filed June 9 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York .
The lawsuit “ Erik Andersen and Rob Landley v. Bell Microproducts , Inc. d.b.a. Hammer Storage , ” case number 08 - CV - 5270 , will be heard by Judge Baer .
The lawsuit “ Erik Andersen and Rob Landley v. Super Micro Computer , Inc. , ” case number 08 - CV - 5269 , will be heard by Judge Berman .

Many young Iranians are having difficulty affording getting married Single workers at one of Iran 's major state - owned companies have been told to marry by September or face being fired , Iranian newspapers have reported .
The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone Company employs thousands of people , mostly young men , on Iran 's Gulf coast .
Being married is a job requirement , a directive from the company is reported as saying .
Correspondents say the ruling appears to be an attempt to reduce the number of prostitutes working in the area .
The company controls Iran 's large network of gas and petrochemical facilities around the coastal city of Assalouyeh on the Gulf coast .
Its directive , according to the Etemad newspaper , says that despite requests " some of our colleagues did not fulfil their commitments and are still single " .
It continues : " As being married is one of the criteria of employment , we are announcing for the last time that all the female and male colleagues have until September 21 to go ahead with this important and moral religious duty . "
In the same vein , the governor of the eastern province of North Khorasan ruled recently that only married people would be hired for official posts in the region .
Economic difficulties in Iran have led many people to postpone getting married , despite sexual relations being illegal outside marriage .
Here are a selection of your comments on this story : Zdenek , if you are working and living in Berlin you should seek German legal advice I am sure that even if the company is Iranian they do not have the right under German employment law to fire you because you are not planning to get married - they might however find another reason which they will use as an excuse if you do n't comply so you 'll have to tread carefully .
Honestly though , I know jobs in Berlin are hard to come by , but do you really want to work for such a company that interferes with your personal life - it 's like working for the Stasi !!
I think especially in Berlin we have worked hard enough to regain our personal freedom do n't give it up again just for a job !
Good luck
anon , Germany I am an Iranian , working in Iran .
My company told me I had to get married or else I would get fired .
They gave me 6 months , and in that time I eventually found someone .
I married a girl , whom I met through family .
She was n't the person I dreamt of spending my life together with , but it had to be done .
However , another 6 months after my marriage , I got the sack .
So was it worth it ?
NO !
I 'm also having trouble with my marriage at the moment !
Abbas , Tehran , Iran Zdenek , go see a lawyer - Germany has one of the most highly - developed employee protection systems .
A simple letter from a lawyer will soon see your employers run for cover :) )
Bill Beetham , Moscow , Russia
If you work in Germany you should have redress under the European equality laws which do not allow discrimination based on family status .
That is certainly the case in other EU countries .
You should check your position with a legal advisor .
YSE , Dublin , Ireland To Zdenek Smetanka my advice is to seek legal advice I cannot believe German labour laws will allow an employer to make such a request , I 'd suggest asking a local German trade union or failing that a local government office .
John , England
This is the kind of society you live in when the government is dictated by a theocratic state .
In a sense , marriage by decree is even worse than street prostitution , because it is less honest , more permanent , and can be just as debilitating to a woman in an unwanted marriage .
A Western person can quit their job and find another , but Iranians cannot escape their government unless they leave .
My sincere sympathy for the young people of Iran .
Kat , Washington , D.C. I 'm not an Iranian , BUT it is a welcome development .
When someone is married , he or she tends to become more focused and responsible .
PETER NWANEVU , LAGOS NIGERIA
To Zdenek Smetanka , Berlin - you are very lucky , as you are covered by German employment law which makes such a discriminatory action completely illegal .
As soon as you get either a copy of this " order " on paper , or get a copy of your dismissal notice , take it straight to your local Arbeitsamt who will help you .
You can expect them to contact the company to inform them they are acting illegally and demand they drop the policy ( As well as probably prosecuting / fining the company ) , and if they continue with the policy regardless and still force you out , the German courts will make you a wealthy man .
Germany has some of the strongest employment laws in the world protecting its employees .
Mark , Zürich , Switzerland I have seen a copy of the directive on one of Persian websites .
I was shocked when I read this directive .
How far can a Government go for interfering into the personal lives of its nation .
Not to worry , they are not afraid to do whatever required to send you to heaven !
Sasan , Dubai , UAE Zdenek Smetanka , with all due respect , such so - called Muslim employers should provide a girl to marry as well as part of a package for single employees taking on the job .
The shame is that such people are called Muslims first and then Iranians .
Most of the problems are created by cultures , not religions .
Almost all of the religions preach peace , not terror .
A. Ahmed , Manchester , UK
It 's a good sign but it would be better if a state owned corporation increase some good will compensation to there employees .
I wonder why such radical Islamic state has forgotten the Allah 's message stated as " Thy Lord is taking care of food etc to its thy belivers " .
Apart from that Iran should consider more option towards stabilizing their economy .
Zeeshan Haq , Karachi , Pakistan I am in the US , and for a long time I felt quite a bit of pressure to get married .
I have no intention of ever getting married , and if my job were tied to it , I would find another job .
The state has no business dictating morality or personal choices like marriage .
Then again , this IS Iran , and the people are subject to the whims of their government , which does not appear to care in the least for the freedoms of its citizens .
Not to worry , the United States is not far behind .
When the legislation of morality is debated in the guise of an amendment to define marriage , you know we are going down that same road .
Mark , Newburgh , NY I am employed in Iranian company in Berlin and they told me to get married or they fire me .
I am not Muslim I come from Czech republic .
I have one month to get married although i have no girlfriend .

McCain ’s 30 - Years of Service to Saudi Bank Raiders
The Crimes And Cover - Ups Of John McCain
Part 2
McCain ’s 30 - Years of Service to Saudi Bank Raiders and Junk Bond Kings
By Mark G. Levey
Part 3 , Part 1
From BCCI , to Milken ’s Junk Bond Kings , to Jack Abramoff , Senator John McCain has long provided the clean All - American face to the dirty job of cleaning up after the looting of America .
Senator John McCain has made a career out of serving the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its army of lobbyists , bagmen , and corrupt bankers during the last three decades .
In the process , he has done his part to cover - up BCCI ’s looting of American banks and S&Ls , helped Ahmed Chalabi sell phony Iraq WMD information to Senate colleagues and to his constituents ( see , Part 1 , Link ) , and more than anyone else , limited the public ’s awareness of Jack Abamoff ’s wholesale foreign buyout of the GOP , activities that individually have killed the careers of other Washington luminaries .
Yet , somehow , John McCain remains the last man standing .
He even appears to keep his hands clean .
The Saudi-Manchurian Candidate
The Senator ’s patented role as All - American influence peddler to the world now includes the latest flap over his national campaign finance co-chair ’s lucrative deals as a Saudi lobbyist and revelations about possible violations of federal campaign laws .
Tom Loeffler , McCain ’s finance co-chair received $ 15 million from Saudi clients since 2002 , is just part of a long conduit in the petrodollar pipeline from Riyadh to the Senator from Arizona .
The Loeffler Group , which he founded , has also represented the People ’s Republic of China .
Under Loeffler , the campaign has brought in more than $ 50 million for McCain so far this year , far more than was raised during all of 2007 when the GOP candidate faced a weak field of primary competitors .
OpenSecrets.com shows that Loeffler and his wife , Nancy , have made a total of fifteen $ 2,300 maximum personal contributions to McCain during the past year .
The latest revelation of McCain ’s connection to Arab oil money , and corruption within his campaign , came after the May 17 issue of NEWSWEEK reported : Link
Loeffler last month told a reporter " at no time have I discussed my clients with John McCain . "
But lobbying disclosure records reviewed by NEWSWEEK show that on May 17 , 2006 , Loeffler listed meeting McCain along with the Saudi ambassador to " discuss US - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relations . "
Another potential problem : Loeffler 's firm started paying $ 15,000 a month last summer to one of its lobbyists , Susan Nelson , after she left to become McCain 's full - time finance director , said a source familiar with the arrangement ( who asked not to be identified talking about sensitive matters ) .
Campaign officials were told the payments were " severance " for Nelson and that they ended by November .
But in " February or March , " Loeffler rehired Nelson as a consultant to " help him with his clients " while she continued on the McCain payroll , according to a campaign official who asked not to be identified talking about personnel matters .
Federal election law prohibits any outside entity from subsidizing the income of campaign workers . .
Also last week , energy adviser Eric Burgeson was ousted .
Burgeson reportedly represented the Gulf emirate state of Qatar , along with several major multinational energy companies .

McCain is , indeed , in good favor among the Saudi and Gulf elites .
Bloomberg reports : Link
Saudis are privately rooting for the presumptive Republican nominee , discounting some of his rhetoric because he's the only candidate to promise to keep U.S. troops in Iraq and to deter Iran .
`` The royal family and other elites would like to see McCain , '' Mai Yamani , a visiting scholar with the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut , said yesterday in a telephone interview from London .
`` He would keep the troops in Iraq , and that is their main worry , that the U.S. may withdraw or minimize its presence , '' said Yamani , whose father , Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani , was the kingdom's oil minister from 1962 to 1986 .
When McCain belatedly ordered his campaign to sever Loeffler , Nelson and Burgeson he may have wished he could so easily jettison the rest of the crude oil covered skeletons from his closet .
Like the Bush Family , McCain had his Hand in the BCCI and S&L Scandals
McCain claims that his involvement in the Keating S&L scandal was n’t really much to worry ourselves about .
He was all but exonerated by his Senate colleagues , he says , let off with the political equivalent of a warning at a traffic stop .
In fact , the Senate Ethics Committee was rather lenient with all five caught up in the scandal .
But , that says more about the nature of the Senate than it does about the actual damage done to the American public by the financial crimes that led to the S&L collapse , itself .
The S&L crisis was all about oil , junk bonds , and deregulation that allowed the two to mix .
That volatile brew is still actively bubbling over , and taxpayers are still paying $ 30 billion annual installments toward the trillion dollar bailout .
Here 's how you got stuck paying the bill , courtesy of the Bush family and John McCain .
In the mid-1980s , world oil prices plunged which set off a long series of bankruptcies and financial takeovers when overvalued Texas and southwestern land prices collapsed .
The financial panic of 1988 also followed the “ reform ” of federal banking rules that had allowed bank managers to trade in risky new derivatives and junk bonds .
This tidal wave of bankruptcies in the oil patch created a huge buying opportunity for anyone with ready cash .
The problem was , these were hard times on Wall Street after the sudden panic sell - off on October 1987 .
But , someone did step in once prices were sufficiently discounted .
Huge bank holding companies scooped up looted banks and S&Ls ( along with their land deeds and oil rights ) , bought out for pennies on the dollar after they went belly - up .
The federal government even subsidized many of these purchases .
The American taxpayer was left with an estimated $ 1 trillion bailout cost .
The epicenters of this late 20th Century white collar crime wave were in Houston and Phoenix , home base for two highly ambitious GOP politicians .
One was named George H. W. .
Bush , and the other John McCain , III .
McCain and BCCI , the Bush Bank
Before he was selected to as Ronald Reagan ’s 1980 running mate , George H.W. Bush had a short and little - known career as an international banker .
That effectively started in 1976 , while Bush was still CIA Director , a post he held for part of the Nixon and Ford Administration .
In the final months of the Ford presidency , Bush made a deal with the newly - appointed head of Saudi General Intelligence Directorate , Prince Turki al - Faisal .
The two spy chiefs agreed the CIA would look the other way while the Saudis ran their own global operations .
In exchange , the Saudis financed the sort of black ops that had been banned by the Democratic Congress after Watergate and the Church Committee hearings .
The arrangement was called “ The Safari Club ” , and the funding mechanism for this was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International , “ BCCI ” .
See , Link ; Link
Newly - elected President Jimmy Carter fired the CIA Director .
In early 1977 , Houston banker Joe Allbritton appointed Bush to direct his First International Bancshares ( dba , First Interbank ) and its London and Luxembourg affiliates .
According to Kevin Phillips , Bush ’s bank was among the first outposts in America for BCCI .
Link
In the early 1980s , Allbritton followed G. H. W. . to Washington , purchasing Riggs Bank , installing brother Jonathan Bush as a Director .
Riggs closed in 2004 after being fined $ 25 million dollars for violation of federal money laundering and anti-terrorism laws .
Riggs had catered to high - end foreign customers and the diplomatic trade in Washington , as well as having “ a relationship ” with the CIA .

After 9/11 , the bank was found to have transferred money from Saudi Embassy accounts that ended up supporting two of the 9/11 hijackers , Flt. 77 leaders Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khaleed al - Midhar after their arrival in the U.S. See , Link
Know Your Banking Customer : Salem Bin Laden
Meanwhile , back in Texas , First Interbank merged with Jim Baker ’s Republic Bank , in which the Saudis had taken a stake with the 1978 purchase of the bank ’ headquarters building by members of the Bin-Laden and bin-Mahfouz families .
The merger of these two Texas banks several years later created the largest regional financial institution in the U.S. Infused with capital from Saudi Arabia , First RepublicBank went on a massive bargain buying binge in the Southwest oil patch .
Link
This Saudi - financed merger of the Bush bank with the Baker bank created the nation ’s largest bank holding company , and soon the largest bank failure , resulting in a $ 1 billion tax - payer funded bailout in 1987 .
This was to become a pattern for the trillion dollar rip - off to come .

McCain 's Role in Covering Up the the Trillion Dollar Bank Heist
It ’s been said that the American people did n’t become very angry about the S&L crisis because the explanations given for what caused it were too complicated for many to comprehend .
That seems to have set a pattern for financial scandals to follow .
Nobody dared tell the American public – although the 1992 Kerry Commission report came close -- that their financial system was being looted by a well - funded , highly - organized global criminal organization with ties to half a dozen of the world ’s most powerful intelligence services , including elements of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency .
They did n't name CIA Headquarters , " The George H.W. Bush Intelligence Center " for nothing .
See , Link
Buried in all this muck is the thread running through all these financial scandals – from Keating to Silverado to First RepublicBank to BCCI to Enron -- has been corrupt management , corrupt officials , corrupt intelligence operatives , and corrupt auditors .
See , Link
As the group ’s scams became more sophisticated and wide - ranging , the price tag for bail - outs escalated .
The federal rescue of Neil Bush ’ Silverado S&L cost the taxpayer $ 1.3 billion .
The price tag for Charles Keating ’s Lincoln Savings & Loan bailout eventually reached $ 2.6 billion .
Link BCCI was termed “ the $ 20 - billion - plus heist . ”
( Beatty , Jonathan ; S.C. Gwynne .
The Outlaw Bank : A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of BCCI Beard Books ( 1993 ) ) .
Finally , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) estimated that Enron fleeced ratepayers of $ 30 billion , creating the 2001 California energy crisis .
On November 15 , 2005 , FERC settled with Enron ’s receivers for a mere $ 1.5 billion .
Link
The Keating S&L scandal was part of a now - familiar pattern of transnational commodities price - fixing , land grabs , stock - price rigging , fraudulent audits , financial panic , and public bailouts , all carried out by an overlapping cast of characters with ties to foreign and domestic intelligence agencies .
Amidst the financial panic of 1986 - 88 that followed the drop of a barrel of oil from $ 39 to $ 13 , many of these banks and S&Ls ( and their land deeds and oil rights ) were bought out for pennies on the dollar .
More than a thousand deregulated financial institutions went belly up and were looted .
Deregulation allowed crooked bank managers to cash in on the junk bond craze that was sweeping Wall Street .
Banks and S&Ls issued unsecured notes and plots of land and traded them in circles with other institutions to ring up the notional value to support cash - out loans for themselves and their partners .
This is precisely the sort of round - robin games that Neil Bush , Director of Silverado S&L played with Charles Keating and his partners , Saudi European Investment Corp ’s board and officers – Roger Tamraz , Tolat Othman , Abdullah Taha Bakhsh , Abbas Gokal -- along with other BCCI players .
All told , the S&L scandal left the American taxpayer holding the tab for an estimated $ 1 trillion bailout .
See , Steven Wilmsen : Silverado : Neil Bush and the Savings & Loan Scandal , p. 81 ; Link ; Link ; Link
It was during this period that the Saudis and Gulf states leveraged their earnings from American bank acquisitions through junk - bond mills , and then moved on to the 1996 Chemical - Chase and Citi banks consolidations in New York .
Link Today , Prince Alaweed ’s Kingdom Holdings owns a substantial and growing share of Citicorp , the largest bank in America , along with a portfolio of the nation ’s largest financial , technology and media corporations .
A similar process of slash and burn acquisition of the U.S. financial industry is now going on with the collapse of the U.S. mortgage and derivatives markets .
Link ; Link
A major figure in the Keating S&L case was Carl Linder , known as the “ father figure ” to junk bond king Michael Milken , and the single largest purchaser of Milken ’s junk bonds .
Link
“ Lindner , a wealthy businessman from Cincinnati , Ohio owned the American Financial Corporation ( AFC ) .
In 1976 , Keating bought a subsidiary of AFC called American Continental Homes from Lindner , which Keating later renamed American Continental Corporation ( ACC ) .
ACC embarked on several ambitious real estate development projects , mostly in Arizona and Colorado .
To finance its activities , ACC set up its own in - house mortgage company and was a pioneer in creating the type of financial package and instrument known as the ‘ mortgage - backed security . ’ ”
See , Link
To recap , the context of the Keating S&L scandal was manipulation of world oil prices following the 1979 Iranian revolution and a loosening of regulatory oversight that set off a wave of bank failures across the American oil patch .
Into this mix enters BCCI ’s global raiders and junk bond traders , who cash cow the giant bank holding companies and leverage their assets into a play to take over the American banking industry .
Finally , to top it off , the Bush presidency and elements of U.S. intelligence engage in a massive cover up of these global financial mechanizations in an effort to protect their international partners .
It ’s in this context that one needs to re-examine the role of John McCain in the Keating S&L scandal .
McCain has always been a conciliator and clean - up specialist – in the case of the Keating S&L , the purpose was to protect a group of junk bond salesmen and Arab bank raiders , but , most of all to shield the Bush wing of the CIA and corrupt lawmakers – and put an attractive , all - American face of “ reform ” on cleaning up the mess afterwards .
This is precisely the cover - up routine McCain repeated twenty years later in the Abramoff case .
McCain and Enron
Throughout his career , McCain has been an enthusiastic champion of financial industry deregulation as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee from 1997 - 2001 and 2003 - 2005 .
McCain voted , according to a Washington Post financial columnist , with his “ campaign 's general co-chairman and domestic policy adviser , former Texas senator Phil Gramm .
The Politico's Lisa Lerer reports that not only did Gramm author the 1999 legislation that repealed Glass - Steagall , the New Deal law restricting the speculative activities of banks , but after Gramm left the Senate , he lobbied Congress on behalf of the Swiss bank UBS when the banking lobby wanted Congress to overturn state laws restricting predatory lending and the issuance of mortgages to prospective home owners who could not afford them . ”
Link McCain , like Gramm , has been a supporter of the “ Enron Loophole ” that allowed Amaranth Advisors hedge fund , a commodities futures trading company , to attempt in 2006 to corner the natural gas market , a criminal violation for which the fund was recently handed a $ 300 million fine .
Link
McCain also has a direct connection with Enron , having received money in campaign contributions from Ken Lay ’s Death Star .
" We 're all tainted by the millions and millions of dollars that were contributed by Enron executives , " John McCain told CBS ' " Face the Nation " Sunday .
McCain then acknowledged receiving $ 9,500 from Enron in two campaigns .
Link Gramm ’s wife , Wendy , was on the Enron Board of Directors , and Gramm was the architect of much of the “ reform ” while he chaired the Senate Banking Committee , including a move to exempt electronic trading of electricity from regulatory oversight .
According to Time Magazine , Gramm and his wife were at the forefront of many of the illicit practices that led to the firm ’s massive rip - offs and ultimate collapse :
On Jan. 14 , 1993 , in the final days of the first Bush administration , Wendy Gramm – as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – pushed through a key regulatory exemption removing energy derivatives contracts and interest - rate swaps from federal oversight .
That was a major financial boon to Enron , where Wendy Gramm landed five weeks later as a member of the board of directors .
She also became a member of the audit committee that signed off on another one of Enron ’s fraudulent schemes , partnerships that hid the company ’s growing debt .
McCain claims that his role in Keating was merely to help out a local constituent in dealing with Washington bank regulators .
McCain , his current wife , and father - in - law were , in fact , Charles Keating ’s business partners in a Phoenix shopping mall , received in excess of one hundred thousand dollars in campaign contributions from Keating , and accompanied Keating on his private jet to his private resort in the Bahamas on multiple occasions , gifts which McCain did not report until they were discovered .
Yet , McCain , hand - picked as Barry Goldwater ’s successor , got a slap on the wrist from the Senate Ethics Committee when this came out in the Keating - Five inquiry .
A second Senate panel was n’t so sanguine .
The 1992 Kerry Commission report concluded that the Keating affair was far more serious than a mere domestic banking scandal : “ the financial dealings of BCCI directors with Charles Keating and several Keating affiliates and front - companies , include the possibility that BCCI related entities may have laundered funds for Keating to move them outside the United States . ”

Out of the five Senators accused , only McCain and Glenn ever ran again for office , with McCain the sole survivor .

BLANCHARD — BreAnna
Helsel escaped serious injury after being struck by lightning while inside her house .
The teenager 's good fortune continued the next day , in the form of a winning lottery ticket .
Helsel , 16 , was at her home in Blanchard , about 48 miles northeast of Grand Rapids , watching thunderstorms roll by on June 6 when she noticed rain entering an open kitchen window .
" She went to close the window and the lightning came through and hit her , " her mother , Linda Johnson , told The Daily News of Greenville .
" We think it must have hit the house or something . "
Helsel , a student at Montabella High School , struggled to describe the sensation she felt as the electricity passed through her body .
" It felt like when your foot falls asleep , " she said .
Helsel said she saw the electricity shoot out of her fingers and into the overhead lights , immediately knocking out the house 's power .
At first , the teenager did n't want to be checked out at a hospital , but when she started complaining about a tingling sensation in an arm , she and her mother drove through the rain to get to Spectrum Health Kelsey Hospital in Lakeview .
Helsel was checked out and the only signs of the lightning strike were some darkened fingertips on her right hand and a shaking arm from damaged muscles that will require some therapy .
A full recovery is expected .
" Everyone said I 'm really lucky , " she said .
Hospital employees suggested that Helsel was on such a lucky streak , she should immediately play the lottery .
She 's too young , so her mother went out the next day and bought a Michigan lottery ticket for her .
" And we won $ 20 , " Johnson said , laughing .
" What a way to start the summer . "
" NO MENTAL THEFT ACT " NEEDED , CONGRESS TOLD
Law would mandate mind - erasing drugs for every movie - goer
Washington , DC ( April 1 , 1998 00:00 PST http://www.dontlaugh.org) -
A sympathetic
House subcommittee today heard testimony from the motion picture industry on the need for a new law to protect the industry from rampant piracy .
" Our undercover investigators have finally discovered why ticket sales to most newly released movies drop so dramatically in the first week or so " , said Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America .
" Hundreds of millions of movie - goers pay a mere $ 7.50 each , but they leave with mental copies of images and sounds of movies that cost us billions of dollars to make .
This is blatant theft of our valuable intellectual property ! "
Because of this rampant mental piracy , Valenti said , " few ever return to a theater to see a movie even for a second time .
This deprives our industry of billions of dollars in lost revenue , and it forces us to spend billions every year just to make new movies in a never - ending battle to stay ahead of the pirates . "
Valenti was especially critical of a few brazen individuals who regularly use television and newspapers to disseminate mentally pirated movies , often before they 're even open to the public .
As a result of this piracy -- a gaping loophole in present copyright law -- many millions of people do not see most movies even once .
" These reprehensible individuals -- some of whom are rich and nationally famous by their misdeeds -- cost us billions of dollars in lost sales every year . "
Valenti's testimony was in support of the " No Mental Theft Act " recently introduced in the House by Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R - VA ) , the sponsor of the " No Electronic Theft Act " recently signed into law by President Clinton .
Goodlatte 's proposed legislation calls for the mandatory administration of memory - erasing drugs to all movie - goers to stop the mental piracy described by Mr. Valenti .
According a Goodlatte staffer , " The drugs are really only temporary .
Eventually we 'll install mind - erasing devices in every movie theater . "
Anonymous sources have confirmed that the memory erasing devices , recently featured without authorization in the movie " Men in Black " , have been secretly field - tested at showings of " Titanic " at the urging of producers desperate to recover its 1 - billion - dollar price tag .
Initial results are reported to be " stunning " .

About 1 in 11 American mortgages were past due or in foreclosure at the end of March , according to a report released on Thursday , a figure that is rising fast as home prices fall and the job market weakens .
The first three months of 2008 marked the worst quarter for American homeowners in nearly three decades , according to the report , issued by the Mortgage Bankers Association .
The rate of new foreclosures and past - due payments surged to their highest level since 1979 , when the group first started collecting the data .
All told , about 8.8 percent of home loans were past due or in foreclosure , or about 4.8 million loans .
That is up from 7.9 percent at the end of December .
( About a third of American homeowners do not have mortgages . )
Delinquency and foreclosure rates started rising from historically low levels in late 2006 and have picked up speed in nearly every quarter since .
Analysts say at first past due mortgages represented mostly high - risk loans made to borrowers with blemished , or subprime , credit .
Now , as the economy has weakened and home prices have fallen in many parts of the country , homeowners with better loans are also falling behind .
The move by the auction site is presently limited to Australia only and will hit sellers with extra fees because PayPal charges them a fee of between 1.1 and 2.4 per cent to accept payments - usually using credit cards - via the service .
Sellers have already begun revolting by papering eBay 's discussion boards and starting a petition , which has more than 3500 signatures .
---------------------------------
MashUp Blog : Is eBay being disingenuous ?
---------------------------------
The sellers are sceptical about eBay 's claims that PayPal is far safer than other methods such as bank deposit , and say some buyers distrust PayPal .
" If consumers want the additional protection offered by using PayPal , they can choose to use PayPal , and eBay 's proposed conduct takes away that choice and would likely prevent the emergence of competitors to PayPal in the online payment market , " said Dale Clapperton , chairman of the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia .
Alastair MacGibbon , eBay 's trust and safety director , said the announcement was designed to protect users as one is four times less likely to have a problem on eBay if one pays using PayPal than with other methods .
eBay has written to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) asking for immunity from legal action under the Trade Practices Act , arguing that the public benefits of the move - increased transaction security - would outweigh any detriment to the public that might be caused by a lessening of competition in the online payments market .
The act prohibits companies from imposing restrictions on people 's freedom to choose whom they deal with .
" While some other payment systems provide some level of customer protection , eBay understands that no other currently available payment method offers an equivalent to either the Buyer Protection Policy or the Buyer Complaints Policy , " eBay argued in its exclusive dealing notification .
" Furthermore , as related bodies corporate , eBay and PayPal are in a unique position to share users ' data , internal risk and dispute data , and to better monitor transaction problems in ' real time ' at each point in the transaction process , to help better protect buyers and sellers . "
A competition lawyer , who did not want to be named , said the ACCC 's analysis would centre on whether eBay was using its substantial market power in the online auction space to leverage into the online payments market , an area where it faces competition .
It would also consider whether shifting eBay users on to PayPal was an appropriate , proportionate response to dealing with online fraud .
" The power in the auction market that eBay has is being extended to limit competition in the payment systems market that PayPal operates in - that would be the basic analysis , I think , " the lawyer said .
A spokesman for the ACCC said the regulator would be inviting submissions from the public on the issue via the exclusive dealing notifications register on its website .
Submissions are due by May 2 .
eBay will seek to placate angry sellers by hosting four Q&A workshops in Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane on May 5 - 8 with presentations from its Australian vice - president , Simon Smith .

The Dalai Lama has told the BBC he believes China is changing and that this could lead to a " more transparent " attitude over Tibet .
In an interview with the Radio 4 Today Programme he said China 's reaction to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province was one sign of change .
Tibet 's spiritual leader said he wanted a " middle way " of autonomy , despite calls for independence among Tibetans .
But he warned of growing frustration if there was " no improvement " in Tibet .
' Wider contact '
Speaking during a 10 - day visit to London the Dalai Lama said he was " quite optimistic " about the future .
China was changing through " wider contact with outside world , " he said .
Not only outside but even inside there are people who really are very critical about our approach , but so far OK , I think we can manage with these people
Dalai Lama
Tibet : 7 Questions The Tibet issue : China 's view The Tibet issue : Tibetans ' view
He cited China 's efforts to deal with the recent earthquake that left tens of thousands of people dead in Sichuan province as evidence .
" This I think ( is ) one sign that the People 's Republic of China is changing , I think at least decade by decade , " he said .
" Hopefully now ( this will ) lead to a more transparent attitude in other fields , including the Tibet case . "
The Chinese government has accused the Dalai Lama of being behind anti-China protests that began in Tibet 's main city , Lhasa , on 10 March , and escalated into deadly rioting .
The Dalai Lama denies inciting any protests .
He has said regularly he is not seeking independence from China .
'' We are not seeking separation , " he told the BBC , adding that it was in the interests of both China and Tibet to stay together .
" Tibetan Buddhist culture can be a great contribution to enrich ( the ) cultural heritage of People 's Republic of China , " he said .
'' Sooner or later we 'll have to talk with China 's government so the question of independence or separation is out of the question . "
' Middle way '
Asked about opposition among followers who might favour taking a stronger line with China , he said different views and criticism were " welcome " .
" On the question of autonomy we are committed to the middle way , " he said .
" Defence and foreign affairs should ( be governed by ) the central government ; but the rest of the business - education , environment , religious work - all these should be handled by Tibetans themselves .
" That is real , meaningful autonomy . "
He acknowledged that there was internal opposition .
" Not only outside but even inside there are people who really are very critical about our approach , but so far OK , I think we can manage with these people , " he said .
" But the longer time no improvement inside Tibet and ruthless suppression continue , then more frustration , then this view can increase . "

The enigmatic shroud surrounding Cloverfield 's menacing creature gets pulled back even further on the Blu-ray version of the movie , which roars into stores Tuesday .
Hard - core Cloverfield sleuths can gain special insight into the monster that trashed Manhattan thanks to the disc 's Special Investigation Mode , an optional in - film feature that provides tidbits of trivia about the creature 's physical characteristics and location throughout the movie .
Additionally , a map tracks the locations of main characters , military personnel and the " large - scale aggressor " that made the movie a box office beast .
The Blu-ray release includes all the extras from the previous two - disc DVD release : slightly tweaked alternative endings and meaty featurettes ( including behind - the - scenes video diaries , explorations into the CGI world of New York under attack and the mechanics of cobbling together the megamonster that wreaks havoc throughout the film ) .
Wired.com nabbed Cloverfield director Matt Reeves ( pictured above , right , with actor T.J. Miller ) for a brief telephone chat about the rumors swirling about Cloverfield 2 and straying from sci-fi for his next project , The Invisible Woman .
Wired :
There 's been a lot of back and forth about whether or not a Cloverfield sequel is in the works .
Can you set the record straight for us ?
__
Matt Reeves : __I can say that we really hope we could do it .
It 's in a pre-baby stage .
Right now , it 's still like in the single - cell version of itself .
It 's not a viable life form yet .
But the truth of the matter is , we 're not 100 percent that we 're going to do it .
I have a couple of ideas , Drew [ Goddard , a Lost alum who penned the first Cloverfield script ] has a couple of ideas , but we just finished this one , and we have n't had the time to evaluate what 's next .
__ __
This is n't me being evasive , but it 's literally just too early to tell .
We promised ourselves that we would have to come up with something just as fresh and fun , ' cause you do n't want to repeat the experience .
We do n't want to be repetitive .
It 's an unusual problem , but a cool one , to see what would come out of it .__
__
Wired :
Does that mean the monster is definitely alive ?
That seemed to be hinted at in the muffled radio static after the credits .
__
Reeves :__
If there 's a continuation like a sequel , then one would think there 's something still going on .
Whether it's that monster or not , I do n’t know .
We know the film would need a fresh perspective , and
I do n't think that means just picking up where we left off .
But I can't even confirm anything in that direction .
__Wired : __You 're killing us , Matt !
__Reeves : __[ Laughs ]
I know .
I 'm sorry .
This is like my pre-Cloverfied interviews where I could n’t give anything else away , except there just is n't anything to give away this time .
But I know that J.J. [ Abrams ] , Drew and I really want to work together again , and hopefully it'll be Cloverfield 2 , and if not , then something else cool .
And I 'll keep you in the loop .
__Wired : __The movie recently debuted in Japan .
How did that go over , considering the film 's roots in the ultimate creature feature , Gojira , or Godzilla ?
Reeves :__ __It was No. 1 in Japan for the first two weekends – it created a big stir , which was very exciting .
We did n't know how the audience there would respond to the viral marketing , and it went over very , very well .
The culture is so different – everyone is so kind and polite – that it was hard to get a real feeling for it , but at the screening the audience went crazy .
I 'd actually never been to Japan , so it was really cool to have Cloverfield bring me there .
__Wired : __What 's different about the Blu-ray release ?
__Reeves : __Even though we shot the whole movie on a Handycam , it was actually shot in HD .
I 'm excited for people to see [ the monster ] in its full , pristine environment .
I need to get a copy of the DVD too !
I 'm anxious to see it in Blu - Ray .
__Wired :
What can you tell us about The Invisible Woman , the new film that you 're writing and directing ?
__
Reeves :
Well , it 's not science fiction at all .
It 's in the vein of a Hitchcockian thriller about a very suburban New Jersey mom who drops her kids off at soccer practice but is leading a double life as a criminal .
The genesis of that project is that I came across a bunch of news stories like this , about suburban bank robbers who did n't fit the traditional model of a criminal or a drug addict .
And I got into the idea of these suburban families with their backs so far up against a wall , they have this crazy , unbelievable secret .
And in Woman , nobody knowns [ the main character ] is so desperate to make ends meet and keep her family together that she turns to a life of crime .
Wired : On IMDB it looks as though J.J. Abrams ' production house , Bad Robot , is working on the film .
Does that mean we can expect another viral web – and possibly more Slusho puzzle pieces and references ?

Reeves : __J.J. is one of the producers , but we 're not necessarily doing it through Bad Robot , but J.J. is definitely involved .
My guess would be the film wo n't have the same [ marketing tactic ] , that same approach as Cloverfield .
We are hoping to be shooting this fall and it would come out next year .
We 've just begun the casting process .

On January 24 , 2006 , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 's ( DHS ) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) component awarded an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity ( IDIQ ) contingency contract to Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root ( KBR ) to " support ICE facilities in the event of an emergency " — in essence , American concentration camps — Business Wire reported .
" With a maximum total value of $ 385 million over a five - year term , consisting of a one - year based period and four one - year options , the competitively awarded contract will be executed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , Fort Worth District .
KBR held the previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005 . " [ 1 ]
" The contract , which [ was ] effective immediately , provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs .
The contingency support contract provides for planning and , if required , initiation of specific engineering , construction and logistics support tasks to establish , operate and maintain one or more expansion facilities .
" The contract may also provide migrant detention support to other U.S. Government organizations in the event of an immigration emergency , as well as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency , such as a natural disaster .
In the event of a natural disaster , the contractor could be tasked with providing housing for ICE personnel performing law enforcement functions in support of relief efforts , " Business Wire wrote .
Construction 2006
KBR is constructing " a huge facility at an undisclosed location to hold tens of thousands of Bush 's ' unlawful enemy combatants , ' " Marjorie Cohn wrote in AlterNet , October 9 , 2006 .
" Americans are certain to be among them . "
The Military Commissions Act of 2006 , passed September 29 , 2006 , " provides the basis for the President to round - up both aliens and U.S. citizens he determines have given material support to terrorists , " Cohn wrote .

My family recently traveled to Texas to relax and camp .
I returned with a few observations .
Because They Can
Camping ?
Alright , we pull a travel trailer , with hot water , A/C , etc .
We 're not roughing it , but our SUV is relatively cramped when you consider the empty space being towed behind us .
One of my daughters asked , " Why did the state make it illegal to ride in the trailer ? "
Questions like these always give me pause .
There is the party line : " Well , state officials feel that riding in the trailer can be dangerous .
They are only protecting us . "
But , wait .
Since not all states ban such travel , the party line is not valid — it never is .
The true response is this : " The state officials ban activities because they can .
Regardless of the reason , regardless of their belief in an individual 's ability to act in his or her best interest , they ban it because they can .
Plain and simple . "
Division of the Consumer
Sure , we give labor its due , but what about the consumer ?
While traveling and camping , we end up at a different campground every night .
Since we were in areas new to us , we had no real action - knowledge of possible campgrounds , their cost , or condition .
[ 1 ]
Sure , there is the occasional KOA , but for the most part , campgrounds are independently owned and locally operated .
All that we had to guide us was our Garmin and campground guide .
Yet , every campground we stayed at was just what we desired : clean and cheap .
Even though each owner can be almost certain that we are never going to return to their campground , they were pleasant and helpful .
So , why are these campgrounds such joys ?
Simple : the division of the consumer .
You see , it is the locals and the regulars who demand quality at a reasonable price .
In addition , it is these very same folks — and their preferences — that drive the market for local campgrounds .
Through this process , my family benefits .
Of course , the same is true for most hotels , stores , restaurants , etc. , across the United States ; the locals and regulars guide the entrepreneur and his investments .
When these folks visit my slice of Ohio , I will repay them .
They will benefit from my buying and abstaining from buying .
Each day , my neighbors and I direct local entrepreneurs to produce desired products and services .
In the end , everyone benefits from individuals acting in their own best interests , acting without outside — or centralized — influence .
Public Schools
Regardless of the socioeconomics of an area , and in spite of any drought or water shortage , every public school that we encountered was the best - looking building in sight , surrounded by the greenest grass .
This is the result of the false belief that government spending drives improvements and leads to positive results , and the belief that tax dollars spent by public schools benefit children and society , both locally and throughout the nation — as if impoverishing the nation for new bricks and green grass will bring about utopia .
In reality , these expensive , well - kept edifices are simply the tokens that government provides for confiscated income and indoctrinated children .
Not a fair trade in my eyes .
Route 66 : Capital , Value , and Taxation
I - 44 through Oklahoma parallels the famed Route 66 .
For a stretch , we ventured off the highway and back in time .
Route 66 is still strewn with small towns , motels , garages , etc. , all suffering from the lack of consumers and dollars .
We spent one night camping at an RV park that has seen wealthier days .
The campground 's facilities and bathrooms were clean and functional , with the exception of the pool and bathhouse .
From all appearances , the owner abandoned the pool years ago , probably not too long after I - 44 replaced Route 66 as the road west .
Now , the going rate for campgrounds in that area is $ 18 per night for water , electricity , and sewer hookup .
The owner obviously recognizes that money spent on the pool does not lead to more guests or more profit .
Moreover , the guests — all overnighters — have little value for a pool .
Therefore , capital reinvestment was reduced from that which sustained a prized Route 66 campground to that which sustains one that now exists off the main road — and the pool is gone .
Likely , the market value of the campground fell the moment I - 44 was first proposed .
The value of the campground has nothing to do with the amount of labor and resources that went into its production .
No , its value is purely driven by the ability of an entrepreneur to obtain profits from his investment .
This is important to note :
Since taxation on capital goods reduces the ability of entrepreneurs to obtain a profit , taxation reduces the value of commercial property and the amount of capital reinvestment .
Taxation moves the capital good from the main road of consumer preference to the slow , back roads of misallocation — and the pool is gone , so to speak .
Taxation does not create value .
Instead , it leads to higher current consumption over capital investments , steadily robbing our future , and our children 's future .
The Border
We spent four nights in Big Bend National Park , alongside the Rio Grande , with Mexico literally a stone - skip away .
If it was n't for the green swath of vegetation that accompanies the Rio , you likely would n't even notice the river .
And yet this is the evil border , and we were about to meet its residents . [ 2 ]
Criminalizing Trade
Boquillas is a small village just south of the Big Bend in the Rio .
This village used to be the home of 200 people who made a living trading with park visitors .
Just a handful of years ago , the border in this area was relatively open , and park visitors and village residents could cross at will .
That all changed with 9 - 11 and the fear subsidized by government and prodded by politicians .
Now , it is illegal to cross the border .
But the traders to the south still venture across the knee - high waters in order to sell their wares : walking sticks , painted rocks , etc .
The park newsletter notes that items purchased from these Mexicans are considered contraband and will be confiscated by officers .
In addition , US citizens who cross the Rio and attempt to reenter the US are liable for a " fine of not more than $ 5,000 or imprisonment for up to one year or both . "
With a stroke of the pen , the United States criminalized free trade , and Boquillas is now a dying village .
Are we safer ?
Absolutely not .
Criminalizing activities does nothing more than create criminals on both sides of the border .
The " illegals " we encountered were very friendly , just business folks looking to put food on the table .
Regardless , someone under threat of government will react differently than the storekeeper in some situations .
In the end , it is the park visitor who likely ends up the criminal , simply by crossing a river to make an exchange that benefits both parties , and harms neither .
The Function of Government
What is the role of government , if any ?
One can only justify government as the force that protects property .
Of course , the extension of this argument quickly becomes contradictory , but we live in a world where government is reality .
The park newsletter notes that visitors who purchase a walking stick from Mexicans are subject to confiscation , etc. , while also noting that visitors need to be on the lookout for drug runners and similar activities .
On top of that , most parking spots had warnings noting frequent break - ins of unattended vehicles .
So there you have it : government writ large .
The only entity that can legally carry a weapon in the park is not willing or able to protect my property .
This very same entity will quickly fine , arrest , etc. , anyone caught purchasing an untaxed , $ 5 painted walking stick .
Government security is nothing less than a sham .
In the end , government exists solely to protect itself from my activities .
It does not exist to protect my property .
Postscript : Presumed Guilt
On the trip home from the border , with the Rio some 100 miles behind us , we were forced to pull into a border patrol station along with everyone else on the road .
Here , the rule is presumed guilt .
And , in a scene from a cheap war movie , a man with a sidearm asked me where we were from and where we were going .
Milling about were five other holstered agents with a guard dog , deciding whether my story met with their approval .
The officer at my window , with his challenging mannerisms , listened to my story and made his decision , all the while holding my life and liberty in the balance .
It was then that I realized that it was n't just my family that was on vacation — we have allowed liberty to go on vacation as well .
Thinking back to my response to my daughter 's question , I realized that it was time to extend my words :
They do it because they can .
We fight for liberty because we must .
No one else will do it for us .
Church signs
With a steady decline in people attending church these days , the holy trinity of North America has opted for a more light hearted approach in attracting future congregation .
Church signs provide the essential means of communication between church , church members , the community and potentially new church members .
Congregations that describe their worship as " joyful " and “ humerous ” are more likely to experience substantial growth in numbers .

When we published our look at Bell Canada 's just - released congestion numbers , numbers that are offered up as the reason for instituting P2P throttling throughout the company 's network , we noted one curious fact : the numbers are low .
Really , really low .
In fact , over the last year ( May 2007 - May 2008 ) , not a single link was congested more than three percent of the time — except at the DSLAM , where the DSL line from the home ends in Bell 's local office .
What 's more , the congestion at the DSLAM has actually increased substantially after Bell implemented its traffic shaping program last fall .
All of this leads one industry expert to tell Ars that Bell 's traffic problems could be " easily and inexpensively solved " without throttling and at fairly low cost .
DSLAM congestion
Bell 's P2P throttling program was allegedly designed to prevent more than 700,000 users from being affected by major congestion on Bell Canada 's DSL network , and it has helped to bring down congestion in the aggregation link from the DSLAM to the broadband access server ( BAS ) , in the BAS itself , and further upstream on Bell 's backbone .
But the congestion rates were n't high before throttling began .
One year ago , in May 2007 , the aggregation link was congested 1.8 percent of the time , the BAS was congested 0.4 percent of the time , and the backbone experienced congestion 3 percent of the time .
Data source : Bell Canada
At the DSLAM , though , congestion hovered around 4 percent last year .
From October 2007 to May 2008 , when Bell was rolling out its traffic - shaping gear , congestion at the DSLAM picked up dramatically , and Bell set three new congestion records ( going from 7.8 percent to 8 percent to 8.2 percent ) .
To get some perspective on these numbers , we talked to Dave Burstein , editor of the trade publication DSL Prime and an expert on DSL operations .
Burstein points out that the only real issue Bell is having is at the local DSLAMs , but he notes that DSLAMs from Lucent and Alcatel ( the main players in this market ) have been non-blocking by design for years now ; they can handle all the data that DSL links can throw at them without problems , multiplex it , and pass it upstream .
Only FiOS is capable of generating enough local traffic to cause potential blocking .
This means one of two things to Burstein : that Bell is using severely outdated DSLAMs , or that the connection out the back of the DSLAM to the upstream fiber aggregation link is far too slow .
The DSLAM box , which aggregates local DSL links and then multiplexes them onto a single line , can have numerous upstream network connection options .
Burstein notes that Bell has repeatedly spoken in its filings about saturating OC - 3 ( 150 Mbps ) and OC - 12 connections ( 600 Mbps ) , but says that every DSL network he 's familiar with has put in gigabit Ethernet connection ( 1 Gbps ) to DSLAMs for at least the last few years .
In Japan , one provider was laying no less than 4 GigE connections to each DSLAM ... and this was back in 2002 .
If Bell 's upstream DSLAM links are too slow , the whole problem could be fixed quite cheaply by upgrading the networking board in the back of DSLAM to gigabit Ethernet .
For a company already publicly pledging to spend $ 500 million in capital upgrades this year , such a fix would be pocket change .
Bandwidth is cheap
Once data is out of the DSLAM , speed problems are simple to address .
Telecom companies like Bell Canada have laid fiber everywhere for years ; whenever you do the expensive work of digging up a street to lay cable , you drop in plenty of cheap dark fiber that can be lit up later .
And fiber links can be expanded by pumping more wavelengths through the cable .
Upgrades consist of simply replacing the machines on either end of a fiber link or the core routers along the way in your network .
While individually these devices cost some serious coin , upgrades are n't particularly expensive in the aggregate .
That 's why bandwidth around the world has plummeted so dramatically in cost over the last decade .
Our own discussions with experts have shown that the core of the Internet has plenty of capacity and the only real scarcity exists at the edges ( and in countries like Japan , it does n't even exist there ) .
Burstein estimates that most ISPs currently spend about a dollar per month per customer to carry their traffic , and that congestion problems are more about a lack of competition than anything else ; useful upgrades could probably be done for about a dime per customer per month .
In the end , though , Bell Canada 's politically - risky approach to throttling P2P ( it has already spawned a proceeding at Canada 's telecoms regulator ) may amount to little .
Unless throttling is expanded to other forms of totally legal video distribution on the ' Net , massive network upgrades will need to continue .
That 's because P2P is only one " threat " to an ISP 's bottom line .
P2P throttling matters less than you think
Cisco last week released some detailed numbers from its own research that showed P2P traffic dropping as a percentage of total IP traffic .
According to the company , " Peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file sharing networks are now carrying 600 petabytes per month more than they did this time last year , which means there is the equivalent of an additional 150 million DVDs crossing the network each month , for a total monthly volume of over 500 million DVD equivalents , or two exabytes .
Despite this growth , P2P as a percentage of consumer Internet traffic dropped to 51 percent at the end of 2007 , down from 60 percent the year before . "
So P2P is growing , but not as fast as other forms of video ; in particular , streaming video from sites like YouTube , Hulu , and Netflix is surging , and as HD streaming grows in popularity , the pressure on last - mile networks will be even greater .
Apart from P2P traffic , Cisco estimates that video already accounts for one - quarter of consumer Internet traffic , and it will hit 32 percent by the end of 2008 .
By 2012 , it will be 50 percent .
Those are P2P - like bandwidth numbers .
ISPs like Bell Canada face a problem .
Much of this new video is entirely legal , negating arguments that it 's sort of okay to throttle P2P because , hey , we all know it 's mostly used by pirates .
If Bell thinks that P2P users complain when their torrents are throttled , wait until the general public can't access their Netflix HD streams or The Colbert Report on Hulu .
As TV and movies continue to migrate to the web , throttling video bandwidth simply wo n't cut it as a business tactic anymore .
Companies like Verizon , that have made long - term infrastructure investments , wo n't have the same problems , but FiOS is available only in limited areas in the US .
In much of Canada and the US , there 's little competition , even when a duopoly exists .
Sure , cable companies are pledging higher speeds from DOCSIS 3.0 , but that rollout wo n't be complete for years .
Most cable operators have n't even started .
In most places , low - speed cable and DSL will be the two main choices for some time still , which means that companies will have less incentive to innovate and upgrade than to sit on a stagnant network and reap the fat profits .
When cast in terms of TV shows , that may not seem like the end of civilization , but when you consider the tremendous economic and social benefits that broadband can bring , it 's not nearly so trivial .

Talk about misunderstanding a concept .
In the videos here , the citizens of Denver cheer on GWOT helicopters as they buzz skyscrapers , apparently clueless about what this means .
It means the Department of Defense is free to “ surprise and inconvenience ” Denver residents , as the Denver Post reported .
“ For those people kept awake by the flights that end at 11 p.m. , [ U.S. Special Operations Command spokesman Lt. Steve Ruh ] says it ’s a small inconvenience to pay for freedom , ” according to KKTV .
Of course , the Pentagon will define “ freedom ” and inconvenience and the people of Denver have nothing to say about it .
“ These low - flying helicopters have been buzzing over Denver for at least a couple of hours now .
Since some of their passes seem to barely miss the roof of my 14 - story building , I really hope they ’re watching out for the two 50 + story skyscrapers that are within 1 - 4 blocks of here , ” writes a YouTube blogger .
“ Is this some sort of security preparation for the upcoming Democratic National Convention ?
A secret government conspiracy to test how citizens react to hour after hour of 100 - decibel noise outside their homes ? ”
More likely , it is an “ exercise ” to get people accustomed to MH - 6 “ Little Birds ” flying around at dusk without running lights .
After all , white al - Qaeda is on the loose .
In a related news , a “ woman in Denver claims the military helicopters flying over the city this week as part of a training exercise caused damage in her backyard , ” reports Denver CBS 4 .
“ It ’s creepy , they did n’t have to get right next to our house and do that , ” said Michelle Simpson .
“ The window was open and then it broke .
Now you can put anything through there , ” added Simpson .
Sand bags that used to keep a gate closed could n’t do anything against the helicopter ’s power .
Even recyclables in a big purple garbage pail were spread all over her backyard .
Lt. Steve Ruh from the U.S. Department of Defense says that helicopters fly 1,000 feet above ground level , according to federal aviation rules .
Simpson said her home is next to an old hospital where the helicopters were landing as part of the exercise .
Ruh never mentioned why the military failed to notify the public about the urban war training before the helicopters started to fly Monday night .
Simpson said she wished she would ’ve had a heads up .
Heads up ?
Obviously , this lady is unaware of white al - Qaeda lurking around in her yard .
Broken windows , scattered yard work , frightened babies — it ’s all a small price to pay for freedom as defined by the neocons in the Pentagon .

Even with those improvements , providing the energy to produce gasoline on a commercial scale  say , 750,000 gallons a day  would require a dedicated power plant , preferably a nuclear one , the scientists say .
According to their analysis , their concept , which would cost about $ 5 billion to build , could produce gasoline at an operating cost of $ 1.40 a gallon and would turn economically viable when the price at the pump hits $ 4.60 a gallon , taking into account construction costs and other expenses in getting the gas to the consumer .
With some additional technological advances , the break - even price would drop to $ 3.40 a gallon , they said .

A nuclear reactor is not required technologically .
The same chemical processes could also be powered by solar panels , for instance , but the economics become far less favorable .
Dr. Martin and Dr. Kubic will present their Green Freedom concept on Wednesday at the Alternative Energy Now conference in Lake Buena Vista , Fla .
They plan a simple demonstration within a year and a larger prototype within a couple of years after that .
A commercial nuclear - powered gasoline factory would have to jump some high hurdles before it could be built , and thousands of them would be needed to fully replace petroleum , but this part of the global warming problem has no easy solutions .
In the efforts to reduce humanity ’s emissions of carbon dioxide , now nearing 30 billion metric tons a year , most of the attention so far has focused on large stationary sources , like power plants where , conceptually at least , one could imagine a shift from fuels that emit carbon dioxide  coal and natural gas  to those that do not  nuclear , solar and wind .
Another strategy , known as carbon capture and storage , would continue the use of fossil fuels but trap the carbon dioxide and then pipe it underground where it would not affect the climate .
Time for Congress to Stand Up in Its Own Defense : Impeach Bush and Cheney Now !
HOW ' HIGH ' DOES A “ HIGH CRIME ” NEED TO BE NOW ?
Time for Congress to Stand Up in Its Own Defense : Impeach Bush and Cheney Now ! by Dave Lindorff Fri , 06/06/2008
The nation is at a dangerous crossroad .
Either Congress reasserts its authority now by impeachment or it forever surrenders that role , leaving us with what can only be called a dictatorship .
The last couple of weeks have brought confirmation — as if it were needed — even in the corporate media , that President George W. Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , and the gang of thugs and sycophants around them in the White House , engaged in a massive conspiracy to lie the country into a war in Iraq .
The release of a confessional book by former White House press spokesman Scott McClellan and the subsequent release of a long blocked report by the Senate Intelligence Committee make it clear that Bush , Cheney & Company deliberately lied to Congress and the American public back in 2002 and early 2003 about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein ( there was none ) .
McClellan also states that Bush and Cheney conspired to “ out ” CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame Wilson , as part of a compaign to prevent her husband from exposing a major part of that campaign of lies : the claim that Saddam Hussein was seeking to build nuclear weapons .
It would be hard to overstate the extent of or the damage caused by these crimes that are now exposed to the light of day .
Beginning in 2001 , making the most cynical use of the tragic killing of nearly 3000 Americans in the 9 - 11 attacks , Bush and Cheney moved to aggrandize as much power as possible in the executive , and then , to consolidate that power grab , engineered a full - scale war against Iraq , enabling them to claim that any opponent of their dictatorial usurpation of power was a traitor to the nation .
It was all a lie .
Saddam Hussein had no links to Al Qaeda , and he had no nuclear program .
He had no weapons of mass destruction .
His country was broken , thanks to years of international sanctions and war .
As a result of these lies , we have a country that no longer even remotely resembles what the Founders had intended .
The Congress has been shorn of its once exclusive authority to legislate , and even its Constitutional power to investigate the executive branch has been successfully defied .
It is now an atrophied relic .
The federal judiciary , right up to the Supreme Court , has been packed with administration sycophants and Federalist Society advocates of unfettered executive power .
We also have been saddled with an unwinnable war in the Middle East that has claimed the lives of 4500 Americans , destroyed the lives of another 30,000 — or perhaps several hundred thousand , if we add in all those suffering psychological damage , or genetic damage from exposure to depleted uranium weapons .
That war has also killed over 1 million innocent Iraqis , including countless chiildren , destroyed their country , bankrupted this nation , and made the US a pariah and a rogue state in the eyes of the rest of the world .
Most Americans long since came to the conclusion that the Bush administration was a gang of idiots .
Just watching their handling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster unfold was enough to make that clear .
But the new reports from McClellan and from the Senate Intelligence Committee should make it clear that this was not just stupidity .
The disasters that have befallen this nation , or that it has brought on the rest of the world , over the past eight years have been the result of deliberate lying and deceit and of the conspiratorial policies of a cabal of leaders whose goal from day one was undoing the Constitution and establishing the presidency as a kind of dictatorship .
Most of the corporate media have been unable to bring themselves to state this clearly .
They edge around the issue by talking about the White House having been “ misleading ” or “ untruthful . ”
And little is said about the lasting damage that has been done to the Republic and the Constitution , or about what is to be done about a still bloody war that never should have been fought in the first place .
The answer is clear .
Impeachment proceedings should be initiated against both Bush and Cheney .
These two arch criminals must not be permitted to leave office with their titles intact .
They need to be tossed out in disgrace , and then indicted for war crimes and for crimes like perjury , conspiracy and perhaps treason .
We are already seeing the long - term damage that has been wrought .
John McCain , the presumed Republican nominee for president , is saying that the president ’s use of the National Security Agency to spy , without any court order , on tens or hundreds of thousants , or perhaps millions of Americans , is legal , and would continue under a McCain administration .
Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , has said that he would continue Bush ’s use of “ signing statements ” to ignore Congressional legislation that he felt impaired his Constitutional powers as president .
The nation is at a dangerous crossroad .
Either Congress reasserts its authority now , via impeachment , drawing a Constitutional line in the stand in defense of Article I of the Constitution — the article that defines the power of Congress as absolute in terms of passing legisation — or it forever surrenders that role , leaving us with what can only be called a dictatorship .
We clearly cannot count on the next president , whoever that may be , to surrender powers usurped by the current one .
What leader in history has willingly and voluntarily surrendered authority , after all ?
Such power must be wrested back by Congress , and the only way for that to happen is impeachment — a course laid out clearly by the authors of the Constitution for just such a crisis .

Sorting out the lobbying entanglements of his campaign advisers is proving to be a messy business for Senator John McCain .
On Monday , just days after it issued new rules to address conflicts of interest , the McCain campaign was furiously sifting through the business records of aides and advisers .
The new rules were prompted by disclosures that led to the abrupt departure from the campaign of a number of aides who worked as lobbyists , including some with ties to foreign governments .
Mr. McCain ’s political identity has long been defined by his calls for reducing the influence of special interests in Washington .
But as he heads toward the general election as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , he has increasingly confronted criticism that his campaign staff is stocked with people who have made their living as lobbyists or in similar jobs , leaving his credentials as a reformer open to attack .
The process of trying to purge the campaign of conflicts that in appearance or reality might violate Mr. McCain ’s stated principles or cause him political trouble has so far focused only more attention on the backgrounds of his aides and advisers .
In this photo montage of actual quantum images , two laser beams coming from the bright glare in the distance transmit images of a cat - like face at two slightly different frequencies ( represented by the orange and the purple colors ) .
The twisted lines indicate that the seemingly random changes or fluctuations that occur over time in any part of the orange image are strongly interconnected or " entangled " with the fluctuations of the corresponding part in the purple image .
Though false color has been added to the cats ' faces , they are otherwise actual images obtained in the experiment .

Using a convenient and flexible method for creating twin light beams , researchers at the Joint Quantum Institute of the Commerce Department 's National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Maryland have produced " quantum images , " pairs of information - rich visual patterns whose features are " entangled , " or inextricably linked by the laws of quantum physics .
In addition to promising better detection of faint objects and improved amplification and positioning of light beams , the researchers ' technique for producing quantum images — unprecedented in its simplicity , versatility , and efficiency — may someday be useful for storing patterns of data in quantum computers and transmitting large amounts of highly secure encrypted information .
The research team , led by JQI 's Paul Lett , describes the work in the June 12 edition of Science Express .
" Images have always been a preferred method of communication because they carry so much information in their details , " says Vincent Boyer , lead author of the new paper .
" Up to now , however , cameras and other optical detectors have largely ignored a lot of useful information in images .
By taking advantage of the quantum - mechanical aspects of images , we can improve applications ranging from taking pictures of hard - to - see objects to storing data in futuristic quantum computers . "
A laser beam ( marked as " probe " ) first passes through a mask that imprints a visual pattern .
Along with a second laser beam ( marked " pump " ) , it enters a cell containing a gas of rubidium atoms .
Interactions between the rubidium gas and the beams produce an amplified version of the imprinted image as well as a second version of the image , rotated 180 degrees around the pump .
The bottom panel shows , from left to right , an incoming probe beam imprinted with the letters " N " and " T , " an outgoing probe beam with an amplified image , and an upside - down version of the letters .

Conventional photographic films or digital camera sensors only record the color and intensity of a light wave striking their surfaces .
A hologram additionally records a light wave 's " phase " — the precise locations of the crests and valleys in the wave .
However , much more happens in a light wave .
Even the most stable laser beams brighten and dim randomly over time because , as quantum mechanics has shown , light has inherent " uncertainties " in its features , manifested as moment - to - moment fluctuations in its properties .
Controlling these fluctuations — which represent a sort of " noise " — can improve detection of faint objects , produce better amplified images , and allow workers to more accurately position laser beams .
Quantum mechanics has revealed light 's unavoidable noise , but it also provides subtle ways of reducing it to values lower than physicists once imagined possible .
Researchers can't completely eliminate the noise , but they can rearrange it to improve desired features in images .
A quantum - mechanical technique called " squeezing " lets physicists reduce noise in one property — such as intensity — at the expense of increasing the noise in a complementary property , such as phase .
Modern physics not only enables useful noise reduction , but also opens new applications for images — such as transferring heaps of encrypted data protected by the laws of quantum mechanics and performing parallel processing of information for quantum computers .
Perhaps most strikingly , the quantum images produced by these researchers are born in pairs .
Transmitted by two light beams originating from the same point , the two images are like twins separated at birth .
Look at one quantum image , and it displays random and unpredictable changes over time .
Look at the other image , and it exhibits very similar random fluctuations at the same time , even if the two images are far apart and unable to transmit information to one another .
They are " entangled " — their properties are linked in such a way that they exist as a unit rather than individually .
Moreover , they are squeezed : Matching up both quantum images and subtracting their fluctuations , their noise is lower — and their information content potentially higher — than it is from any two classical images .
To create quantum images , the researchers use a simple yet powerful method known as " four - wave mixing , " a technique in which incoming light waves enter a gas and interact to produce outgoing light waves .
In the setup , a faint " probe " beam passes through a stencil - like " mask " with a visual pattern .
Imprinted with an image , the probe beam joins an intense " pump " beam inside a cell of rubidium gas .
The atoms of the gas interact with the light , absorbing energy and re-emitting an amplified version of the original image .
In addition , a complementary second image is created by the light emitted by the atoms .
To satisfy nature 's requirement for the set of outgoing light beams to have the same energy and momentum as the set of incoming light beams , the second image comes out as an inverted , upside - down copy of the first image , rotated by 180 degrees with respect to the pump beam and at a slightly different color .
One breakthrough in the experiment is that each image is made of up to 100 distinct regions , akin to the pixels forming a digital image , each with its own independent optical and noise properties .
A pixel on one image forms a partnership with a pixel on the other image .
Look at two unrelated pixels — for example , a pixel in the top row of the first image and a pixel in the top row of the second image — and they appear to be doing their own random thing .
But for two entangled pixels — the upper left pixel in the first image and the lower right pixel in the second image — their random fluctuations over time are eerily similar — one could predict many of the properties in the second pixel just by looking at the first .
" Making entangled quantum images is really striking , but what is most impressive to us is that the technique for making them is so much easier than what was possible before , " says Lett .
Previous efforts at making quantum images have been limited to building them up with " photon counting " — collecting one photon at a time over a long period of time , or having very specialized " images " such as something that could only be constructed from a dot and a ring .
In contrast , the new method produces an entire image at one time and can make a wide variety of images in any shape .
Moreover , those earlier efforts have been difficult to implement — some setups required light to bounce back and forth between tightly controlled , precisely spaced mirrors .
By contrast , the four - wave mixing approach requires easy - to - prepare laser beams and a small cell of rubidium vapor .
A next goal for the researchers is to produce quantum images with slowed - down light ; such slowed images could be used in information storage and processing as well as communications applications .

After suffering a seizure this weekend , Sen .
Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor , and the press has begun to speculate about treatments that may be used to buy some extra time for the dying lawmaker .
We have picked our favorite : cholortoxin .
Kennedy 's best option may be an experimental drug made from giant yellow Israeli scorpion venom .
It is produced by TransMolecular Inc. and has advanced into Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of gliomas , the type of tumor that will probably kill him .
The medication , TM - 601 , is a peptide , a short protein which has a remarkable ability to stick to some types of cancer cells while avoiding normal ones .
Attach it to some radioactive iodine and the molecule becomes a smart weapon – killing cancer cells while leaving their healthy neighbors unscathed .
In an ongoing clinical trial , the drug will be intracavitary administered , which means it will be squirted straight into the patients ' brains .
Despite the bugs and gore , what I find most interesting is that radiolabeled TM - 601 was granted orphan drug status by the Food and Drug Administration this year .
Since gliomas are not common enough to be a big moneymaker for big pharmaceutical companies , they have little motivation to develop a cure .
With just that sort of dire situation in mind , congress passed the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 .
It was meant to encourage research for neglected diseases .
Years later , Kennedy fought to amend that theoretically - benevolent law because manufacturers were charging a fortune for drugs which had been granted orphan status .
We would like to compile a list of his medical options , including experimental remedies , and you can help us out .
What are his other options ?
Do you like this one the best ?

If you ’ve ever taken a chemistry class , you ’re probably familiar with analytical balances .
These scales are n’t like a casual bathroom scale but are instead designed to measure mass with high accuracy .
Draft shields and stabilizing feet protect extra-sensitive balance pans from vibrations and wind , giving you the most precise measurement possible .
If you need to weigh something small , countertop analytical balances are the way to go .
For large items , consider an analytical balance table .
While analytical balance chemistry uses are the most well - known , there are many reasons to use an analytical balance .
Small analytical balances are useful for weighing supplements , remineralizing the water you drink , and endless other home uses .
Zoologists recording animals ’ weights and jewelers weighing precious stones are a couple of lesser - known professional uses .
Here are six great tips on how to select an analytical balance , no matter what you ’re weighing .
1. What You ’re Weighing Matters
While you can weigh many materials with an analytical balance , some balances are better for certain materials than others are .
If you plan on weighing liquids , search for a waterproof scale .
Those looking to weigh jewels should make sure to get an analytical balance that measures in carats because not all do .
2. Consider the Precision of Analytical Balances
Precision is indicated by the number of decimal points the scale measures to .
Any good analytical balance is designed to weigh with precision .
Yet , you do n’t need the same degree of precision for everything .
For example , if you ’re weighing tiny objects , you may want an analytical balance 4 digit scale or an even more precise one .
If the items weigh a kilogram or more , you do n’t need to worry about fractions of milligrams in most cases .
3. Be Realistic About Maintenance
Because analytical balances are precise and fragile devices , it ’s important to do proper maintenance .
High - end analytical balances need more attention to detail .
Workers in professional chemistry labs train on careful maintenance .
You may have the best intentions , but you ’re unlikely to be that careful when using an analytical balance at home .
So buying a professional - grade scale for personal use is n’t the smartest move in most cases .
Getting a balance you can’t maintain means you lose accuracy — and accuracy is the entire point of buying an analytical balance .
If you do n’t maintain your analytical balance , you might as well get a less accurate scale .
4. Some Balances Are More Accurate Than Others
As with any other product , you have the option of buying a high - quality or lower - quality analytical balance .
Again , the highest - quality scales are best for professionals .
Most home users find that slightly cheaper balances are perfect for their intended purposes .
A 3 digit analytical balance is n’t reliable down to 0.001 units .
All scales have a tolerance range of plus / minus (+/-) a certain amount over / under the actual mass .
This range indicates accuracy and is not the same for every scale .
Cheaper scales are often less accurate .
For example , a budget 3 digit analytical balance might have a range of +/- 0.005 , while its more expensive counterpart measures to +/- 0.001 .
A less accurate scale is n’t always worse , because you might not need a high degree of accuracy .
Consider what you plan to do with a balance when looking at its tolerance value .
In general , best practice with an analytical balance is to take measurements to one decimal point less than the screen displays .
So , if you weigh a 10 - gram weight and the balance reads 10.005 grams , you would still record it as 10.00 grams .
Always keep in mind that you ca n’t rely on the final digit .
5. Accuracy Is n’t Only About Weight
While the most significant tolerance range regards mass , there are other measures of accuracy , too .
The best scales come with a full tolerance breakdown .
Cheaper scales may combine all the figures into one measurement .
In any case , it ’s a good idea to confirm the accuracy and calibrate the scale using a standardized weight , often 10 grams for smaller balances .
“ Repeatability ” is one measurement that is often glossed over , especially by beginners .
This measurement refers to whether you get the same measurement multiple times in a row .
You can test it by weighing your calibration weight at least ten times or so .
Another range regards off - center balance .
You should always place your item in the center of the pan , but oddly - shaped objects make it hard to do so .
If you plan to weigh things that ca n’t lie in the exact center , you want a scale that measures well off - center .
You can measure this kind of accuracy by putting the weight in the middle , then at the far ends of the pan , and comparing the values .
6. Do n’t Overshoot the Analytical Balance Capacity
One of the most important things to know when getting an analytical balance is the weight range you expect to measure .
You do n’t need to know the exact range , but do have a general idea .
To illustrate this , consider that someone weighing milligrams of vitamins needs a different scale than a person weighing lab rats .
The amount of weight a balance can measure is called its capacity .
Smaller analytical balances often have a capacity of 200-300 grams , but that ’s not always true .
Some analytical balances can weigh items up to a few kilograms in mass .
Analytical balance tables are designed to get the precise weight of even larger things , like when vets weigh dogs and cats .
Other analytical balances hold only up to 100 grams , and some hold even fewer .
Knowing the balance capacity is important because overshooting capacity can ruin the scale .
If you put an object too large or heavy in the pan , it can throw off measurements forever or even break the balance .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - American films and TV dramas shot since the September 11 attacks have reinforced screen images of Arabs and Muslims as fanatics and villains , ingraining harmful stereotypes , argues an author on the subject .

REUTERS /FOX / Handout
In his book “ Guilty -- Hollywood ’s Verdict on Arabs after 9/11 ” , Jack Shaheen praises some post - September 11 films for offering a more sympathetic image of Arabs and Muslims , who he argues have been castigated for decades by Hollywood .
But he says that too many have portrayed them in ever darker shades , criticizing films including “ The Kingdom ” ( 2007 ) and “ The Four Feathers ” ( 2002 ) and condemning the creation of a new “ Arab - American bogeyman ” in TV dramas such as “ 24 ” .
“ In the United States , you can say anything you want about Islam and Arabs and get away with it .
In other words , as someone said , ‘ You can hit an Arab free ’ , ” said Shaheen -- also author of “ Reel Bad Arabs -- How Hollywood Vilifies a People ” .
Shaheen , an American of Lebanese descent , has examined the treatment of Arabs and Muslims in some 1,000 films , including more than 100 shot since September 11 .
From action movies such as “ True Lies ” ( 1994 ) to comedies including “ Father of the Bride Part II ” ( 1995 ) and Disney ’s animated “ Aladdin ” ( 1992 ) , Shaheen identifies films that have perpetuated damaging stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims .
“ The images have remained primarily fixed and have only been changed in the sense that they have become more vindictive and damaging , ” he told Reuters in an interview in Beirut .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ What enables these images to persist and prevail ?
One of the primary reasons is silence , ” said Shaheen , a retired professor of mass communications who worked as a consultant on “ Syriana ” ( 2005 ) and “ Three Kings ” ( 1999 ) .
“ There ’s nobody in authority , no political leader , no Hollywood personality who has taken a stand and said that demonizing Arabs and Muslims is the same as demonizing Jews or blacks or Asians or any other racial or ethnic group . ”
“ SELECTIVE FRAMING OF RADICALS ”
In “ Guilty ” , Shaheen credits films including “ Babel ” ( 2006 ) and “ Rendition ” ( 2007 ) for “ more complex , even - handed Arab portraits ” .
But “ very few people are listening ” , he said .
“ It ’s been very difficult , it ’s like being a salmon trying to swim upstream .
“ What is done is selective framing of radicals : people saying ‘ death to America ’ .
You cannot deny the reality -- there are people who really want to kill Americans .
But those are basically the only images we see . ”
He describes last year ’s “ The Kingdom ” -- an action movie about FBI agents hunting terrorists in Saudi Arabia -- as one of the most damaging depictions of Arabs of recent times in which “ even Arab children cannot be trusted ” .
Shaheen also charts a new trend of turning American Arabs and Muslims into “ the new bogey person ” and criticizes the TV drama “ 24 ” for its “ vicious images of loathsome Muslim Americans as well as Americans with Arab roots ” .
Hollywood ’s depiction of Arabs has eased the path for U.S. administration policy , he argues .
Decades of portraying Arabs and Muslims as the enemy “ made it that much easier for us to go into Iraq ” , he said .
“ There were very few people protesting .
“ The images help enforce policy , ” he said .
“ As the policy becomes more even - handed , perhaps films will reflect that .
“ Plato said : ‘ Those who tell the stories rule society ’ .
Nothing has changed , and the story tellers of today have a tremendous impact on the world as we perceive it . ”

Here ’s how you to get to CherryPal .
Gather up all of the hot technology buzzwords – cloud computing , going green , communities – and mush them together into something about the size of sandwich .
CherryPal has unveiled a device that ’s billed as a cloud computer .
Do n’t be intimidated by the name .
We ’re just talking about a PC that runs on an ultra low - power chip from Freescale instead of one of those hot jobbies from Intel or AMD .
That energy - friendly chip helps CherryPal keep its computer small and cheap – an ideal combination , we ’re told , for attracting youngsters to something different .
Fine details on CherryPal ’s approach remain tough to gather because the company does n’t plan to reveal the full breadth of its assault on the PC market until the third quarter .
For now , it ’s only showing off the hardware .
The CherryPal folks stripped out 80 per cent of the usual PC innards , leaving a case , a chip , a couple USB ports and a monitor port .
The system runs on a Power architecture - based 400MHz Freescale mobileGT MPC5121e chip , ships with 4GB of Flash storage and has 256MB of memory .
The operating system of choice is a tweaked version of embedded Linux ( Debian ) .
Best of all , perhaps , the unit chews through a mere 2 watts .
( Not a typo . )
Now , we know what you ’re thinking .
400MHz ?
Painful , right ?
Well , CherryPal CEO Max Seybold promises that this puppy flies .
The 10.5 ounce unit boots in 20 seconds and can crank through just about any applications , including graphics - heavy stuff thanks to the tri-core Freescale design that includes a graphics cruncher .
We remain skeptical – very skeptical .
And CherryPal wo n’t have demonstration units for a few weeks to prove us wrong .
Seybold , however , believes that the CherryPal device will deliver plenty of horsepower for those willing to embrace the cloud computing world .
It sounds to us like the company will have some kind of application repository and data service where customers can find software and store their files .
But Seybold refuses to talk about that for now .
Seybold also wo n’t reveal the price of system , although he did claim that it will come in “ dramatically lower ” than things like the $ 400 or so Asus EEE PC and other laptots .
Meet CherryPal
Plenty of companies have tried the thinned down computer idea and also attempted to go against the Intel and AMD ( x86 ) machine .
They ’ve just about all failed .
But perhaps this is the right machine for the right time . . . ?
" It is really good enough , " Seybold told us .
" That is the basic principle .
" We tried to eliminate waste and produce the most affordable , greenest computer on the market . "
Heinz pulled a mayo ad , airing only in Britain , because it showed a man kissing his partner goodbye on his way to work .
Heinz felt it had to pull the ad , and I repeat , only aired in the UK , because Bill O’Reilly complained that he did n’t want to see it , even though it was n’t aired in the US at all .
Nice .
So Heinz now has an official policy that gay couples are verboten in Heinz ads , even in Europe .
Gays are too controversial , too icky , too gross for Heinz .
Very nice .
Does Heinz also feel that gays are too gross to market to in Spain , where gays can legally marry ?
How about Norway , we can marry there too .
And I wonder how Heinz feels about a black man kissing a white woman .
I can see it now , try Heinz ’s new Miscegenation Mayonnaise , served on white bread only .
Heinz is one of the most recognizable brands in America .
So it should n’t be too hard to remember to avoid all of their products now and in the future .
It ’s not like there is n’t other mayo and ketchup to buy ( and honestly , Heinz mayo ?
who buys that crap anyway ? )

While Myanmar ’s military regime Friday restricted the rush of international aid offered to help hungry and homeless cyclone survivors , the government was exporting tons of rice through its main port .
Four of the five berths at the port of Thilawa for oceangoing container vessels were empty , but a crane was loading large white sacks into the hold of a freighter .
The sacks were filled with rice destined for Bangladesh , said the drivers of at least 10 transport trucks waiting to deliver several tons more of rice to the docks .
The regime has a monopoly on rice exports and said this week that it planned to meet commitments to sell rice , whose price has reached record highs on the world market , to countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , even though Myanmar ’s main rice - producing region suffered the worst damage from the cyclone , which hit a week ago .
The storm caused massive destruction in the Irrawaddy River delta , where farmers are now desperate for food .

As rice was loaded onto the freighter , people in nearby villages said authorities had handed out rations of rotting rice , apparently from ruined stocks in the port ’s massive warehouse .
The storm soaked about 40 % of the stored rice , worth millions of dollars , said the chief driver , who requested anonymity to avoid problems with government officials .
India , Vietnam , China and Cambodia had curbed rice exports this year to ensure adequate supplies for their people amid a mounting world food crisis .
Tropical Cyclone Nargis packed winds of 120 to 150 mph , snapping large trees and concrete fence posts , and bending steel electricity poles at a 45 - degree angle .
About 23,000 people died , according to officials , with tens of thousands still missing .
One survivor described the sound of the storm as otherworldly , a high - pitched howl mixed with a blood - curdling screech .
The wind pummeled the port of Thilawa so hard that it toppled one of at least three multi-ton gantry container cranes .
The 10 - story behemoth lay crippled on its side Friday .

Kyaw Win , 31 , head of the village of Thamalone , swore at the mention of the military rulers .
As he stood among broken wood planks , woven bamboo and thatch that had been his neighbors ’ homes , he began to cry .
The village is only 15 miles from Myanmar ’s commercial center , Yangon .
It ’s easy to reach by road and close to the country ’s best seaport .
But the only relief aid came from a private charity , the Free Funeral Service Assn .
Headed by movie star and opposition supporter Kyaw Thu , the association normally provides coffins so the poor can get a proper burial .
But since the weekend storm , the charity ’s pickup trucks and volunteer workers have been one of the main lifelines in the disaster zone .
They delivered 4.4 pounds of rice each to many families Wednesday and promised to return in a few days with more .

Villagers said that they saw cartons of instant noodles unloaded at a government office and that officials kept them for themselves .
The only help the villagers received from the government was half a pound of rotting rice , they said , and the absurdity made them laugh .
Residents said they were used to the military , which has ruled Myanmar , also known as Burma , since 1962 .
The generals who rule one of Asia ’s poorest countries also sell gems and timber through state - controlled companies .
The storm flattened the wood - frame home of Kyaw Kyaw , 38 .
Like most of the village , Kyaw Kyaw , his wife and their two small children had taken refuge across the road in a Buddhist monastery that remained standing despite losing its roof .

A bus conductor , Kyaw Kyaw earned $ 1.50 a day before the cyclone struck .
The storm knocked out power to most areas in the south , so the plant that provides compressed natural gas for the buses is shut down .
Villagers are helping one another rebuild their homes with materials they can scrounge locally , but like Kyaw Kyaw , they need donated food to survive .
Thousands of homeless people across the devastated countryside in the south are living anywhere they can , in restaurants , Buddhist temples and ruined buildings , any place that offers a little shelter from the heavy rain that is expected over the coming days .
One family crouched like cave dwellers in the remains of their collapsed shop , where they had just enough space between the fallen roof and the floor to move around on their haunches .
Others scavenged in the rubble of destroyed and abandoned homes for usable pieces of wood and corrugated roofing .

Already poor , the eyes of many of the villagers were bloodshot and yellowing in wan , weary faces .
One mother who needed a rest from carrying her infant put him on the fallen roof of a house and gave him a small piece of a shredded bamboo wall to play with , as casually as she once would have put him on a chair .
By late Friday , it remained unclear what the military regime might allow by way of assistance , including help from the United States and other Western countries .
The generals have allowed several cargo planes carrying supplies from the United Nations and neighboring countries such as India and Thailand to land .
But the air shipments of food and medical supplies are tiny compared with the enormous need .

The U.N. stopped relief flights Friday after the regime seized all foreign aid .
The agency later announced that it would resume flights today .
In Washington , the White House announced that it had received approval from Myanmar to land a military C - 130 cargo plane loaded with relief supplies Monday .
However , Myanmar has not approved additional flights and has not agreed to allow U.S. relief assistance teams to enter the country .
The country ’s biggest port , officially known as Myanmar International Terminals Thilawa , would be a likely link if the regime has a change of heart and allows a large and sustained international aid effort .
The container port , near the mouth of the Yangon River , opened 10 years ago and is equipped with modern facilities that could efficiently unload relief supplies for delivery to the disaster zone by smaller boats , trucks and helicopters .

The port at Yangon , Myanmar ’s largest city , was heavily damaged in the weekend storm , and sunken vessels will make it difficult for large craft to maneuver safely for some time , officials say .
Local charities know that the affected people do n’t have time to wait for foreign governments to persuade the generals to allow outside help on the scale that is needed to avert another disaster from hunger and disease .
But their resources are limited .
Nearly 1,000 people who lost their homes moved into the Mandalay Beer Station , a state - owned roadside restaurant near here .
Their main meal Friday was a watery soup of boiled rice , fish sauce and onion shoots .
The servers ladling soup into tin cups and metal bowls on the beer hall ’s concrete steps slapped and shouted at children who dared to ask for second helpings .
Advertisement
An official watching the chaotic scene said he was afraid because the people had lost their sense of discipline .
They had to move out , he said , because they were making the restaurant dirty and his superiors would be angry .
When the official left , the survivors ignored his eviction order and moved back into the building .
In Kyat Inn , a village about four miles from the port , merchant San Win was handing out tins of condensed milk and small bags of rice to children , women and the elderly .
Advertisement
They stood , anxious but orderly , waiting as a man called out names written by hand in a school notebook .
Someone stepped forward for San Win ’s gift of food .
San Win was paying for the small relief effort out of her own pocket , she explained , because it would give her merits , which Buddhists believe will help them in their next life .
“ They ’re hungry , ” she said , reaching for another tin of milk as three boys stared up at her , pleading silently with their eyes .
“ I have to do something . ”

pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which matches the selection criteria .
pgrep ssh
- This will list all PIDs associated with the ssh process .
Execute The Last Executed Command
!!
This will execute the last command you used on the command line .
Is n't the UP arrow for that ?
The !!
command is very useful when you forget to start a command with sudo :
apt - get update
sudo !!
Execute The Last Command Starting With ...
If you want to execute a command from history starting with the letter S you can use the following :
!s
- This will execute the last command used on the command line that started with s .
Last Argument
You can use the last argument from the last command by refering to it as $_
so you only need to type a long path like this once :
cp assignment.htm /home/phill/reports/2008 /
cd $_
to go straight to the 2008 folder as well .
You can use this however you like .
Always the last argument of the command above .
Like using $ _ for the last argument of the last command , you can also hit ALT +. to quickly paste it at the cursor .
Run a Command Repeatedly and Display the Output
watch runs a command repeatedly , displaying its output .
This allows you to watch the program output change over time .
By default , the program is run every 2 seconds .
watch is very similar to tail .
watch -d ls -l
- This will watch the current directory for any file changes and highlight the change when it occurs .
Save Quickly in VI /VIM
Save and quit the file you ’re editing in vi by exiting insert mode , holding shift , and hitting z twice ( ZZ ) .
That is quick or not , it depends .
You can use :wq OR more easily :x

cd –
will take you to the last directory you were in .
Make Parent Directories the Smart Way
mkdir -p /home / adam / make / all / of / these/directories / will create all directories as needed even if they do not exist .
Why waste time doing something silly like : mkdir make ; cd make ; mkdir all ; cd all ; mkdir of ; cd of … you get the point .
Use mkdir -p !
This is one command I really lacked .
Delete the Entire Line
If you ’ve just typed a long string of commands that you do n’t need to enter anymore , delete the entire line by using : CTRL+U , K .
That is not easy .
CTRL+U deletes whatever is to the left of the cursor and CTRL+K deletes what is to the right .
If you are at the end of command , CTRL+U will do .
Especially if you start typing password and you make a mistake .
Alternatively , you can use CTRL+C , which discards the current typed command , and gives you a new line .
CTRL+L will clear the screen .
Set the Time stamp of a File
touch -c -t 0801010800 filename.c will show the time stamp as 2008 - 01-01 8:00 .
The format is ( YYMMDDhhmm ) .

Ha !
Finally completed comics for May .
Now to start on June .
Another update will be up shortly .
You watch the show every day , and you 're pretty sure you could hold your own against the contestants you see on TV .
Sure , there 's a chance you might make a fool of yourself in front of millions of people , but with thousands of dollars waiting to be won , you 're game .
Do you have a shot at it ?
Definitely !
But if you want to give yourself the best shot at getting on the show  and winning a bunch of cash  it makes sense to be prepared .
After all , you 'll probably never get to show off your knowledge on national TV again , so you should try to make the most of it .
Some people think you can't prepare for the Jeopardy audition , but that 's not true .
However , if you you plan to study seriously for the show over a period of many months ( as I did ) , there 's no sense in trying out until you feel ready for it .
If you pass , you might get called almost immediately for a taping two weeks from then  and a few weeks of cramming just wo n't be enough time .
Preparing for the Jeopardy test is about commitment .
It might take a year , or two , or even more , but the education will be more than worth the work .
And since Jeopardy has been on the air continuously since 1984 , and is still very popular , there 's a very good chance it 'll still be on a year or two from now .
Gauge yourself .
One of the most important ways to prepare for your Jeopardy audition is to start keeping score of your games .
There are two reasons for this .
First , it will enable you to chart your progress over time .
Second , it will get you used to the idea of responding to the clues selectively .
One sure - fire way to get into trouble on the audition or show is to ring in and make blind guesses at material you 're unsure about .
Keeping score , and trying to maximize your scores , will condition you to keep your mouth closed when it can hurt you most .
Here 's how to keep score : Before each show , take an index card and draw two six - by - five grids on it .
Write abbreviated names of the categories over each column .
When you get a question right , put a check mark in that square ; when you get one wrong , put an " X " ; if you pass on a question , put a dot in the square .
When the round is over , cancel out every X with a check mark of an equal value , and then add up the values that remain .
But do n't count the Daily Doubles ; treat them as regular clues .
Feel free to guess at them , and if you get one right , give yourself the value of the square ; if you 're wrong , count it as a pass .
I do n't believe in wagering at home because you want your score to accurately reflect your true performance in handling all of the material , and wagering on Daily Doubles puts too much weight on three of the 60 questions .
Do n't count Final Jeopardy toward your score , either ( although it 's a good idea to keep a moving average of how many Finals you get right ) .
It 's okay to give yourself a " rebound " check - mark if a contestant rings in and is incorrect , causing you to know the correct response ( provided of course that you did n't " ring in " the first time ) .
One more thing :
Be brutally tough on yourself when you 're scoring .
Give yourself the money only if you 're able to say the correct response before the contestant does .
Record your scores for at least two weeks , and average them ; this will give you a handle on where you stand performance - wise .
I estimate the typical Jeopardy contestant on the show would average around $ 24,000 if you adjusted for Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy and eliminated competition  in other words , if nobody were able to beat him or her to the buzzer .
Mathematically , a group of three players with more - or - less random overlap of knowledge  each able to answer $ 24,000 worth of material on his or her own  accounts for the average accumulated sum of $ 38,000 to $ 40,000 you see on the show ( on j- archive.com they call this the " combined Coryat " ) .
For a real challenge , measure yourself against this combined score  it's a humbling experience !
If you average under $ 16,000 ( I averaged about $ 12,000 when I began my training  which , back before they doubled the dollar values , was only $ 6,000 ) , you can either plunge in and take the contestant test again and again until you pass , or you can get to work to bring up your score .
( See below . )
If you can consistently score around $ 24,000 , you have a fairly good chance at passing the test , but it certainly would n't hurt to bring up that average .
If you can consistently score around $ 28,000 , I 'd say you have a very good chance of getting on the show , if you have any personality at all .
However , if you think you 're prone to stage fright or if pressure weakens your ability to think , or you 're just really ambitious , my advice is to overbuild your knowledge as much as possible .
( You just know most of those contestants on TV play better when they 're in their comfy living rooms . )
In that case , you might wait until your average is up to $ 32,000 or even $ 36,000 before you try out for real .
By the way , my at - home average was close to $ 36,000 ( $ 18,000 in 1996 dollar values ) by the time my episodes were taped  but do n't let that scare you .
I did it , and so can you .
Preparation .
You can take two approaches to studying for Jeopardy .
If you find yourself knowing most of the correct responses but have trouble coming up with them on time , you can concentrate on simply refreshing your knowledge .
If some of the material is foreign to you but you have a good long - term memory , you can learn a lot of the stuff from scratch .
( This is what I did . )
If you 're memorizing a lot of material , you should do it systematically , and you should frequently reinforce your new knowledge by reviewing it .
This can literally take years ; it is not possible to significantly improve your score through sheer memorization in only a month or two .
And even if you 're only refreshing old knowledge , you 'll find that when the moment of truth comes , the things that pop into your head the fastest are the ones you reviewed most recently .
The trick is to review , review , review .
In fact , I can not stress review enough .
At least half of your studying time should be spent reviewing " old " material .
It may not be very fun , but trust me  if anything can make you a Jeopardy champion , it 's reviewing what you already know .
( Note that it is possible to " already know " stuff that you first learned after you started your Jeopardy training  and the longer you study , the more of this material you 'll " already know . "
Also , if you 're reviewing diligently , the longer you study , the better you 'll know the material . )
In terms of material , there are a few things you absolutely must know .
These are , in rough order of importance : State and world capitals ; U.S. presidents ( order , years of office to within a half - decade , and general biographies ) ; state nicknames ; and Shakespeare 's plays , including basic plot lines and major characters .
How much you need to know about one thing depends on how significant that thing is , so you need to know more about Abraham Lincoln and Macbeth than Martin Van Buren and Titus Andronicus .
It 's a good idea to go through a book of biographies to learn about the lives of significant people , as this info makes up a huge amount of Jeopardy 's material .
For instance , did you know that Leonid Brezhnev 's background was in metallurgy , or that Albert Schweitzer was an organist ?
You also want to know all about the world 's major religions and currencies .
Later , you 'll want to learn which U.S. senators ( notable past and present ) come from which states , current and ( notable ) past cabinet members , major world leaders , and other similar fields where there 's a fairly finite set of information .
In addition , you should be as sharp as possible on history , geography , literature , mythology , artists , composers , religions , and languages .
These are the heavy - duty academic categories that make up much of the weight of the Double Jeopardy round .
If you 're weak in one of these areas , work on it , and your score will go up .
In most Jeopardy games , you 'll see a variation on literature , history , and geography in one or both of the rounds .
I 've noticed that Jeopardy gives certain countries more weight than others in its material .
These countries are ( roughly in order ) : the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , South Africa , Germany , France , Australia , Russia , Italy , Spain , India , Mexico , and China .
In terms of continents , North America comes first , followed by Europe , followed by South America .
I 've also noticed that Jeopardy rarely asks contestants for hard - to - pronounce foreign words or names .
For instance , they probably would n't ask for the " real " name of Canton , China  but if they said " Guangzhou , " you should know it 's the proper name for Canton .
In general , with regard to Jeopardy , there tends to be a " relevant direction " for any piece of information , and in many cases , you need to know only one " direction , " not both .
To use a couple of the above examples , Jeopardy would never ask what field Leonid Brezhnev studied in college , but they might say something like , " This former Soviet premier was originally a metallurgist . "
And they probably would n't ask you to name the current Secretary of Commerce , but they might give the cabinet member 's name and ask you to identify the department .
In these cases it 's easier to remember the more relevant " direction " ; spending the energy to memorize the opposite " direction " would be a waste .
When studying , read lots of books , and write down the material you might need to know .
Write lots of questions , and put them on flash cards or audio tapes for the car .
Look for general - knowledge reference volumes on cultural literacy , Americana , and the like .
Be wary of " trivia " books ; Jeopardy concentrates on culturally significant material and usually places " lightweight " subjects , such as show biz and sports , in the first round , where there 's much less money .
Trivia books do contain valuable material , but you have to search for it amidst a lot of unimportant stuff .
The best single book I found was a little paperback called On the Tip of Your Tongue by Irene M. Franck [ Signet ] ; it contained an astonishing amount of relevant material .
Unfortunately it 's no longer in print .
( Over the years people have tried to get me to send my copy to them ! )
Pocket encyclopedias are also valuable and are easy to read cover to cover .
Books containing one - paragraph biographies of prominent people , past and present , are great .
In general , avoid books that appear to have an agenda  where the content consists of what the author considers important , rather than what society as a whole considers important .
If you find a biographies book in which one - quarter of the listings are for world leaders of the past whom no one remembers , pass that book up in favor of one that weighs more on people who are still discussed and written about , even if they were n't as significant in their time .
For example , it would be much more useful to learn about Mary Mallon ( " Typhoid Mary " ) than the Chinese emperor from 565- 635 , Li Yuan ( okay , I had to look that up ) .
Jeopardy is not going to ask about Li ( unless they go in the direction of giving the name and asking for the empire , in which case it would be easy to guess ) , but Typhoid Mary  who remains a topic of interest  comes up all the time .
Getting a feel for " Jeopardy scope " is very important as you prepare .
For instance , Jeopardy would never ask for the atomic number of the element fermium , but they would definitely expect you to know who Enrico Fermi is  so you'd be wasting your time and energy by learning all the atomic numbers when you could be learning about prominent physicists .
In studying for Jeopardy , I found that while the amount of human knowledge is indeed virtually infinite , the amount of knowledge within the " Jeopardy scope " is actually surprisingly finite .
Here 's a model I dreamed up to explain this : Imagine you have a good education and a fair gathering of knowledge .
Now imagine your knowledge is a sphere , like a planet .
There are " shells " of knowledge surrounding that sphere , like layers of the atmosphere , each shell representing increasingly obscure or esoteric knowledge as you move away .
As you travel farther and farther outward from your sphere , the volume of knowledge contained within the shells increases geometrically , until you reach a point where the information becomes unmanagable .
Your job , as a Jeopardy hopeful , is to find the " shell " that separates possible Jeopardy material from the overly obscure stuff .
Believe me , these limits do exist , and if you can find them you 're halfway home to preparing for Jeopardy .
There 's another peculiarity about Jeopardy material that can be a big help :
You 'll notice recurring phrases that give away the correct responses to clues .
A lot of these consist of a nationality and an occupation .
For instance , if you hear " Chinese - American architect , " the correct response will probably be " Who is I.M. Pei ? "
Here are a few others : Swedish playwright = Strindberg ; Norwegian playwright = Ibsen ; Norwegian artist = Munch ; Danish astronomer = Brahe ; Polish composer = Chopin ( or Paderewski  be careful ) ; Finnish architect = Saaranin ; Finnish composer = Sibelius ; Indian conductor = Mehta ; Yugoslav tennis player = Monica Seles ; Czech tennis player = Navratolova ; Welsh poet = Dylan Thomas , etc .
Anytime they ask for a European Duchy , it 's Luxembourg .
A " nonsense poet " is usually Edward Lear .
An " ode poet " is almost always Keats .
A " Round Table wit " is surely Dorothy Parker .
A U.S. commonwealth is probably Puerto Rico .
( Virginia is also a commonwealth , but they 'll probably refer to Virginia as a state  although they might say , " This commonwealth state ... " )
If a poet is referred to as a " lord , " it 's probably either Byron or Tennyson  make an educated guess , perhaps based on the dates they give .
( Byron came before Tennyson . )
It helps a lot if you can read the clue quickly just after it 's revealed .
I found myself developing a skill where I could scan the clue quickly for an important element while I listened to Alex reading it .
I would scan for things like quotation marks ; in a Literature category , for instance , all you need is the name of the book , play , etc. , which is always contained within quotation marks .
If you find that title right away , you can spend the four or five seconds it takes Alex to read the clue to try to remember who wrote the work .
But you 've got to practice a lot and learn to keep your cool to get all of these skills to work right .
Record the Jeopardy broadcast and watch it religiously  once to play and keep score ( it 's okay to pause on the Daily Doubles ! ) , and a second time to study the structure of the clues and to write down the big - money material you need to know .
You 'll find that much of the same stuff , rephrased or dressed up differently , comes up again and again .
Try to get a really good feel for the scope of the big - money questions , and keep that in mind as you read and collect your material .
The audition .
Jeopardy now offers a preliminary online test as part of the audition process .
This is really just a screening step to weed out people , and it's a great idea , because in the traveling auditions the competition for spots is high ; before the online test , plenty of people who really should have been on the show were n't even able to audition .
The " real " audition consists of a 50 - question test , in 50 different categories , with some questions much easier than others .
If you pass the test ( you need to answer at least 35 right  sometimes more ) , you go on to play a mock game in front of the contestant coordinators , who watch you closely and take lots of notes .
If they like you , you 'll be placed in the pool of potential contestants for a year .
( It took me about five months to get called for the show . )
If a year goes by and you do n't get called , you can audition again .
The show will give you most of the information you 'll need for the audition , but I 'll give you a few pointers .
First , consider the audition a fun opportunity , not a day of reckoning that judges your worth as a person .
The contestant coordinators look for people who look like they 're having fun , not enduring a grueling ordeal .
Second , for God 's sake , do what the contestant coordinators say !
At my audition , about 20 people passed the test , and during the mock game , the staff kept saying , " Speak up !
Let 's see lots of energy !
Keep the game going ! "  and I was shocked to see most of the applicants mumbling , stalling , and being very unimpressive overall .
In retrospect , it was pretty clear who was going to get on the show and who was n't .
Finally , be nice , cheerful , and respectful to the contestant coordinators .
You do n't have to kiss their butts , but understand it 's your good impression that will get you on the show .
( To read one prospective contestant 's auditioning story , go here .
To read a story from a teen who got to the last stage of the Teen Tournament audition , go here . )
The show .
All the same things apply to preparing for the show that applied to preparing for the audition .
I did some additional things , like playing along at home with a bright light in my face , to simulate the studio lighting .
( This may have been a good idea , because the lights in the studio are somewhat distracting . )
If you can , play along at home with lots of people in the room ; this will put a little pressure on , and they 'll be impressed with your performance , which will help your confidence .
When you 're actually on the show , you really should play Jeopardy as a game and not an end - all competition .
I personally can't stand contestants who constantly dart their eyes over to the scoreboard to see how they 're doing .
In fact , many successful contestants claim they never knew where they stood score - wise until commercial breaks or Daily Doubles came around .
That 's because they were having fun playing a game , not getting emotionally wound up in every detail of their performance .
Here 's a devious trick I actually used successfully on Jeopardy :
When contestants are selecting a category , they 're allowed to abbreviate the category name to speed up play .
For instance , if the category is " Presidents ' Last Words , " you can just say , " Presidents . "
Now , with some categories , you can use this rule to confuse your opponents .
I had a category called " Crossword Clues M , " in which every correct response began with the letter " M , " but when I chose the category I would say only , " Crossword Clues for ( dollar amount ) . "
Unless they looked at the top of the category and read the full name of the category , my opponents were at a disadvantage , and I smoked them .
( Unfortunately , I ended up losing that game  so it did n't make me any money . )
Other abbreviations : Shorten " European Capitals " to " Capitals , " " 19th Century Authors " to " Authors , " etc .
Get the idea ?
A lot of people want to know about wagering .
I do n't have much to say in this regard .
My strategy was to bet big on Daily Doubles , which ended up helping me a lot , and to bet for the win on all Final Jeopardy questions , which ended up being my demise in game # 3 .
In retrospect , I would advise people to be a little more judicious than I was .
I had about an 80 % average on DD 's but only a 60 % average on FJ's , so it would have been wiser for me to be more cagey with my FJ wagers .
I was killed by the category Business & Industry , and looking back , I often got Business & Industry FJ 's wrong at home  so I should have bet less than I did .
Your mileage , as they say , may vary .
( I recommend Math For Jeopardy Players for some excellent info on Final Jeopardy wagering . )
The buzzer .
Everyone wants tips on how to beat the buzzer , the device that lets you ring in .
First , you have to understand how it works .
You can't see it at home , but on both sides of the game board are two lights that come on a moment after Alex finishes reading the clue .
When the lights come on , it 's okay for you to ring in .
If you ring in early , you 're locked out for a half a second , allowing someone else to ring in .
Therefore , you will want to push the buzzer repeatedly , so that in case you ring in early you 'll have a shot at the rebound .
If everyone rings in early , the clue goes to the person who pushes the button first after the half - second is up .
It 's not the best idea to wait for the lights to come on before you push the button , even if they tell you that 's what you should do .
The big winners learn to time their buzzers so they get in an instant after the lights come on .
Here 's how you can work on this :
Make yourself a mock buzzer .
( I made one out of a large ballpoint pen with the clicker removed . )
When you play along at home , you can get an idea of when the lights are coming on in the studio by when the camera cuts over  a contestant podium very often lights up a tiny fraction of a second later .
Try to coincide your " ringing in " with just the tiniest moment after the camera cuts over , without waiting and reacting to the camera cutting over .
The time when that happens depends on several factors , including the rhythm of Alex 's speech .
For me , the best way to practice the buzzer was to watch from the studio audience , where you can actually see those lights  so if as a contestant you get to watch several shows from the audience , you 'll have a small advantage .
I asked 1996 $ 100,000 Tournament Of Champions Winner Mike Dupeé to contribute to my page with some advice about the buzzer and how to ring in .
Read : How to Win on the Buzzer .
The payoff .
I made enough money on Jeopardy to put a down payment on my first home , and after a couple of refinances , my mortgage payment became low enough that I was able to semi-retire at age 37 .
Cool , huh ?
I must tell you , though , that never in the process was money a factor for me .
My real motivation was to get on TV and do something impressive in front of millions of people .
( It was either that or reciting π to the 100th decimal place on Letterman 's " Stupid Human Tricks " ! )
But almost immediately after I began studying for Jeopardy , I noticed something amazing : my knowledge was increasing in a really significant way .
No , learning the state birds wo n't change your life  but it seems I can't go five minutes these days without encountering something I learned from my Jeopardy experience , and that knowledge has broadened my understanding of the world and what people talk about .
Just flipping through the TV channels  the news might mention the Golan Heights ... a cooking show might mention carbonara sauce ... a nature show might take us to the Atacama Desert .
Before , the stuff would have been over my head .
Now , I 'm right there with it , and I have a perspective that gives it all meaning .
( Dennis Miller makes a lot more sense , too ! )
Studying for Jeopardy really did change my life  and if you tackle it with anything close to the effort I gave , it will change yours as well .

SurveyUSA is doing a series of McCain vs. Obama head to head match - up polls in different states testing an almost mystifying number of vice presidential possibilities for each nominee .
Their poll of Pennsylvania is out today .
And the snapshot is that John Edwards — someone who I do n’t think many have considered as a Veep possibility this year — is , from this poll at least , Obama ’s strongest pick .
The real headline though is the baseline number : McCain vs. Obama without veep nominees attached .
On that SurveyUSA has Obama beating McCain 48 % to 40 % .
And this , remember , was the nut Obama was n’t supposed to be able to crack .
You can see the range of possibilities here , which go from a very narrow McCain lead to an Obama landslide .
To be clear , I do not expect Obama to win Pennsylvania in a landslide .
I think it will be very tight .
But this is a potent corrective to the idea that Obama ca n’t win the state .
Late Update : TPM Reader SS makes the point — and one I agree with — that we should n’t read too much into the numbers for these different veep possibilities because a number of them have almost zero name recognition .
I would guess that very few people around the country have any idea who Pawlenty or Sebelius even are .
So , not that they mean nothing .
But I ’d see those as very mutable .
What is striking is that even plugging in a lot of names that a lot of people have never even heard of , the terrain seems to tilt heavily in Obama ’s direction .
Later Update : A good point from TPM Reader DR …
So it turns out that Sony did something right and it , along with a large consortium of supporting folks , won the format war .
Blu-ray is now the HD disc format pf choice , but even so , the data storage capability wo n't keep users happy indefinitely .
Some recent research from Northwestern University shows that much higher storage densities are possible using technology based on existing optical media .
The limiting factor is the area on which light can be focused , set by the diffraction limit .
Using conventional optics , light can only be focused to a spot that is about the same as the wavelength — for Blu-ray , the wavelength is about 405nm , and the spot size is about 580nm .
This means that the pits and landings that represent the data need to be a significant fraction of this size ( ~100 nm ) and be separated by a significant fraction of the spot - size as well ( 100 - 300nm ) .
This sets limits on the data density and , currently , the only way to overcome these limits is to layer the disc .
That can only go so far , as each layer has to reflect a significant amount of light so that the data can be read .
For instance , if each layer of a dual layer disc is 50 percent reflective , then the signal level can be expected to drop by a factor of four between two adjacent layers .
Recently , it was discovered that the interaction between light and a simple glass sphere has some really odd properties .
In particular , on the side opposite to the illuminating light , a very narrow and very bright stream of light , termed a photonic jet , exits the sphere .
Within a very short distance — on the order of a micrometer for a blue - light laser — the light stream begins to expand rapidly .
But very close to the sphere it has dimensions that are much smaller than the wavelength of light .
The researchers realized that if they placed the pits and landings within this narrow beam of light , they should be able to store data at much higher densities .
The researchers also realized that this would be difficult to test this using blue - light lasers because it would be very difficult to manufacture and align a suitable demonstration surface at the micron scale .
Instead , they did a proof - of - principle using microwave radiation , which has a wavelength of 10 millimeters .
The microwaves illuminated an acrylic sphere to create a photonic jet .
An optical disc was approximated via a polished aluminum plate that had pits and landings machined into the surface ; the plate was coated with the equivalent of the protection layer that comes standard on all optical media , making the whole device as close to a scaled - up optical drive as possible .
Their experimental results and modeling indicated that the light reflected from a pit was about 700 times weaker than from a landing , making the difference very easy to detect .
Furthermore , modeling results showed that the reflected signal varied strongly with pit depth , opening up the possibility of encoding additional data by pit depth .
Two big questions remain : how much more data can be stored , and can the reader be be scaled down ?
If scaled directly , the pits would be approximately 50 - 80 nm long , making the per-layer capacity a factor of two larger than current blu - ray discs .
However , the depth encoding could easily provide another two to four times the capacity .
Furthermore , this is the first experiment , so we can probably expect another factor of two to four from lessons learned during the development process — the optimist in me says that this could give us 30 times more data than a single layer disc .
The question of scaling is more tricky .
The sphere would be on the order of two micrometers in diameter , which is pretty easy to make .
However , the distance between the surface of the disc and the sphere would be only around 200nm , which would be very difficult to maintain while the disc was spinning .
If that problem can be addressed , then this technology would probably be a winner , particularly since it would be compatible with existing discs .

In testimony last week , Ben Bernanke told Ron Paul that the government created the Federal Reserve in 1913 to stop the " periodic financial crises " that erupted in the 19th Century and again in 1907 .
Bernanke , evidently , was counting on Paul holding the accepted view of the Fed 's origins , the one untainted by Wall Street - government conspiracy -- not the view meticulously presented in the works of Kolko , Rothbard , and Griffin , among others .
Perhaps he was also hoping none of us saw the CNBC Squawk Box interview with author / investor Jim Rogers a few weeks earlier .
Rogers , now living in Singapore , has done better - than - well under the Fed 's reign of the markets .
Given his success , one might expect him to say nice things about the Fed .
Here 's some of what he had to say :
Let 's talk first about your reaction to yesterday 's HUGE move in the market .
We had the Federal Reserve adding about $ 230 billion in liquidity , a 400 point move on the Dow . . .
What do you think ?
CNBC : Why is n't it good , Jim ?
What 's not good about 400 points on the DOW ?
Remember , that this is what the Federal Reserve did in the 1970s .
They just printed money .
We had huge recession .
We had huge inflation .
And then we had to bring in Paul Volcker and say , ' Solve the problem . '
He had to take interest rates to over 20 percent to solve the problem .
That 's what 's going to happen again . . . .
CNBC : What would be the first two things you would do if you were in Mr. Bernanke 's seat tomorrow morning ?
CNBC : How would this help the 300 million Americans that you say are n't being helped out by the Fed 's activities yesterday ?
CNBC : But Jim , absent of getting rid of the Federal Reserve , let 's talk about real solutions here .
. . .
The Fed itself was pushed as a ' real solution , ' but apparently any talk of getting rid of it should n't be taken seriously .
Big Bankers Wanted the Fed
We did have banking crises before the Fed , and various concerned parties were pushing for a central bank as a way of dealing with them .
They wanted to deal with them by making sure others paid and they profited .
There was also widespread concern about Wall Street 's concentration of power .
A congressional investigation called the Pujo Committee conducted hearings on the ' Money Trust , ' as it was called , for eight tedious months in 1912 and concluded that the banking system needed reforming because five banking firms were too big .
Together , the firms ' held 341 directorships in 112 corporations with an aggregate capitalization of over $ 22 billion , ' Kolko writes [ Triumph , p. 220 ] .
According to Griffin , ' the public was given the impression that Congress was really prying off the lid of scandal and corruption , but the reality was more like a fireside chat between old friends . '
[ Creature , p. 444 ]
No one was curious about why the biggest advocate of banking reform was the Money Trust itself .
Thus , banking reform arrived as the big banker - designed Federal Reserve System .
But it 's doubtful even the bankers saw the Fed 's full potential .
Shortly after its creation , it found itself in the war finance business .
Then it roughly doubled the money supply so the U.S. could intervene in a European war that had already killed five million people .
The government raised taxes as well but not enough to trigger a revolt .
Inflation of the currency covered most of the expenses , and as Keynes wrote after the temporary peace , ' not one man in a million ' could figure out the slick theft government had pulled off .
Actually , it 's likely that few of them even tried .
Obstacles to Entering the War
Before American entrance into the war , the Allies were about to default on the massive loans Morgan had made them with the help of his cherished Fed .
Only an Allied victory could prevent default , but that meant sending American boys overseas to join the carnage .
The warmongers faced two obstacles :
2. Paying for it .
Propaganda and government oppression of dissenters took care of the first ; the Fed , aided by the income tax , overcame the second .
One of Morgan 's partners expressed their goal starkly in the fall of 1914 :
In America [ at present ] there are 50,000 people who understand the necessity of the United States entering the war on [ England 's ] side .
But there are 100,000,000 Americans who have not even thought of it .
Our task is to see that those figures are reversed .
[ The Illusion of Victory : America in World War I , Thomas Fleming , p. 47 ; quoted from H.C. Peterson 's Propaganda for War : The Campaign Against American Neutrality ]
The Morgans attempted to reverse the figures by purchasing editorial control of 25 of the country 's most influential newspapers .
Griffin quotes from the Congressional Record :
The policy of the papers was bought , to be paid for by the month ; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness , militarism , financial policies , and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers .
[ Creature , p. 244 ]
Morgan 's enormous advertising expenditures supplemented their direct editorial control .
Funding the war had at least two aspects .
There was the Allied debt to Morgan that had to be covered , along with direct American expenditures .
Building and mobilizing an American Expeditionary Force requires money that for political reasons can only be partially provided through overt channels of appropriation .
Conscripting kids and rushing them through boot camp , then packing them sardine - style into ships for the voyage overseas , then trucking them to rat - infested trenches , then hauling them out when they 're dead , maimed , diseased , or finished killing -- all of that and much more requires funding that only a central bank , with its surreptitious form of theft , can provide without political repercussions .
War 's Silent Partner
The war was a lucrative racket for those pulling the strings of government .
On April 14 , 1917 , eight days after its declaration of war on the Axis powers , Congress passed the War Loan Act , extending $ 1 billion in credit to the Allies .
Of that amount , $ 200 million went to the British the next day , who immediately turned it over to Morgan in payment of debt .
Three months later the British were in debt to Morgan for $ 400 million , but when Morgan tried to collect it from Treasury Secretary McAdoo , he initially refused to pay .
At that point , the Fed stepped in .
Morgan 's appointee at the New York Fed , Benjamin Strong , who ran the Federal Reserve autocratically until his death in 1928 , simply created money and slipped it to McAdoo , who paid Morgan piecemeal for the duration of the war .
[ Creature , p. 258 ]
The Fed , in other words , bailed out Morgan during World War I , which in turn kept the war going -- i.e. , drove casualties and prices even higher .
But Morgan was only one of the beneficiaries .
At the recommendation of Cleveland Dodge , president of Rockefeller 's National City Bank , the little - known Bernard Baruch became chairman of the dictatorial War Industries Board .
Baruch and his Wall Street cronies who made up the board and its committees spent taxpayer money on war materials at a rate of $ 10 billion a year , fixing prices on a cost - plus basis .
The costs , as it turned out under subsequent investigation , were grossly padded .
. . . the total wartime expenditure of the United States government from April 6 , 1917 , to October 31 , 1919 , when the last contingent of troops returned from Europe , was $ 35,413,000,000 .
Net corporation profits from the period January 1 , 1916 , to July , 1921 , when wartime industrial activity was finally liquidated , were $ 38,000,000,000 , or approximately the amount of the wartime expenditures .
More than two - thirds of these corporation profits were taken by precisely those enterprises which the Pujo Committee had found to be under control of the ' Money Trust . '
[ Creature , p. 259 ; quote from America 's Sixty Families , Ferdinand Lundberg ]
Thus , Wilson 's intervention into the European war broke the stalemate , ended the possibility of a negotiated peace , and prolonged the killing until Germany surrendered unconditionally .
( And even after the armistice , the British kept blockading German ports so that German citizens would continue to starve -- and never forget . )
A few rich men became much richer , while millions of others went through hell .
And bankrolling much of it by debasing the currency was the Fed , the institution now under consideration for receiving even more power over our lives .
Getting rid of the Fed may not be a ' real solution , ' as the CNBC wits proclaim , but it is the only solution if we 're serious about ending inflation and its unforgivable consequences .
Lessing was once told the judges did not like her and she would never win Nobel Prize - winning author Doris Lessing has said winning the prestigious award in 2007 had been a " bloody disaster " .
The increased media interest in her has meant that writing a full novel was next to impossible , she told Radio 4's Front Row .
Lessing , 88 , also said she would probably now be giving up writing novels altogether .
Her latest book is the partly fictional memoir entitled Alfred and Emily .
Since her Nobel win she has been constantly in demand , she said .
" All I do is give interviews and spend time being photographed . "
Speaking about her writing , she said : " It has stopped , I do n't have any energy any more .
" This is why I keep telling anyone younger than me , do n't imagine you 'll have it forever .
" Use it while you 've got it because it 'll go , it 's sliding away like water down a plughole . "
Lessing is the 11th woman to win the Nobel Prize for literature in its 106 - year history .
Her best known works include The Golden Notebook and The Good Terrorist .
' Long deserved ' " Thank you does not seem enough when you 've won the best of them all .
It is astonishing and amazing , " she said at the time of winning .
She also recalled that , in the 1960s , she had been informed that the Nobel Academy 's judges did not like her and she would never win .
Ill - health prevented her from attending the prize ceremony in Stockholm , Sweden .
Instead the Swedish Ambassador to London , Staffan Carlsson , presented the award to her in the UK .
He told her she was being " crowned with a prize you have long deserved " .
Lessing was born in Iran and moved to Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe - as a child before settling in England in 1949 .
Her debut novel The Grass is Singing was published the following year .
Altogether she has written more than 50 novels , plays , memoirs and collections of short stories .
The Golden Notebook is considered by many to be a feminist classic , though Lessing has distanced herself from the movement .
Doris Lessing 's interview will be broadcast on Front Row on 12 May at 1915 BST on BBC Radio 4 .

Both Henson and the gallery owner Roslyn Oxley went to ground yesterday .
Henson is understood to be distressed by the planned charges .
In dramatic scenes , police took his pictures in packing cases to a truck outside the gallery .
The Rose Bay police commander , Superintendent Allan Sicard , told media there : " This morning police have attended the gallery and executed a search warrant and seized several items depicting a child under the age of 16 years of age in a sexual context . "
The Herald understands that previous Henson works are also being examined by the police .
Henson has been producing similar works for years without police intervention , and they have been lauded worldwide , as long ago as the 1995 Venice Biennale .
But police raided the gallery on Thursday night following a complaint .
It has emerged that complaint came from Hetty Johnston , of the child sexual assault advocacy group Bravehearts .
" I did make a complaint yesterday , absolutely , " Ms Johnston said .
" I asked them to prosecute , both the gallery and the photographer , but I 'd like to see the parents as well looked in to .
What parent in their right mind would allow their 12 - or 13 - year - old to strip off naked and display themselves all over the internet ?
That 's not in the interests of the child .
What 's happening here is that the arts community have felt that they 've been able to get away with this under the guise of art for a number of years , and I think this is the community drawing a line in the sand and saying , ' Enough 's enough ' . "
Earlier yesterday the gallery released a statement : " After much consideration we have decided to withdraw a number of works from the current Bill Henson exhibition that have attracted controversy .
The current show , without the said works , will be reopened for viewing in coming days . "
The Herald revealed details of the exhibition on Thursday , following an early viewing .
The photographs of naked children comprised about a third of the exhibition .
Most of the shots were taken from the waist up , though the genitals of the female model are visible in one image .
Politicians , including Kevin Rudd , condemned the exhibition , and talkback radio lines ran hot .
" I find them absolutely revolting , " Mr Rudd told the Nine Network .
" Whatever the artistic view of the merits of that sort of stuff - frankly , I do n't think there are any - just allow kids to be kids . "
But the prominent gallery owner Anna Schwartz said : " It 's a dark day for Australian culture in my view .
It is an indictment of a culture when an artist of the integrity and stature of Bill Henson is n't free to show his work . "
Although Henson could not be reached for comment yesterday , he told the Herald this week he had chosen to work with children at the beginning of puberty because they were " half in childhood , half in the adult world " and this " creates a floating world of expectation and uncertainty " .
He told the Herald in 2006 : " It 's an impossibly oversimplified notion , this ' loss of innocence ' .
It 's not like you cross a painted line on the floor ; it 's a progression . "
Henson 's work is held in the National Gallery of Australia , the High Court , and the Guggenheim in New York .

The suspect threatened to stab the owner of the jewellery
A thief stole a chain from a teenager on a tram in south - east London and then tried it on - checking his reflection in the CCTV camera lens , police said .
Officers said the suspect snatched the chain and a bracelet from a 16 - year - old boy in Bromley on 23 March .
The thief threatened to stab the boy , who got on the tram at Elmers End , when he tried to retrieve his jewellery .
The images were issued on Wednesday by British Transport Police ( BTP ) in an effort to track down the thief .
Det Con Dan Arundell said : " They were approached by a black male who demanded the victim show him the bracelet he was wearing .
" The suspect grabbed the bracelet and then grabbed the chain from his wrist .
He then asked if the necklace matched and grabbed that from the victim .
" The suspect is then captured on CCTV trying on the necklace and checking himself out in the reflection of the camera . "
The suspect fled the tram at Woodside tram stop .
Anyone with information is asked to contact British Transport Police on 0800 405040 or the Witness Appeal Line on 020 7391 5275 , quoting background log B10 of 10/06/08 .

BBC News in Beirut
Ehab al - Banna was tortured over nearly five years People rarely talk openly about torture in Lebanon ; even the victims are reluctant to speak out , much less seek treatment .
But a new centre in Beirut is trying to help those who have suffered at the hands of vicious interrogators and ruthless prison guards .
Centre Nassim , in the eastern part of the city , aims to rehabilitate victims of torture .
The idea is to bring everything people may need under one roof .
Here , they can get legal and financial advice .
They are also offered medical treatment for their physical and mental wounds .
Some of the people who come to the centre experienced cruel treatment in detention during the civil war in Lebanon , which ended in 1990 .
Others say they were tortured much more recently .
" There is nothing worse you can do than torture someone , " says Cynthia Petrigh , the director of the centre .
" But we are here to help the worst - off .
It 's so rewarding when you see a smile on the face of someone who has been through hell in detention . "
' Nobody gets justice ' Ehab al - Banna says he knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of brutal treatment in prison .
He was arrested in 1999 after clashes with the Lebanese army and held for four - and - a - half years .
" They gave us no food no water for three days , " he alleges .
" No sleep , no toilet , until we signed a confession .
They used electrical torture , water torture and they tied our hands behind our backs and lifted us . "
The centre calls for torture to end now that there is relative peace
He shows me some of the techniques he says were used against him .
On one occasion , he says , he was so badly beaten that he ended up in a coma for three days - something he still has not fully recovered from .
" It 's a very bad feeling " he says .
" You have this fear for the rest of your life .
They make you a very bad person in the eyes of society . "
I ask his lawyer Tarek Shindab about compensation .
He just laughs .
" Never - not in this country .
They will put you in prison again .
That 's it , " he says .
" Nobody ever gets justice for this . "
At the Centre Nassim , however , victims can get practical assistance .
Very often there is a link between the physical and mental effects of torture .
The psychological pain sometimes lasts the longest .
Rabih Chammaay , the psychiatrist at the centre , says that some of the victims tortured 20 years ago are still depressed .
There are also those newly released from jail , whose symptoms are slightly different .
" They are more agitated and anxious , " he explains .
Terror suspects
The first step for treating the victims is to get them to relax .
Selim al - Hilwee , a physiotherapist , tells me he often likes to use calming music and massage to help them open up and accept more specific treatment .
Massage helps victims relax and tackle their mental scars
The centre has only been open a few months , but the specialists employed here say they are already seeing positive results .
Lebanon signed up to an international convention against torture in 2000 , and in recent years legislation has given victims greater legal protection .
But according to human rights organisations , forms of torture are still widely practised .
Wadih al - Asmar , of the Lebanese Centre for Human Rights , says that the main issue in Lebanon is that the police think that torture is a method of interrogation .
" It 's a particular problem with cases of terrorism , " he says .
" Every time a terrorist is suspected , we suspect torture . "
The fact is that Lebanon probably has a better record on torture than many countries in the Middle East - but even here , it seems to have taken place much too frequently .
Only now are the victims starting to talk more openly about their experiences , and getting the help they need to recover .

The lights dimmed , the sold - out concert hall hushed and 4ft3in of shiny white metal clanked onto the stage .
The conductor , it seems , was ready .
" Hello , everyone , " it beeped and then waved to the Detroit Symphony to begin .
Scroll down for more ...
Maestro :
The ASIMO robot conducts the Detroit Symphony Orchestra
As the orchestra played the first chords of The Impossible Dream , the robot nodded its head at various sections and gestured with one or both hands .
It was a note perfect if passionless performance .
Not that the American audience seemed to care .
There were enthusiastic cheers as the robot took a bow .
Scroll down for more ...
You 're kidding : The Honda robot enters the stage to a chorus of smiles from the musicians
The robot , built by the Honda company , is known as ASIMO - which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility .
A spokesman for the company , which has incidentally used The Impossible Dream in some of its advertising campaigns , said it was the first time a robot had conducted a live performance .
Engineers had simply programmed it to mimic the conductor .
But it cannot respond to the musicians .
For example , during a rehearsal , the orchestra lost its place when the robot slowed the tempo , something a human conductor would have sensed and corrected .
Barack Obama , as he introduces himself to the broader voting public , is emphasizing centrist -- even conservative -- positions on hot - button issues .
In recent weeks , he toughened his stance on Iran and backed an expansion of the government ’s wiretapping powers .
On Wednesday , he said states should be allowed to execute child rapists .
When the Supreme Court the next day struck down the District of Columbia ’s ban on handguns , he did not complain .
These views would fit many Republican candidates , but they are the recent profile adopted by a man who has been called the most liberal Democrat in the Senate .
In the primary season , candidates ’ chief goal is usually to win their party ’s most ideologically driven voters ; afterward the candidates often adjust their policy stances .
John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , has also changed tack on an array of issues .
But Obama has drawn attention for the number of issues on which he has taken a moderate stance in recent days .
Advertisement
“ I ’ve been struck by the speed and decisiveness of his move to the center , ” said Will Marshall , president of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute .
At the same time , Obama has proposed a host of government spending initiatives that give Republicans plenty of ammunition to brand him a liberal .
And they cite his ranking by National Journal magazine -- called misleading by Obama ’s aides -- that identified him as having the most liberal voting record in the Senate in 2007 .
But other recent moves by Obama chart a more moderate course .
He disagreed with this week ’s Supreme Court decision barring the death penalty for child rape , saying that states should be able to impose such a penalty for “ heinous ” crimes .

Obama has long supported the death penalty , but he has also expressed doubts about whether it ’s an effective deterrent and applied fairly .
Obama ’s reaction to another Supreme Court ruling , which struck down a gun ban in Washington , D.C. , stood in contrast to that of many local political leaders and was more tempered than that of many liberals .
Whereas his hometown mayor , Richard M. Daley of Chicago , and Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton sharply criticized the court decision , Obama was more welcoming .
He said the ruling “ reinforces that if we act responsibly , we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe . ”
Meanwhile , after calling the North American Free Trade Agreement a “ big mistake ” during the primary season and saying it should be renegotiated , Obama has recently toned down his rhetoric and emphasized his record of support for free trade .
He also angered many union and liberal activists by naming a chief economic advisor who has extolled the virtues of globalization .
Facing criticism that he may be too willing to negotiate with Iran , Obama in a recent speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee took a tough line on protecting Israel against Iran .

This month , he announced that he would opt out of the public financing system for presidential elections , continuing to raise money from private donors , rather than adhere to the spending limits that come with it .
Earlier , he had pledged to take public funds if his GOP opponent did .
And Obama endorsed a compromise wiretapping bill despite stiff opposition from liberal activists .
MoveOn.org , the liberal online activist group , asked its members to flood Obama ’s campaign office with phone calls and e-mails urging him to support a filibuster of the bill .
The changes carry some risk that Obama will diminish the image he has sought to build as a new type of leader who will change how Washington conducts business .
McCain and other Republicans have used his recent policy statements to argue that Obama is a traditional politician , unwilling to take clear stands on tough issues and abandoning his principles when he finds it advantageous .
For example , McCain ’s campaign said Obama was unable to give a clear account of whether he viewed the Washington gun ban as constitutional , an issue on which Obama and his campaign have given mixed signals .
And when Obama announced that his campaign would not take public funding , McCain ’s spokeswoman accused him of failing to stand by his principles .

But Bill Burton , an Obama spokesman , said the Illinois senator ’s record has been consistent , not tilting to the center for political purposes .
“ He ’s committed to making decisions he thinks are right , ” said Burton .
“ He ’ll continue to do that as president . ”
Some analysts say the moves amount to smart politics , showing that Obama is not chained to his party ’s most devoted liberals .
“ If Obama does n’t do what MoveOn wants , it will show some degree of independence , ” said Thomas Mann , a political analyst at the Brookings Institution .
“ He ’s a good politician .
He ’s doing all he can to make sure people know he would govern as a post - partisan moderate , ” said Matt Bennett , a policy analyst with Third Way , a Democratic centrist think tank .
While Obama is making a play for centrist voters , McCain ’s strategy seems more geared to pinning down his party ’s conservative base , as he has steadily tacked to the right on a range of issues .
Advertisement
He has abandoned or downplayed views on which his reputation as a maverick are based : his opposition to President Bush ’s tax cuts , his liberal approach to handling illegal immigrants and his opposition to offshore oil drilling .
McCain is bringing his campaign agenda in line with party orthodoxy because many conservatives still view him with suspicion due to past departures from core GOP positions .
His burden is to mobilize a party that is fractured and seemingly unenthusiastic about its standard - bearer .
Eddie Mahe , a McCain supporter and former GOP official , said that McCain has to position himself for conservatives “ in a way that provides them a motivation and incentive to vote . ”
Last week , McCain reversed course and announced that he supports offshore oil drilling .
On tax policy , McCain has come to support an extension of Bush ’s tax cuts .
What ’s more , he has proposed additional cuts in corporate tax rates and other business breaks .
Advertisement
He has backed away from supporting an immigration plan that conservatives loathed because it offered a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants already in the country .
Despite those adjustments , many in McCain ’s party seem lukewarm about his candidacy .
A Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll found recently that 45 % of those who planned to vote for McCain said they would do so with enthusiasm .
By contrast , 81 % of Obama voters said they were enthusiastic .
But Mahe said the Arizona senator would pick up support among conservatives as they learn more about Obama ’s record .
“ The best shot they have to motivate the base , ” he said , “ is to get people to see how liberal he is . ”

With an Irish " No " to Lisbon , others should continue the ratification process and European leaders keep focus on how to make the EU an effective global player .
It 's deja vu all over again " , as the U.S baseball player Yogi Berra said .
With low turn - out and with an energetic " No " campaign , Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty , much like they rejected the Nice Treaty seven years ago .
European leaders must think hard about ways to salvage the foreign policy ideas in the Treaty .
The rejection of the Lisbon Treaty will pose a considerable headache for Europe 's leaders , who negotiated the accord after the rejection of the European Constitution by French and Dutch voters .
Even though things are not as dire as they were in 2001 - when the Nice Treaty was seen as necessary for the Union 's expansion - the Irish vote is likely to hobble the EU for a time .
The French EU Presidency , which starts in July , would be focused entirely on the issue , as would that of the Czech Republic .
Real business is likely to be pushed aside and a new bout of Euro - pessimism could set in .
To keep all options open , the remaining eight countries that have yet to ratify the Lisbon Treaty should do so .
This does not amount to ignoring the Irish , but keeps the door open for a number of different solutions and respects the democratic will of those countries who have ratified the treaty ( however they have chosen to do so ) .
If it turns out that the Lisbon Treaty , however amended and with whatever concession offered to Ireland , is dead , European leaders should ensure that one of the main ideas behind the Treaty - to make the EU a more effective foreign policy player - is saved .
The treaty is the product of an EU institutional reform process which stretches back to 2001 .
In 2001 , the EU states declared that the recently concluded Amsterdam ( 1997 ) and Nice ( 2001 ) Treaties still left the EU with an inadequate institutional framework .
Foreign policy was seen as a key deficiency and in the Lisbon Treaty a number of ideas survived from the Constitutional Convention , including a permanent President of the Council , an EU Foreign Minister ( EUHR ) in all but name and the eponymously - named External Action Service ( EAS ) .
The prominence given to external affairs in the Treaty led some people to argue that it would provide a new narrative for the EU , one that puts the onus not only domestic matters , but on Europe 's international responsibilities .
David Miliband , Britain 's chief diplomat , talks of a " Global Europe " and eighty - eight percent of Europeans agree that the EU should take greater responsibility for dealing with global threats .
But a global outlook for Europe is not a matter of choice ; it is a matter of necessity .
The EU - 27 are a group of medium - sized countries with a time - bound , out - sized influence in the world .
Unless the EU finds ways to collaborate more effectively , Europe 's influence and power in the world will decline .
This will have repercussions not only for Europeans but for others too .
Europe is , and will remain for many years , the staunchest supporter of the norms and rules upon which a progressive multilateral system rests .
For this reason , European leaders should think about ways of improving the Union 's foreign policy instruments .
Many of the necessary changes could probably be created without the Treaty and through Council and Commission decisions .
Commission chief José Manuel Barroso introduced the concept of several Vice - Presidents of the Commission .
Lawyers need to find out whether he could appoint the High Representative for CSFP as the RELEX Commissioner and a Vice - President ?
Even though the External Action Service was created in the Treaty , what is to stop a double - hating of every staff member in RELEX and the Council Secretariat ?
Lawyers need to find out .
Other ideas ( that were not in the Treaty ) include appointing a high - level Climate Envoy ; establishing a Climate Embassy in California ; double - hatting the EU counter - terrorism ‘ czar ' as a Deputy High Representative for CSFP so as to give the portfolio an external dimension and staff ; setting - up a network of Security and Justice Attaches in select EU delegations to work on security assistance ; and so on .
The Irish voters have to be respected , but the EU must find a way to accommodate this respect with equal amounts of respect for the clear will in many other countries for the Lisbon Treaty and the EU 's machinery to improve .
The best way to do so is for those countries who have not yet ratified the Lisbon Treaty to do so .
If worse comes to worse , European leaders should ensure that there is no let up in efforts to make the EU a more effective foreign policy player .
In Krieg und Kapitalismus Werner Sombart , a German economist , wrote " again out of destruction a new spirit of creativity arises " .
Let us hope that this is what happens when EU leaders meet to discus the Irish referendum .

CONSIDERING it is a business that has provoked wars in centuries past , scant attention is paid to the modern slave trade .
But one way to track the trade in people is the recently released annual report on trafficking in persons from America 's State Department .
And it makes for gloomy reading .
Though there have been improvements of late , the numbers of people involved are still appallingly high .
Approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders each year and millions more are traded domestically .
The International Labour Organisation estimates that there are at least 2.5 m people in forced labour at any one time , including sexual exploitation , as a result of trafficking .
Efforts to wipe out this modern slave trade are hampered because human trafficking is a big business .
It is impossible to know the exact sums involved but recent estimates of the value of the global trafficking trade have put it as high as $ 32 billion .
The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking describes it as a high - reward and low - risk crime .
People come cheap and many countries lack the necessary laws to target traffickers , or they are not properly enforced .
Worse still , it is often the victims of the traffickers that are treated as criminals .
Women suffer most in this respect : the report estimates that 80 % of victims of international trafficking are women forced into some form of prostitution .
Women are involved in trafficking too , though this is less common .
In Europe and Central and south Asia women are often recruited by other women who were themselves the victims of trafficking .
In part to avoid detection by the authorities , traffickers grant victims limited freedom while simultaneously coercing them to return home to recruit other women to replace them .
The report also casts a light on the increasingly important role that technology is playing in the trade , both in combating it and its perpetration .
The internet helps to identify and track down the perpetrators but increasingly it is becoming part of the problem .
Chatrooms are used to exchange information about sex - tourism sites ; people are targeted through social - networking sites where pornographic records of sex trafficking are also bought and sold ; victims are ensnared through instant messaging .
There are a few bright spots .
Ethiopia is commended for its efforts to combat the trafficking of children by establishing child - protection units across the country .
Romania 's creation of a national database to identify and respond quickly to trends in trafficking is also praised as is Madagascar 's campaign to wipe out sex tourism .
The report ranks countries into 3 tiers determined by how compliant they are deemed to be with America 's Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 .
Predictably , some countries listed in tier 3 , the worst offenders , have responded to the accusations with outrage .
But these are not the only countries that have a problem .
There is also “ special watch list ” of tier - 2 countries that need careful monitoring .
The foreign ministry of Cuba , a country the report places in tier 3 , firmly denied that the report had any value and used the opportunity for a customary jibe at America , saying that “ the government of the United States has a lot to do in its own country to combat the rampant phenomenon there of prostitution , sexual exploitation , forced labour and the trafficking of people . ”
Of the six Gulf states , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and Saudi Arabia were listed as Tier 3 and Bahrain crept up to the tier - 2 watch list .
Only the United Arab Emirates made it to tier 2 on the basis of its efforts to combat abuse against foreign domestic servants and construction workers .
Foreign ministers from the Gulf Co-operation Council simply said that the information in the report was wrong .
They claim that America “ aims to practise unjustified pressure for political ends ” .
And there is some evidence they could use to back up this assertion .
One country exempt from the rankings is America itself .
Self - analysis is always difficult but the report , though comprehensive , might have more force if America were to turn the spotlight fully on itself .

" Yes , " Jake adds , " it returns a literal char* , which is then cast to an STL string on the function return , which is then cast to a c_str in the comparison , which is finally compared with strstr ( ) .
All this for a Boolean ! "
" Good thing they only check whether the return string contains ' ERROR ' and not any of the various misspellings of SUCCESS .

Under Hillary Rules , Clinton counts the popular vote in Michigan , where she was the only major candidate on the ballot .
Clinton playing by her own set of rules
Hillary Clinton leads Barack Obama in the popular vote , and this is her path to victory .
She will ultimately win the Democratic nomination by convincing the superdelegates that her popular vote lead makes it legitimate for them to support her .
It gives them the cover they need to deny Obama a nomination that he otherwise would have won .
Advertisement
What ’s wrong with this picture ?
First , Clinton does not lead Obama in the popular vote .
It is a fantasy .
Second , the people she most needs to convince that this fantasy is true are the people least likely to believe it .
Let ’s first deal with Clinton ’s fantasy lead in the popular vote .
“ I ’m very proud that as of today , I have received more votes by the people who have voted than anyone else , ” Clinton said the day after her victory in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary .
But has she really ?
No .
Not really .
Not unless you throw out the existing rules of the Democratic Party and invent a new set of Hillary Rules .
Under Hillary Rules , Clinton counts the popular vote in Michigan , where she was the only major candidate on the ballot .
The Democratic Party does not recognize those votes .
Under Hillary Rules , Clinton also counts the popular vote in Florida , where candidates were forbidden to campaign .
The Democratic Party does not recognize the results of the Florida primary , either .
Under Hillary Rules , Clinton throws out the “ votes by the people who have voted ” in the states of Iowa , Nevada , Maine and Washington , because those were caucus states , where popular vote tallies were not officially kept and where , by the way , Obama won three out of the four contests .
Under Hillary Rules , Clinton gets to choose the contests that help her , throw out the contests that do not and declare herself the winner .
Steve Kornacki of The New York Observer did an excellent , detailed story last week on Clinton and the popular vote , going through a number of different scenarios and projections for the contests that remain .
His conclusion : “ The point is that under the most basic and probably the fairest criteria — simply counting every state and U.S. possession where there was a legitimate primary or a caucus where popular votes were tallied —
Obama will finish the primary season hundreds of thousands of votes ahead of Clinton . ”
But , hey , he ’s a journalist , and journalists do n’t count .
Only the superdelegates count now , and this is where Hillary must win .
Which is her real problem .
As I have previously pointed out , 56 percent of all superdelegates are members of the Democratic National Committee itself , and the DNC represents the largest bloc of delegates who have not yet committed to a candidate .
Am I saying that the DNC , the ultimate insiders , could decide who the Democratic nominee is ?
Yes , that is exactly what I am saying .
Why is this a problem for Clinton ?
Because more than anybody , DNC members know that the popular vote does n’t count , even though Clinton says it does .
The DNC made the current rules .
If it had wanted a national primary , a day on which all Democrats across the land would vote and choose the nominee ( a legitimate idea ) , it would have created such a system .
But the DNC created a different system , one in which pledged delegates — selected from legitimate primaries and caucuses — and superdelegates get to select the nominee .
OK , but let ’s say you got the DNC members really , really drunk ( not an outrageous scenario ) and convinced them that the popular vote ought to count .
Could you then convince them that counting Michigan and Florida makes sense ?
No way .
For starters , the DNC is the group that declared Michigan and Florida rogue states in the first place .
Do you really think the DNC is now likely to accept the popular vote count from those states ?
Second , to make Clinton ’s popular vote fantasy work , you have to throw out the votes in legitimate caucus states such as Iowa .
The DNC turns its back on Iowa ?
As if .
Lastly , there is the big picture :
Will the DNC really overturn the choice of the pledged delegates and substitute Clinton as the nominee over Obama ?
I doubt it .
First and foremost , DNC members care about the party and its future .
So ask yourself :
Is the DNC going to shatter the party by telling black voters and young voters that their votes in legitimate primaries and caucuses do not count ?
Clinton can try to make up her own set of rules , but that does n’t mean they are going to rule the DNC or the day .
By Yue Shan , Trend Magazine ( Hong Kong , in Chinese ) , Via the Epochtimes , May 27 , 2008 -
The People ’s Liberation Army conducted its first - ever concurrent military exercise operation to simulate a nuclear war .
The maneuvers were conducted from midnight April 26 through midnight May 15 , 2008 .
Operation ’08- weiguo-20 ′
Military exercises simultaneously conducted in northern , middle , southwestern , and northwestern China were part of an operation code - named “ 08 - weiguo - 20 .
” This was the first organized military exercise operation of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) occurring after its 17th Congress and the 11th plenary session of the Political Consultative Conference .
According to a high - ranking military official , judging from the scale of the engagement of the combined armed forces , the degree of sophistication of equipment , war strategy simulation , time , environment , and international concerns , the impact and significance of this exercise surpassed a military operation conducted by the regime in the spring and summer of 1996 .
Four Parts of the Exercise
The military exercise consisted of four parts :
1 ) Integration of conventional weaponry in actual combat maneuvers
2 ) Testing the military tactics and strategies of high - level commanders with hi-tech criteria , in a simulated , complex , and intense war environment
3 ) Examination and assessment of actual state - of - the - art equipment and weaponry vis-a - vis the criteria of new military strategies and tactics
4 ) Simulation of nuclear and laser war
Guo Boxiong , deputy chairman of the military commission , was the commander - in - chief of this military project .
The vice commanders were Liang Guanglie and Chen Bingde .
Other commanding officers included Liao Xilong , Chang Wanquan , Ge Zhenfeng , Wu Shengli , Xu Qiliang , and Jing Zhiyuan .
Over 30 observation groups conducted on - site research .
These groups were drawn from every division of the armed forces , including the seven major military bases , military schools , military science departments , and military equipment research and manufacturing units .
Considerations of the Central Military Commission
The Central Military Commission presented considerations for this military operation , consisting of “ four adaptations , five problems to resolve , and one preventative measure . ”
The four adaptations concerned :
1 ) Adapting to new technology and regional wars
2 ) Adapting to fighting in a multi-faceted , modern war of attrition ( a style of war that has never been officially disclosed )
3 ) Adapting to surprise attacks by high - tech destructive military groups
4 ) Adapting to attacks by nuclear weapons and counterattack battles
While inspecting a military base near Beijing and Tianjin , Commander - in - Chief Guo said : “ First , we need to presume the likelihood of war , so we wo n’t be in a passive mode when war commences .
We need to know more about high - tech weapons , be familiar with , and be able to incorporate various military tactics under complex , threatening , and uncertain situations . ”
The five problems to resolve :
1 ) Lack of expertise on war and counterattack war
2 ) Troops lacking understanding of war and equipment , strength of will , and vigilance
3 ) Troops which are disorganized , undisciplined , unrestrained , and disobedient
4 ) Knowledge of modern and high tech war tactics ( superceding outdated knowledge )
5 ) Lack of knowledge and technical expertise handling and maintaining high - tech equipment and weaponry
Guo pointed out in a high - level military conference : “ Living a peaceful , materially abundant life has made our high - ranking military commanders fearful of going to war : moreover , with the prospect of high - tech destructive wars , this is a hidden problem in building up the military .
To eliminate hidden problems is a key objective .
One preventative measure :
To prevent the degeneration of the military .
The perception prevailed that going against the Party ’s leadership in difficult times or during developmental periods would contribute to political crisis and the weakening of the military substrate .
The Exercise Listed Over 200 Issues To Be Resolved
Another goal and mission of this military exercise was to solve problems exposed in maneuvers in recent years .
Ten categories presented 270 problems requiring resolution , 75 percent of which involved the use of tactics and weapons .
The commanding officers ’ poor knowledge of modern military affairs has been assessed as a hidden danger and critical in building a modernized military and national defense .
Primary Focus of the Military Exercise : To Simulate Nuclear War
The unique feature that distinguished this military exercise from others was the simulation of nuclear war .
An attack and counterattack sequence was staged inside the Hongshagang underground military base in the Jinchang region of Gansu Province , and the Aerjinshan underground military base .
The nuclear bombs used in the simulation had the power of about 1/500 of that of the bombs used in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Chen Bingde , general chief of staff , and Jing Zhiyuan , a commanding officer , were present to supervise .
This simulation was the main focus of this military exercise .

Norway ( TGW ) StatoilHydro , a Norwegian oil company , has announced plans for the first offshore floating wind turbine .
The 2.3 - megawatt , $ 80 million turbine , a Siemens machine that is 65 meters high , will sit atop a buoy tied down by three anchors .
There are currently many offshore wind turbines and wind farms , but this would be the first one that floats like an oil rig .
These turbines have the advantage of having the ability of being far out at sea and allay the NIMBY ( Not In My BackYard ) problem .
It will be tested starting in 2009 off the coast of Norway .

How is the Iron Man suit made ?
We admire the result in the movie ( still number one this week at the box office ) ; the comic book version states that the Iron Man suit circuits were created using a process called biological circuit fabrication :
" Micro - Scale suit tiles fabricated by genetically engineered metal affinity bacteria which assemble themselves in specific orderly arrays , then expire , leaving behind various metallic deposits which form all the metal shapes and microscopic circuits . "
Now , a group of scientists led by Michael Sussman , director of University of Wisconsin , Madison 's Biotechnology Center , and oceanography professor Virginia Armbrust of the University of Washington , are seeing if diatoms will help make even smaller integrated circuit chips by a similar process of biological fabrication .
Diatoms are unicellular algae ; they form a unique shell , called a frustule .
They work hard to make human life possible ; they produce about a third of the world 's oxygen .
Their cell walls - the shell - is created from silicon dioxide , or silica .
Sussman 's interest in diatoms is based on the fact that diatoms are capable of creating lines of silica much smaller than present chip manufacturing processes can make out of silicon .
Sussman and Armbrust 's group have been working with the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana .
Armbrust previously led the effort to sequence T. pseudonana 's genome in 2004 .
The group has identified 75 genes that are used in the diatom 's silica bioprocessing , and they hope to use genetic manipulation to use diatoms to draw lines on computer chips .
" If we can genetically control that process , we would have a whole new way of performing the nanofabrication used to make computer chips , " says Sussman .
Biological circuit fabrication is not the only " comic book " technology that real - life scientists are trying to bring to life .
Researchers in Germany are working on spinning webs like Spiderman and an American firm is working on blast - resistant fabrics like a superhero suit .

That morning coffee is just the thing to get the brain in gear and the body moving .
But it turns out that just the aroma of coffee also gets some of our genes up and at ‘ em .
That ’s according to research in the June 25th issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
The authors report that a sniff of coffee turns on several genes in the brain in ways that help diminish the impact of sleep deprivation .
In rats , at least .
Rats that were stressed by lack of sleep were exposed to the smell of coffee .
Seventeen different genes got activated in their brains .
And thirteen of them produced proteins known to protect nerve cells from the damaging effects of stress .
While there have been numerous studies analyzing the health impact of the ingredients ingested when drinking coffee , the researchers say that this is the first study to examine the effects of coffee ’s aroma .
So maybe you do n’t have to shell out that four dollars for the latte — just walk by the counter …[ old TV ad : “ smell the honest coffee smell , ahhh , smell it ! ” ]

( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton rode the momentum of her Pennsylvania win into Indiana on Wednesday , with her campaign saying it is on pace to raise $ 10 million in 24 hours .
Clinton reported raising $ 20 million in all of March , according to campaign finance reports filed last weekend .
Sen .
Barack Obama raised more than twice as much last month , taking in $ 41 million for his campaign .
Obama 's camp touted a big boost for his campaign Wednesday : endorsements from 49 John Edwards supporters .
Edwards , a former North Carolina senator who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race in January , has yet to endorse a candidate .
Indiana and North Carolina hold primaries May 6 , the next date on the primary calendar in what has become a protracted and , at times , bruising fight for the Democratic nomination .
Obama is leading in North Carolina , and it's a tight race in Indiana , according to recent polls .
Both Democratic candidates picked up superdelegates Wednesday , with Obama getting the support of Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry and Clinton receiving a nod from Tennessee Rep. John Tanner .
Clinton and Obama both planned to stump in Indiana on Wednesday , following Clinton 's decisive win in Pennsylvania .
She beat Obama by 10 points .
With the win , Clinton will pick up 81 of Pennsylvania 's 158 delegates , and Obama won 69 , CNN estimates .
Eight delegates have yet to be allocated .
The New York senator said Wednesday that her much - needed victory raises fresh questions about Obama 's electability .
Obama downplayed Clinton 's win , saying " it 's important for people to keep things in perspective . "
" We have won the white - , blue - collar vote in a whole bunch of states ... and if we had a demographic problem in Pennsylvania , it was that it's an older state than a lot of states , and it is true that Sen.
Clinton has some strong support among voters over 60 , " he said on Roland Martin 's radio show .
Listen to the interview »
Clinton argued that the " tide is turning " as a result of her Tuesday victory .
Watch Clinton question Obama 's appeal »
" I won that double - digit victory that everybody on TV said I had to win , and the voters of Pennsylvania clearly made their views known , that they think I would be the best president and the better candidate to go against Sen. McCain , " referring to the presumptive Republican candidate , John McCain of Arizona .

" Clearly , [ Obama ] outspent me again in Pennsylvania , 3 to 1 , and we roared back with a tremendous grass - roots campaign and millions of people turning out to vote and favoring me by a big margin .
...
The fair question is , if you can't win the states we have to win in the fall , maybe that says something about your general - election appeal , " she said .
Clinton has scored wins in the large states of California , New York , Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania as well as in the Florida primary , which violated Democratic party rules because it was held at the end of January .
Obama , however , has won more state primaries and caucuses than Clinton and leads her in the overall delegate count as well as the popular vote , despite her win Tuesday night .
Obama leads Clinton 1,719 to 1,586 , CNN estimates .
Call the races and see how the delegates add up »
Neither candidate can capture the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination with wins in the remaining Democratic contests , meaning the party 's superdelegates will probably decide who gets the Democratic nomination .
Clinton and her backers have argued that the superdelegates should vote for her over Obama , despite his lead in the delegate count and the popular vote , because she is the more electable candidate in a general election .
Clinton won Tuesday by holding on to the core group of voters who have fueled her previous victories .
She won a majority of female voters , voters over the age of 45 and white voters .
And , in a troubling sign for the Obama camp , only 50 percent of Pennsylvania voters who picked Clinton said they would vote for Obama if he was the Democratic nominee , but 26 percent said they would vote for McCain .
Nineteen percent of Clinton 's Pennsylvania supporters said they would not vote in the fall if she was not the Democratic nominee .
Obama 's inability to cut into Clinton 's support among those groups may raise some concerns on whether he could win those groups if he became the Democrats ' nominee .
Speaking to supporters in Evansville , Indiana , on Tuesday night , Obama dismissed questions about his ability to cross racial , gender and generational boundaries .
" We can continue to slice and dice this country ... or this time , we can build on the movement we started in this campaign , a movement that 's united Democrats , independents , Republicans , young , old , rich , poor , white , black , Hispanic , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , " he said .
" Because one thing I know , from traveling 46 states this campaign season , is that we are not as divided as our politics suggest . "
" Now , it 's up to you , Indiana . ...
You can decide whether we 're going to travel the same worn path or whether we will chart a new course that offers real hope for the future , " the Illinois Democrat said .

Marijuana contains an amazing chemical , beta - caryophyllene , and scientists have thoroughly proven that it could be used to treat pain , inflammation , atherosclerosis , and osteoporosis .
Jürg Gertsch , of ETH Zürich , and his collaborators from three other universities learned that the natural molecule can activate a protein called cannabinoid receptor type 2 .
When that biological button is pushed , it soothes the immune system , increases bone mass , and blocks pain signals – without causing euphoria or interfering with the central nervous system .
Gertsch and his team published their findings on June 23 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
They focused on the anti-inflammatory properties of the impressive substance – testing it on immune cells called monocytes and also in mice .
Since beta - caryophyllene seems to be powerful , occurs naturally in many foods , and does not get people high , it could turn out to be a nearly ideal medication .
The organic compound is also phenomenally cheap .
Sigma Aldrich sells it , in kosher form , for forty - two dollars per kilogram .
Unfortunately , big pharmaceutical companies tend not to seek FDA approval for natural chemicals , and most doctors are reluctant to prescribe drugs that have not received a green light from the regulatory agency .
Thus , it would require a heroic effort by academic researchers to prove that beta - caryophyllene is safe and effective in humans .
Perhaps , before that happens , the natural substance will find its way into the herbal medicine aisle of health food stores .

The Plascencia family boasts the brand name for fine dining in Tijuana .
Their showcase restaurant -- Villa Saverios -- is a foodie destination , its elegant dining room a gathering spot for the city ’s political and social elite .
But the family ’s success has also drawn other attention .
Three years ago , gunmen tried to kidnap chef Javier Plascencia ’s younger brother .
A year later they tried again but , in a case of mistaken identity , snatched the wrong man .
Enough close calls , the family decided .

Nearly 40 years after they opened their first Tijuana restaurant , the entire extended family -- 18 people , including Javier Plascencia ’s wife and four children -- moved across the border to a suburb southeast of San Diego .
Such migrations have become increasingly common in metropolitan areas along the U.S. - Mexico border , as the ongoing violence of a brutal drug war has disrupted lives from Tijuana to Nuevo Laredo , across the Rio Grande from Texas .
The Mexican government has sent more than 3,000 troops into Tijuana in the last 1 1/2 years , and on several occasions soldiers have shot it out with drug cartel gunmen on residential streets .
“ San Diego is the only place you can forget the sense of insecurity and fear .
There , you can breathe .
Psychologically , crossing the border relieves the stress , ” said Guillermo Alonso Meneses , a professor of cultural studies at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana .
In San Diego County , the Plascencias opened a new restaurant , brought in their violinist and piano player , and found that they had no shortage of customers .
Romesco was soon full of others who had fled the growing violence in Tijuana , including members of the city ’s most prominent families .

Real estate agents , business owners and victims groups estimate that more than 1,000 Tijuana families -- including those of doctors , lawyers , law enforcement officials , Lucha Libre wrestlers and business owners -- have made this move in recent years as the drug - fueled violence has worsened .
People have arrived in south San Diego County with only the clothes on their back .
Kidnapping victims released after lengthy captivities have shown up long - haired and disheveled , sometimes with fresh wounds .
Real estate agents tell of clients with fingers missing , sliced off by kidnappers who sent them to relatives as proof the victims were alive .
The presence of the immigrants , most in the U.S. legally , is unmistakable in the many gated , master - planned communities of eastern Chula Vista , where parking lots for upscale stores and spas are sprinkled with Baja California license plates .

So many upper - class Mexican families live in the Eastlake neighborhood and Bonita , an unincorporated community adjacent to Chula Vista , that residents say the area is becoming a gilded colony of Mexicans , where speaking English is optional and people can breathe easy cruising around in their Mercedes - Benzes and BMWs .
“ I always say that Eastlake is the city with the highest standard of living in all of Mexico , ” joked Enrique Hernandez Pulido , a San Diego - based attorney with many Mexican emigre clients .
Kidnappings rampant
Tijuana suffers more kidnappings than almost any other city outside Baghdad , according to a global security firm that handles ransom negotiations south of the border .
And a crime wave that started three years ago has only intensified .
Most abductions are not reported to authorities , but victim support groups and others estimate the number in the hundreds in the last three to four years .

Experts say the Mexican government ’s crackdown on drug cartels may have inadvertently intensified the problem .
With Tijuana ’s major organized crime group , the Arellano Felix drug cartel , ravaged by arrests and killings , cartel lieutenants have been turning more and more to kidnappings to supplement their dwindling drug profits .
Heavily armed gunmen , often wearing federal police uniforms , snatch people from shopping centers , restaurants , country clubs .
The victims are warehoused in networks of safe houses and often shackled and put in group cages until ransoms are paid .
Some families have seen loved ones abducted , released , then abducted again .
Many of the kidnapped have been killed , even after large ransoms have been paid .
The threat has forced many families that have stayed in Tijuana to employ large security details , bar their doors and windows and retreat behind thick gates or high walls in the Chapultepec Hills .
These days , the drug war ’s spiraling violence keeps people away from Tijuana ’s restaurant row on Sanchez Taboada Boulevard .
Bodyguards shadow children to and from school .
About half of the businesses on Avenida Revolucion , the city ’s downtown tourist district , have been shuttered .

Fleeing in fear
Some people must take flight suddenly .
One prominent attorney , who asked not to be identified for security reasons , drove from his office directly to the border with a police escort after being notified that kidnappers planned to kill him for speaking out against the crime wave .
He and his family slept on air mattresses and sofa beds in a San Ysidro apartment for weeks until he closed escrow on a home in Eastlake .
He shut down his office in a Tijuana high - rise and now works from his American home .

“ I had to change cities , houses , countries , offices , ” he said .
“ It ’s a life of constant fear . ”
In the rolling hills of Eastlake -- only five miles from Mexico up California 125 , the new South Bay Expressway toll road -- most of the gated mansions in the $ 2 - million - to - $ 3 - million range have been sold to Tijuana refugees , say real estate agents .
Maids cross the border daily to work for families that have recently come north -- both in Eastlake ’s mansions and in its lower - priced neighborhoods of large tract homes with red - tile roofs .
Though safely ensconced behind gates or in the cookie - cutter anonymity of manicured American suburbia , many people who leave Tijuana remain tethered to it by business .
Many continue to run their factories or businesses there from a distance , from nondescript office parks in Otay Mesa or Chula Vista .
They monitor their employees via closed - circuit camera systems and shuttle messengers back and forth across the border with paperwork and cash .

If they must travel to Tijuana themselves , they take ample precautions -- varying their routes and driving junky cars that they hope will not attract attention .
“ They ’re running scared .
They ’re having to do clever things to not be seen crossing the border .
They go in different clothes .
They go in different cars , ” said Father John P. Dolan , pastor of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Chula Vista .
Dolan said six families in his parish have fallen victim to kidnappings in the last year .
Dr. Fernando Guzman , who was kidnapped in April , said he occasionally commutes by motorcycle across the border to his hospital near downtown Tijuana .
The prominent attorney armor-plated his SUV for $ 66,000 .
Another business owner wears a GPS tracking device hidden on his body so that in an emergency his family will be able to determine his location via satellite .

Still , any return to Tijuana is risky .
About 30 people from the Chula Vista area who travel back and forth across the border have been kidnapped in the last 1 1/2 years while conducting business or visiting relatives in the Tijuana area , according to the FBI .
Some have been killed .
Extraordinary security measures are n’t limited to visits to Mexico .
Many families wo n’t tell even their closest friends their new addresses in San Diego County .
Some parents with kids who carpool tell them to get dropped off a few blocks from home and walk the rest of the way .
Homeowners cast wary eyes on nosy landscapers , maids , busboys , members of their health clubs -- fearful that someone will pass along valuable information about them to kidnappers .
A lifestyle adjustment

Many emigres miss their old lifestyles in Tijuana .
Accustomed to lives of privilege in Mexico , some had to downsize their tastes to afford the more expensive San Diego suburbs .
Some traded customs homes for tract houses .
Their social lives , which revolved around country club lunches and all - night parties , have been dialed down in their adopted country of early last calls .
Slowly , an emigre culture is taking root .
Golfers tee up at the Eastlake Country Club instead of Tijuana ’s Club Campestre .
The Vega Caffe in the Eastlake Design District offers carne asada tortas with cappuccino shots .
English is n’t an issue in most Eastlake stores , where signs are in Spanish and clerks are bilingual .
Power lunch spots such as Frida Restaurant and Romesco have filled the gaps left by Villa Saverios and Sanborn ’s in Tijuana .
For many , Romesco has become the next best thing to an elegant night out south of the border .
Its shopping center locale lacks the curb appeal of the Plascencias ’ Tuscan - style restaurant on Sanchez Taboada Boulevard .
But the fare is familiar : Baja - Mediterranean seafood , featuring olive oils and wines from the Guadalupe Valley .
Advertisement
Plascencia , who recently joined elite chefs at a West Hollywood culinary event called Tables of Ten , says his restaurant offers the kind of gourmet experience that his fellow refugees crave .
“ The people who come here miss the atmosphere of Tijuana , ” he said .
“ They ’re like us .
They ca n’t go back very often . ”
Before his infrequent visits to Villa Saverios , he has trusted friends scout the area for suspicious - looking people .
He never stays long .
“ I ca n’t play host anymore and say hello to guests , ” he said .
“ I take a quick tour of the kitchen , walk the dining room and come back . ”

Dogs Get Ringtone Only They Can Hear
Pet lovers never seem to give enough to their animal companions .
They pamper their pet with “ gourmet ” food , “ designer ” garments , satin and silk beds , jewel encrusted collars , and much more
There is really no way to even know that a pet can appreciate all the things we do for them , but that does n’t seem to thwart our efforts .
The latest is from a Tokyo content provider , Dwango , who is getting ready to sell ringtones that only dogs can hear .
The service , called “ Inu ni shika kikoenai chakushinon ” ( ringtones only dogs can hear ) will make free downloads available to current DoCoMo i-mode subscribers .
What practical purpose this development will serve was left out of Dwango ’s press release .
I ’m sure there ’ll be a lot of unanswered cell phones next to barking dogs , wishing the damn things would stop ringing .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Justice Antonin Scalia , in an interview to be shown on Sunday , defended the U.S. Supreme Court ruling ’s that gave George W. Bush the presidency and said he was not trying to impose his personal views on abortion .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia attends a National Italian American Foundation gala dinner in Washington October 13 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
Scalia was interviewed for the CBS News show “ 60 Minutes , ” an appearance timed to coincide with the publication on Monday of the book he coauthored , “ Making Your Case : The Art of Persuading Judges . ”
It marked the latest in a series of broadcast interviews this year by the conservative justice who once shunned the media .
The nine - member Supreme Court conducts its deliberations in secret and the justices traditionally wo n’t discuss pending cases in public .
The court has the final word on questions of U.S. law and its rulings affect the rights of all Americans .
“ I am a law - and - order guy .
I mean , I confess to being a social conservative , but it does not affect my views on cases , ” Scalia said on CBS , which on Thursday released excerpts of the interview .
Scalia repeated his earlier statement that people should “ get over ” the court ’s ruling in 2000 that halted Florida ’s vote recount , giving the presidential election to Republican Bush over Democrat Al Gore .
“ I say nonsense , ” Scalia said , when asked about critics who say the 5 - 4 ruling was based on politics and not justice .
“ Get over it .
It ’s so old by now . ”
Scalia , who has long opposed the court ’s landmark Roe v.
Wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion , said he was not trying to impose his personal views .
“ If indeed I were ... trying to impose my own views , I would be in favor of the opposite view , which the anti-abortion people would like to see adopted , which is to interpret the Constitution to mean that a state must prohibit abortion , ” Scalia said .
He said “ there ’s nothing ” in the Constitution to support that view .
The interviews are a turnabout for Scalia , who for years has barred television and radio coverage from his public speaking events .
Justice Clarence Thomas , another member of the high court ’s conservative wing who also has been disdainful of reporters , was profiled in a similar “ 60 Minutes ” piece before the October 1 publication of his autobiography , “ My Grandfather ’s Son . ”
In the past , the 72 - year - old Scalia , who was appointed to the court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan , has cited his “ First Amendment right not to speak on the radio or television when I do not wish to do so . ”
In 2004 , his security detail forced two reporters in Mississippi to erase tape recordings of a speech he gave .
Scalia later apologized and said his policy was aimed at the broadcast media , not print reporters who record his speeches to write accurate stories .
And in 2006 when a Boston reporter approached him after a mass and asked whether lawyers might question his impartiality in church - state matters , Scalia flicked his fingers under his chin in a well - known dismissive gesture .
But Scalia has embarked on an apparent media blitz this year .
One possible reason for the change is that his children have urged him to do more televised public appearances .
Another reason is to promote his book .
In February in London , Scalia told the BBC that some physical interrogation techniques can be used on a terrorism suspect in the event of an imminent threat such as a hidden bomb about to blow up .
Earlier this month , Scalia held an hour - long session with local high school students that was broadcast live on one of the C - SPAN cable television channels .
But while Scalia now is more open to interviews on camera , he still opposed cameras covering the Supreme Court ’s arguments , and strongly criticized televised civil and criminal courts .
If the arguments were televised , he said short clips would be shown that would not accurately represent what happened .
“ Why should I participate in the mis-education of the American people ? , ” he said .
Trump sidesteps call to condemn white supremacists
Debate moderator Chris Wallace asked if Trump would urge groups to stand down and avoid contributing to the violence .
He sidestepped .
What if Apple trumps Microsoft one day ?
I know i know i know .
Its a big what if .
But what if that happens ?
Would it really be as fun to talk and root for Apple like a lot of people do when they are n't second place anymore ?
I say no .
All sales is showmanship .
There are an infinite number of ways to show you are number one .
Everything in this universe is ' All Natural ' .
See through the hype !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House Judiciary Committee served a subpoena on former top Bush aide Karl Rove on Thursday to compel his testimony concerning allegations that the Department of Justice had dismissed U.S. attorneys based on party affiliation .
Former top White House adviser Karl Rove was subpoenaed Thursday by the House Judiciary Committee .
The committee ordered Rove to appear July 10 to testify on claims that he was a key player in pressing the Justice Department to dismiss some U.S. attorneys and to prosecute Democrats .
It had authorized the subpoena earlier but delivered it Thursday after Rove 's attorney said he would not appear voluntarily , Chairman John Conyers , D - Michigan , said in a written statement .
" It is unfortunate that Mr. Rove has failed to cooperate with our requests , " Conyers said .
" Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate .
Unfortunately , I have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters . "
In a letter dated Thursday and addressed to Conyers , Rove 's attorney , Robert D. Luskin , noted that his client has received a subpoena on the same issue from the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" While the committee has the authority to issue a subpoena , it is hard to see what this will accomplish , apart from a ' Groundhog Day ' replay of the same issues that are already the subject of litigation , " the lawyer wrote , referring to a movie in which a person lives the same day over and over again .
Luskin added that " issues of executive privilege and separation of powers " could limit Rove 's testimony .
Do n't Miss Panel threatens to subpoena Rove
Panel threatens to subpoena Rove Judge orders jailed governor 's release
In a letter of response written Thursday , Conyers said the two committees are focusing on different matters , with the House committee delving into the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , a Democrat .
Conyers also noted that other former White House officials have testified under subpoena in the past and have dealt with issues of executive privilege on a case - by - case basis .
" Mr. Rove should follow the same course , " he said .
The Democratic - controlled Congress has been engaged in battle for months with the White House over information about the dismissal of the attorneys and the prosecution of Siegelman .
Current and former White House aides have refused to testify , citing executive privilege .

Militants closely monitor military web postings , Israel believes Israeli defence chiefs have moved to tighten internet social networking rules after photographs appeared showing sensitive military subjects .
A review of Facebook pages belonging to Israeli troops found that some had posted detailed pictures of air bases , operations rooms and submarines .
" These are things we do n't want the public to see for security reasons , " an official source told the BBC .
Posting photos of troops in uniform - a popular pastime - is still allowed .
The new set of rules - which has not been made public - includes a ban on images of pilots and members of special units , and anything that shows specific military manoeuvres .
Rite of passage
The defence ministry launched its inquiry earlier in the year to check the potential security risk in the dozens of social networking groups dedicated to life in the Israeli military .
Compulsory military service is a rite of passage experienced by large numbers of young Israelis and in recent years they have shared their experiences through photos and web - posted accounts of their activities .
Posting photos of troops in uniform - a popular pastime - is still allowed " There 's a lot of illegal photography inside the Israeli Defence Forces , including the Israeli Air Force , " a source inside the air force told the BBC .
" Most of the soldiers do n't understand how much damage it may cause , " the source added .
Militants in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories are believed to monitor Israeli web forums and communities , including Facebook and the photo sharing site Flickr , to get information .
Enthusiasts
The military source , who cannot be identified , says a few of his comrades are authorised to take pictures at their bases and to post them on Flickr .
Every photo is vetted by military censors , and the ones considered appropriate are assured a warm reception by the many enthusiasts of military hardware in the online photo - sharing community .
But the defence ministry says military tribunals have investigated and disciplined about 100 soldiers who broke the rules and unwittingly helped the enemy this year .
It may seem a large number , but the defence ministry source said : " Considering the number of soldiers there are with social networking websites , it is a tiny proportion . "
The worst offenders were punished with a month in jail for particularly egregious posts , while others were warned they would face similar punishment if they re-offended .

Canadians who get behind the wheel while under the influence of drugs will face tougher consequences and will no longer be able to refuse roadside drug tests when new laws kick - in next week .
As of July 2 , police officers will be able to require drivers to submit to a roadside sobriety test .
As well , they can take drivers they suspect of being on drugs to a hospital for either a blood , saliva or urine test .
" More and more often individuals are refusing to give those samples and so now finally we are changing the law in this country that you will be compelled or you will be charged and I think that 's a reasonable response to the problem , " Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said Friday .
Under current laws , police who stop drivers they suspect of being under the influence of drugs can ask for a fluid sample to determine whether the person is intoxicated .
However , Nicholson said , police are also required to inform the individual that they are n't obligated to comply with the request .
RCMP Sgt. Robert Martin said that marijuana impairs drivers because it hampers a user 's ability to process information .
" It slows down your perceptions , " Martin said .
" It impairs your ability to judge time and distance and reaction times . "
Drivers who are convicted of drug - impaired driving will face a minimum $ 1,000 fine for a first offence .
A second conviction could result in a month in jail .
The Conservative government is also making it harder for drivers to challenge breathalyzer tests in court , Nicholson said .
Representatives from MADD said the new law is a victory for the organization , because impaired driving is the number one criminal cause of death in Canada .
" Those people have committed a criminal act by driving impaired , whether it's by drugs or alcohol and as far as I 'm concerned they 've lost their rights , " said MADD Canada president Margaret Miller .
However , defence lawyers believe that it wo n't be long before cases stemming from the new law end up at the Supreme Court of Canada .

Swimming into trouble
Enlarge Image
More than half of the world 's ocean - going sharks are at risk of extinction , a new analysis concludes .
Specialists with IUCN ( formerly the World Conservation Union ) found that 11 species are on the high - risk list , with five more showing signs of decline .
Sharks are particularly affected by over - fishing as they reproduce slowly .
The scientists are calling for global catch limits , an end to the practice of removing fins , and measures to minimise incidental catches ( bycatch ) .
With sufficient public support and resulting political will , we can turn the tide
Nicholas Dulvy , SSG
" There 's this idea that because these are widely ranging species , they 're more resilient to fishing pressure , " said Sonja Fordham , deputy chair of the IUCN Shark Specialist Group ( SSG ) and policy director for the Shark Alliance conservation group .
" In fact they 're becoming species of serious concern because there are no international catch limits for sharks .
There are intense fisheries on the oceans , and they remain pretty much unprotected . "
New threats
The SSG assessed data on the 21 species of sharks and their close cousins , the rays , that swim in upper portions of the open ocean where they are exposed to fishing fleets .
Of the 21 , one - the giant devilray - is assessed as Endangered , and 10 are Vulnerable .
A further five are listed as Near Threatened , which means the signs of decline are not serious enough yet to merit a full listing .
The classifications are based on a range of criteria that look at past or forecast declines in population size .
For example , a population shrinking by 50 % in 10 years would usually qualify as Endangered .
Some of these species have been assessed before ; but for others , including the three species of thresher sharks with their spectacularly long tails , the dangerlisting is new .
Fin cuts
The main threat to sharks is fishing , both accidental and targeted .
The three thresher species are newly judged as Vulnerable to extinction " They used to be taken as bycatch by boats targeting tuna and swordfish , " said Ms Fordham .
" But now as those species are declining we 're seeing more fishermen targeting sharks .
" Porbeagle and shortfin mako are targeted for fins and meat ; species like blue shark are likely to be finned , but particularly in Europe we 're seeing more blue shark being landed . "
Several of the bodies that regulate fisheries in international waters - the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations ( RFMOs ) - have set up measures to curb shark finning , but there are different standards in place , a situation that enables fishermen to work around the regulations .
As East Asian economies boom , conservation groups say the market for fins is increasing .
" Fishery managers and regional , national and international officials have a real obligation to improve this situation , " commented Nicholas Dulvy from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , the report 's lead author .
" But it does n't have to be like this .
With sufficient public support and resulting political will , we can turn the tide . "
The report was released at the Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) meeting in Bonn , and will be published in the journal Aquatic Conservation : Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems .
The new risk assessments will be included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species when it is published later this year .

Every few months , rumors swirl about Beatles music finally going on sale in online music stores .
We 've largely trained ourselves to ignore these rumors , because nothing ever seems to materialize .
By the time Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr , OliviaHarrison , Yoko Ono Lennon and company get around to selling Beatles music on iTunes , a decent percentage of music customers may have no idea who they are .
However , The Fab Four could apparently soon follow in Metallica 's footsteps by licensing a videogame in which gamers can play their ( still incredible , to my ear ) catalog .
The Financial Times reports that Beatles representatives met with both Activision , makers of Guitar Hero , and MTV Games , which puts out Rock Band , to discuss the possibility of a Beatles - themed game in a deal that " could be worth millions of dollars . "
The Beatles ' label Apple Corps ( which owns certain rights to the catalog ) and EMI ( which own the rights to the masters ) would both have to be on board .
Apparently , mobile carriers have recently expressed interest in the Beatles ' catalog after some of their songs appeared on American Idol , with Apple Corps ' permission – a possible foreshadowing of more licensing deals to come .
" To my view , it 's only a matter of time before we see Beatles songs that are theoriginal recordings in motion pictures , in television work , and yes , maybe evenone day in a commercial , " Martin Bandier , chief executive of Sony / ATV Music Publishing , which owns certain Beatles publishing rights , told the FT .
The paper said Bandier " argued that sensitivities aboutcommercialism should be balanced against the merits of exposing the band to ayounger generation . "
In honor of this latest rumor , here are the 10 Beatles songs I 'd most want to play in Guitar Hero or Rock Band , in alphabetical order :
" Blackbird "
" Day Tripper "
" Dear Prudence "
" Helter Skelter "
" Here Comes the Sun "
" Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) "
" Octopus 's Garden "
" Revolution "
" Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band "
" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "

( Oprah.com ) -- Poignant , tragic , funny , outrageous -- most of us have at least one story we tell ( and retell ) to explain our emotional bruises .
But there 's a big difference between understanding the past and being stuck in it .
Expert warns that you should pay attention to why you 're telling that story again .
Self - pity , a dominant characteristic of sociopaths , is also the characteristic that differentiates heroic storytelling from psychological rumination .
When you talk about your experiences to shed light , you may feel wrenching pain , grief , anger , or shame .
Your audience may pity you , but not because you want them to .
Obsessing aloud , on the other hand , is a way of fishing for pity , a means of extorting attention .
Healthy people instinctively resist this strategy .
When you grieve , they will yearn to comfort you .
When you demand pity , they will yearn to smack you .
All day , I 've been telling stories to evoke my own pity , and it 's working .
Partly .
The unhealthy part of me , the world - class codependent , is just mesmerized .
" Oh , " she cries , " you poor darling !
Tell me that sad story again -- the first 400 times did n't do it justice ! "
The healthy part of me finds this annoying : " Oh , for God 's sake , " she says , rolling her eyes .
" Could we please stop the drama and get on with our life ? "
The healthy part of me is such a heartless bitch .
On the other hand , she 's got a point .
Compulsively examining my stories never works for me .
I keep sinking into sorrow ( self - inflicted though it is ) until it occurs to me that I will drown unless I can drag myself out .
This can be difficult , but after decades of practice , I 've created a sort of verbal tree limb I can grab in a pinch :
Am I presently learning the truth about my life 's work ?
If this sentence sounds a little vague , that 's because it 's actually a mnemonic code .
Each phrase reminds me of a concept that helps me escape the marsh : being present , learning continuously , seeking truth , and committing my energy to my real life 's work .
Become present
I just met with a client I 'll call Kristin , an energetic self - pitier .
We were discussing her desire for a promotion when her gaze dropped and her voice took on a timbre both sorrowful and weirdly practiced , as though she were reciting a very depressing Pledge of Allegiance .
" You know , " Kristin said , her eyes welling up , " my mother never let me talk back to her , never really listened to me . "
Her chest began to heave .
" My therapist says she may as well have been deaf . "
She dissolved into tears .
" Oh , " I said .
" So , are you going to ask for that promotion ? "
" She never listened ! " Kristin repeated , sobbing , her hand on her neck .
" My astrologer says it totally blocked my throat chakra ! "
" Kristin , " I said , " Look at me , please . "
She did n't want to .
I insisted .
" How many fingers am I holding up ? "
Reluctantly , like a dog dropping a stolen ham , Kristin raised her eyes and looked .
" Three , " she said .
Her tears dried up .
She seemed disappointed .
The story - fondling thing had been going so well .
" Kristin , can you see that your mother is n't here ?
Can you hear that you are able to speak ?
You 're a full - grown woman , with a functioning larynx , who wants a promotion .
Full stop . "
I call this anchoring , establishing a simple , physical , factual connection with present reality .
Try it for yourself , right now .
Look around you .
Listen .
Touch your hair , the floor , this page .
Whatever happened 10 years ago , whatever happened 10 minutes ago , is not your present concern .
Neither is what will happen in another 10 years , another 10 minutes .
This moment is all you have to worry about .
Narrowing your attention to this point is your reconnection with solid ground .
Never stop learning
Getting bogged down in old stories stops the flow of learning by censoring our perceptions , making us functionally deaf and blind to new information .
Once the replay button gets pushed , we no longer form new ideas or conclusions -- the old ones are so cozy .
But becoming present puts us back in reality , where we can rigorously fact - check our own tales .
Try dredging up one of your favorite stories -- maybe a classic like " I 'm not good enough . "
Treat it as a hypothesis .
Research it .
Is there any evidence that contradicts it ?
Have you ever , in any way , even for an instant , been good enough ?
You may need to ask someone for coaching at first .
Evidence that contradicts your hypothesis will be hard for you to see , while to an objective observer , it 's obvious ( " Well , you 're good enough for me , your dog , and everyone down at the bingo hall , you dumb cluck " ) .
However you get to it , the moment you absorb a fact that disproves your hypothesis , you 're half out of the mire .
Insist on the truth
Whatever terrible things may have happened to you , only one thing allows them to damage your core self , and that is continued belief in them .
Kristin's mother may have been Stalin in a bra , but by the time Kristin got to my office , what was silencing her was the conviction she 'd formed during interactions with Mom : " It 's no good to speak up ; no one will ever hear me . "
Kristin could n't redo her past , but she could change that belief .
In fact , the loop she replayed in her head was the one thing standing in her way , since evidence disconfirming her hypothesis was everywhere .
Lots of people listened to Kristin .
Once she acknowledged that , she could n't be a tiny victim , waiting haplessly for her chakras to open .
She was just a woman with a scary job to do .
I know how much this realization bummed her out ; it always bums me out .
But then , it 's also the doorway to freedom .
Put all your energy into your life 's work
The moment you lift your gaze from your old stories , you 'll see your life 's work .
I do n't mean a gilt - edged proclamation from God , describing every step you are to take for the rest of your existence .
I mean the next step , which is usually very small : Ask for the promotion .
Pick up the kids .
Take a nap .
Then take the step that comes after that .
From time to time , as you continue along , a Big Dream will coalesce out of the swamp fog .
The way forward is to shake the quicksand off your feet and take one small step toward that dream .
Trust me , it will be all you can do .
Taking things step - by - step means working -- working hard , working scared , working through confusion and embarrassment and failure .
I 've met many people the world thinks of as " lucky , " and all of them operate this way .
I 've come to think that the main purpose of rumination is work avoidance .
Dwelling endlessly on the past keeps us from the wild , exhausting , terrifying tasks that create our right lives .
When I become a little more ruthless with myself and a lot more present in what I have to do , I see that writing a humble column is my next step -- and I have writer 's block .
I 'd love to enter therapy and figure out why , but I do n't have that kind of time .
Instead , I 'll focus on a saying from the Ojibwa tradition , one that deserves the attention I customarily lavish on my problems : Sometimes I go about pitying myself , and all the while I am being carried on great winds across the sky .

The Accidental Vegetarian : Grilling the Japanese way

The first time I ate Japanese food was in the Japan pavilion at Epcot Center in Disney World , when I was 9 .
It was here among the koi-filled ponds and the Japantown - esque architecture that I slurped my first bowl of fat , slippery udon .
I still remember the steamy broth loaded with seaweed and vegetables , and the chewiness of the thick white udon .
Watching my father try to use chopsticks had me roaring with laughter .
While it still makes me laugh to watch my father use chopsticks , my taste in Japanese food has extended beyond the easy - to - love big bowl of udon .
The subtley nuanced vegetarian , often vegan , preparations in Japanese cooking make me feel like I 'm eating a healthful , guilt - free dish .
Many of the dishes use very few ingredients to convey a lot of flavor , depending on various seaweeds , misos and mushrooms to add depth .
A few vegetarian Japanese restaurants have opened in the Bay Area during the past few years , and it was at one of them that I was reminded of how simple , yet how full - flavored good Japanese dishes can be .
There 's a soup at Cha - Ya , in the Mission District , that seems to have restorative powers .
That 's what I keep telling myself .
It 's the dobin mushi , a clear soup with mushrooms , tofu and other vegetables .
The mushroom flavor comes through clear and clean , and the whole thing is served in a little tea pot .
The broth is poured into small tea cups for sipping , while the vegetables can be eaten afterward .
At the now - closed Medicine Eatstation , I enjoyed a simple artisanally crafted block of tofu , so rich it was cheeselike , with shredded ginger and soy sauce for dousing .
It 's hard to imagine just eating a block of tofu , but then again , it was hard to stop it , too .
Mirroring this simplicity , while following another favorite Japanese food trend of skewered and grilled dishes , I developed a recipe for the Tofu Kebabs depends on using the best - quality ingredients available .
Alternate firm , fat cubes of tofu with lengths of green onion and meaty shiitake mushroom caps , and baste them in a salty - sweet miso glaze .
Cook the skewers on a grill or in a grill pan , or broil them , watching closely to make sure the sugar in the glaze does n't burn .
Use any kind of miso .
Red miso has a strong flavor , while white ( shiro ) is milder and sweeter .
The glaze is also good brushed onto corn and then grilled .
The skewers are especially nice with sunomono ( for recipe , see the link with this story on sfgate.com / food ) , a cooling cucumber salad that mirrors the salty - sweet taste but adds some crunch .
Or , serve them on top of the Soba Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing to make a more substantial salad .
Do n't let using seaweed intimidate you .
It simply needs to be rehydrated in water before it 's ready to use .
And , it 's low in calories and high in fiber .
Wakame is high in protein , calcium and iron , making it a great addition for salads and soups .
If the wakame is a bit unruly ( unlike the tamer hijiki ) , cut it into manageable pieces with kitchen shears , and toss it with a little vinegar or lemon to cut any sliminess from oversoaking .
Tofu Kebabs Serves 4
These skewers have a lovely miso glaze that needs no sauce for dunking .
These make a great , easy vegetarian option for the usual meat - heavy barbecues .
Soak wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before using .
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons warm water
2 tablespoons white miso or any other miso
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons grated ginger
1 tablespoon minced shallot
6 scallions , cut into 2 - inch lengths
2 lemons , cut into 1/4 - inch thick slices
12 ounces extra - firm tofu , drained and cut into large pieces ( about 1 1/2 - to 2 - inch cubes )
12 small shiitake mushroom caps ( or 3 large ones cut into quarters )
White and black sesame seeds , for sprinkling Instructions : Preheat the grill to medium .
Alternatively , the skewers can be cooked in a grill pan over medium - high heat .
Combine sugar , soy sauce , water , miso , sesame oil , ginger and shallot in a small bowl .
Thread scallion , lemons , tofu and mushroom on skewers , alternating .
Each skewer should have two pieces of tofu .
Brush glaze on skewers , covering all sides , and transfer skewers to the grill or grill pan .
Grill , turning occasionally , until all sides are golden brown and the scallions and mushrooms have softened slightly , about 10 minutes .
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately .

Almost three years ago , Americans watched in horror as this country failed to provide adequate disaster relief resources during Hurricane Katrina .
Currently , the scenario is being repeated in California , where an estimated 600 to 900 lightning sparked wildfires are burning .
Many of these fires began last Friday afternoon ( 6/20/08 ) ; many of these fires remain unmanned .
As someone personally surrounded by over 80 fires in a 10 mile radius of my home , I am pissed , frightened , anxious , and depressed .
On Saturday , I called 911 twice to report seven fires , six of which only appeared on a map yesterday !
I called CalFire , the United States Forest Service ( two ranger districts ) , the Humboldt County Sheriff Department , the Trinity County Sheriff Department , and our local volunteer fire department .
I wanted to know what road I could take out of our valley if I needed to escape the firestorm .
The response , “ Ma’am , there are fires everywhere .
We do n’t know where they are or what roads are open . ”
I felt trapped , and we began putting dozer lines around our meadow , hooking up more sprinklers , and connecting fire hoses to the pump in our pond .
Friends of ours in Mendocino were told by CDF , “ We have so many fires , you are on your own . ”
YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN !
Five days later , there has still not been any agency to help with their fire ; however , the BLM showed up to tell them to stop using private bulldozers to put fire lines in around the blaze on public land .
They did n’t listen and protected their homes on their own .
We ’ve been through fire before , but never of this magnitude .
There is no doubt that local agencies are doing the best they can with limited resources .
The Firefighter Blog explains :
The State of California is in the midst of the worst wildfire crisis in modern state history .
More than 900 wildland fires are burning , many unstaffed .
Incident commanders are making do with skeleton crews in most cases .
Of course , the priority for resources has been homes and life , and I commend the job the firefighters are doing , but why did it take our governor three days to declare a state of emergency from the fires ?
Does he not work on the weekends during a natural disaster ?
Why do we have skeleton crews ?
The most apparent lack of support is air support .
We are lucky if one plane or helicopter shows up for an hour to fight one fire out of 80 in our smoldering community .
The Bush administration has left this country ’s infrastructure to deal with natural disasters in shambles .
National Guard troops and resources are in Iraq , and local agencies are underfunded .
Increased wildfires have been predicted as a result of global warming ; this should not have hit us out of the blue .
If we ca n’t handle natural disasters on our own , we need to ask other countries for help .
We often send assistance to other countries during times of need .
It ’s time to swallow our patriotic pride and admit we can’t fight the magnitude of these fires on our own .
We let immigrants earn citizenship by fighting in our wars ; why not let them earn citizenship for fighting wildfires ?
Locals are trying to make noise to get anyone ’s attention :
We are in DESPERATE need of help !
We have been contacting our county board of supervisors , who have been trying their best to get us resources .
We have called the governor , Boxer , Feinstein , Berg , etc .
We receive compassionate responses to our pleas for help , but the answer is always the same :
We do n’t have any resources to send your way .
Here is what one impassioned citizen wrote :
We appreciate your efforts in the past week to try and obtain the needed resources to fight the fires in Trinity County .
However after five days , there are still few if any resources on any of the eighteen or so fires threatening our home and business , and the homes of our eight to ten other neighbors .
All told there are about ten houses , one commercial building , our winery , numerous barns and outbuildings ( probably about 25 ) and historic ranches that are being threatened .
After we called 911 on Friday afternoon , a spotter plane flew over Friday night , but since then no planes or helicopters have worked on any of the eighteen fires near us …So far the weather has been ok so the fires have not spread too badly , but we need resources at some point to fight these fires , or they will eventually reach our homes and businesses , our lives that we have built over the past twenty years and longer .
We are trying our best to be patient , but it is difficult .
While we were watching the fires burn last night from our deck , we realized there is at least one that is not on the map and does not have a name …
We are doing what we can to remain safe , keep our place green , build defensible barriers , and would like to remain here as long as we can to keep our place safe , especially since so far very little help appears to be on the way .
Help is getting closer , which is a good start , but I wish it could get even closer .
The fire camps are quite large , I hope they can spare some bodies out our way , and any air support would really help both the fires and our spirits .
More resources are needed or the situation in Northern California could turn into another Hurricane Katrina type situation when the government took too long to take care of its citizens .
Local citizens have stepped up to the plate to keep each other informed and squelch wild rumors .
What few firefighters have arrived have needed locals to help them find roads and locate fires on the map .
Email has been utilized to keep the community informed ; however , power was turned off to our town two days ago because of fire near the poles .
Maps finally showed up yesterday at the store , and tomorrow there will be a community meeting .
The information aspect of the fires is improving , as our local volunteer fire chief explained , “ I do n’t feel like a mushroom anymore , kept in the dark and fed s**t . ”
Despite local information efforts , websites reporting incident news are unreliable .
This occurs every fire season , when the server for InciWeb ca n’t handle the demand .
Firefighters and families rely on InciWeb for updated information , why ca n’t the government upgrade the server ?
We are lucky the thunderstorms occurred early in fire season , when much of the foliage is still green .
These fires are moving slowly , for the most part , which has been a blessing , as agencies scramble for very limited resources .
The weather has mostly cooperated with cooler temperatures and light winds , but more thunderstorms are predicted for this weekend .

Some of you may already have seen this anecdote as a circulating email .
A Wise Bread reader recently posted it here , and I found it worthy of sharing .
Suppose that every day , ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $ 100 .
If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes , it would go something like this :
The first four men ( the poorest ) would pay nothing .
The fifth would pay $ 1 .
The sixth would pay $ 3 .
The seventh would pay $ 7 .
The eighth would pay $ 12 .
The ninth would pay $ 18 .
The tenth man ( the richest ) would pay $ 59 .
So , that 's what they decided to do .
The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement , until one day , the owner threw them a curve .
" Since you are all such good customers " , he said , " I 'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $ 20 " .
Drinks for the ten now cost just $ 80 .
The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected .
They would still drink for free .
But what about the other six men - the paying customers ?
How could they divide the $ 20 windfall so that everyone would get his " fair share ? "
They realized that $ 20 divided by six is $ 3.33 .
But if they subtracted that from everybody 's share , then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer .
So , the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man 's bill by roughly the same amount , and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay .
And so :
The fifth man , like the first four , now paid nothing ( 100 % savings ) .
The sixth now paid $ 2 instead of $ 3 ( 33 % savings ) .
The seventh now pay $ 5 instead of $ 7 ( 28 % savings ) .
The eighth now paid $ 9 instead of $ 12 ( 25 % savings ) .
The ninth now paid $ 14 instead of $ 18 ( 22 % savings ) .
The tenth now paid $ 49 instead of $ 59 ( 16 % savings ) .
Each of the six was better off than before .
And the first four continued to drink for free .
But once outside the restaurant , the men began to compare their savings .
" I only got a dollar out of the $ 20 , " declared the sixth man .
He pointed to the tenth man , " but he got $ 10 ! "
" Yeah , that 's right , " exclaimed the fifth man .
" I only saved a dollar , too .
It 's unfair that he got ten times more than I ! "
" That 's true ! ! " shouted the seventh man .
" Why should he get $ 10 back when I got only two ?
The wealthy get all the breaks ! "
" Wait a minute , " yelled the first four men in unison .
" We did n't get anything at all .
The system exploits the poor ! "
The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up .
The next night the tenth man did n't show up for drinks , so the nine sat down and had beers without him .
But when it came time to pay the bill , they discovered something important .
They did n't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill !
And that , boys and girls , journalists and college professors , is how our tax system works .
The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction .
Tax them too much , attack them for being wealthy , and they just may not show up anymore .
In fact , they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier .
This is of course a light hearted way to poke fun at " the system " , but still yet an interesting look at the North American tax system .
It also observes how we can sometimes get caught up in our own worlds such that we lose sight of the forest through the trees .
A lot of libertarian analysis makes use of the concept of spontaneous order .
As well it should ; it ’s an important concept , and especially important for understanding how many problems of social coordination can be solved in a free society without any government intervention or institutionalized central planning .
But I think there are a couple complications involved in the concept which need to be noted , but often fail to be .
( I figured it would be worthwhile to mention it now , because these points happened to come up recently in discussions over at Distributed Republic . )
First , the concept of spontaneous order , as it is employed in libertarian writing , is systematically ambiguous , depending on whether one is using spontaneous to mean not planned ahead of time , or whether one is using it to mean voluntary .
Thus , the term spontaneous order may be used to refer strictly to voluntary orders — that is , forms of social coordination which emerge from the free actions of many different people , as opposed to coordination that arises from some people being forced to do what other people tell them to do .
Or it may be used to refer to undesigned orders — that is , forms of social coordination which emerges from the actions of many different people , who are not acting from a conscious desire to bring about that form of social coordination , as opposed to coordination that people consciously act to bring about .
It ’s important to see that these two meanings are distinct : a voluntary order may be designed ( if everyone is freely choosing to follow a set plan ) , and an undesigned order may be involuntary ( if it emerges as an unintended consequence of coercive actions that were committed in order to achieve a different goal ) .
While Hayek himself was fairly consistent and explicit in using spontaneous order to refer to undesigned orders , many libertarian writers since Hayek have used it to mean voluntary orders , or orders that are both voluntary and undesigned , or have simply equivocated between the two different meanings of the term from one statement to the next .
It ’s important to be clear about the difference between the two , because if you equivocate you are likely to expose yourself to certain confusions , and to find yourself wearing certain kinds of conceptual blinders .
The second point , which is related to the first , is that not all spontaneous orders are necessarily benign .
Libertarians tend to write as if they were , probably because most of the examples of spontaneous order that libertarians are most interested in are examples where the process is benign — especially cases where a benign spontaneous order ( say , the adjustment of prices to reflect changes in relative scarcity of goods in a market economy ) provides an alternative to central planning , and does something important and worthwhile that State planners cannot do at all , or can not do as well .
But if widely distributed forms of intelligence , knowledge , virtue , or prudence can add up , through many individual self - interested actions , into an benign undesigned order , then there ’s no reason why widely distributed forms of stupidity , ignorance , prejudice , vice , or folly might not add up , through many individual self - interested actions , into an unintended but malign undesigned order .
Moreover , if you consider that spontaneous orders can emerge as unintended consequences of certain widespread forms of violence , then it ought to be especially clear that not all undesigned orders can be considered benign from a libertarian point of view .
Here ’s a concrete example : Susan Brownmiller ’s Myrmidon theory of stranger rape , which she explains in Chapter 6 of Against Our Will ( The Police - Blotter Rapist ) .
Brownmiller famously wrote , near the end of the first chapter of Against Our Will :
Man ’s discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to generate fear must rank as one of the most important discoveries of prehistoric times , along with the use of fire and the first crude stone axe .
From prehistoric times to the present , I believe , rape has played a critical function .
It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear .
— Susan Brownmiller ( 1975 ) , Against Our Will pp. 14–15 .
Critics of Brownmiller have often misunderstood this passage , mainly in ways which seem to come from not having read any further in the book than that paragraph .
I ’ve discussed some of those misunderstandings in the post and comments for GT 2004 - 03 - 03 :
She said , she said ( for example , if you think that Brownmiller is claiming all men are rapists , you need to re-read the final sentence more carefully , and pay particular attention to what the verb in that sentence is ) .
But my point in bringing it up here is that one way to get clearer on Brownmiller ’s meaning is to look at how it connects with the Myrmidon theory , as presented in Chapter 6 , and to think about both of them in light of the concept of a malign spontaneous order :
As described by Warden [ Clinton ] Duffy [ of San Quentin ] or as defined by the statistical profiles of the sociologists and the FBI , America ’s police - blotter rapists are dreary and banal .
To those who know them , no magic , no mystery , no Robin Hood bravura , infuses their style .
Rape is a dull , blunt , ugly act committed by punk kids , their cousins and older brothers , not by charming , witty , unscrupulous , heroic , sensual rakes , or by timid souls deprived of a normal sexual outlet , or by super - menschen possessed of uncontrollable lust .
And yet , on the shoulders of these unthinking , predictable , insensitive , violence - prone young men there rests an age - old burden that amounts to an historic mission : the perpetuation of male domination over women by force .
The Greek warrior Achilles used a swarm of men descended from ants , the Myrmidons , to do his bidding as hired henchmen in battle .
Loyal and unquestioning , the Myrmidons served their master well , functioning in anonymity as effective agents of terror .
Police - blotter rapists in a very real sense perform a myrmidon function for all men in our society .
Cloaked in myths that obscure their identity , they , too , function as anonymous agents of terror .
Although they are the ones who do the dirty work , the actual attentat , to other men , their superiors in class and station , the lasting benefits of their simple - minded evil have always accrued .
A world without rapists would be a world in which women moved freely without fear of men .
That some men rape provides a sufficient threat to keep all women in a constant state of intimidation , forever conscious of the knowledge that the biological tool must be held in awe for it may turn into a weapon with sudden swiftness borne of harmful intent .
Myrmidons to the cause of male dominance , police - blotter rapists have performed their duty well , so well in fact that the true meaning of their act has largely gone unnoticed .
Rather than society ’s aberrants or spoilers of purity , men who commit rape have served in effect as front - line masculine shock troops , terrorist guerrillas in the longest sustained battle the world has ever known .
— Susan Brownmiller , Against Our Will : Men , Women and Rape , pp. 208–209 .
One extremely common , rather coarse way of misunderstanding Brownmiller ( or , mutatis mutandis , other radical feminists , when they say things like this ) is to treat this kind of analysis as if it were some kind of conspiracy theory about rape — as if Brownmiller were claiming that , say , every first Monday of the month , all the men got together in a big meeting at the Patriarchy ’s underground headquarters and decided to have some men commit stranger rape as a way to keep women down .
Or , to be more charitable to uncharitable critics , as if Brownmiller were claiming that police - blotter rapists and other men who do not commit rape are consciously collaborating with one another , in some kind of social plan , promulgated from the top down , to intimidate women and bring about and sustain male supremacy .
The truth is that there are historical cases where groups or movements of men have consciously collaborated with one another to keep women down .
( What else , for example , would you call the gynocide in Basra , or the psychiatric analysis and treatment of hysteria in Europe and America , or the Taliban , or 19th century American family laws , under which white husbands posted advertisements about fugitive wives — almost as frequently as they posted advertisements about fugitive slaves — and used the law and bounty - hunters to forcibly recapture wives who chose to leave home ? )
So that happens , but Brownmiller ’s analysis of stranger rape does n’t claim that that ’s what ’s happening when rapists reinforce the system of male supremacy .
What she claims is that the pervasive fact of rape , and the threat that its pervasiveness inflicts on all women , produces a spontaneous ( undesigned ) order , so that the actions of rapists serve the role of promoting , sustaining , and reinforcing male supremacy .
It ’s not controversial , or it should n’t be by now , that the threat of rape imposes constraints on women ’s behavior :
Do n’t go out at night alone .
Do n’t make yourself noticeable on the subway .
Do n’t dress like that .
Do n’t act overtly sexual .
Do n’t go to that party .
Do n’t drink at that party .
Or , if you do , then you better like whatever happens to you and you better not complain , because baby , you were asking for it .
And also : you better find the Right Man and enlist him to protect you from other men .
( By walking you home at night .
By slipping into a situation to block off the Wrong Men who are hassling you .
By becoming your boyfriend or fiance or husband and looking out for you . )
The natural consequence of these restrictions is that women in our society are systematically constrained in their action by the fear of men .
Women are not free because they must figure out how to live with the fact of widespread , intense , random violence against women .
That fact has profound ripple effects on where women feel they can safely go .
When they feel they can safely go there .
What women feel they can safely do or say–especially what they can safely do or say in the presence of men .
How they dress , how they take up space , how they react to social interactions that are wanted or unwanted .
Some of this is conscious adjustment to fears and explicit warnings ; a lot of it is the sort of small - scale , subconscious acts of vigilance and self - protection that we all carry out , as a daily routine , or as an expression of felt anxiety .
Another natural consequence is that men who do n’t commit stranger rape , and who are genuinely concerned for the safety of women who are their daughters , their sisters , their friends , their lovers , or what have you , are in a material and emotional position where it is very tempting to see themselves as needing to protect the women they care about from the threat of male violence .
The desire to protect an innocent person from violence is , in and of itself , a good thing , not a bad thing .
But the danger here is that it ’s an unethical and corrupting , but a very tempting and easy , psychological step for these men to come to see themselves as the sole protector , as a woman ’s only safe option .
To see women as uniquely frail and in need of protection by nature ( rather than uniquely threatened due to the choices of other men ) .
And to try to make sure that women seek and depend on and stay within the scope of a man ’s protection , whether or not they really want it , by use of those intimidating and restrictive warnings , by harassing women ( seen as foolish or bad ) who step outside of the stiflingly close boundaries of those safety tips , in order to try to intimidate them into staying in the boundaries , and ultimately by blaming the woman , rather than her attacker , and writing off her suffering as nonexistent or unimportant , if some other man should choose to rape her after she has ignored those safety tips .
And many women will naturally look to men who act like that — that is , as Protectors — because they are realistically afraid of other men ’s sexual aggression , and afraid of stranger rape , and they may like this particular guy , for other reasons , anyway , and so it is worth seeking out his help .
All of this can happen quite naturally when a large enough minority of men choose to commit widespread , intense , random acts of violence against a large enough number of women .
And it can happen quite naturally without the raping men , or the protecting men , or the women in the society ever intending for any particular large - scale social outcome to come about .
But what will come about , quite naturally , is that women ’s social being — how women appear and act , as women , in public — will be systematically and profoundly circumscribed by a diffuse , decentralized threat of violence .
And , as a natural but unintended consequence of many small , self - interested actions , some vicious and violent ( as in the case of men who rape women ) , some worthwhile in their origins but easily and quickly corrupted ( as in the case of men who try to protect women from rape ) , and some entirely rational responses to an irrational and dangerous situation ( as in the case of women who limit their action and seek protection from men ) , the existence and activities of the police - blotter rapist serve to constrain women ’s behavior and to intimidate women into becoming dependent on some men — and thus dependent on keeping those men pleased and serving those men ’s priorities — for physical protection from other men .
That kind of dependence can just as easily become frustrating and confining for the woman , and that kind of power can just as easily become corrupting and exploitative for the man , as any other form of dependence and power .
( Libertarians and anarchists who easily see this dynamic when it comes to government police and military protection of a disarmed populace , should n’t have any trouble seeing it , if they are willing to see it , when it comes to male protection of women . )
Thus stranger rapists become the Myrmidons — the anonymous shock troops — of male supremacy , and the fact that nobody involved intends quite that , exactly , is quite irrelevant , because they serve their function in an violent undesigned order well enough whether anyone intended that or not .
I ’ve been talking about stranger rape all this time because that ’s what Brownmiller ’s theory is about , and Brownmiller ’s theory is a good case study in the point I ’m trying to make .
But similar remarks , with different but importantly related consequences , could be made for forms of violence against women which feminist activists and researchers have , over the past 30 years , demonstrated to be even more prevalent and even harder to escape than the threat of stranger rape — date rape , rape in marriage , battery , and so on .
Because these forms of violence are committed by different men , in different circumstances , from stranger rape , and because they are widely experienced by women ( about 1 in 4 women in the United States will be sexually or physically assaulted by an intimate partner ) , but far less widely and insistently discussed as an everyday threat to women ’s safety than stranger rape is , there was comparatively little public knowledge about them at the time Brownmiller first published her book , and what we now know is that they have different functions in a violent undesigned order that exploits women , hurts women , and circumscribes their behavior to a limited sphere under the control and for the benefit of men .
But those roles are more easily seen , and more fruitfully discussed , when they are seen as other expressions of a similar underlying phenomenon .
Because of the central role that the pervasive danger of violence against women plays in sustaining it , and the way in which that pervasive , diffuse threat of violence constrains the liberty of women in everyday life to move and act and live as they want , libertarians and anarchists must recognize patriarchy as a system of violent political oppression older , no less invasive , and no less powerful , than the violence of the police state or the warfare state .
But unlike the kinds of State violence to which male anarchists and libertarians are accustomed to discuss — violent restrictions of freedom handed down according to explicit State policies , ratified through political processes , promulgated from the top down and consciously carried out by officially appointed or deputized agents of the State — patriarchy expresses itself in attitudes , behaviors , and coercive restrictions that are largely produced by bottom - up , decentralized forms of violence , committed by many different men , who would n’t know each other from Adam , freelance terrorists who commit violence of their own accord , out of a desire to control but without any grand unified social plan , without conscious collaboration or conspiracy , sometimes in conflict with the explicit provisions of the law ( though rarely investigated and ineffectively prosecuted in the male - dominated legal system ) .
This is part of what I take Catharine MacKinnon to mean when she writes that :
Unlike the ways in which men systematically enslave , violate , dehumanize , and exterminate other men , expressing political inequalities among men , men ’s forms of dominance over women have been accomplished socially as well as economically , prior to the operation of the law , without express state acts , often in intimate contexts , as everyday life .
( 1989 , p. 161 )
It ’s important to recognize that the coercive social order that arises from this kind of diffuse gender violence , both as a direct consequence and as social , psychological , or economic ripple effects from the direct consequences — is no less real , no less effective , no less important , and no less evil , for being undesigned , for battering women into the social position they currently occupy as if by an invisible fist .
Far too many libertarian men still write as if the misogynistic oppression of women and spontaneous order were two radically different , and incompatible , explanations for differences in the socioeconomic status of men and women ; as if anyone who sees anything systematically wrong here , something that merits exposure and resistance through conscious activism , must therefore be simply ignorant , or in denial , about the ways in which social outcomes can emerge , undesigned , from spontaneous order processes .
But this is only the result of failing to pay attention to , or failing to charitably understand , what your interlocutors are saying .
Libertarians have no reason to believe that all voluntary orders , much less all undesigned orders ( which are n’t even guaranteed to be non-coercive ) , will be benign .
And radical feminists , far from being socioeconomic creationists , are actually well practiced in using the concept of a spontaneous order — indeed , make significant use of it themselves in their own analysis of the differences between men and women ’s socioeconomic status .
They happen to be right about that , and those of us who believe that freedom is for all human beings , and who work for an end to all forms of systematic political violence , have to fight , at the very least , a two - front war : against the violence of the State , and against the violence of patriarchy .
But in order to fight back effectively we will have to see it for what it is , and to take it on on its own ground .
It may very well be the case that the best methods for resisting the planned order of State coercion are not the same as the best methods for resisting the unplanned order of Patriarchal coercion .
At the very least , a clear understanding of the dynamics of patriarchy — of the way in which an account like Susan Brownmiller ’s is best understood , and the way it fits in with our understanding of spontaneous order — will be necessary to get a firm grip on what needs to be exposed and resisted .

Applied scientists at Harvard University in collaboration with researchers from the German universities of Jena , Gottingen , and Bremen , have developed a new technique for fabricating nanowire photonic and electronic integrated circuits that may one day be suitable for high - volume commercial production .
Spearheaded by graduate student Mariano Zimmler and Federico Capasso , Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics and Vinton Hayes Senior Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering , both of Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) , and Prof. Carsten Ronning of the University of Jena , the findings will be published in Nano Letters .
The researchers have filed for U.S. patents covering their invention .
While semiconductor nanowires --- rods with an approximate diameter of one - thousandth the width of a human hair --- can be easily synthesized in large quantities using inexpensive chemical methods , reliable and controlled strategies for assembling them into functional circuits have posed a major challenge .
By incorporating spin-on glass technology , used in Silicon integrated circuits manufacturing , and photolithography , transferring a circuit pattern onto a substrate with light , the team demonstrated a reproducible , high - volume , and low - cost fabrication method for integrating nanowire devices directly onto silicon .
" Because our fabrication technique is independent of the geometrical arrangement of the nanowires on the substrate , we envision further combining the process with one of the several methods already developed for the controlled placement and alignment of nanowires over large areas , " said Capasso .
" We believe the marriage of these processes will soon provide the necessary control to enable integrated nanowire photonic circuits in a standard manufacturing setting . "
The structure of the team 's nanowire devices is based on a sandwich geometry : a nanowire is placed between the highly conductive substrate , which functions as a common bottom contact , and a top metallic contact , using spin-on glass as a spacer layer to prevent the metal contact from shorting to the substrate .
As a result current can be uniformly injected along the length of the nanowires .
These devices can then function as light - emitting diodes , with the color of light determined by the type of semiconductor nanowire used .
To demonstrate the potential scalability of their technique , the team fabricated hundreds of nanoscale ultraviolet light - emitting diodes by using zinc oxide nanowires on a silicon wafer .
More broadly , because nanowires can be made of materials commonly used in electronics and photonics , they hold great promise for integrating efficient light emitters , from ultraviolet to infrared , with silicon technology .
The team plans to further refine their novel method with an aim towards electrically contacting nanowires over entire wafers .
" Such an advance could lead to the development of a completely new class of integrated circuits , such as large arrays of ultra-small nanoscale lasers that could be designed as high - density optical interconnects or be used for on - chip chemical sensing , " said Ronning .
The team 's co-authors are postdoctoral fellow Wei Yi and Venkatesh Narayanamurti , John A. and Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor and dean , both of Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ; graduate student Daniel Stichtenoth , University of Gottingen ; and postdoctoral fellow Tobias Voss , University of Bremen .
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and the German Research Foundation .

AFTER 105 witnesses and three months of evidence , a drug trial costing $ 1 million was aborted yesterday when it emerged that jurors had been playing Sudoku since the trial 's second week .
In the District Court in Sydney , Judge Peter Zahra discharged the jury after hearing evidence from two accused men , one of their solicitors and the jury forewoman , who admitted that she and four other jurors had been diverting themselves in the jury box by playing the popular numbers game .
More than 20 police gave evidence in the case , in which the two accused faced a common charge of conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of amphetamines .
One faced further firearms and drug possession indictments .
The prosecution and defence were due to deliver final addresses to the jury this week .

In this report , I introduce you to an amazing chart .
It is getting zero attention from the mainstream financial media .
The information it conveys is at the heart of Bernanke ’s looming problem .
I have decided to post a link to this chart on a permanent basis in the “ Free Materials ” section of my website .
But , first , here is some background information .
The Federal Reserve System on December 17 began a unique experiment : debt swaps with large commercial banks .
The FED is now swapping at face value highly marketable U.S. Treasury securities in exchange for discounted mortgages .
Nothing like this has ever been attempted before .
It represents an innovation in central bank policy .
It is called the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) .
The initial offer was for $ 20 billion in swaps .
Since that time , the 28 - day swaps have risen in volume to $ 75 billion .
As of May 5 , according to the FED , $ 150 billion in TAF swaps have taken place .
The rate charged is about 2 % .
This is why the FED has cut the FedFunds rate to 2 % — not to stimulate the economy directly but to make available TAF loans at low rates .
Here is how the game is played .
The borrowing banks can place the borrowed Treasury debt on their books at close to face value .
This looks as though the banks are meeting their capital requirements .
What is really going on ?
Deception on a massive scale — a fully legal deception that the U.S. government ’s bank auditors understand and go along with .
Let me make a comparison .
When a person who wants a mortgage signs the loan application , he is asked if any of his down payment is borrowed .
The lender does this because he wants the equity to belong to the home buyer .
He does n’t want any other lender , such as a relative of the home buyer , to be able to claim first dibs on the money if the home buyer walks away .
On the other hand , when it comes time for a large bank that loaned money to a defaulting borrower to cover itself by borrowing high - rated assets , the bank ’s auditors do not ask the same question of the banks : “ Is any of this capital borrowed ? ”
The FED ’s decision - makers were able to convince four other central banks to adopt a similar swap policy with the government - issued debt of their nations .
The FED is making it worthwhile for the other central banks to cooperate .
It is providing these banks with the money to make the swaps .
The FED ’s May 2 announcement describes what is going on .
In conjunction with the increase in the size of the TAF , the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized further increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) .
These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $ 50 billion and $ 12 billion to the ECB and the SNB , respectively , representing increases of $ 20 billion and $ 6 billion .
The FOMC extended the term of these reciprocal currency arrangements through January 30 , 2009 .
The fact that the other central banks are going along with this plan indicates that the subprime mortgage crisis has spread far beyond the borders of the United States .
Commercial bankers in other nations made the same mistake that America ’s commercial bankers made .
They assumed that a package of mortgages with different degrees of risk would create sufficient risk diversification that the market value of these packaged pools of debt would not fall from book value .
Beginning in August 2007 , this assumption was revealed to be breathtakingly naive .
Bankers loaned money to hedge funds to buy these packaged mortgages .
Now the hedge funds that invested heavily in these mortgages are unable to pay interest to the banks .
The liquidity for these assets has fallen .
The market has discounted these assets to 80 % or less of face value .
So , the collateral for the bank loans to the hedge funds is trouble .
If the banks mark these assets at market value , as new accounting rules in the United States require , then the banks will have to cut their estimates of their capital , which will require that they cut their lending .
All this is happening as a recession in the United States has begun , despite the financial media headlines .
This has been argued persuasively by economist Stefan Karlsson .
WOULD YOU FUND A USED CAR PORTFOLIO FOR THIS BANK ?
Back in 1960 , a Democrat drew a cartoon of Richard Nixon .
Under the Nixon ’s face was this question : “ Would you buy a used car from this man ? ”
Because the election was so close , we can blame Nixon ’s defeat on almost anything , including the ballots cast in Cook County , Illinois , where , in the words at the time of black comedian Dick Gregory , “ your vote really counts , and counts , and counts . ”
But I prefer to blame that cartoon , which was reproduced everywhere .
With this as background , let us consider the words of the Federal Reserve System as of May 2 .
In addition , the Federal Open Market Committee authorized an expansion of the collateral that can be pledged in the Federal Reserve ’s Schedule 2 Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) auctions .
Primary dealers may now pledge AAA / Aaa - rated asset - backed securities , in addition to already eligible residential - and commercial - mortgage - backed securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations , beginning with the Schedule 2 TSLF auction to be announced on May 7 , 2008 , and to settle on May 9 , 2008 .
The wider pool of collateral should promote improved financing conditions in a broader range of financial markets .
Deciphering the FedSpeak , we learn that the FED is swapping U.S. Treasury securities for packages of loans on just about anything .
I suppose this could include cars , if the FOMC decides the asset meets its wider standards .
I ca n’t help it .
I have this mental image of Ben Bernanke on some late - night television commercial for used cars .
He ’s out on the lot , walking down a row of used cars .
“ Friends , you ’ve got to get down here tomorrow morning .
No matter how long and hard you look around town , you wo n’t find a beauty like this 2005 Hummer . ”
He whacks the hood .
The bumper falls off .
All over the banking world , the bumper has fallen off .
As for the AAA - rating , let me quote the late Senator Everett Dirkson .
“ Ho , ho , ho — and , I might ad , ha , ha ha . ”
If the AAA rating meant anything significant , the paper would not be trading at discounts from face value .
Consider these words :
“ The wider pool of collateral should promote improved financing conditions in a broader range of financial markets . ”
Let me translate .
The wider pool of eligible capital for swaps will allow banks to convince government auditors — wink , wink — that the assets on the banks ’ books need not be marked to market with a discount .
Therefore , the banks will not have to call in loans in order to bring their loan - to - capital ratios back into line with regulations .
HOW LONG CAN THE GAME GO ON ?
It can go on for as long as the Federal Reserve System has U.S. Treasury debt to swap .
As Hamlet said , “ There ’s the rub . ”
In November , 2007 , two weeks before the first TAF auction was held , the Federal Reserve System held about $ 800 billion in Treasury debt .
As of May 1 , it held $ 539 billion .
“ May day !
May day ! ”
The Federal Reserve ’s “ creative financing ” to bail out banks that have invested in creatively financed mortgages has a limit .
The limit is its portfolio of Treasury debt .
This brings us to the chart .
It is published by Cumberland Associates .
It lets us see the decline in the FED ’s holdings of Treasury debt .
The important section of the chart is labeled “ Securities . ”
The color is deep purple .
It took from 1914 until November 2007 for the Federal Reserve to accumulate $ 800 billion worth of Treasury debt .
It has take from December 17 to the end of April for the FED to divest itself of $ 260 billion of this portfolio , a decrease of one - third .
In its place , it has placed AAA - rated mortgages .
At the current swap rate , the Federal Reserve System will be out of Treasury debt in December of 2008 .
But by adding car loans to the list of eligible paper , the FED has guaranteed that this rate will accelerate .
During this period , the financial media have remained characteristically mute .
Half a century ago , in “ Damn Yankees , ” the musical treated us with this lyric : “ Whatever Lola wants , Lola gets , and little man , little Lola wants you . ”
The FED wants a docile press to match the docile Congress .
It gets what it wants .
“ There ’s no exception to the rule .
It ’s irresistible , you fool .
Give in . ”
The chart is Bernanke ’s nightmare .
It reveals the reality of the limits of the FED ’s program to make the banking system solvent without creating fiat money by purchasing assets .
The FED has not created new money since early last August .
In fact , it has deflated .
We can see this in the chart .
Its ending date in May 1 .
Several decades ago , Ben Stein ’s father Herbert , who had been the head of Nixon ’s Council of Economic Advisors , uttered one of the profound observations of our era :
“ When things ca n’t go on , they have a tendency to stop . ”
The FED ’s swap programs are going to stop .
I think they will stop this year .
If I am correct , then the FED will have to come up with a fall - back program .
INFLATION IS ONE ANSWER
If the FED buys more Treasury debt to swap for AAA - rated paper held by banks and financial institutions , then it will have to abandon its anti-inflation policy .
Then again , the FED could keep the game going a while longer .
It could sell its other major asset : gold .
This of course assumes that the FED still is sitting on physical gold .
If it is , it can sell it .
For accounting purposes , it is held at $ 42.22 per ounce .
If it hikes the price by 20 to one before selling , this will increase the monetary base , just as surely as the purchase of a comparable quantity of T - bonds would .
The FED officially holds 262 million troy ounces of gold .
That ’s over $ 200 billion in gold at $ 800 per ounce .
To sell gold at $ 42.22 an ounce would transfer enormous windfall profits to the buyers .
Congress might take a close look at such an arrangement .
Technically , the U.S. government owns the gold .
So , I do n’t think the FED will sell off its gold .
The FED is hoping that the market for AAA - rated mortgage packages and car loan packages will recover before the end of the year .
If it does n’t , then the banks will no longer have a cooperating buyer of these packages at face value for 2 % .
CONCLUSION
The clock is ticking for Dr. Bernanke and his fellow Board members and Federal Open Market Committee members .
They have adopted the most creative “ creative financing ” program in central bank history .
They have invited other central banks to adopt the program , which they have .
The problem is , there is an economic law here : “ At a below - market price , there is greater demand than supply . ”
There is a rush by commercial banks and financial institutions to swap AAA - rated paper for Treasury debt .
I can understand their enthusiasm .
The game cannot go on indefinitely .
Remember Herb Stein ’s law : “ When things can not go on , they have a tendency to stop . ”
The FED is not inflating today .
My opinion is that it will not maintain this policy through 2009 .

Following last September ’s crash of a Gulfstream jet used by the CIA for torture flights that contained 4 tonnes of cocaine , more customs officials and cops have been caught in drug smuggling and drug dealing rackets .
Customs supervisor Walter Golembiowski and officer John Ajello face narcotics , bribery and conspiracy charges after they were arrested for helping smuggle drugs and contraband through New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport .
" The investigation has led to the indictment and prosecution of more than 20 people — “ from distributors to overseas sources of supply ” — and the seizure of more than 600 pounds of imported hashish and other drugs from the United States and France , " according to a CNN report .
Meanwhile in Texas , Cameron County Constable Saul Ochoa was arrested by the FBI yesterday morning for possession and distribution of marijuana .
Ochoa ’s brother is Justice of the Peace Benny Ochoa III of Port Isabel and his cousin is Port Isabel Police Chief Joel Ochoa .
" The grand jury charged Ochoa with possessing five to 10 pounds of marijuana on four different days in May with the intent to distribute .
Each of the four counts carries a maximum five years in prison and $ 250,000 fine , " according to a Brownsville Herald report .
While reports of customs agents and cops dealing drugs are almost routine , the real head of the hydra has always been CIA involvement in smuggling drugs that end up on America ’s streets , a symbiotic process that also helps finance wars and terrorist groups to do the bidding of the U.S. government around the world .
The corporate media will report on lesser drug smuggling scandals involving cops and customs agents , but when it comes to the gargantuan sprawling CIA drug smuggling racket , the silence is deafening .
In September 2007 , a Florida based Gulfstream II jet aircraft # N987SA was forced to crash land in Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula after it ran out of fuel .
After accident investigators arrived on the scene they discovered a cargo of nearly 4 tonnes of cocaine .
Journalists discovered that the same Gulstream jet had been used in at least three CIA " rendition " trips to Guantanamo Bay between 2003 and 2005 .
Kevin Booth ’s underground hit documentary American Drug War features footage of former DEA head Robert Bonner admitting that the CIA was involved in cocaine smuggling operations .
Former DEA agent Cele Castillo , who has appeared on The Alex Jones Show many times , personally witnessed CIA drug smuggling operations funneled through terrorists that were also involved in kidnappings and the training of death squads on behalf of the U.S. government .
Investigative reporter Gary Webb was instrumental in exposing CIA cocaine trafficking operations before his alleged suicide in 2004 .
In the You Tube clip below , Webb traces the history of Agency involvement in drug smuggling and its links to financing wars in central America .

In episode 24/5/2008 of Diggnation , a story the guys were covering which was linked to Gizmodo highlighted EXACTLY the concern I ’ve had about this so - called tech news site for a long time .
Gizmodo seem to present stories they ’ve found elsewhere as if they are there own , by making it very difficult to see the link to the original article , at the foot of the page .
Annoyingly , they rarely include all the information about a story which you might need to understand it better – such as photographs or technical spec text files and so on ; choosing instead to literally bury the link in two or three pages of internal links to other stories on their own site .
I was completely ignored when I submitted a self - reddit on this subject once before – about how it ’s OK for big name tech sites to basically steal other site ’s stories , but when we independent bloggers do it , all of a sudden it ’s blogspam .
Well it would seem that , in attempting to understand more about a story which made it to the Diggnation script ( if you can call it that ) co-host Alex Albrecht came across the same problem that I ’ve been complaining about ever since I first came across Gizmodo .
Perhaps anyone reading from Gizmodo might like to do the right thing and make it easier in future for people to click directly to the story as it was intended to be read by it ’s original author , or better yet just stop self - submitting to Digg altogether , trying to make out like the work belongs to Gizmodo .

This ai n’t your mama ’s prefab .
Mobile homes , step aside - shipping containers and other modern techniques and architectures are here .
This spring , Brio 54 introduces a new set of prefab residential prototypes .
Brio54 ’s mission is to provide sustainable , affordable design while delivering high quality construction .
Each Brio54 home comes complete with green features such as centralized efficient heating and cooling , moisture and ventilation control , dual flush toilets , energy star HVAC and appliances , passive solar energy design , all natural wood and stone flooring , and 3 Form Ecoresin countertops .
They have some stiff competition .
Since going into production earlier this year , Adam Kalkin has sold a dozen Quik Houses , each based on five shipping containers .
Cheap , strong and easily transportable by boat , truck or train , shipping containers have changed status from waste product to green construction material .
The basic Quik House is a two - story , 2,000 - square - foot home with three bedrooms , two baths , skylights , and enormous glass windows .
The price ranges from $ 76,000 for the basic kit to $ 160,000 .
That`s less than $ 100 per square foot , including a stainless - steel kitchen and mahogany doors .
His most recent design — the “ Push Button House ” — is a home built inside a shipping container with mechanized walls that open like a blossoming flower .
Architects Pieter Peelings and Silvia Mertens of Sculp ( IT ) live and work in this four story shipping container home .
A spa is located on the roof .
Hurricane proof , flood proof , and fire proof , these metal Lego blocks are tough enough to be stacked twelve high .
Not only are they green , they fit neatly into odd spaces .
Imagine slotting this home in between two skyscrapers !
What`s more , they`re movable .
Travelodge recently constructed a “ portable ” hotel out of recycled shipping containers in London , in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics .
Each room is a Travelpod .
The containers fit together like a giant Lego set .
They can be disassembled and easily reassembled at a different site , or used individually :
The hotel company plans to use Travelpods as an on - site camping alternative for events such as Burning Man .
They will be transported from site to site to fit the need for temporary hotels .
Finally , shipping containers work as construction materials in all sorts of environments and difficult - to - reach spaces .
These three pictures trace the construction of a home in the midst of a dense rainforest in Australia .
This double container home is accessible only by a narrow , unpaved path .
The PVC pillars keep the house dry , stable , and vermin - free without disturbing the complex root system underneath .
The materials cost less than $ 16,000 and are both recycled ( for the most part ) and recyclable for the future .
SHILLONG , India  Lou Majaw wore his signature skin - tight , cutoff short - shorts .
His long gray hair hung like dirty threads around his face .
Eyes closed in prayer , a guitar cupped in arms , he strummed the chords to “ Blowin ’ in the Wind . ”
“ Happy birthday , Bob Dylan , wherever you are , ” he began , standing on a stage in a near - empty church hall on an overcast Saturday afternoon .
“ God bless you , and thanks for everything that you ’ve done . ”
Every May 24 for the last 35 years Mr. Majaw , 61 , and one of India ’s original rock ’n ’ roll bards , has held a homespun celebration of Mr. Dylan ’s birth .
This year ’s version was held in All Saints Hall , next to the church of the same name .
Mr. Majaw pranced around the auditorium singing , “ Everybody must get stoned . ”
Two schoolgirls , who described their repertory as mostly Mariah Carey , sang “ Knockin ’ on Heaven ’s Door , ” in two - part harmony , having learned it two days before .

This annual incantation is more than one man ’s act of madcap devotion .
It is also a peephole into the love affair with Western music that goes on every day in this pine - wooded outpost in India ’s northeast .
Shillong , a British - era hill town that is now home to dozens of boarding schools and colleges , is its hub , especially when it comes to rock .
Financial institutions have already written down over $ 350 billion in subprime mortgage related losses globally and S&P said they face more write - offs .
" The negative actions reflect prospects of continued weakness in the investment banking business and the potential for more write - offs , though not of the magnitude of those of the past few quarters , " S&P said .
The rating agency also said it may downgrade Wachovia and revised outlooks to negative on Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase .
The outlook indicates the likely direction of the rating over the next two years .
S&P removed Citigroup from CreditWatch negative , affirming its ratings , and also changed its outlook to negative .
That was n't the only bad news to hit financials on Monday .
U.K. mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley was also downgraded by S&P and Fitch Ratings after it earlier announced a slide in profits and restructured a rescue plan .
Moreover , Wachovia , the No. 4 U.S. bank , ousted its chief executive in the wake of growing legal woes and loan losses .
And Washington Mutual , the large bank and home lender slammed by the mortgage slump , said it would strip Chief Executive Kerry Killinger of his title of chairman starting next month .
" The worst of the credit market is over , but there are still a lot of problems , " said T.J. Marta , fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York .
The S&P action followed continued downgrades of the financial sector in recent months .
In May , Citigroupslashed its earnings outlook for Wall Street investment banks , Goldman Sachs Group , Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley , citing a tough operating environment .
The second quarter has seen lower client - related trading volumes , little banking activity , losses related to ineffective hedging and reversals of gains on fair valuing liabilities , Citigroup analyst Prashant Bhatia wrote in a note dated May 16 .
Robyn Crook from the City University of New York reports that Nautilus , the ancient living ancestors of modern cephalopods , have both long and short - term memory , despite lacking the brain structures that modern cephalopods evolved for long - term memory .
Nautiloids are the sole surviving family of externally - shelled cephalopods that thrived in the tropical oceans 450-- 150 million years ago .
However , in the intervening years their modern soft bodied relatives dumped the shell and developed complex central nervous systems ; which makes Nautilus ideally suited to discover the 'evolutionary pathways that led to the development of the complex coleoid [ soft bodied cephalopod ] brains ' say Robyn Crook and Jennifer Basil .
Knowing that the simple Nautilus brain lacks the structures required for memory in more sophisticated cephalopods , Crook and Basil decided to test the living fossil 's memory .
Training Nautilus pompilus to associate the smell of food with a blue light , the cephalopods eventually learned to respond to a flash of blue light by extending their tentacles .
Then the scientists tested the cephalopods memories with a flash of light 3 min , 30 min , 1h , 6h , 12h and 24h after training .
Amazingly , Nautilus remembered their training for up to an hour before the memory was lost , but then the memory returned 6h later , lasting up to 24h .
Nautilus has both short and long term memory , just like modern cephalopods , despite lacking the same brain structures .
Crook and Basil are optimistic that the unsophisticated Nautilus brain could teach us how modern cephalopod brains evolved .

Final verdict : the Indonesian village - eating mud-erupting volcano known as Lusi was triggered by oil and gas drilling two years ago .
The eruption began in May 2006 when Lapindo Brantas , owned by the family of billionaire Indonesian Welfare Minister Aburizal Bakrie , began exploratory drilling of a borehole named Banjar - Panji - 1 .
Since then Lusi ’s oozing eruption has inundated rice paddies and villages , destroyed 10,000 homes and displaced 30,000 people .
Now a study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters shows exactly how drilling caused Lusi ’s birth .
Lead author Richard Davies says , “ We show that the day before the mud volcano started there was a huge ‘ kick ’ in the well , which is an influx of fluid and gas into the wellbore .
We show that after the kick the pressure in the well went beyond a critical level .
This resulted in the leakage of the fluid from the well and the rock formations to the surface — a so called ‘ underground blowout ’ .
This fluid picked up mud during its accent and Lusi was born .
Lapindo Brantas initially claimed the Yogyakarta earthquake , which occurred two days before and 155 miles away , caused Lusi ’s birth .
However the oil and gas company now confirms the published data on Lusi are correct and their drilling was the trigger , reports Durham University .
The question now is whether , as some suspect , Lapindo Brantas will simply fold into bankruptcy to avoid paying penalties or reparations .
Especially now since another study by Davies at Durham University suggests Lusi is beginning to collapse — precursor to becoming a huge sunken caldera , worsening the environmental disaster .

GREENDALE , Wis. —
Is he sick , or not ?
Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign caused a bit of a buzz when it abruptly sent out an e-mail to reporters Thursday saying his public events the following day — a town hall and news conference –in Pennsylvania were being canceled .
Several political bloggers reported he had a cold and was feeling under the weather , citing unnamed campaign aides .
An aide also confirmed to The Times that Mr. McCain has a cold .
But Brooke Buchanan , Mr. McCain ’s traveling press secretary , hurried over to reporters before a town hall meeting here and told them the senator was not sick at all .
Ms. Buchanan said she was mystified at where the illness rumors were coming from .
After all , she said , he was plunging ahead with his town hall meeting at a high school here and a fund - raiser this evening .
“ He ’s not sick , ” she said .
“ Otherwise , we would have canceled this .
“ It really is a scheduling issue , ” she added but did not elaborate .
Indeed , Mr. McCain did not seem at all under the weather during his hour - long town hall meeting here , which aides said drew over a thousand people .
He continued with gusto the running count he began Wednesday of how many days it has been since Senator Barack Obama , Mr. McCain ’s likely Democratic opponent , has been to Iraq ; he listened patiently but responded forcefully as a woman pressed him about whether the war in Iraq was hurting the economy ; and he argued vigorously that he had a “ record ” of working in a bipartisan fashion , as opposed to mere “ rhetoric . ”
The possibility that Mr. McCain might be feeling a bit rundown from campaigning is , of course , a bit more of sensitive topic than it might be for the typical candidate .
Mr. McCain ’s age , 71 , continues to be a source of concern for at least some voters .
Last week , reporters pored over hundreds of pages of medical records his campaign released .
As part of an effort to deflect concerns about his age and vitality , Mr. McCain has kept up a vigorous campaign schedule , which often kept him going from early in the morning to late at night –although it has become much more focused on fund - raising event over the past few months .
Instead of flying to Pennsylvania Friday , Mr. McCain will hold a news conference in Milwaukee at 1 p.m. and then fly on to Long Island for a fund - raiser , before returning to Washington late that evening .
Still a long day .

Beijing
MANY sympathetic Westerners view Chinese society along the lines of what they saw in the waning days of the Soviet Union : a repressive government backed by old hard - liners losing its grip to a new generation of well - educated , liberal - leaning sophisticates .
As pleasant as this outlook may be , it ’s naïve .
Educated young Chinese , far from being embarrassed or upset by their government ’s human - rights record , rank among the most patriotic , establishment - supporting people you ’ll meet .
As is clear to anyone who lives here , most young ethnic Chinese strongly support their government ’s suppression of the recent Tibetan uprising .
One Chinese friend who has a degree from a European university described the conflict to me as “ a clash between the commercial world and an old aboriginal society . ”
She even praised her government for treating Tibetans better than New World settlers treated Native Americans .
It ’s a rare person in China who considers the desires of the Tibetans themselves .
“ Young Chinese have no sympathy for Tibet , ” a Beijing human - rights lawyer named Teng Biao told me .
Mr. Teng  a Han Chinese who has offered to defend Tibetan monks caught up in police dragnets  feels very alone these days .
Most people in their 20s , he says , “ believe the Dalai Lama is trying to split China . ”
Educated young people are usually the best positioned in society to bridge cultures , so it ’s important to examine the thinking of those in China .
The most striking thing is that , almost without exception , they feel rightfully proud of their country ’s accomplishments in the three decades since economic reforms began .
And their pride and patriotism often find expression in an unquestioning support of their government , especially regarding Tibet .

On a more positive note , I want to congratulate Republicans on finally coming up with one ( albeit inexplicable ) smear against Obama that is n't just codespeak or awkward polite - company placeholder for " he 's black .
Scary ! "
Consider the recent dismal record :
Obama has a Kenyan father !
( You know what color Kenyans are ?
Black ! )
Scary !
Obama might secretly be a Muslim !
( You know what color Muslims are ?
Neither do I , but they might be black for all I know ! )
Scary !
Obama 's middle name is ethnic sounding !
Scary !
Obama attends a black church !
With black people !
Scary !
Obama needs to better prove his patriotism !
( Waiver of proof granted if you are a white politician . )
Scaaaary !
Obama needs to prove he understands the middle class , like [ insert fabulously wealthy pasty white lawmaker here ] undoubtably does .
( Because black people might not understand the middle class like rich white people do ! )
Scary again !
Obama can't bowl !
( You know who else can't bowl ?
Terrorists -- I mean , black people ! )
Super scary !
Obama 's wife , this one time , possibly was in the same room as Louis Farrakhan 's wife !
For a women 's luncheon !
With black people !
Scaaaaary !
Booga booga booga !
Look , I 'm holding a flashlight under my face right now !
And there , on the handle of the car door , was a hook !
Aaaaaagh !
Translation of all of the above :
Oh my goodness , this guy might be African American or something .
But we can't say that out loud , because it 's the freaking twenty first century and we'd look like giant , bigoted jackasses .
So this new Republican opine that he might secretly be a Marxist is a bit of a novelty .
Now , I 'm not sure if even two in ten Republicans could tell you exactly what a Marxist was , precisely , but at least it 's nice , European fearmongering .
You still get to make the point that the Democratic candidate for President of the United States might secretly be a traitor to our nation , and way of life , and not really a good wholesome flag - humping patriot at all -- but instead of looking like a hopelessly behind - the - times bigot trying desperately to stay relevant and on the airwaves , you just look like an unfathomably shallow idiot with no grasp of history or politics trying desperately to stay relevant and on the airwaves .
I do think Tom Delay should , you know , read a book or something .
At least to pass the time between murdering children and sodomizing sea life .
I thought Barack Obama 's speech was strong , thoughtful and important .
Rather beautifully , it was a speech to think to , not clap to .
It was clear that 's what he wanted , and this is rare .
It seemed to me as honest a speech as one in his position could give within the limits imposed by politics .
As such it was a contribution .
We 'll see if it was a success .
The blowhard guild , proud member since 2000 , praised it , and , in the biggest compliment , cable news shows came out of the speech not with jokes or jaded insiderism , but with thought .
They started talking , pundits left and right , black and white , about what they 'd experienced of race in America .
It was kind of wonderful .
I thought , Go , America , go , go .
You know what Mr. Obama said .
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright was wrong .
His sermons were " incendiary , " and they " denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation . "
Mr. Obama admitted that if all he knew of Mr. Wright were what he saw on the " endless loop . . . of YouTube , " he would n't like him either .
But he 's known him 20 years as a man who taught him Christian faith , helped the poor , served as a Marine , and leads a community helping the homeless , needy and sick .
" As imperfect as he may be , he has been like family to me . "
He would not renounce their friendship .
Most significantly , Mr. Obama asserted that race in America has become a generational story .
The original sin of slavery is a fact , but the progress we have lived through the past 50 years means each generation experiences race differently .
Older blacks , like Mr. Wright , remember Jim Crow and were left misshapen by it .
Some rose anyway , some did not ; of the latter , a " legacy of defeat " went on to misshape another generation .
The result : destructive anger that is at times " exploited by politicians " and that can keep African - Americans " from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition . "
But " a similar anger exists within segments of the white community . "
He speaks of working - and middle - class whites whose " experience is the immigrant experience , " who started with nothing .
" As far as they 're concerned , no one handed them anything , they 've built it from scratch . "
" So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town , " when they hear of someone receiving preferences they never received , and " when they 're told their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced , " they feel anger too .
This is all , simply , true .
And we are not used to political figures being frank , in this way , in public .
For this Mr. Obama deserves deep credit .
It is also true the particular whites Obama chose to paint -- ethnic , middle class -- are precisely the voters he needs to draw in Pennsylvania .
It was strategically clever .
But as one who witnessed busing in Boston first hand , and whose memories of those days can still bring tears , I was glad for his admission that busing was experienced as an injustice by the white working class .
Next step : admitting it was an injustice , period .
Have you ever thought why ........ 1 means " one " , and 2 means " two " ?
The roman numerals are easy to understand but what was the logic behind the phonecian numbers ?
It 's all about angles !
It 's the number of angles .
If one writes the numbers down ( see below ) on a piece of paper in their older forms , one quickly sees why .
I have marked the angles with " o "s .
No 1 has one angle .
No 2 has two angles .
No 3 has three angles .
etc .
and " O " has no angles
Unless , that is , your establishment is a doctor ’s office , medical clinic , or hospital .
Mounting clinical evidence suggests that better design can improve patients ’ health — not to mention their morale .
But the one - sixth of the American economy devoted to health care has n’t kept up with the rest of the economy ’s aesthetic imperative , leaving patients to wonder , as a diabetes blogger puts it , “ why hospital clinic interiors have to feel so much like a Motel 6 from the ’ 70s . ”
A Hyatt from the early ’ 80s might be more accurate .
The United States is in the midst of a hospital - building boom , with some $ 200 billion expected to be spent on new facilities between 2004 and 2014 .
Although more spacious and sunlit than the 50 - year - old boxes they often replace , even new medical centers tend to concentrate their amenities in public areas , the way hotels used to feature lavish atriums but furnish guest rooms with dirt - hiding floral bedspreads and fake - wood desks .
Hospital lobbies may now have gardens , waterfalls , and piano music , but that does n’t mean their patient rooms , emergency departments , or imaging suites are also well designed .
“ Except for the computers you see , it ’s like a 1980s hospital , ” says Jain Malkin , a San Diego–based interior designer and the author of several reference books on health - care design .
“ The place where patients spend their time 24/ 7 is treated as if it ’s back - of - the - house . ”
Consider diagnostic imaging departments .
MRIs and CT scans can frighten many patients , and research shows that simple elements such as nature photos can ease their stress .
Yet the typical scanner room still looks “ as if it ’s a workshop for cars , ” says Malkin , with bare walls and big machines .
One of the bleakest rooms at the UCLA Medical Plaza , where I spend my time , is a waiting room in the imaging center .
Small and beige , it epitomizes aesthetic neglect , with stained chairs , mismatched tiles , and tattered copies of U.S. News & World Report .
The only wall art is a drug - company poster on myocardial perfusion imaging — just the thing to comfort anxious patients .
Cost is of course an issue .
Malkin estimates that enhanced design amenities can add about 3 percent to the cost of a large project .
The big shortage , though , is not money but attention .
When hospital boards and executives talk with architects and designers , it ’s rarely about the imaging department .
Also , unlike a hotel , a medical center rarely trains its staff to pay attention to how the place looks to guests .
Hence the often - torn drug posters , teddy bears , and countertop clutter .
If you work somewhere every day , after a while you do n’t notice eight - year - old snapshots and peacock feathers too tall for the space .
The ad hoc , staff - oriented decorating that fills an aesthetic vacuum can be worse than bare walls .
Lee Mequet , a Southern California real - estate agent , recalls a chemotherapy visit with her husband , who was so ravaged by lung cancer that his skull and bones showed under his skin .
The treatment room , she says , was “ decorated for Halloween , with pumpkins and paper skeletons , and the tragicomic horribleness of the images made me want to rip the fucking things from the wall . ”
Alas , cable TV has yet to create a makeover show called Designed to Heal .
TORONTO ( AP )  Canada 's border control agency does n't know the whereabouts of 41,000 people ordered to leave the country , a national government watchdog agency said Tuesday .
The report by Auditor General Sheila Fraser criticized the Canada Border Services Agency for failing to monitor observance of its removal decisions .
The agency said in the report that it agreed with all of the auditor 's recommendations for improvements .
Fraser 's report said the agency lacked contact information for 41,000 of the 63,000 people ordered to leave the country as of September 2007 .
It said the majority ordered deported were rejected refugee applicants and did n't pose " a very high risk to the public . "
The report said the agency removed about 12,600 individuals in 2006 and 2007 , including 1,900 criminals who " posed a high risk to Canada . "
The border agency has the power to detain foreign nationals and permanent residents who are considered a risk or danger to the public and to deport people ruled ineligible to enter Canada .
Canada has long prided itself for opening its doors to immigrants and asylum - seekers but critics have long complained that the United States ' northern neighbor is too lax on illegal immigration .
Parliament member Ujjal Dosanjh of the opposition Liberal party criticized the government for not doing more .
" How do we know that all 41,000 are harmless ?
We do n't know , " Dosanjh said .
The report said the precise number of people remaining illegally was impossible to determine due in part to the fact that the government does not record departures from Canada .
Some of the monitoring problems were traced to an aborted plan to replace a computerized case management system , originally intended to be in place three years ago .
" As a result , the agency 's ability to track individuals in the detention and removal process remains limited , " the report said .
Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day said the government was acting on Fraser 's advice .
" The CBSA has already put in place quite a few of the recommendations that she has talked about , so we 're improving .
It 's not perfect yet but it 's a big improvement over what it has been , " Day said .

The savvy part : Gates ' fledgling company was able to retain rights to the new operating system , securing Microsoft 's place at the hub of the PC industry .
Later , Gates leveraged that monopoly into such complete dominance of the PC industry that Microsoft was able to collect payments from PC manufacturers for every PC they sold — even if those PCs did n't carry a Microsoft operating system .
No problem .
Gates immediately bought the rights to another operating system , QDOS , which he then recast as MS - DOS and sold to IBM .
The Microsoft monopoly was one part luck , one part business acumen .
The lucky part :
When IBM asked Microsoft to provide an operating system for its new personal computer in 1980 , Gates got the contract , even though he did n't have an OS to sell .
A look at some of Bill Gates ' most memorable moments at Microsoft , caught on tape .
In fact , the monopoly that Microsoft once had on computer operating systems was essential to the development of the computer industry , enforcing a de facto standard that permitted thousands of software and hardware companies to blossom .
And that was a good thing .
" A lot of people see Microsoft as the enemy of openness and innovation , but it 's worth remembering that it was the open architecture of the Microsoft - based PC that spurred massive creativity in both hardware and software and sped the adoption of computers both at home and at work , " Carr said .
" In his prime , Gates combined the monomania of the compulsive software programmer with the competitiveness of Attila the Hun , " said Nicholas Carr , author of Does IT Matter and The Big Switch .
As Gates prepares to retire from full - time work at Microsoft July 1 , after 33 years of doing everything from writing code to defending his company 's business practices in court , many people are saying ' good riddance ' to the man most techies loved to hate .
What the critics wo n't acknowledge is that it was Gates ' most obnoxious qualities that made it possible for the tech industry to grow as large as it has .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
He 's a merciless competitor , a shameless " fan " of other people 's ideas and an unapologetic monopolist .
And because of all that , Bill Gates has done more to create the thriving computer industry than anybody else .
That monopoly was bad for competitors who had arguably superior operating systems — including , later , IBM's OS / 2 .
And it was built in large part on appropriating the best ideas of other companies , from Gary Kildall 's CP / M to Apple 's Macintosh .
But the upside was enormous because the monopoly created a stable environment where entrepreneurs could develop new companies and new products around a common platform .
Without that standard , the computer industry in the 1990s would have resembled the web today : diverse , vibrant and flowering with abundant innovation , but also frequently broken because of the inability of disparate products to make the most basic connections with one another .
" Unlike oil , pharmaceutical or steel , monopolies are a necessary ingredient in the technology business , " Forrester Research founder George Colony wrote in a recent blog post .
" It 's only when de facto standards like Windows or de jure standards like HTML become dominant that usefulness soars . "
Contrast that to the state of the internet today .
While the web abounds in standards , a frequent problem is that companies do n't hew to them ( and since 1996 , Microsoft has been guilty of this behavior too ) .
Having trouble syncing your Google calendar with your Yahoo calendar ?
Wondering why your camcorder wo n't upload to your new Macbook , your iPod can't share files with your friends '
MP3 players and your mobile phone can't display webpages properly ?
All of these problems are traceable to a lack of widely supported standards .
Just imagine if the same chaos had reigned throughout the 1980s and early 1990s .
Hardware manufacturers like Dell , Hewlett Packard , Compaq and IBM would still be battling it out with incompatible systems .
And software like Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , WordPerfect and , yes , even Microsoft Office never would have achieved widespread success .
" [ Bill Gates ] made an unbelievable contribution , " said Netscape , Opsware and Ning founder Marc Andreessen , while speaking at a keynote with John Battelle at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco earlier this year .
" It 's hard to conceive what this industry would look like today if Microsoft had n't standardized the OS … I think the industry would be much smaller if that had n't happened . "
Of course , success breeds resentment , and Gates ' aggressive business practices — and less - than - polished personal style — made him many enemies .
" The problem is when you 're the biggest sequoia in the woods , everyone wants to cut you down , " said Paul Santinelli , a general partner with North Bridge Venture Partners , a venture capital firm .
Gates did n't help matters by overreaching once his company 's monopoly was firmly established .
" Gates became kind of a Godfather figure in the industry , demanding tributes from his partners and whacking those who threatened his power , " Carr said .
" So Microsoft deserves both praise for stimulating innovation and criticism for stifling it . "
And then there was the problem that many of Microsoft 's products simply did n't work that well .
Indeed , as the chorus of complaints about Windows Vista grows louder day by day , it could be said that Gates is leaving Microsoft at exactly the right time , before the company 's long decline sullies his reputation .
" If all that stuff worked right out of the box , we 'd all be out of a job , " said David Strom , an independent technology consultant and speaker in St. Louis .
Strom has a speech praising Gates for , among other things , effectively guaranteeing full employment for IT people called in to make Microsoft products work properly .
But while technologists may curse Gates ' aggressiveness and the buggyness of Microsoft software , they should also raise a glass to toast him as he departs the computer business .
" He did n't have the zest of a Philippe Kahn , or the elegance of a Steve Jobs , or the stage presence of a Larry Ellison .
But the guy revolutionized the PC industry , and that 's what people need to remember , " said Santinelli .
On a website he calls ExposeObama.com , Floyd G. Brown , the producer of the Willie Horton ad that helped defeat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 , is preparing an encore .
Brown is raising money for a series of ads that he says will show Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) to be out of touch on an issue of fundamental concern to voters : violent crime .
One spot already making the rounds on the Internet attacks the presumptive Democratic nominee for opposing a bill while he was a state legislator that would have extended the death penalty to gang - related murders .
“ When the time came to get tough , Obama chose to be weak .
. . .
Can a man so weak in the war on gangs be trusted in the war on terror ? ” the ad asks .
Though in this presidential race crime has taken a back seat to the war in Iraq and the economy , some Republicans think Obama is vulnerable on the issue -- and they hope to inject it into the campaign .

Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona have some sharply different views on crime , but in truth , the president has little to do with day - to - day law enforcement .
The vast amount of crime - fighting in the U.S. is done at the state and local level .
Moreover , the rate of violent crime nationally has been declining for more than a decade .
Critics say the issue of crime is used primarily to exploit voter fears and stir up prejudices .
Richard Nixon ’s pledge during the 1968 campaign to restore “ law and order ” was viewed as a subtle appeal to white racial prejudice .
The Willie Horton ad that made GOP consultant Brown famous focused on a black Massachusetts felon who raped a woman while on weekend furlough from prison .
Dukakis was governor at the time and supported the program .
“ Presidents do n’t deal with crimes .
Governors and mayors deal with crimes , ” said James Alan Fox , a criminal justice professor at Boston ’s Northeastern University .
“ These are relatively fringe issues for presidents .
Yet they certainly resonate when it comes to the electorate . ”
Brown is counting on that resonance .
“ There are many , many different votes that Barack Obama has taken over the course of his state Senate career that are going to show him to be absolutely missing in action when it comes to the question of controlling violent crime , ” Brown asserted in an interview .

He added : “ If he thinks it is not a significant issue , then he should talk to Michael Dukakis . ”
Conservative strategists say such ads can provide a window into a candidate ’s personal morality .
The issue of violent crime also is germane , they say , because of Bush administration efforts to steer more federal money to states for anti-terrorism programs rather than traditional crime - fighting ones , a policy that has riled many cash - strapped state and local governments .
Obama ’s campaign , and some independent observers , say Brown ’s work is misleading at best .
FactCheck.org , a political watchdog , has called the death penalty ad -- which suggests that Obama ’s vote made him responsible for the gang - related deaths of three youths -- “ reprehensible misrepresentation . ”
The legislation was largely symbolic , because many gang killers were already eligible for death under state law .
It also was running up against concern over the administration of the state death penalty law .
That concern ultimately led to a statewide moratorium on executions .
The Republican governor at the time , George Ryan , eventually vetoed the legislation .

Obama supporters take exception to the notion that their candidate is weak on crime .
“ I thought . . . he tried to strike a decent balance between solid law enforcement and protecting the rights of individuals , ” said Richard A. Devine , the Cook County state ’s attorney , who leads the largest prosecutor office in Illinois .
In the Legislature , Obama led the push for mandatory taping of interrogations and confessions to ensure fair treatment of the accused .
Devine said the gang - related death - penalty bill was “ really not moving us forward at all . ”
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt , asked about the ad , said : “ The Republicans will soon realize that trying to divert attention from McCain ’s plans to continue George Bush ’s failed policies on Iraq and the economy by launching long ago debunked attacks on Obama wo n’t work .
Sen .
Obama has a record that demonstrates he is both tough and smart on crime . ”
Advertisement
McCain , for his part , has mostly embraced the tough - on - crime ” stance of the last 25 years , including strict sentencing and a focus on the rights of victims .
Obama appears more interested in addressing what he sees as the root causes of crime , and even doing away with or modifying laws that set mandatory minimum sentences such as those in drug cases .
“ We will review these sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the blind and counterproductive warehousing of nonviolent offenders , ” he said in a speech at Howard University in Washington in September .
Obama supported the U.S. Sentencing Commission ’s move this year to reduce the sentences of about 20,000 federal inmates imprisoned for dealing crack cocaine .
McCain opposed the early release .
Obama also supports restoring cuts in federal aid to state and local government for putting more cops on the street under a program started in the Clinton administration .
McCain has indicated more cautious support for community - oriented policing and has said he wants to make sure federal dollars are spent effectively .

McCain opposes a federal ban on assault weapons that Obama backs .
But McCain has been vilified by the gun lobby on occasion .
He has supported federal legislation requiring background checks for people who buy firearms at gun shows , and the sharing of federal data about guns used in crimes with state and local law enforcement .
In a recent speech to the National Rifle Assn. , McCain portrayed himself as a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment .
But his past statements show that he thinks that some NRA positions “ actually threaten the interests of law enforcement , ” said Dennis Henigan , legal director of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence .
“ He was conspicuously silent on those when he spoke to the gun lobby . ”

This post has been appended with additional information .
In the wake of Sunday ’s killings in Colorado , Chuck Chadwick ’s phone has been ringing steadily .
In between calls from reporters , there ’s the occasional church calling to find out how to beef up security .
That ’s the former cop ’s job now , as head of security for one of the largest churches in Texas , and owner of a company , National Association of Church Security & Safety Management , that advises churches .
Most of them are megachurches .
“ We have massive control rooms and video surveillance and plainclothes people and bodyguards , ” Chadwick told me this afternoon , adding he tries to keep things inconspicuous .
But he says the need for such things existed long before last weekend ’s shootings .
“ We ’ve had down through the years … mass murders .
We had Wedgewood in ’ 99 , the guy up in Wisconsin , the guy in Sash , Texas and now this .
It does n’t really surprise me .
I think what it ’s brought to light is that church needs to have armed people … in a role .
We see a lot of churches sometimes that say , ‘ Oh yeah , get old Bubba over there with his concealed weapon permit and he can be our bodyguard and shoot anybody . ’
Well , there ’s various state regulations and licensing regulations that need to be followed and we help them with that . ”
Here ’s the highlights of the interview :
“ You ca n’t stop it from happening , you can only limit the scope . ” ( Listen – MP3 )
His message to churches that are reluctant to allow guns .
( Listen – MP3 ) Not surprised by Colorado ( Listen – MP3 )
The extent to which Minnesota churches are listening is unclear .
Megachurches Eagle Brook ( the largest church in the state ) , Mt. Olivet Lutheran Church , and Eden Prairie ’s Grace Church have not yet returned messages ,
At Living Word Church in Brooklyn Center , a megachurch that boasts 8,000 members , I was referred to the “ security department , ” which at least told me they had one .
“ We ’ve got it covered , but that ’s all I ’m going to say , ” said the man in charge of security .
A Star Tribune article today suggested local Catholics are at least thinking about it .
“ Maybe this is a wake - up call , ” said Dennis McGrath , director of communications for the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis .
“ An attack during a service is just such an aberration that we do n’t even think about it .
We have crisis plans ready for other things , like natural disasters .
Maybe it ’s time that we need one for this , too . ”
Churches and guns have been an uncomfortable mix in Minnesota .
A couple of years ago , an Edina church challenged the law allowing people to bring guns to church unless a sign ( above ) specifically banned them .
A judge agreed in a 2006 order , but churches may not ban guns from their parking lots .
Update Weds 7:52 a.m. – Fargo Forum newspaper surveys churches in its area on the subject .
Update Weds 10:02 a.m. – Tom MacNally , the chief operating officer at Mt. Olivet Lutheran Church , the largest Lutheran church in the region with 13,000 members , says the church has four police officers handling traffic , who also are available once worship service begins .
But “ if someone comes in with a rifle , we do n’t have a procedure for that , ” he said .
The church , however , has established a lockdown procedure .
In fact , MacNally says , the signs describing a lockdown process are being put up today .
He says the church did not get involved in the challenge of the concealed carry law because church officials were sensitive to being involved in a political stand on the issue , and because posting against handguns would have required the church to check all of those attending church to be sure they were n’t carrying a gun .
Update Weds . 1:01 p.m. Eagle Brook Church spokeswoman : “ We do n’t divulge our security arrangements . ”
Saturn 's rings are wide but very thin .
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of the rings edge - on in 1995 .
Saturn : jewel of the solarsystem , taker of breaths , ringed beauty .
Even veteran astronomers can't helpbut gasp when they see her through a small telescope .
Red Alert : Saturn 's ringsare vanishing .
Around the world , amateurastronomers have noticed the change ; Saturn 's wide open rings are rapidlynarrowing into a thin line .
Efrain Morales Rivera sends these pictures takenthrough a backyard telescope in Aguadilla , Puerto Rico :
" The rings havenarrowed considerably in the last year , " he reports .
" The Cassinidivision ( a dark gap in the rings ) is getting hard to see . "
Four hundred years ago , thesame phenomenon puzzled Galileo .
Peering through a primitive spy glass , hediscovered Saturn 's rings in 1610 and immediately wrote to his Medici patrons : " I found another very strange wonder , which I should like to make known totheir Highnesses ? . "
He was dumbfounded , however , when the rings winked outlittle more than a year later .
What happened ?
The same thing that 'shappening now : we 're experiencing a " ring plane crossing . "
As Saturngoes around the sun , it periodically turns its rings edge - on to Earth — onceevery 14 - to - 15 years .
Because the rings are so thin , they can actually disappearwhen viewed through a small telescope .
In the months ahead , Saturn 's rings will become thinner and thinner until , on Sept. 4 , 2009 , they vanish .
When this happened toGalileo in 1612 , he briefly abandoned his study of the planet .
Big mistake : ring plane crossings are good times to discover new Saturnian moons and faintouter rings .
It 'salso a good time to behold Saturn 's curiously blue north pole .
In 2005 the Cassini spacecraft flew over Saturn 's northern hemisphere and found the skiesthere as azure as Earth itself .
Saturn is a planet of golden clouds , but forsome reason clouds at high northern latitudes have cleared , revealing a dome ofsurprising blue .
For years , only Cassini hasenjoyed this view because from Earth , the blue top of Saturn was hidden behindthe rings .
No more : " Now that Saturn 's rings are only open 8 degrees , wecan finally view its northern hemisphere 's beautiful teal blue colored beltsand zones , which really did look blue through my 10 - inch telescope , " reports Dan Petersen of Racine , Wisconsin , who took thispicture on Feb. 24 , 2008 .
Galileo never understoodthe true nature of Saturn 's rings .
He did n't know that they were a disk - shapedswarm of orbiting moonlets ranging in size from microscopic dust to tumblinghouses .
( Scientists still are n't sure , but they may be debris from a shatteredmoon . )
He did n't even know the rings were rings .
Through his 17th - centurytelescope , they looked more like ears or planetary lobes of some kind .
Yet , somehow , his intuitionguided him to make a correct prediction : " they 'll be back , " orItalian words to that effect .
And he was right .
Saturn 's rings opened up againand scientists resumed their study .
In 1659 , Christaan Huygens correctly explained the periodic disappearances as ring plane crossings .
In 1660 , Jean Chapelainargued that Saturn 's rings were not solid , but made instead of many smallparticles independently orbiting Saturn .
His correct suggestion was not widelyaccepted for nearly two hundred years .
Almost 27 ring planecrossings later , we still marvel at Saturn .
Even with rings diminished , she isstill a breathtaking sight through the meanest of telescopes .
Indeed , this is agood week to look .
On Tuesday , March 18th ( skymap ) , and Wednesday , March 19th ( skymap ) , the nearly - full Moon and Saturn will be lined up in the same part ofthe evening sky .
That makes Saturn unusually easy to find :
Go outside aftersunset and look around for the Moon ; Saturn is the bright golden " star " nearby .
Point your telescope and , well , just try not to gasp .
LookingAhead :
If youmiss the March 18 - 19 encounter , try again on April 14 - 15 .
The Moon and Saturnwill be close together and the rings even narrower .

For as long as there has been international trade , there has been a need to make international payments .
To show up in person with gold or silver coins risked both your life and your wealth .
Centuries ago -- at least as far back as the early days of the silk road -- this problem was solved with informal financial networks -- networks that still serve the same functions today .
One array of such networks , with its roots in the Middle East , is called " hawala . "
If you wish to send some money to someone in another country , you can visit your local hawaladar and give him the sum in local currency .
The local hawaladar contacts ( by phone , fax , or email ) another hawaladar who then delivers an equivalent sum to the recipient in his or her local currency .
The hawaladars settle transactions between themselves in many different ways -- netting out transactions going in the opposite direction , financing trade , and so on .
Hawala transactions are quite cheap -- much cheaper than international transactions using banks , especially for small sums .
After the attacks of 9/11 , there was considerable suspicion that hawala networks were used to finance terrorism .
The resulting scrutiny failed to find much evidence of that ( although considerable evidence that the networks were used to evade currency controls and to launder money ) .
The hawala system depends on trust rooted in personal , family , ethnic , and cultural ties between individual brokers and their customers .
Because of that , they can operate even where legal systems are poorly developed or unstable .
Hawala systems operate today .
But , because the basis of trust in the system springs from ethnic and cultural ties , they are less accessible to people who do not have the same cultural background .
As it happens , though , there 's a very similar system that depends not on ethnic ties , but rather on linguistic ones -- the language of Esperanto .
Early on after the creation of Esperanto , there were various efforts to create a means for international payments -- because one of the first things people want to do once they can communicate with one another is to trade with one another .
The big international Esperanto organization , the UEA ( Universala Esperanto Asocio ) , automatically creates an account for each member .
By sending money to their local or national Esperanto association , members can add money to their account .
They can then transfer money to any other Esperantist in the world , simply by sending instructions ( by letter or electronically ) to the central office of the UEA .
The account is maintained in euros , but payments can be made in any currency .
Your local or national Esperanto organization may charge a fee ( or take a percentage ) when you put the money into your account , but once it 's there , payments between members are free .
The system is primarily used to buy books and magazines in Esperanto , to pay membership fees to Esperanto organizations , and to pay the costs of attending various Esperanto conferences , classes , and other events .
But the system can be used to make payments for any purpose .
You simply need to be a member of the UEA and be able to read and write Esperanto well enough to give the instructions and read the statements .
( You can learn that much Esperanto in an hour . )

Want to know when the " bottom " is finally in ?
The " bottom " will be close when buying real estate make sense as a sound business proposition .
This kind of foreclosed / distressed property is not even close to being a decent business proposition :
If you want to spawn " The Creature From the Black Lagoon , " then by all means fill up this abandoned McMansion 's pool :
What 's a sound business proposition ?
making a profit from day one , without the aid of any tax shenanigans .
At the real bottom in real estate cycles , you can buy a house or apartment and rent it out at market rates -- and make a profit on day one in cash - accounting terms .
If you can't rent the property out for a profit from day one , it is n't the bottom .
Untold numbers of inexperienced speculators bought homes with the untested notion that they could " rent it out " ( " buy to let " in the U.K. ) if flipping it for vast profits did n't work out .
Let 's go through the actual expenses of an absentee landlord / owner :
1. down payment .
The down payment is n't " free " : you could be earning 3 % or so in a money market / T- bill .
As pathetic as that is , it 's not zero .
If the down payment is n't earning more than 3 % , then why bother buying real estate ?
2. mortgage / borrowed money .
This is self - evident .
But wait -- there 's more !
3. property management .
Even if you do it yourself , it 's not " free " ; nobody 's time is free .
The standard fee is abour 5 - 6 % to handle the rental and collect the rent .
This does not cover gardening , upkeep , repairs , etc. -- those are extra .
Plus somebody has to respond to tenant complaints .
That 's not free , either .
4. property taxes .
Like weeds , these just grow constantly .
Do n't forget the special assessments .
5. advertising / marketing .
Sure , craigslist is free -- but somebody has to meet prospective tenants , process their rental applications , check their credit , etc .
Maybe that 's included in your property management fee , maybe not .
6. auto / truck expenses .
hauling stuff to the dump and driving to Lowes / Home Cheepo is n't free .
7. cleaning and maintenance .
When the tenant moves out , the place is n't perfect , no matter what you hope / what the lease says .
( And how good is that lease , anyway ?
Better add a couple hundred bucks for attorney 's fees if you 're smart . )
Ah , maintenance .
That covers quite a few costly items : appliances that die , carpets that wear out , hardwood floors stained by cat pee / soggy house plants , furnace filters , paint that gets grimy , etc .
Many pros figure 10 % of the rent goes ( eventually ) to repairs / maintenance .
If you stipulate the tenant takes care of the yard , be prepared to own a slum .
8. Insurance .
It 's nice if you could get homeowner 's coverage , but you can 't -- your rental is a commercial property .
Now you need liability coverage , too , not just fire insurance .
Nothing like a tenant " tripping on the broken concrete " to remind you of that .
9. repairs .
A building is a living thing which breaks down over time -- expecially if it's a cheaply built , poorly constructed McMansion / condo .
Windows break , paint peels , roofing leaks , flashing rusts , stairs rot , crummy veneer flooring delaminates , the list is endless .
10 . utilities .
Many landlords pay for water , but maybe you wo n't .
11 . fees and licenses .
Your city or county probably wants some business license fees from your landlording business .
One way or another , there 's sure to be some fees or licensing costs somewhere .
Maybe the city inspects the property for safety -- and bills you .
Some agency or municipality is sure to assess you something beyond property tax .
12 . Vacancies .
Yes , some premium properties are rarely empty , but do n't fool yourself -- the pros know vacancies are a fact of rental real estate life .
Most figure 5 % ( for premium properties ) to 10 % ( for less than premium ) .
OK , so let 's say a rental property rents for $ 1,500 / month in the real world .
In my neck of the woods , this would be a small 2 - bedroom , 1 - bath bungalow .
Maybe in your area , it would be a 4 - bedroom , 2 - bath home .
Regardless , the key is to add up the real - world expenses and see if owning the property pencils out as a business proposition .
Due to variations in property tax rates , it 's difficult to set a generic cost to owning a house .
And of course , the property tax drops along with the value of the property .
To keep things simple .
let 's say the rental costs $ 300,000 and the owner bought it with no down payment .
According to zillow.com 's mortgage estimation tool , a $ 300 K mortgage at 6 % ( 30 - year fixed - rate ) costs $ 2,124 / month or $ 25,500 a year .
A rough guesstimate of all the non-mortgage expenses listed above for a $ 300 K property comes to between $ 8,000 and $ 9,000 , so let 's take the lower number .
( Insurance and other costs vary widely , too . ) $ 8 K + $ 25 K = $ 33 K in expenses against $ 18 K in annual income .
A $ 15,000 per year loss is not a good business proposition .
So let 's lower the price to $ 200,000 .
The mortgage drops to $ 18,000 a year , and the lower valuation shaves $ 1,000 off the property tax .
So $ 7 K + $ 18 K = $ 25 K versus an annual income of $ 18 K .
A $ 7,000 annual loss is a lousy business proposition .
So let 's drop the price down to $ 150,000 .
The mortgage drops to $ 1,224 / month or $ 14,600 annually .
Let 's shave another $ 1,000 off the property tax ( too bad for the city / county depending onrising property tax revenues ) and assume all non-mortgage expenses can be reduced to $ 6,000 per year .
$ 14.5 K + $ 6 K = $ 20.5 K versus $ 18,000 rental income : we 're down to a $ 2,500 annual loss .
So let 's ratchet the pruchase price down to $ 130,000 .
Now the mortgage is only $ 13,000 a year and the non-mortgage expenses , well let 's say they 're down to $ 5,500 a year .
$ 13 K + $ 5.5 K = $ 18.5 K against $ 18 K in rental income .
Hey , we 're finally getting close to breakeven here .
An actual , honest profit is just around the corner .
So let 's assume a purchase price of $ 126,000 for the house which rents for $ 1,500 per month ( $ 18,000 a year ) .
Now at long last we can anticipate a modest profit -- unless of course the property sits vacant more than a few weeks out of the year .
Real estate investment pros have a rule of thumb for establishing fair value of rental property .
Multiply the annual gross rental by between 6 and 10 ; that gives you a " business " estimate of the value of the rental .
In not - so - great neighborhoods , a multiple of 6 is standard ; a house that rents for $ 18,000 a year would thus be worth $ 108,000 .
A moderate neighborhood would fetch a multiple of 7 -- magically , our $ 126,000 number .
Premium neighborhoods ( where it is presumed you can raise the rents ) may be worth 8 to 10 times gross annual rents .
So even in a wonderful neighborhood with terrific schools and other assets , a house renting for $ 18,000 a year is worth no more than $ 175,000 - - as a business proposition .
Of course you can pay more , but you 're paying for " blue sky , " not an asset that can be sold on the open market as a business proposition .
There are many other variables , of course ; if interest rates climb , then the cost of the property has to decline further to make investment sense .
Nonetheless , we can say with great historical accuracy that housing of any sort which can be purchased for a multiple of 6 or 7 is a sound investment .
History suggests that only when properties are selling for these low multiples can we discern the " bottom . "
And when will that occur ?
If we look at the chart of mortgage re-sets , we see the non-subprime re-sets really start rising in 2009 and keep increasing all the way through 2011 before finally falling off in 2012 .
Since we can also anticipate the recession will be neither shallow nor short , there are ample reasons to expect the inventory of unsold homes to rise in inverse proportion to the number of qualified , willing buyers .
What does an oversupply of merchandise ( houses ) and a dearth of demand / buyers lead to ?
Falling prices .
It 's easy to multiply a number by 7 .
That big house down the street that rents for $ 3,000 a month / $ 36,000 a year ?
At the real " bottom , " that house will sell for about $ 250,000 ( or less ) .
That condo which rents for $ 1,200 / month / $ 14,000 a year ?
$ 100,000 , tops .
And so on .
Can real estate decline in value ?
Yes .
At what point does it make sense to buy real estate as an investment which bests other business opportunities ?
When it makes a profit on day one , after all expenses , not just mortgage / property tax / insurance .
And what 's a time - tested method of figuring that price ?
Seven times gross annual rental income .
Calling the bottom wo n't be that difficult ; it requires only patience and simple arithmetic .
One caveat : if a property can't be rented at any price , its value is essentially zero .

This week , seven federal officers died in a gun battle with cartel henchmen when they tried to enter a house in Culiacán , Sinaloa , a city notorious for its traffickers .
The officers had been sent to the city , along with 2,700 other soldiers and agents , to track down a reputed drug kingpin believed to have ordered the assassination of the acting federal chief of police , who was killed in Mexico City on May 8 .
Image In Villa Ahumada , Mexico , on May 18 .
The night before , dozens of gunmen killed six people in the town , including two civilians who were together in a pickup truck , and abducted others .
Credit ... El Heraldo de Chihuahua
When the police arrived , banners were hung in the city taunting the officers and saying the reputed kingpin , Arturo Beltrán Leyva , reigned supreme in Culiacán .
In Villa Ahumada less than two weeks after the massacre , people remained so cowed that even the mayor and his police commissioner declined requests to be interviewed .
When asked who the gunmen were and why they had come , most of the residents who were interviewed shook their heads and whispered that spies were everywhere .
In private , however , some acknowledged that the town had long been home to narcotics traffickers in league with a reputed drug dealer , Pedro Sánchez Arras .
Frightened residents , who did not want to be identified , said Mr. Sánchez ’s agent in the town was Gerardo Gallegos Rodelo , a 19 - year - old tough guy who went around with an armed posse .
It was rumored that he and Mr. Sánchez had links to a drug cartel in Ciudad Juárez that is controlled by the Carrillo Fuentes family .
Law enforcement officials did not confirm the claim .
Several residents said Mr. Gallegos and Mr. Sánchez had also seemed to enjoy good relations with the local police .
People shrugged and tolerated the arrangement .
The town was peaceful , after all , some said .
It seemed best to leave well enough alone .
“ Wherever you are in Mexico these days there are drug dealers , not just here , ” explained Raúl Moreno , 64 , a day laborer .
“ They did n’t bother anyone .
No one bothered them . ”
The trouble started , people here say , when Mr. Gallegos was killed in a shootout with a group of reputed gangsters in Hidalgo del Parral , in the southern part of Chihuahua State , on April 6 .
" About two years ago , " Simon writes , " I worked for a small telecommunications company .
Turnover was fairly high , leaving not much consistency in the way applications were developed . "
" Shortly after starting , I was tasked with fixing a report .
For whatever reason , it would n't show any data newer than two months .
So , I went to the reporting website and loaded up the report page .
Eight minutes of watching the hourglass cursor turn , I verified that the report did not , in fact , display any new data .
So I dug in to the report code .
" What first greeted me was a few hundred lines of integer declarations ...
int iCompany1Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany2Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany3Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany4Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany5Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany6Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany7Nov2003 = 0 ; int iCompany1Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany2Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany3Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany4Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany5Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany6Dec2003 = 0 ; int iCompany7Dec2003 = 0 ; ... snip ... int iCompany5Dec2009 = 0 ; int iCompany6Dec2009 = 0 ; int iCompany7Dec2009 = 0 ;
" Continuing down the code file , my next discovery was this ...
iCompany1Nov2003 = getTotals ( con , " Company1 " , 11 , 2003 ) ; iCompany2Nov2003 = getTotals ( con , " Company2 " , 11 , 2003 ) ; iCompany3Nov2003 = getTotals ( con , " Company3 " , 11 , 2003 ) ; iCompany4Nov2003 = getTotals ( con , " Company4 " , 11 , 2003 ) ; ... snip ... iCompany5Oct2005 = getTotals ( con , " Company5 " , 10 , 2005 ) ; iCompany6Oct2005 = getTotals ( con , " Company6 " , 10 , 2005 ) ; iCompany7Oct2005 = getTotals ( con , " Company7 " , 10 , 2005 ) ;
" And below that was a few hundred more lines of commented - out calls to ' getTotals ( ) ' .
It went all the way to December of 2009 .
It should come as no surprise what getTotals ( ) was like ...
int getTotals ( dbCon , companyCode , month , year ) { rows [ ] = dbConn.exec( " SELECT * FROM company_trans " " WHERE companyCode = ?
AND month = ?
AND year = ? " , companyCode , month , year ) ; return rows .
length ; }
" So , if you 're keeping count ... for the basic report , we had a total of 168 individual queries on the ( unindexed ) company_trans table , which contained a good 3 million + rows .
Of course , that was just the code to get the data ; beneath all the queries was code to display the results .
Want to guess what that looked like ?
... out ( " < td > " + iCompany1Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany2Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany3Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany4Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany5Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany6Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + iCompany7Nov2003 + " < /td > " ) ; out ( " < td > " + ( iCompany1Nov2003 + iCompany2Nov2003 + ... + iCompany7Nov2003 " < /td > " ) ; ...
" ... and so on .
All told , the simple report spanned well over 3,000 lines .
Fortunately , all I had to do was uncomment the two months and pray that someone else would get stuck with it next month !
" Just kidding .
I rewrote the report to use a simple GROUP BY query , added a loop to display the results , and managed to get it running in less than three seconds .
" When I showed my lead the old code and the new , he responded , ah , that must have been Jed Code ; yeah , he really hated anything that had to use arrays or loops , he could n't see the point of them ...
I think each month he would uncomment the next month and redeploy the application
And in case you 're wondering ... no , it was n't that Jed .
Clearly , there were n't enough comments .
Voters in Ireland are ready to wreck EU treaty , pollsters say
Voters in Ireland could scupper the controversial EU treaty , a poll suggests .
The survey , just days before the referendum , found that the ' No ' vote had surged into the lead for the first time .
Of those polled , 35 per cent said they would vote to derail the Lisbon Treaty on Thursday - double the number three weeks ago .
Meanwhile , those planning to vote in favour dropped from 35 per cent to 30 per cent , the Irish Times poll found .
The leader of the SDLP Mark Durkan ( left ) and Irish Labour party leader Eamon Gilmore ( right ) speaking at a press conference in Belfast , Northern Ireland in May , urging voters to vote pro-Europe
The treaty must be passed unanimously by all 27 member states .
It has been waved through by the other 26 countries , including Britain , despite fears over the loss of national sovereignty .
But Ireland has a legal obligation to put it to the public - and a ' No ' vote would kill it off .
Opponents say that the treaty will enable the creation of a permanent EU president , foreign minister and diplomatic service , surrendering almost 50 national vetoes to Brussels .
But in March , MPs in Britain voted against holding a referendum .
Labour and the Liberal Democrats scuppered calls to give voters the chance to decide on the revamped constitution , despite manifesto pledges from both to hold a ballot .
Gordon Brown has repeatedly claimed the ' constitutional concept ' had been abandoned and has resisted calls for a vote .
The Prime Minister said the treaty was ' substantially different ' to the constitution rejected by France and Holland in 2005 .
He argued that Britain was different because ministers had negotiated to protect key 'red lines ' on crime and justice , human and social rights , foreign policy and taxes .
Neil O'Brien , director of the eurosceptic think - tank Open Europe , fears that the Irish government is likely to hold a second referendum if the ' Yes ' campaign is defeated next week .
But last month , European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso suggested that a ' No ' vote would be catastrophic for the EU .
In a series of mini-referendums held across Britain by the I Want A Referendum campaign group this year , 88 per cent demanded a vote on the treaty .
And on Wednesday , the House of Lords is due to vote on the treaty .
But an amendment to secure a national poll looks likely to be defeated .
William Hague , the Tory foreign affairs spokesman , said : ' How the Irish vote on the EU Treaty is for the Irish to decide .
' But the great thing for Ireland is that they 're being given a choice the rest of us are being denied .
Every test of public opinion shows that the vast majority of British people want to have their say on this treaty .
' After all , that 's exactly what Gordon Brown promised the country at the last election . '
Viewing Climate Change Through The Lens Of Trauma , Zhiwa Woodbury & Peter Melton
My Brother Austin Asked Me to Go to Syria with Him .
Four Months Later , He Was Taken
On August 14 , 2012 , at a checkpoint outside Damascus , Austin Tice disappeared .
Last May , a fax arrived at the London office of the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al Awsat from a shadowy figure in the radical Islamist movement who went by many names .
Born Sayyid Imam al - Sharif , he was the former leader of the Egyptian terrorist group Al Jihad , and known to those in the underground mainly as Dr. Fadl .
Members of Al Jihad became part of the original core of Al Qaeda ; among them was Ayman al - Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden ’s chief lieutenant .
Fadl was one of the first members of Al Qaeda ’s top council .
Twenty years ago , he wrote two of the most important books in modern Islamist discourse ; Al Qaeda used them to indoctrinate recruits and justify killing .
Now Fadl was announcing a new book , rejecting Al Qaeda ’s violence .
“ We are prohibited from committing aggression , even if the enemies of Islam do that , ” Fadl wrote in his fax , which was sent from Tora Prison , in Egypt .
Dr. Fadl had laid the intellectual foundation for Al Qaeda ’s murderous acts .
His defection posed a terrible threat .
Illustration by John Ritter
Fadl ’s fax confirmed rumors that imprisoned leaders of Al Jihad were part of a trend in which former terrorists renounced violence .
His defection posed a terrible threat to the radical Islamists , because he directly challenged their authority .
“ There is a form of obedience that is greater than the obedience accorded to any leader , namely , obedience to God and His Messenger , ” Fadl wrote , claiming that hundreds of Egyptian jihadists from various factions had endorsed his position .
Two months after Fadl ’s fax appeared , Zawahiri issued a handsomely produced video on behalf of Al Qaeda .
“ Do they now have fax machines in Egyptian jail cells ? ” he asked .
“ I wonder if they ’re connected to the same line as the electric - shock machines . ”
This sarcastic dismissal was perhaps intended to dampen anxiety about Fadl ’s manifesto — which was to be published serially , in newspapers in Egypt and Kuwait — among Al Qaeda insiders .
Fadl ’s previous work , after all , had laid the intellectual foundation for Al Qaeda ’s murderous acts .
On a recent trip to Cairo , I met with Gamal Sultan , an Islamist writer and a publisher there .
He said of Fadl , “ Nobody can challenge the legitimacy of this person .
His writings could have far - reaching effects not only in Egypt but on leaders outside it . ”
Usama Ayub , a former member of Egypt ’s Islamist community , who is now the director of the Islamic Center in Münster , Germany , told me , “ A lot of people base their work on Fadl ’s writings , so he ’s very important .
When Dr. Fadl speaks , everyone should listen . ”
Although the debate between Fadl and Zawahiri was esoteric and bitterly personal , its ramifications for the West were potentially enormous .
Other Islamist organizations had gone through violent phases before deciding that such actions led to a dead end .
Was this happening to Al Jihad ?
Could it happen even to Al Qaeda ?
A Theorist Of Jihad
The roots of this ideological war within Al Qaeda go back forty years , to 1968 , when two precocious teen - agers met at Cairo University ’s medical school .
Zawahiri , a student there , was then seventeen , but he was already involved in clandestine Islamist activity .
Although he was not a natural leader , he had an eye for ambitious , frustrated youths like him who believed that destiny was whispering in their ear .
So it was not surprising that he was drawn to a tall , solitary classmate named Sayyid Imam al - Sharif .
Admired for his brilliance and his tenacity , Imam was expected to become either a great surgeon or a leading cleric .
( The name “ al - Sharif ” denotes the family ’s descent from the Prophet Muhammad . )
His father , a headmaster in Beni Suef , a town seventy - five miles south of Cairo , was conservative , and his son followed suit .
He fasted twice a week and , each morning after dawn prayers , studied the Koran , which he had memorized by the time he finished sixth grade .
When he was fifteen , the Egyptian government enrolled him in a boarding school for exceptional students , in Cairo .
Three years later , he entered medical school , and began preparing for a career as a plastic surgeon , specializing in burn injuries .
Both Zawahiri and Imam were pious and high - minded , prideful , and rigid in their views .
They tended to look at matters of the spirit in the same way they regarded the laws of nature — as a series of immutable rules , handed down by God .
This mind - set was typical of the engineers and technocrats who disproportionately made up the extremist branch of Salafism , a school of thought intent on returning Islam to the idealized early days of the religion .
Imam learned that Zawahiri belonged to a subterranean world .
“ I knew from another student that Ayman was part of an Islamic group , ” he later told a reporter for Al Hayat , a pan-Arabic newspaper .
The group came to be called Al Jihad .
Its discussions centered on the idea that real Islam no longer existed , because Egypt ’s rulers had turned away from Islamic law , or Sharia , and were steering believers away from salvation and toward secular modernity .
The young members of Al Jihad decided that they had to act .
In doing so , these men were placing their lives , and perhaps their families , in terrible jeopardy .
Egypt ’s military government , then led by Gamal Abdel Nasser , had a vast network of informers and secret police .
The prisons were brimming with Islamist detainees , locked away in dungeons where torture was routine .
Despite this repressive atmosphere , an increasing number of Egyptians , disillusioned with Nasser ’s socialist , secular government , were turning to the mosque for political answers .
In 1967 , Nasser led Egypt and its Arab allies into a disastrous confrontation with Israel , which crushed the Egyptian Air Force in an afternoon .
The Sinai Peninsula soon passed to Israeli control .
The Arab world was traumatized , and that deepened the appeal of radical Islamists , who argued that Muslims had fallen out of God ’s favor , and that only by returning to the religion as it was originally practiced could Islam regain its supremacy in the world .
In 1977 , Zawahiri asked Imam to join his group , presenting himself as a mere delegate of the organization .
Imam told Al Hayat that his agreement was conditional upon meeting the Islamic scholars who Zawahiri insisted were in the group ; clerical authority was essential to validate the drastic deeds these men were contemplating .
The meeting never happened .
“ Ayman was a charlatan who used secrecy as a pretext , ” Imam said .
“ I discovered that Ayman himself was the emir of this group , and that it did n’t have any sheikhs . ”
In 1981 , soldiers affiliated with Al Jihad assassinated the President of Egypt , Anwar Sadat — who had signed a peace treaty with Israel two years earlier — but the militants failed to seize power .
Sadat ’s successor , Hosni Mubarak , rounded up thousands of Islamists , including Zawahiri , who was charged with smuggling weapons .
Before he was arrested , Zawahiri went to Imam ’s house and urged him to flee , according to Zawahiri ’s uncle Mahfouz Azzam .
Imam ’s son Ismail al - Sharif , who now lives in Yemen , says that this never happened .
In fact , he claims , Zawahiri later put Imam in danger , by disclosing his name to interrogators .
During the next three years , these two men , who had once been so profoundly alike , began to diverge .
Zawahiri , who had given up the names of other Al Jihad members as well , was humiliated by this betrayal .
Prison hardened him ; torture sharpened his appetite for revenge .
He abandoned the ideological purity of his youth .
Imam , by contrast , had not been forced to face the limits of his belief .
He had slipped out of Egypt and made his way to Peshawar , Pakistan , where the Afghan resistance against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was based .
Imam left his real identity behind and became Dr. Fadl .
It was common for those who joined the jihad to take a nom de guerre .
He adopted the persona of the revolutionary intellectual , in the tradition of Leon Trotsky and Che Guevara .
Instead of engaging in combat , Fadl worked as a surgeon for the injured fighters and became a spiritual guide to the jihad .
Zawahiri finished serving his sentence in 1984 , and also fled Egypt .
He was soon reunited in Peshawar with Fadl , who had become the director of a Red Crescent hospital there .
Their relationship had turned edgy and competitive , and , besides , Fadl held a low opinion of Zawahiri ’s abilities as a surgeon .
“ He asked me to stand with him and teach him how to perform operations , ” Fadl told Al Hayat .
“ I taught him until he could perform them on his own .
Were it not for that , he would have been exposed , as he had contracted for a job for which he was unqualified . ”
In the mid-eighties , Fadl became Al Jihad ’s emir , or chief .
( Fadl told Al Hayat that this was untrue , saying that his role was merely one of offering “ Sharia guidance . ” )
Zawahiri , whose reputation had been stained by his prison confessions , was left to handle tactical operations .
He had to defer to Fadl ’s superior learning in Islamic jurisprudence .
The jihadis who came to Peshawar revered Fadl for his encyclopedic knowledge of the Koran and the Hadith — the sayings of the Prophet .
Usama Ayub , who was in Peshawar at the time , remembered , “ He would say , Get this book , volume so - and - so , and he would quote it perfectly — without the book in his hand ! ”
Kamal Helbawy , a former spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood , the Egyptian Islamist group , was also in Peshawar , and remembers Fadl as a “ haughty , dominating presence , ” who frequently lambasted Muslims who did n’t believe in the same doctrines .
A former member of Al Qaeda says of Fadl , “ He used to lecture for four or five hours at a time .
He would say that anything the government does has to come from God , and if that ’s not the case then people should be allowed to topple the ruler by any means necessary . ”
Fadl remained so much in the background , however , that some newer members of Al Jihad thought that Zawahiri was actually their emir .
Fadl is “ not a social man — he ’s very isolated , ” according to Hani al - Sibai , an Islamist attorney who knew both men .
“ Ayman was the one in front , but the real leader was Dr. Fadl . ”
Fadl resented the attention that Zawahiri received .
( In the interview with Al Hayat , Fadl said that Zawahiri was “ enamored of the media and a showoff . ” )
And yet he let Zawahiri take the public role and give voice to ideas and doctrines that came from his own mind , not Zawahiri’s .
This dynamic eventually became the source of an acrimonious dispute between the two men .
The Rift
In Peshawar , Fadl devoted himself to formalizing the rules of holy war .
The jihadis needed a text that would school them in the proper way to fight battles whose real objective was not victory over the Soviets but martyrdom and eternal salvation .
“ The Essential Guide for Preparation ” appeared in 1988 , as the Afghan jihad was winding down .
It quickly became one of the most important texts in the jihadis ’ training .
The “ Guide ” begins with the premise that jihad is the natural state of Islam .
Muslims must always be in conflict with nonbelievers , Fadl asserts , resorting to peace only in moments of abject weakness .
Because jihad is , above all , a religious exercise , there are divine rewards to be gained .
He who gives money for jihad will be compensated in Heaven , but not as much as the person who acts .
The greatest prize goes to the martyr .
Every able - bodied believer is obligated to engage in jihad , since most Muslim countries are ruled by infidels who must be forcibly removed , in order to bring about an Islamic state .
“ The way to bring an end to the rulers ’ unbelief is armed rebellion , ” the “ Guide ” states .
Some Arab governments regarded the book as so dangerous that anyone caught with a copy was subject to arrest .
On August 11 , 1988 , Dr. Fadl attended a meeting in Peshawar with several senior leaders of Al Jihad , along with Abdullah Azzam , a Palestinian who oversaw the recruitment of Arabs to the cause .
They were joined by a protégé of Azzam ’s , a young Saudi named Osama bin Laden .
The Soviets had already announced their intention to withdraw from Afghanistan , and the prospect of victory awakened many old dreams among these men .
They were not the same dreams , however .
The leaders of Al Jihad , especially Zawahiri , wanted to use their well - trained warriors to overthrow the Egyptian government .
Azzam longed to turn the attention of the Arab mujahideen to Palestine .
Neither had the money or the resources to pursue such goals .
Bin Laden , on the other hand , was rich , and he had his own vision : to create an all - Arab foreign legion that would pursue the retreating Soviets into Central Asia and also fight against the Marxist government that was then in control of South Yemen .
According to Montasser al - Zayyat , an Islamist lawyer in Cairo who is Zawahiri ’s biographer , Fadl proposed supporting bin Laden with members of Al Jihad .
Combining the Saudi ’s money with the Egyptians ’ expertise , the men who met that day formed a new group , called Al Qaeda .
Fadl was part of its inner circle .
“ For years after the launching of Al Qaeda , they would do nothing without consulting me , ” he boasted to Al Hayat .

" Programming is planning how to solve a problem .
No matter what method is used -- pencil and paper , slide rule , adding machine , or computer - problem solving requires programming .

This is taken from the
Anyway back to what is programming ... " planning how to solve a problem " , note we are not actually solving a problem , the computer is going to do that for us .
If we could solve the problem ourselves we would have no need to write the program .
The premise for a program is that we do n't have the time , tenacity or memory capabilities to solve a problem but we do know how to solve it so can instruct a computer to do it for us .
A simple example of this is what is the sum of all integers from 1 - 10,000 .
If you wanted to you could sit down with a pencil and paper or a calculator and work this out however the time involved plus the likelihood that at some point you would make a mistake makes that an undesirable option .
However I can write and run a program to calculate this sum in less than 5 minutes
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers #include " stdio.h " # define MAX ( 10000UL ) int main ( int argc , char ** argp ) { unsigned long sum = 0 ; unsigned long number ; for ( number=1 ; number < =MAX ; number ++ ) { sum += number ; } printf ( " The sum of all integers from 1 - %lu is : %lu

( N+1 ) *( N/2 )
( 10000 + 1 ) *( 10000/2 ) = 10001*5000 = 50005000
So I have solved the problem of how to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 - 10000 and the computer has solve the problem of calculating the sum of all integers from 1 - 10000 .
And this is the crux of all computer programs ; you can not program a computer to solve a problem unless you know how to solve that problem .
There is no point even sitting at your computer with the intention of programming until you have the knowledge , be that a formula from a text book or a design document or a print out from a web page , of how you are going to set about solving the problem .
So programming is the production of a set of instructions that describe how a problem can be solved .
There are many languages in which these instructions may be written , for instance on the back of a bottle of shampoo you will often find the instructions describing how to solve the problem of making dirty hair clean :
Wet hair Rub in shampoo to create a lather Rinse Hair Repeat Note that because this set of instructions is aimed at human beings it makes a couple of assumptions .
In step 4 for instance it makes the assumption that normal English is in use and that the instruction will actually be read as  Repeat Once .
It is also likely that an human running these instructions will not repeat step 1 because their hair will already be wet so they will judge it unnecessary to repeat that step .
And that is one of the major differences between humans and computers .
Humans have judgement and free will and will not run any instruction they deem not required or nonsensical where as a computer will do exactly what it is told with no judgement on the need or sanity of the instruction .
Give the instructions above to your computer and it will never get out of the shower .
Tutorial 2 : How to Program I felt that this was a good point to start a tutorial on C/ C++ programming because clearly we need to have some idea of what we are trying to achieve before we start out .
I recently found this definition on the web which I rather like This is taken from the ROYAL PRECISION , Electronic Computer PROGRAMMING MANUAL for the LGP - 30 .
For those of you that have not heard of the LPG - 30 you may be forgiven because it was first made in 1956 and has long since gone out of production .
But it has the rather auspicious claim of being the type of computer that Edward Lorenz was using when he first noted the chaotic nature of weather systems .

However I can write and run a program to calculate this sum in less than 5 minutes This gives the result 50005000 .
As it happens I can verify this because I know that the sum of integers from 1 - N can be calculated as ( N+1 ) *( N/2 ) ( 10000 + 1 ) *( 10000/2 ) = 10001*5000 = 50005000

Heavy Drinkers ' Genes May Cut Cancer Risk Researchers find a tweaked gene that may help some heavy drinkers dodge cancer .
May 26 , 2008  --
Could your genes actually help lower the risk of getting cancer when drinking alcohol ?
A new study says that this may be possible .
Researchers from Lyon , France , found that some people with certain variations in a gene involved in breaking down alcohol in the body appear to have a lower risk for developing certain alcohol - related cancers .
Paul Brennan , head of the genetic epidemiology group at the International Agency for Research on Cancer , and his colleagues studied more than 3,800 people in Europe and Latin America who had cancers of the respiratory tract and upper digestive tract .
What they found is that those who had a particular variation in the genes known as ADH1B and ADH7 metabolized alcohol much faster than those without the variation -- about 100 times faster , to be exact .
The results were released Sunday in the journal Nature Genetics .
A Balance of Risk and Benefit
Several studies have shown that there are both risks and benefits to moderate alcohol intake .
But past research has also found that alcohol consumption is a risk factor for oral cancer .
However , this study found that having a variation of ADH1B or ADH7 may be " cancer protective " in people who are moderate to heavy drinkers .
The greater the amount of alcohol the people with the variant gene consumed , the more significant the protective effect researchers saw .
The study did not see the variant gene provide cancer protection in nondrinkers .
It 's like our bodies were designed to have this protective mechanism " kick in " in the event that we overindulge .
Now the bad news :
The benefits extend only to those of us who carry the gene .
In the study population , only approximately 3 percent to 12 percent were so lucky .
Take That Shot -- With a Grain of Salt
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 79,000 Americans die every year because of excessive alcohol use , making it the third - leading lifestyle - related cause of death for the nation .
Could this variant gene somehow help to minimize the negative effect of excessive alcohol intake ?
Maybe , and maybe not .
Many mixed messages exist when it comes to drinking .
In 2001 , researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women 's Hospital found that moderate alcohol consumption in people who have another version of this gene had lowered risk of heart disease .
However , they cautioned , " Heavy consumption of alcohol can lead to negative cardiovascular outcomes such as high blood pressure , heart attacks and sudden cardiac death .
Other doctors warn that even moderate drinking may raise the risks of colon and breast cancer , some types of stroke , fetal damage , driving accidents , abusive behavior and criminal activities . "
The study released Sunday may only marginally advance the debate over the balance between the risk and benefit of alcohol consumption , since this study was conducted in only two population groups -- Europeans and Latin Americans .
Still , Brennan notes in the study , " These results provide strong evidence that both ADH1B and ADH7 have an important association with susceptibility to [ upper ] digestive cancer .
The strong similarity of the results from different studies argues against population stratification or other biases . "
In other words , he explains , because these results are similar in studies around the world , their results could be applied globally .
But more evidence may be necessary to change the view of the World Health Organization , which states that light drinking is unlikely to lower heart disease risks in people who are already taking other lifestyle precautions , such as exercising regularly , not smoking and eating less fat .
According to WHO , the less you drink the better .
Drink to Your Health ?
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of and Health and Human Services defines moderate drinking as no more than one drink a day for women and people over 60 , and two drinks a day for men .
They recommend the following people should not drink at all :
Women who are pregnant or trying to conceive
People who plan to drive or engage in other activities that require attention or skill
People taking medication , including over - the - counter medications
Recovering alcoholics
People under the age of 21
As for cancer , there is good news .
The National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health said that " the rate of cancer incidence has declined since the early 1990s . "
With that in mind , this new study may suggest an added avenue of decline for alcohol - related cancers .

Forgetting the password of your email account might be a bit inevitable , particularly when you seldom use it on a daily basis .
As a result , it would be a huge inconvenience , which is very true if it is where your online activities are located .
This might also be the dilemma of some Gmail users , but it should n’t be the end of the world for you .
All you have to do is to recover your Gmail password , which is just an easy task .
It is understandable that when you forget your password , you would no longer have access to your Gmail account .
So , all you need to do to address this situation is to follow a few steps in order to recover your account .
The best thing that you can do is to go to the account recovery page of Google , which you can go by following this link : https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery?service=mail.
You might have previously linked your mobile phone number to your account .
If so , you can use it to retrieve the verification code via SMS .
You can also click on the Verify Your Identity by answering some security questions .
Take note that Google would consider your Gmail account as abandoned if you have not tried to access your account for 9 months or more .
In this case , Gmail might have deleted it from the server .
Therefore , you have no chance of recovering your lost password .
Upon the recovery process , there are things that you have to remember or recall .
Thus , you should have at least a secondary email address that you have specified for your Gmail account .
If so , you need to determine which email account was it , and try to recall the login credentials , so that you can use it to recover your lost Gmail account .
WASHINGTON , May 5 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) on Monday kicked off a hearing on Boeing Co's BA.N protest of a $ 35 billion U.S. Air Force refueling aircraft contract won by Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N and its European subcontractor EADS EAD .
PA .
A GAO spokesman confirmed the start of the hearing , but gave no details .
The congressional agency , which reviews contract disputes , is due to rule on the case by June 19 .
The hearing includes lawyers from Boeing , Northrop , and the Air Force , with three GAO officials hearing the various arguments , according to three sources familiar with the case , who said it could last all week .
“ This hearing will go on for days and days , ” said one of the sources , who asked not to be named .
“ Each side will put on what they think is the support for their key arguments . ”
Boeing , which was widely expected to win the competition for the new aerial refueling tankers , protested the Air Force decision vigorously in legal filings with the GAO and in newspaper advertisements .
It argues the Air Force was inconsistent in the way it assessed the bids .
A Boeing spokesman declined comment on the GAO hearing .
Northrop and the Air Force had no immediate comment .
The Air Force ’s acquisition chief , Sue Payton , is not expected to testify at the hearing , but other officials who headed assessments of specific aspects of the bids will be called , said two of the sources , who asked not to be named .
Loren Thompson , defense analyst with the private Lexington Institute , said the Air Force believed the GAO would find only minor problems with its handling of the competition , but no major issues that could lead it to sustain Boeing ’s protest .
“ The Air Force ’s working assumption is that the GAO will find some problems , but they will be minor and not the sort of thing that would result in a recommendation to recompete the contract , ” said Thompson , who has close ties to the Air Force .
Thompson said much of Boeing ’s protest was aimed at justifying the efforts of its backers on Capitol Hill , some of whom have vowed to reverse the Air Force ’s decision , even if the GAO upholds the contract award .
The Senate Armed Services Committee last week approved $ 893.4 million in research and development funding for the Northrop tanker , which the Air Force has dubbed the KC - 45A .
Chairman Sen. Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat , said he would not support action to halt the program before the GAO rules on the Boeing appeal .
Rep. John Murtha , the Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the House Appropriations defense subcommittee , said he would recommend blocking funding for the deal if the GAO recommended the competition be reopened .
Col .
Thomas Doyne , a senior Air Force official who works on space programs and policy for the Pentagon , warned against any delay in the tanker program , given that the current fleet of KC - 135 refueling tankers were 47 years old , on average .
“ A delay will simply make the thing more expensive in terms of the money , but also in terms of getting it fielded , ” Doyne said after a conference sponsored by the Atlantic Council .
Terry Pudas , a former top Pentagon official who now works at the National Defense University , told the conference that Northrop and EADS would face “ enormous scrutiny ” of their performance if the contract was allowed to stand .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Eurozone government deficit more than halved last year and debt fell too , data showed yesterday , with all countries sharing the single currency below the European Union ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
Government deficit in the 15 countries now using the euro fell to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2007 from 1.3 percent in 2006 and debt declined to 66.3 percent from 68.4 percent .
« This is the best figure ever , » European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a news briefing , referring to the deficit .
« This result demonstrates that the Stability and Growth Pact is working . »
The pact lays out EU budget rules , setting a ceiling of 3 percent of GDP for budget deficits and 60 percent of GDP for debt .
Germany , the eurozone 's biggest economy , made the biggest deficit cut of 1.6 percentage points , bringing its public finances into balance well ahead of a 2010 deadline agreed by eurozone finance ministers .
Italy slashed its shortfall by 1.5 percentage points to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 and Portugal reduced its deficit by 1.3 percentage points to 2.6 percent .
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said this week that as a result of these improvements the European Commission would propose on May 7 an end to EU disciplinary budget action against Rome and Lisbon .
But the French deficit increased to 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent despite government plans to cut it to 2.3 percent .
Public debt in France , the eurozone 's second - biggest economy , rose to 64.2 percent from 63.6 percent .
In the whole European Union of 27 countries , government deficit fell to 0.9 percent of GDP from 1.4 percent and debt dipped to 58.7 percent from 61.2 percent .
Hungary was the only EU member with a deficit higher than the bloc 's 3 percent ceiling and thus the only country likely to remain under the EU 's disciplinary budget procedure .
Nevertheless , Hungary 's deficit fell to 5.5 percent of GDP last year from 9.2 percent in 2006 .
The data showed the Commission should also end the disciplinary procedure against Poland , the biggest of the 12 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 , and Slovakia .
Estonia and Bulgaria kept budget surpluses .
The largest pro-independence demonstrations in the Tibetan capital in nearly two decades have rattled the Chinese government as it struggles to contain growing criticism of its human rights record in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics .
More than 500 Buddhist monks participated in marches toward the center of Lhasa , shouting slogans against China ’s 57 - year rule over Tibet .
Two of Tibet ’s three most important monasteries participated in the protests Monday and Tuesday .
Monks at the third , the remote Ganden Monastery in the mountains 29 miles from the capital , were said to have staged their own demonstration Wednesday , said Robert Barnett , a Tibet scholar at Columbia University in New York .
“ It is an astonishing development after 20 years that this is happening , ” Barnett said .
Activists quoting witnesses in Lhasa said Chinese security forces were setting up roadblocks around the city .

In another security move , China notified tour operators this week that Mt. Everest would be closed to climbers this year until May 10 .
Although the letter of notification cited environmental concerns , analysts say the Chinese want to avoid a repeat of an incident last year , when climbers made a video of themselves on Everest with a “ Free Tibet ” banner , and posted it on the Internet .
China has ruled Tibet since 1951 , and critics say it has stifled its culture , language and religion .
This week ’s protests marked the March 10 anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against China .
Separately , several hundred Tibetan exiles tried to march into Tibet from the north Indian town of Dharamsala , where the Dalai Lama presides over a government in exile .
Some were arrested .
The U.S. - funded Radio Free Asia ’s Tibetan - language service reported that it received a phone call Wednesday from a witness in the Ganden Monastery who said monks were demonstrating .
The service also reported fresh accounts of a protest Tuesday in which several hundred monks were seen marching near a police station .
“ There were probably a couple of thousand armed police . . . .
Police fired tear gas into the crowd , ” the witness was quoted as saying .

Although some witnesses said they heard gunshots , no serious injuries were reported .
The blockades kept the monks far from the city center , where they had hoped to demonstrate .
But the marches clearly rattled the Chinese government , which has been trying to fend off human rights activists from all corners of the globe using the Summer Olympics as a platform for their causes .
“ The Olympic charter requires that the Olympic Games not be politicized , ” Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said at a news conference Wednesday in Beijing .
Advertisement
He also criticized the Dalai Lama , saying the Tibetan spiritual leader ’s “ conspiracy to split Tibet from China and his secessionist attempt is doomed to fail , ” according to the official New China News Agency .
Tibet is a potentially explosive issue for the Chinese in this sensitive year because it commands a large international following with high celebrity interest .
The Chinese were shocked last month when Icelandic singer Bjork shouted “ Tibet , Tibet ! ” from a stage in Shanghai after performing her song , “ Declare Independence . ”
Kate Saunders , an official of London - based Free Tibet , said , “ We want to use the Olympics as a means of leverage on China to press for positive change . ”
Since 1988 , when a monk was shot to death for unfurling a Tibetan flag in Lhasa , the Chinese have kept such a large paramilitary presence in Tibet that protests against their rule have been virtually impossible .

Barnett said this week ’s events were linked to the Olympics and to resentments that have been pent up since 2005 , when Zhang Qingli , a confidant of President Hu Jintao , took over as head of the Communist Party in Tibet .
“ The control of Tibet has become more aggressive in the way they ’ve controlled religion and the aggressive language they ’re using about the Dalai Lama , ” Barnett said .
“ And deciding to route the Olympic torch through Tibet was really provocative .
They were setting themselves up for trouble . ”
Barnett noted , however , that the protests this week were handled with more sophistication than previously by the Chinese People ’s Armed Police force , which is stationed in Tibet .
In the 1980s , brutality toward the monks inflamed the general population , leading to riots .
The State Department this year dropped China from its list of worst abusers of human rights , but accusations continue .
Human Rights
Watch issued a report Wednesday charging the Chinese with systematically abusing migrant workers involved in Beijing ’s pre-Olympics construction boom .

Last week in Britain , some commentators were endorsing calls from the newly ennobled former New York mayor , Rudolph Giuliani , to jail cannabis smokers , and vilifying Brian Paddick , police commander of Lambeth , for telling an internet forum that the drug laws need reform .
To arrive in Holland 's fourth largest city is to cross a cultural chasm .
First there is the obvious : like most Dutch towns , Utrecht , population 300,000 , has its coffee shops , 40 of them , each selling dozens of brands of cannabis to smoke at the tables or take away .
In Holland , ideas considered dangerously radical in Britain attract little controversy .
' There is no war on drugs in the Netherlands , ' says Machel Vewer , a senior police detective who has spent the past decade working with addicts .
' What 's the point of making war on part of your own country ?
Drugs are here and they 're always going to be .
This is a social problem , not a criminal one , and the whole of society has to tackle it - not leave it to the police on their own .
' This means accepting that addicts are people too : that they have their backgrounds , their stories , and you have to respect them .
They can still lead useful lives , and they 're not a lost group .
If you look at England , France , Spain , they all have drug problems .
But Holland started thinking about how to deal with this much earlier .
We 're not deluded we can solve the problem entirely , but we can contain it , make it controllable .
You are 20 years behind . '
This is no utopia .
Around the stairwells and walkways of Hoog Catherijne , Utrecht 's addicts , many of them homeless , are highly visible : hunched , gaunt , unshaven .
The mall and its customers , brimming with prosperity , present an inevitable target for thefts to fund pur chases from dealers , which still remain illegal .
But measured against the near - catastrophe of drugs policy in Britain , the evidence suggests the Dutch are right .
Last summer I spent weeks researching two Observer articles about hard drugs in Britain .
As I rapidly discovered , the past decade has seen an explosion in Class A drug use , mainly crack and heroin .
Seizures by Customs and police have soared , but the price has fallen steadily , while the market has expanded far beyond its former inner-city strongholds .
In Cotswold villages of golden stone and tea shoppes , heroin can be summoned more easily than a takeaway meal .
As the drug research charity Drugscope confirmed last week , teenagers are progressing from cannabis to crack and heroin much more quickly .
With increasing drug dependency , drug - related crime has surged .
Good intentions and good ideas to deal with this crisis have not been lacking .
Since the mid-1990s , Governments have recognised the need to cut demand through education , and invested heavily in drug rehabilitation .
Yet , with the sole exception of the present Home Secretary David Blunkett 's move to reclassify cannabis as a Category C drug , the basic legal framework has remained untouched .
Commander Paddick can ask his officers not to arrest for smoking a spliff , but sanctioning coffee shops is not within his remit .
More radical reform remains a political taboo .
In Holland , drug policy begins with pragmatism .
Its central objective , says Harold Wychgel , of Drugscope 's Dutch equivalent , the Utrecht Trimbos Institute , 'is to reduce the risks posed by the use of drugs to the users themselves , people in their immediate vicinity , and society at large ' .
The Dutch accept that achieving this may require apparent contradictions and compromises .
Selling cannabis through coffee shops remains theoretically illegal .
' They could close me down tomorrow , ' says the manager of Utrecht 's largest , a fume - filled den in a fine Renaissance building by the banks of the Rhine canal .
Yet his trade is merely regulated , with the police checking that his bags of resin from the Middle East and potent hydroponic ' Nederweed ' weigh no more than 5g , and that none of his customers is under 18 .
The policy is rigorously enforced , says Vewer .
One shop was caught supplying to under - age smokers , and its licence was withdrawn .
In the coffee shops , the police are regulating businesses dependent on organised crime .
At their back doors , owners buy their supplies from criminal importers and traffickers , who just as in Britain are investigated , prosecuted and sent to prison .
Is this a problem ?
Vewer shrugs genially .
Apparently not .
The Rhine canal shop manager smiles .
' I 've been doing this for 25 years . '
He pauses .
' Buying is just ... well , allowed . '
In border areas , and in honeypots such as Amsterdam , coffee shops have boosted Holland 's income from tourists .
However , the reason they began to appear in 1976 was as a means of separating the markets for soft and hard drugs , and thus for closing the dealers ' ' gateway ' from cannabis to heroin and cocaine .
The policy may rely on a legal fudge , but the evidence that it works is overwhelming .
' Just look at the figures , ' says Wychgel .
' Heroin is just not an issue here in the Netherlands .
The number of addicts has been stable , at around 25,000 , for20 years .
And the addicts are getting older ; few youngsters are joining them . '
At an average £ 20 a gram , Dutch heroin is about half the price it is in England , where the fact that the drug is cheaper than it was in 1990 has helped dealers persuade their customers to transfer from cannabis .
Per head of population , Holland has perhaps a quarter of Britain 's addicts .
Meanwhile , Holland also has significantly fewer cannabis smokers , especially among teenagers .
From the age of 10 , children are given drugs education .
It tries , says Wychgel , to present the facts about drugs in a way which removes any sense of glamour , but leaves the decision up to the individual .
' We say , " It 's your responsibility , this is what drugs will do . "
We do n't tell kids simply " no " , we say " know " . '
Trimbos surveys 10,000 Dutch schoolchildren every four years .
The last study , in 1999 , showed a small decline in cannabis use - 20 per cent of those aged 15 - 16 had tried it , and 5 per cent smoked it regularly .
Less than one in 1,000 had tried heroin .
The same year the European Drug Monitoring Centre found 40 per cent of British children the same age had tried cannabis , and one in 50 had used heroin .
A similar pragmatism , with reducing harm as the governing principle , is visible in the way Utrecht deals with hard drugs .
The smoking and shooting rooms at Stationsplein form part of an impressive network of facilities .
Some deal with the homeless addict 's survival needs .
At the Inlope centre , beneath another part of the shopping mall , registered users can get a shower , clean clothes , cheap hot food , a game of pool and a respite from the rigours of the street .
The new Stek building , a smart bungalow next to a canal , combines drug - taking rooms with a cafe and common room .
From an addict 's point of view , the benefits are obvious .
' Before they built this place , ' says Martin , 34 , a crack and heroin user for 16 years , ' they hunted us .
You had to use on the street and look behind you .
Now you can really enjoy your stuff , and you 're not so stressed .
Life is much less aggressive .'
At the same time , Vewer argues , wider society is also better off .
The addicts ' centres provide immediate access to rehabilitation programmes and employment training for those who want them , and some work at the centres themselves , cleaning , cooking or washing clothes and bedding .
Ruud Laukon , a field coordinator from Utrecht 's main drug social work project , the Centrum Mallieban , works seamlessly with Vewer : ' We and the police have the same viewpoint .
If you treat addicts as criminals , they 'll treat you as criminals do .
Sending them to prison does n't solve anything . '
The addicts used to spend their days in a dark , fetid pedestrian tunnel beneath the Hoog Catherijne mall , which has now been closed .
Intimidating and dangerous for passers - by , it also saw frequent violence between addicts .
' It 's much easier now to have good relationships with them , ' Vewer says .
' It creates a set of rules , and the addicts know they have to abide by them .
It makes the scene much easier to control . '
Patrolling the mall with two uniformed policemen , Robert Wisman and Sander van der Kamp , the personal nature of that control is strikingly apparent .
Time and again , users greet the officers and stop to talk .
As we pass through the maze of shops and restaurants , they point out the known dealers , some of whom they have sent to prison .
In Utrecht , as in Britain , addicts steal to fund their habits .
As we walk , Wisman explains how the thin blue line tries to hold back crime .
' We have a lot of bicycle theft .
The addicts steal bikes and sell them to students .
And theft from cars : they break the windows , take the stereo ; and naturally some shoplifting , and a few pickpockets . '
How about robbery , muggings ?
Wisman stops and the two officers confer .
' I think there may have been one last year .
I 'm not sure .
It 's very rare . '
Car - jackings ?
They laugh .
' Not here . '
Official figures bear them out .
The Hoog Catherijne may be the centre of Utrecht 's drug scene , but crime is no more common there than anywhere else .
In 2000 , the International Crime Victims Survey confirmed the impression from the streets : the crimes typically committed by drug addicts - burglary , robbery , shoplifting and theft from cars - are all significantly more prevalent in Britain than in Holland .
Before boarding my train for the airport , I ask Wisman if he likes his job .
' Very much , ' he says .
' Sometimes I get a little depressed that there 's never going to be a real solution to the drug scene .
But then again , I certainly do n't think things are getting worse . '
His reply speaks volumes about the difference between the British and Dutch approaches to drugs and crime .
In Britain , successive politicians and police chiefs have vowed to defeat drugs , and in presenting their rhetorichave pumped up the enemy in the eyes of the public , exaggerating its strength and demonising addicts , using the media to create waves of what criminologists call ' crime panics ' .
The result has been an almost complete restriction on political room to manoeuvre .
In Holland , a calmer conception of the relationship between the state and citizen , and awareness of the state 's limitations , have created a strategy of containment and limiting harm , and where necessary , an expedient , pragmatic fudge .
There 's little doubt which has been more effective .

Top McCain economic advisor lobbied for mortgage bank RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann reported on Tuesday that the co-chair of Senator John McCain 's national campaign was lobbying Congress about the US mortgage crisis on behalf of a major Swiss bank at the same time that he was serving as an advisor to McCain on economic policy .
" Senator McCain 's dream of putting his lobbyist problem behind him [ is ] quite possibly turning into his own nightmare , " Olbermann noted .
Former Texas Senator Phil Gramm has been advising McCain on economic issues since 2006 .
The two men have been friends for many years , and Gramm is considered a likely treasury secretary in a McCain administration .
Gramm is a major proponent of deregulation and was deeply involved as a senator in passing bills -- from which his family benefited financially -- which led to both the California energy crisis and the current banking crisis .
Gramm currently serves as a vice chairman at the Swiss bank UBS , which he joined in 2002 , shortly before he left the Senate .
He was their registered lobbyist from 2004 until April 18 of this year , a period of time during which UBS was lobbying to kill the Predatory Lending Act , the Emergency Home Ownership and Mortgage Equity Protection Act , and the Helping Families Save their Homes in Bankruptcy Act .
Gramm was still actively lobbying for UBS on March 26 , when he contributed to a speech in which McCain recommended further deregulation as a response to the mortgage crisis .
Talking Points Memo notes that " UBS is among the banks worst hit by the global credit crisis , " with about $ 37 billion in assets tied to bad US mortgages .
UBS has now told members of a private banking team which advised wealthy American clients to avoid travel to the US , following the indictment of a former senior executive for helping a billionaire evade taxes .
Olbermann concluded by noting " the drip , drip , drip we 've talked about previously as he 's thrown out one lobbyist at a time from the campaign , with a zero tolerance lobbyist disclosure form ...
At the rate this is going , might the only solution for him to be -- to have zero people working on his campaign ? "
This video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast May 27 , 2008 .

In Rutherford B. Hayes ' hometown of Delaware , Ohio , there 's a memorial to the late U.S. president ; it 's a plaque that marks his birthplace , which is now a gas station .
In Paraguay , people might find this fact horribly offensive .
Perhaps that 's because the country is littered with Hayes memorials — from statues to schools to streets named in his honor .
There 's even a city in Paraguay called Villa Hayes , which lies in the middle of a province called Presidente Hayes , which is roughly the size of South Carolina .
What did Rutherford do to deserve all this ?
From 1864 to 1870 , Paraguay was engaged in one of the bloodiest wars in the history of the Americas — the War of the Triple Alliance .
Facing the combined forces of Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay , the people of Paraguay were mercilessly defeated .
Two - thirds of the country 's population died .
But even after the war ended , Argentina and Paraguay continued to scuffle over the Chaco , a huge tract of land in the southwest region of Paraguay .
Unable to come to a resolution , diplomats from both countries traveled to Washington , D.C. , so that President Hayes could arbitrate the debate .
As you 've probably guessed , Hayes decided in favor of Paraguay — and he 's been a national hero ever since .
Once every 50 years , Villa Hayes hosts a huge festival in his honor .
The next one is in 2028 , so mark your calendars .
Just about everyone loves the beach .
If you do n’t , then you just have n’t truly experienced an amazing beach yet .
The bright sun , endless blue skies , the sand beneath your feet , a cool breeze and the most crystal clear water you ’ve ever seen will be sure to win over your heart [ Wonderful beach trips ] .
Here are some of the secret sands ; to those who are looking for secluded beaches around the globe , where quiet coasts invite in - the - know sunbathers to savor their relative solitude .
Sure , some of these Travel destinations are downright remote , and require off - the - path travel .
Here are the Top Secluded Beaches ; for you to Enjoy !
Wildcat Beach , Point Reyes National Seashore , California
Since you have to walk more than five miles to reach it , you wo n’t be fighting the crowds for a spot on this isolated stretch of sand 30 miles north of San Francisco .
In the evening , if you have remembered to get the necessary permit ( this is a National Seashore , after all ) , build a fire at the tide line and toast your good fortune with marshmallows .
Cayo Costa , Florida
On a barrier island off Florida ’s southern Gulf coast , it is reachable only by private boat or a small public ferry that charges $ 25 per person for day visitors .
Once you arrive , though , count on having at least some of its nine miles of soft white sand all to yourself .
Pink Beach , Barbuda , Antigua and Barbuda
Yachtsmen and day - trippers to Antigua ’s sister island usually get no further than the beach at Low Bay , on the northwest coast of Barbuda .
Low Bay is pretty enough , and it ’s a convenient starting point for a visit to what is one of the world ’s largest frigate bird sanctuaries .
But the real beauty on the island is Pink Colour Beaches .
Essentially one huge sandbar , this flamingo - hued swath extends eight miles from Palmetto Point towards Spanish Point , at the southern end .
Los Frailes , Ecuador
Los Frailes is the image Ecuadorians hold up when they want to match their beaches against some of the most beautiful in South America .
Part of undeveloped Machalilla National Parks , the beach is often deserted , especially during the Ecuadoran winter in June and July .
Breathtaking Beaches Of Hawaii
Majahuitas Cove , Puerto Vallarta , Mexico
The day - trippers from Puerto Vallarta know this palm tree–backed beach , accessible only by boat , in a little cove at the southern end of Banderas Bay .
Although not a high - energy kind of place , the cove is perfect for snorkeling , kayaking , and trying not to feel superior to the people who have to take the return boat .
Store Beach , Sydney , Australia
As implausible as it might seem , there is indeed a hidden beach almost within a boomerang ’s throw of Sydney .
What ’s kept Store Beach — part of the Sydney Harbour National Park — hidden is that a guardian rank of rocks makes it accessible only by boat .
Polihua Beach , Lanai , Hawaii
To reach this beach , head north from Lanai City on the jeep trail inappropriately called the Polihua Highway , passing the weirdly sculptured landscape of the Garden of the Gods .
If you are in an open vehicle , you ’ll arrive looking like a sun-dried tomato .
Plage Blanche , Morocco
Few beaches take more effort to get to than Plage Blanche , where the Sahara meets the sea .
Backed by rolling dunes , the beach is 25 miles long , and for now about the only thing you ’ll see on it is an occasional fisherman , a couple of hard - core surfers .
Porat Beach , Bisevo , Croatia
Most of the people who make it to Bisevo — usually on a half - day excursion from nearby Vis or one of the other islands off the Dalmatian Coast — are there to visit the Blue Cave .
If you are after the rare bit of European sand that is without umbrellas , though , head for Porat Beach , in a sandy cove tucked among limestone cliffs on the west side of the island .
Spectacular Pictures of Untamed Navagio Beach
Playa Medina , Venezuela
This palm - fringed crescent of sand on the isolated Paria Peninsula is so pretty that Club Med once planned to build its first hotel in South America here .
What remains untouched is about as perfect a beach for chilling out as you could find anywhere .
The water is clear and calm , the sand is gold , and not one of the few people you meet will be trying to interest you in a time - share .
Poles Bay , Kea , Greece
The island of Kea , with terraced hillsides and ancient , stone - paved walking paths , is a day trip from Athens .
But because it is not on the main ferry routes , only a few foreigners and not that many more Greeks find their way to it .
Of those who do , just a handful discover the beach at Poles Bay on the southeast coast .

Hi there .
I ’m Kevin McCann , director of development at Tiki Games in ( mostly ) sunny San Diego .
I ’ll go ahead and start off with some undeniably fascinating information about me :
Favorite Game Genre : 1st person shooters
Favorite Game of all time : DOOM ( the original – for me it was just the most ground - breaking title I ever played )
Favorite Movie : Jaws
Least known game that I worked on : Tanarus ( as lead designer )
Game you may know of that I worked on : PlanetSide ( as lead designer )
And now that you know everything about me ( and okay , maybe it was n’t all that fascinating ) , I ’ll move onto the better news .
We just received word that our first game – NOVASTRIKE for the PLAYSTATION 3 – has been approved for release on PSN this upcoming June 5th .
So I figure this is as good a time as any to make an appearance on PlayStation .
Blog ( thanks to the courteous folks at PlayStation .
Blog ) .
NOVASTRIKE is going to be the first self - published game available on PSN so we ’re pretty pleased with that .
I ’d also like to thank SCEA for all their assistance in making that possible .
For you gamers that might understandably not mean much , but for any independent developers that are currently developing a title for PSN or thinking about doing it – we ’re proof that you can self - publish a game on PSN .
I suppose I should probably give a little overview of the game now .
NOVASTRIKE is a free - roaming top - down arcade shooter where you ’re flying an advanced fighter and combating the Draelus invasion .
Yes , aliens are pretty single - minded in that regard .
Airborne enemies consist of fighters , aces , kamikazes , bombers and capital ships , and you ’ll also need to deal with enemy ground installations .
Fortunately the ship you ’re flying – the Scythe – can acquire and upgrade weapons over time .
And there are nine weapons total , each with three additional upgrade states , to aid you in sending the Draelus to the great beyond .
I know that ’s a pretty short description , but I just want to start off by briefly introducing myself and the game for now .
Feel free to read more details on the game at our website , and I ’ll also be responding to questions here ( NOVASTRIKE - related or otherwise ) .
If the rest of the world is still foreign to your ears , here are 50 places from which to start a journey of discovery : 50 key albums , both ancient and modern , from around the globe , assembled by our all - star panel
AFRICA
1 The Legend
Oum Kalsoum
Manteca , 2007
‘ She ’s great .
She really is .
Really great . ’
So said Bob Dylan , for once lost for words .
But he was n’t wrong .
Start here with the extraordinary Egyptian singer who died in 1975 , mourned by a global audience .
2 Miss Perfumado
Cesaria Evora
Lusafrica / BMG , 1992
She learnt to sing in her orphanage choir , but gave up to support her family and did n’t perform for 10 years , battled alcoholism - and at the age of 47 , Cape Verde ’s ‘ barefoot diva ’ became an international star .
And this is the mesmeric record which made that happen .
3 Pirates Choice
Orchestra Baobab
World Circuit , 2001
The liquid sound of the West African night courtesy of the seminal Senegalese band ( re - formed and now touring again ) who magically adapted the local craze for Cuban sounds to the traditions of Wolof griot culture .
This is their peak .
4 Immigres
Youssou N’Dour
Earthworks , 1988
Which Youssou record to pick ?
The West African superstar has brought many disparate elements to his music but with this magical collection he introduced the world to the mbalax sound .
And no it does n’t feature ‘ 7 Seconds ’ , his hit with Neneh Cherry .
5 Sahra
Khaled
Wrasse , 1996
The key album from the King of Rai ( an uproarious updating of Algerian folk sounds ) including his ‘ Aicha ’ , covered by a Francophone zouk act , a salsa group and ( with an almost certain inevitability ) a Danish rap outfit .
6 Moffou
Salif Keita
Universal , 2002
For some - including Youssou N’Dour - the best album from ‘ the Golden Voice of Africa ’ ( and descendant of Mali ’s kings ) remains Soro but surely this most captivating set of acoustic arrangements just pips it .
7 Star Choice - Robert Plant selects :
Festival in the Desert
Various
IRL , 2003
I played this show with my band - it ’s a three - day festival in the sands , miles from anywhere .
Great bands - Tartit , Tinariwen - plus all - time legend Ali Farka Toure .
Fantastic , and the DVD is mind - altering .
There was a Navajo speed metal group from Arizona and they hooked up with the guys from the desert - both their people had been shafted by imperial powers .
It was the strangest thing seeing these sub- machine gun-carrying Tuareg hanging out with speed metallers from Scottsdale .
8 Dimanche a Bamako
Amadou and Mariam
Nonesuch , 2005
The blind Malian couple ’s irresistibly sunny album was produced by Manu Chao and became a summer soundtrack across Europe .
9 Boulevard de l’Independance
Toumani Diabate ’s Symmetric Orchestra
World Circuit , 2006
Suddenly it was n’t just the likes of Ali Farka Toure or even Taj Mahal who wanted to work with the Malian kora virtuoso but Damon Albarn and Björk , too .
This spectacular recording is just one of the reasons why .
10 Zombie
Fela Kuti
Wrasse , 1976
Women , politics , magic , controversy ... and a long series of albums that captured an epic funked - up militancy .
‘ Zombie ’ was Kuti ’s name for Nigeria ’s soldiers - 1,000 of whom attacked his commune after this came out .
11 The best of the Ethiopiques
Various
Manteca , 2007
Who knew ?
Through the sterling work of a French fan ( see OMM52 ) , the sounds of swinging Addis Ababa in the 1960s and 1970s have been newly made available to - and lapped up in large numbers by - a curious global audience .
12 1972/73/74
Franco and TPOK Jazz
Sonodisc , 2000
The big guitarist from Congo ( Zaire as it then was ) gave James Brown a run for his money at the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle , when both performed before the Ali-Foreman fight .
This set shows his slinky soukous sound at its best ( Franco ’s , that is , not Ali’s ) .
13 Congotronics
Konono No.1
Cramworld , 2005
Not the most likely pop stars , given they had to fashion their instruments from junkyard scrap .
But the Kinshasa outfit - big Franco fans - now find themselves feted as being at the bleeding - edge of contemporary post - rock dance .
14 Star Choice - Vampire Weekend ’s Rostam selects :
The Queen of African Pop
Brenda Fassie
CCP / EMI , 2004
Fassie was a South African pop star who died four years ago .
I love this compilation .
It ’s clearly African but it also sounds really inspired by house music .
The way it uses synthesizers and electronic drums inspired me when we were making our first album .
15 Hondo
Thomas Mapfumo
Zimbob , 1993
The architect of Zimbabwe ’s shuffling and hypnotic chimurenga style was the guerrillas ’ favourite in the independence wars and now aims his sorrowfully melodic attacks on Mugabe ’s corruption from his new home in Oregon .
16 Kwaito : South African Urban Beats
Various
EMI , 2004
Hip hop - like jazz and reggae ( which produced indigenous stars such as the late Lucky Dube ) - has always been huge in South Africa .
Here ’s a raucous selection of the local version of the genre , called kwaito , including the likes of the best - selling Zola .
THE AMERICAS
17 The living road
Lhasa
Tot ou Tard , 2004
Eclectic is too narrow a word for the Montreal - based Lhasa de Sel ’s family gene pool and correspondingly rich musical blend of Mexican , gypsy , French and Spanish ingredients - all communicated through a sexy , husky voice .
18 Bachata Rosa
Juan Luis Guerra
Karen , 1990
One of the great innovators in Latin music , a trained jazz guitarist , took sounds native to the Dominican Republic and gave them a surreally poetic , modern twist - and has ended up selling something like 14 million records across the globe .
19 Live at the Cheetah
Fania All - Stars
Fania , 1972
Ray Barretto , Willie Colon and Johnny Pacheco lead the ultimate all - star New York salsa jam on this live album .
The definitive Fania hits of the era are here , recorded in front of a breathless audience .
20 La Cantina
Lila Downs
EMI , 2006
She sang at Frida Kahlo ’s bedside in the 2002 biopic of her fellow Mexican artist and looked quite the part .
An anthropologist , she mixes Mesoamerican traditions into her sound - with hints of a Mexican yodel in her arresting voice .
21 Barrio Fino
Daddy Yankee
Interscope , 2005
Puerto Rico ’s biggest reggaeton star with the album that brought this local twist on hip hop to the world - spiced up further by sprinklings of salsa , Mexican and even Arabic styles in the mix .
22 A lo Cubano
Orishas
Chrysalis , 2000
The Cuban hip hip outfit ’s debut proved that the Yankee imperialists across the Florida strait did n’t have a monopoly on the genre .
Plus there was plenty of invention here , like the incorporation of Cuban timba .
23 Buena Vista Social Club
Buena Vista Social Club
World Circuit , 1997
The record that put Cuban son on the map and relaunched the careers of a generation of stellar musicians such as Ibrahim Ferrer .
And kudos to producer Ry Cooder ( sometimes sparring partner of Ali Farka Toure , too ) .
24 Watina
Andy Palacio
Cumbancha , 2007
Suddenly a whole lot of people know about the plight of the Garifuna community in Belize - some because of the recent success of this mellifluous gem , put together by the extraordinary Palacio , who sadly died earlier this year .
25 Ola Latina : Grandes Exitos Discos Fuentes
Bonnier Amigo , 2006
A killer Colombian compilation , culled from the Discos Fuentes vaults in Medellin .
Mambo - style hotel bands , cumbia rock combos and accordion - led cowboys - they ’re all here .
26 Star Choice - Gilles Peterson selects :
Cru
Seu Jorge
Wrasse , 2007
Seu Jorge is the perfect embodiment of all things Brazilian .
He manages to marry MPB ( Música Popular Brasileira ) - the classic bossa sound of people like Elis Regina - with a contemporary edge .
People here know him as an actor - he was in City of God and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou , singing David Bowie songs .
But in Brazil you hear him being played everywhere , in taxis and on the expensive beaches .
I really think he ’ll be a significant artist for years to come .
He ’s a real spokesman .
27 Brazil Classics Vol. 1
Various
Luaka Bop , 1989
David Byrne ‘ discovers ’ Brazilian music - and plumps for the obvious Seventies samba stars : Gilberto Gil , Caetano Veloso , Jorge Ben , Milton Nascimento .
But they ’re obvious for a reason .
28 Tropicalia
Various
Soul Jazz , 2006
Gil and Caetano again , only plus the likes of Os Mutantes : the focus is on the right - on , artistically outlandish ‘ tropicalia ’ movement .
( And you thought British hippies were out there ...)
29 Rio Baile Funk Vol 1
Various
Essay , 2004
Forget the musicianship of other Brazilian artistes - these cuts are raw , the true sound of the favelas .
Likewise , Brazilian music has always been sexy , but these ‘ booty beats ’ verge on the pornographic .
30 Tango : Zero Hour
Astor Piazzolla
Nonesuch , 2003
The Argentinian bandoneón player revolutionised tango , introducing jazz and classical elements , and this was his late masterpiece .
Just be warned : this is n’t quite the sort of thing you ’ve heard on Strictly Come Dancing .
EUROPE
31 Fado em Mim
Mariza
World Connection , 2002
Mariza ’s sweeping crinolines added glamour to world music , and her voice , drenched in a sadness that coursed through her audience , gave the fado sound of Lisbon international acclaim .
32 Rumba Argelina
Radio Tarifa
World Circuit , 1996
Radio Tarifa imagined a playlist for a mythic radio station at the meeting point of North Africa and Spain - flamenco guitars and ouds , Arabic drums and Gallician bagpipes - then made it happen , brilliantly .
33 Au Cabaret Sauvage
Lo ’ Jo
Emma , 2003
Lo ’Jo demolished France ’s reputation for bad pop music .
Tagged ‘ funfair shamans ’ , their French - African - Gypsy mix holds up a distorting mirror to the country ’s population .
THE BEST OF
34 Clandestino
Manu Chao
Virgin , 2000
Backpackers of the world unite : you have nothing to lose but your dirty washing .
And someone to celebrate in this global citizen .
Robbie Williams covered one of these songs , but do n’t hold that against Manu .
35 La Revencha del Tango
Gotan Project
Ya Basta ! , 2001
Two electronic composers , one French , the other Swiss , and a tango guitarist from Buenos Aires concoct soundtracks for the 21st century complemented by Cristina Vilallonga ’s sultry vocals .
36 Miero
Varttina
Real World , 2006
For anyone thinking they do n’t need the music and tribal sagas of the Finno - Ugric people of Karelia and Ingria , think again - this is a group who have rocked a 200,000 - strong crowd at the Rock In Rio festival .
37 Star Choice - Charlie Gillett selects :
Bari
Ojos de Brujos
Pias , 2002
Bari distilled the inspirations and influences - rumba , rock , rap and flamenco - of a group of Barcelona friends , who made a record that captured their camaraderie and caught the spirit of Spanish music at that moment .
Why include this hybrid hotchpotch when there ’s no proper flamenco record in the list ?
Precisely because it is such a remarkable melange .
38 London is the Place for Me Vol . 1
Various Artists
Honest Jon’s , 2002
When the Empire Windrush , docked at Tilbury on 21 June , 1948 , calypso star Lord Kitchener was on board : and he still deserves to be welcomed .
39 The Best of Paolo Conte
Paolo Conte
Coalition , 1999
Somewhere it will always be Paolo Conte time : no one else is left in the bar , the rain is pouring outside , and hell , you can even smoke .
The Italian jazzer conjures shades of Tom Waits , the ghost of Jacques Brel and plenty more .
40 Band of Gypsies
Taraf De Haidouks
Cramworld , 2001
Put them up against any rock ’n ’roll band and they ’ll likely drink them under the table , and then out - play them .
The Romanian Roma band never sounded quite so fiery as they do here .
41 Deliveren
Sezen Aksu
Post , 2001
Turkey ’s fearless pop icon has had scores of hits and several husbands .
A rule - flouter and a quietly political force and with a heart - stopping voice , she ’s the sexy face of modern Turkey .
MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA
42 Star Choice - Nitin Sawnhey selects :
Musst Musst
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
Real World , 1990
It ’s hard to overestimate the influence this record had on me .
I was familiar with Qawwali singers , but Nusrat ’s collaboration with the Canadian Michael Brook blew me away , in particular the remix of the title track by Massive Attack .
It opened a whole range of possibilities at a time when I was listening to a lot of dub .
And of course there ’s Nusrat ’s overwhelming voice - he brings an almost erotic charge to these spiritual lyrics .
43 Dalai Beldiri
Yat Kha
Wicklow , 1999
One of the most inhuman sounds in music , Tuvan throat - singing from the Mongolian - Siberian borders , is an ancient tradition - but young rock guitarist Albert Kuvez effected a revolution with this post - Soviet collision of rawk and traditional instrumentation .
44 Mano Suave
Yasmin Levy
World Village , 2007
You might think a set of songs charting the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492 , sung in the Ladino language , would sound dry and dusty .
But this Israeli singer ’s rich voice brings a fiery passion to her musical fusion .
45 Hightway to Hassake : Folk and Pop of Syria
Omar Souleyman
Sublime Frequencies , 2007
The berserk sound of the Middle East : Souleyman crashes Arabic , Turkish and Kurdish styles together in a rough and thrilling mix .
Much of this was recorded live and it ’s gritty in a good way .
Syrian music does n’t get heard a lot - surely it ca n’t all be this raw .
46 Call of the Valley
Pandit Shivkumar Sharma
Hemisphere , 1968
The ragas represent a shepherd ’s journey from morning to evening , the santoor , flute and guitar combining to beatific effect .
This recording remains the bestselling Indian classical album ever .
47 The Legend

Research by Yale scientists shows that males and females have essentially unisex brains — at least in flies — according to a recent report in Cell designed to identify factors that are responsible for sex differences in behavior .
The researchers showed that a courting “ song and dance ” routine that only male flies naturally perform — one wing is lifted and wiggled to make a humming “ song ” — can also be triggered in female flies by artificially stimulating particular brain cells that are present in both sexes .
It is n’t what you ’ve got — it ’s how you use it , the authors say .
“ It appears there is a largely bisexual or ‘ unisex brain . ’
Anatomically , the differences are subtle and a few critical switches make the difference between male and female behavior , ” said senior author Gero Miesenboeck , formerly of Yale University and now at the University of Oxford .
According to the authors , most male animals have to perform elaborate courtship displays to try to convince the female that they are worthy mates .
Their study was designed to see what neurons were responsible for behavior in the courtship dance of flies , and how the neural circuits in males and females differed .
To do this , they genetically engineered specific neurons in the fly to respond to light .
This optical trick allowed them to activate the neural circuits that control the behavior pattern directly .
Using a flash of laser light as a “ remote control ” for the brain cells , the researchers first identified which nerve cells control the courting behavior in males .
Next , they showed that the cells were present and functional in both males and females , even though only males do the song and dance .
“ Surprisingly , when the brain cells of female flies were flashed with the laser cue we found that even the female flies that never normally behaved this way , began to sing , ” said Dylan Clyne , a Yale post - doctoral associate and primary investigator of the study .
“ Our work shows that the brains not only look similar but are functionally similar .
The females have all the equipment to sing , but normally do n’t use it because their song circuit does n’t get the appropriate activating signals . ”
Asked about the relevance of this study to humans , Clyne said , “ You have to be careful about how much you can extrapolate from studying flies .
But , the basic principle should hold up – that is , the idea that we do n’t need big sex - differences in the brain to explain why it seems that men are from Mars and women from Venus . ”
The authors ’ next goal is finding the controls that set the flies ’ brains to the male or female mode .
They hope that by studying examples like sex - specific behaviors , they can clarify the still poorly understood relationships between genes , which are the targets of natural selection , and behavior , which is the product of evolution .
Ultimately , this line of research could also shed light on how genes underlie behavioral variation and perhaps even specific mental illnesses .

The 9/11 truth movement is a prime target for disinformation , infiltration , and other forms of sabotage by forces who do not want the public asking difficult questions about 9/11 .
Believers of the official story may see the discussion of disinformation as further evidence of “ paranoia , ” but objective observers and researchers recognize the clear evidence of disinformation .
Disinformation and counterintelligence sabotage have long been used by government authorities in subverting progressive groups and causes ( see Cointelpro ) .
Agents of disinformation may not “ play their hand ” until the right moment and much disinformation is carefully crafted to appear legitimate .
Misleading evidence is often delivered alongside accurate information .
On the other hand , some disinformation promotes ridiculous claims and behavior in order to sow confusion and undermine credibility .
Disinformation requires intentionality while misinformation does not .
In the 9/11 truth movement , you will come across both — evidence , materials , researchers , and groups that either consciously or unconsciously promote false or misleading information .
Much incorrect information within the 9/11 truth community likely began as disinformation but has been perpetuated as unintentional misinformation .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government has intercepted $ 842 million in economic stimulus payments for 1.5 million Americans who have skipped out on child support obligations , student loans or tax bills .
The amount withheld represents about 1.5 % of the more than $ 57 billion distributed under the stimulus program .
So far , 67 million tax filers have received payments .
About 54 % of the cash intercepted will be funneled to states for child support , according to Dean Balamaci , a U.S. Treasury Department official .
" We are really proud of that , " he added .
Congress and the Bush administration came together earlier this year to enact a $ 170 billion economic stimulus package .
The Treasury started distributing payments - $ 600 for individuals , $ 1,200 for couples and $ 300 per child - to tax filers .
The goal was to juice the economy by putting money in the pockets of consumers .
Stimulus Cash for Child Support
One unanticipated side effect of the stimulus program is the recovery of money owed single parents and government programs that support children on welfare .
Of the stimulus cash that has been recaptured , $ 459 million is being sent to states to distribute for child support payments .
And of that amount , $ 166 million is used to fund state child welfare programs and $ 292 million goes to custodial parents who have not qualified for welfare payments but are owed child support , according to Balamaci .
" It is important symbolically , " said Robert Fellmeth , director of the Children 's Advocacy Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law .
" The government is saying that you owe this and your debt is more important than having you run out and spend the money . "
Social service officials says the intercepted stimulus money helps reimburse state coffers , according to Anthony Farmer , spokesman for the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance .
" The state has an interest in being involved in helping to collect child support because if people do n't pay child support , then those parents go on public assistance , " said Farmer .
Nearly 40 % of the stimulus money that has been recovered by the Treasury Department is going back to the federal government in the form of back taxes owed and student loans .
About 6 % will go to states that are owed back taxes .
Georgia , Maryland and New York - each of which has received more than $ 4.5 million - are receiving the biggest stimulus offsets .
The Treasury Offset Program
The stimulus offset effort is part of the Treasury Offset Program , which intercepts federal payments of any kind to pay debts .
The entire program has collected $ 4.6 billion so far this fiscal year .
Generally , the offset program captures money owed by people who are found formally delinquent on tax or child support payments .
Tax filers on scheduled pay plans with the government are not affected by the program .
Any debtor whose stimulus check is eligible to be absorbed by the program has already received notice that he or she is delinquent on a debt , according to a Treasury spokesperson .
" These are all situations where some attempt has been made to collect the bills on a voluntary basis , " said another spokesperson for the Treasury .
The program matches payments due with debts owed by Social Security number and last name , according to a spokesperson .

Guantanamo Trials Hit Setbacks
By William Fisher

NEW YORK , May 20 ( IPS ) – Key elements of the George W. Bush administration ’s anti-terrorist detention policies appear to be unraveling , according to human rights and legal advocates .
In the past two weeks alone , a military judge has disqualified a Pentagon legal official from participating in the Guantanamo war crimes trial of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , a former driver for Osama bin Laden , because he had pushed for “ sexy ” cases that would capture attention .
The U.S. government dropped all charges against the man alleged to have been the “ 20th hijacker ” in the Sep. 11th 2001 terrorist attacks because it is believed his military commission trial would expose evidence obtained through torture .
And , in a totally unexpected move , Al Jazeera cameraman Sami Al - Haj was released from Guantanamo after six years in detention without charge .
In the Hamdan case , the judge ruled that the military must appoint a replacement to Air Force Brig .
Gen . Thomas Hartmann , the legal adviser to the military tribunals , before the Yemeni ’s scheduled trial in June .
Hamdan is charged with supporting terrorism and faces life in prison if convicted .
His trial would be the first U.S. war crimes trial for a Guantanamo prisoner .
The dropped charges were against Mohammad al - Qahtani , who has been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 , following his detention in Afghanistan .
In February , he was charged with conspiracy , terrorism , and murder in violation of the laws of war , among other offences .
The Centre for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , which has provided many of the lawyers representing Guantanamo detainees , said it believed the charges against al - Qahtani had been dropped because he had been tortured .
“ The government ’s claims against our client were based on unreliable evidence obtained through torture at Guantanamo , ” the group said .
“ Using torture to string together a web of so - called evidence is illegal , immoral and cannot be the basis for a fair trial , ” the CCR added .
Defence lawyers say Hartmann rushed proceedings in hopes of speedy convictions and sought to improperly influence who was prosecuted , selecting cases based on their potential to sway public opinion of the process .
At an Apr. 28 hearing on the issue , former chief prosecutor Air Force Colonel Morris Davis testified that Hartmann had pushed for “ sexy ” cases that would appeal to the media .
Colonel Davis resigned when he was placed directly under the command of the General Counsel of the Department of Defence , a principal author of the military commissions system .
As legal adviser , Hartmann was charged with providing counsel to the official who makes key decisions such as whether to approve charges against individual detainees .
According to Clive Stafford Smith , a British lawyer who represents a number of Guantanamo detainees , Hartmann “ was basically telling ( Col. Morris ) what to do and saying , ‘ Look , there ’s an election coming up .
It ’s in November .
We ’ve got to have prosecutions now against the high - profile guys .
It does n’t matter if you ’re not ready to prosecute them , but we need Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on trial because of electioneering ’. ”
Prosecutors deny that Hartmann ever subjected subordinates to unlawful influence .
While the judge ’s ruling directly affects only Hamdan ’s case , lawyers for the Yemeni detainee said it raises questions about the validity of charges that Hartmann was involved in preparing against other suspects at Guantanamo .
A case currently before the Supreme Court – Boumediene v. Bush – is challenging the legality of military commissions under the constitution .
The Court is expected to rule in the next two months .
Hamdan has already become part of U.S. jurisprudence .
In 2005 , he brought suit against then Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
The Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that President Bush overstepped his authority in ordering military war crimes trials for Guantanamo Bay detainees .
The ruling , a rebuke to the administration and its aggressive anti-terror policies , said the proposed trials were illegal under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions .
Three years ago , the Supreme Court rejected Bush ’s claim to have the authority to seize and detain terrorism suspects and indefinitely deny them access to courts or lawyers .
In this follow - up case , the justices focused solely on the issue of trials for some of the men .
Published reports in 2006 described al Qahtani ’s interrogation .
The reports – based on leaks from the Pentagon – said he had been subjected to stress positions , sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures , humiliation and other highly coercive practices .
Some lawyers believe military officers did not want to face a discussion of these interrogation techniques in court , nor to have their case collapse publicly because the evidence obtained using such techniques might be ruled inadmissible .
It was recently revealed that Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , former Defence Secretary Rumsfeld , former Secretary of State Colin Powell , former CIA chief George Tenet , and former Attorney General John Ashcroft had met in the White House and personally authorized specific torture techniques including waterboarding .
President Bush has admitted he knew and approved of their actions .
Human and legal rights advocates have been outspoken on the military commissions issue .
Columbia University law professor Scott Horton told IPS he believes the process used to establish the commissions – criminal courts run by the U.S. armed forces – is likely to result in what says will be “ a series of show trials ” timed to strengthen the Republican Party ’s chances in the 2008 presidential election .
This viewed is shared by Michael Ratner , CCR ’s president , who told IPS that the Military Commission system “ has none of the guarantees of regular trials .
Coerced and hearsay evidence can be used .
There is no jury – only a group of military officers and the judge is appointed by the Bush administration . ”
“ Much of the trial can be held in secret and the defendant does not get to see all of the evidence , ” Ratner noted .
“ After this sham process the defendant , if convicted , can receive the death penalty .
There is a barbarity to the actions of the Bush administration that is without precedent . ”
And Gabor Rona , International Legal Director for advocacy group Human Rights First , told IPS , “ Much of the world considers the death penalty an international human rights violation even when imposed after the fairest of procedures .
To impose it through an untested , ad hoc process that has not yet successfully completed a trial even for a misdemeanor will likely be viewed with deep skepticism . ”
In related developments , the American Civil Liberties Union has joined with the National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers to assemble defence teams to assist in the representation of detainees facing prosecution in the military commissions proceedings at GuantÃ¡namo “ in order to protect American values of fairness and justice and the constitutional guarantee of due process . ”
And another legal advocacy group , the National Lawyers Guild , called on Congress to appoint a Special Prosecutor , independent of the Department of Justice , to investigate and prosecute senior Bush administration officials and lawyers for their role in the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody .
Since the U.S. detention facility on this southeastern corner of Cuba opened in January 2002 , only one military commission has reached a verdict , when Australian David Hicks pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in March 2007 .
It was part of a politically orchestrated deal that returned Hicks to his home country to serve out his sentence .
He was released last December .
The Al Jazeera cameraman , who had been on a protracted hunger strike during his detention , was flown back to his native Sudan .
The Pentagon has not explained his release .

The George W. Bush administration responded to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon with an assault on U.S. civil liberty that Bush justified in the name of the war on terror . 
The government assured us that the draconian measures apply only to terrorists .
The word terrorist , however , was not defined .
The government claimed the discretionary power to decide who is a terrorist without having to present evidence or charges in a court of law .
Frankly , the Bush administration ’s policy evades any notion of procedural due process of law .
Administration assurances that harsh treatment is reserved only for terrorists is meaningless when the threshold process for determining who is and who is not a terrorist depends on executive discretion that is not subject to review .
Substantive rights are useless without the procedural rights to enforce them .
Terrorist legislation and executive assertions created a basis upon which federal authorities claimed they were free to suspend suspects ’ civil liberties in order to defend Americans from terrorism .
Only after civil liberties groups and federal courts challenged some of the unconstitutional laws and procedures did realization spread that the Bush administration ’s assault on the Bill of Rights is a greater threat to Americans than are terrorists .
The alacrity with which Congress accepted the initial assault from the administration is frightening .
In 2001 , the USA PATRIOT Act passed by a vote of 98 to 1 in the Senate and by 357 to 66 in the House .
The act was already written and waiting on the shelf before the 9/11 attack .
Indeed , the FBI and Department of Justice have tried for years to introduce PATRIOT
Act provisions into the law .
That act was introduced immediately after the attacks , and few members of Congress read its contents prior to passing it .
Federal courts declared some provisions of the legislation to be unconstitutional .
Vague language criminalizing expert advice or assistance as material support for terrorism was thrown out , as were gag orders and  National Security Letters used to obtain private information without judicial oversight .
Despite challenges from the American Civil Liberties Union and resolutions passed in 8 states and 396 cities and counties condemning the act for its attack on civil liberties , Congress reauthorized the act in March 2006 , making most of it permanent and sending a clear signal that the war on terror takes precedence over civil liberty .
The PATRIOT Act ’s infringements of civil liberty are serious , but they pale by comparison to the Bush administration ’s assertion of executive power to set aside habeas corpus protection for both citizens and noncitizens declared by the executive branch to be enemy combatants .
The Bush administration claimed and exercised the power to hold indefinitely anyone so designated without access to legal representation .
In other words , the Bush administration claimed the discretionary and unaccountable power to imprison whomever it wished .
In keeping with its self - declared powers , the Bush administration quickly rounded up hundreds of detainees whom it claimed — without evidence — to be enemy combatants .
Four detainees , Rasul , Hamdi , Padilla , and Hamdan , consisting of a British citizen , two American citizens , and an Afghan , respectively , challenged the administration in federal court cases that reached the Supreme Court .
In Rasul v. Bush the Supreme Court ruled in June 2004 that , contrary to Bush administration assertions , the courts have jurisdiction over Guantnamo and that detainees must be allowed to challenge their detention .
Also in June 2004 , the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that Hamdi , an American citizen , was deprived of due process and had the right to challenge his detention .
However , the ruling was far from a clean sweep for civil liberty .
Both noted civil libertarian Harvey Silverglate ( Reason , January 2005 ) and John Yoo , a Department of Justice apologist for the new tyranny , agree that the Supreme Court decision left flexibility and room for the government to maneuver and prevail in the end .
In December 2003 , an appellate court ruled that U.S. citizen Jos Padilla could not be denied habeas corpus protection .
To forestall another Supreme Court ruling against the Bush administration , the administration withdrew Padilla ’s status as enemy combatant and filed criminal charges that bore no relationship to the administration ’s original assertions that Padilla was plotting to explode a dirty bomb in an American city .
As Harvey Silverglate has documented ( Boston Phoenix , September 16 , 2005 ) , the Padilla case is also an extraordinary story of forum shopping  ( picking a court where judges are friendly to its case ) by the Department of Justice .
Forced by the federal judiciary to release José Padilla from years of illegal detention or to put him on trial , the Bush administration had to scramble to put together some kind of charges .
The best that the Bush administration could do was to charge Padilla not with any terrorist acts , but with wanting to be a terrorist — a terrorist - wannabe to use the words of Andrew Cohen ( WashingtonPost.com , August 16 , 2007 ) .
By the time Padilla went to trial , he had been demonized for years in the media as an enemy combatant who intended to set off a radioactive bomb .
Peter Whoriskey ( Washington Post , August 17 , 2007 ) described the Padilla Jury as a patriotic jury that appeared in court with one row of jurors dressed in red , one in white , and one in blue .
It was a jury primed to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by federal prosecutors .
No member of this jury was going to return home to accusations of letting off the dirty bomber . 
Evidence , of which there was little , if any , played no role in the case .
The chief FBI agent , James T. Kavanaugh , testified in court that the intercepted telephone conversations were innocuous and contained no references to terrorism or Islamic extremism , but the jury was n’t listening .
The judge allowed prosecutors to show the jury a ten - year - old video of Osama bin Laden that had no relevance to the case , but which served to arouse in jurors fear , anger , and disturbing memories of September 11 , 2001 .
The jury convicted Padilla on all counts , despite the total absence of any evidence that he had ever committed a terrorist act or had agreed to commit such an act .
By convicting Padilla , the jury opened Pandora ’s box and created a Benthamite precedent for imprisoning U.S. citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a terrorist act .
In July 2006 , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court ruled that Bush ’s military tribunals violate U.S. military law and the Geneva Conventions .
Republicans , who tend to regard civil liberties as devices that coddle criminals and terrorists , turned to legislation in attempts to subvert the Supreme Court ’s defense of the U.S. Constitution .
In November 2005 , the Senate Republicans passed an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act offered by Lindsay Graham of South Carolina authorizing the president to deny habeas corpus protection to Guantnamo detainees .
The fact that it was known by this time that the vast majority of the detainees were hapless individuals who were captured by Afghan warlords and sold to the Americans , who were paying a bounty for terrorists ,  carried no weight with the Republican senators .
The Republicans replied to Hamdan v. Rumsfeld with the Military Commissions Act passed in September 2006 and signed by Bush in October .
The act strips detainees of protections provided by the Geneva Conventions :
 No alien unlawful enemy combatant subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights .
Other provisions of the act strip detainees of speedy trials and of protection against torture and self - incrimination .
This heinous law has a breathtaking provision that retroactively protects torturers against prosecution for war crimes .
The act explicitly denies habeas corpus protection and access to federal courts to any alien detained by the U.S. government as an enemy combatant  and any alien awaiting determination of his status .
The act reads :  No court , justice , or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the US who has been determined by the US to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination . 
This act is as atrocious a piece of legislation as the world has ever seen .
It permits people to be sentenced to death on the basis of hearsay , secret evidence , and on a confession extracted by torture .
Indeed , detainees could be shot in the back of the head without undergoing the kangaroo tribunal and no one would ever know or be held legally responsible .
A number of legal experts have concluded that there is no assurance that the act cannot be applied to U.S. citizens .
Although language in the act refers to alien unlawful enemy combatant ,  other language in the document does not limit the act ’s applicability only to aliens .
Legal scholars have warned that the legislation defines enemy combatant in such broad language that the act applies to any person whom the executive branch declares has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States .
No evidence for the charge is necessary .
By seizing the power to decide who is and who is not an enemy combatant ,  the executive branch has seized the power to decide who shall and who shall not be permitted the protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution .
The Bush administration has resurrected the dungeons and torture chambers that Blackstone ’s Rights of Englishmen banished from the English - speaking world .
It is too early to know how the act will be interpreted and applied to American citizens or whether it can be challenged and overturned on constitutional grounds , but forebodings are severe .
What we can say is that the act is draconian and dangerous legislation that is completely unnecessary .
If the U.S. government has enough correct information to designate a person truthfully to be an enemy combatant , the U.S. government has enough information to put the person on trial in open court with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to defendants .
The U.S. government only needs indefinite detention , torture , and secret evidence when it has no evidence .
Every American should be concerned that John Yoo , one of the Justice Department authors of this totalitarian legislation , is now a law professor at the University of California .
Liberty has no future in America if law schools provide legitimacy to those who would subvert the U.S. Constitution .
The Assault on the Constitution
We concluded the first edition of this book with a call for an intellectual rebirth , a revival of constitutionalism . 
Alas , far from a rebirth of constitutionalism , we are witnessing a rending that we would not have imagined .
On January 17 , 2007 , the attorney general of the United States , Alberto Gonzales , declared in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that  the Constitution does n’t say every individual in the United States or every citizen is hereby granted or assured the right of habeas . 
The chairman of the committee , Arlen Specter ( R - Pennsylvania ) was incredulous when Gonzales insisted that there is no express grant of habeas in the Constitution . 
In June 2007 , Dick Cheney astonished Americans with his claim that the Office of Vice President is independent of both the executive branch and Congress and is accountable to neither .
Americans should pay attention to the power that the Bush administration is claiming over them .
If Americans are not protected by habeas corpus , the government can pick us up at its will and cast us into dungeons for the rest of our lives without ever giving any accountability of its action .
If the Constitution does not grant habeas corpus protection , the administration is under no compulsion to provide indictments , evidence , and trial .
The government can simply imprison at will .
The Bush administration is using every strategy to push aside the remains of the legal principles that shield the people from arbitrary government power .
It is a short step from denying Americans ’ constitutional right to a public trial by an impartial jury to denying every other constitutional right .
Clearly , on the basis of an indefinite war against an indefinite terrorist enemy ,  the Bush regime is attempting to claim powers that are not limited by the Constitution , Congress , or the courts .
It is a life - and - death matter for Americans to understand that the Bush administration is seeking to undermine all rights by shutting off the procedural avenues for enforcing rights .
Few Americans seem alarmed .
Conservative attorneys , such as members of the Federalist Society who present themselves as defenders of original intent ,  are pushing for more power to be concentrated in the executive .
One of the tools used to obtain this goal is Bush ’s misuse of signing statements .
Scholars , such as Phillip J. Cooper of Portland State University writing in the September 2005 issue of Presidential Studies Quarterly , warn that Bush uses signing statements not only as illegal line - item vetoes that evade congressional override but also as wide - ranging assertions of exclusive authority and court - like pronouncements that redefine legislative powers under the Constitution .
They reveal a systematic effort to define presidential authority in terms of the broad conception of the prerogative both internationally and domestically under the unitary executive theory . 
Signing statements deserve a closer look than they are receiving .
There is no provision in the Constitution for signing statements .
Courts often look to congressional debates and proceedings to ascertain legislative intent when a statute ’s meaning is not obvious .
The Bush administration is endeavoring to establish the judicial practice of also looking to the president ’s signing statements in the same way , an absurd idea as the president does not enact legislation .
President Bush ’s use of signing statements signals the refusal of the executive branch to abide by the rule of law , a frightening prospect .
A growing number of thoughtful Americans believe , rightly or wrongly , that the war on terror is a hoax that is providing cover for what former President Nixon ’s White House counsel , John W. Dean , says is an assault on American liberty by authoritarian conservatives .
Time will tell whether Americans will continue to tolerate the neoconservatives ’ wars and attacks on civil liberty .
The Case of Sami Al - Arian
The demise of the Rights of Englishmen , the unaccountability of police and prosecutors , the witch - hunt atmosphere created by the war on terror ,  the government ’s need to find terrorist suspects in order to maintain the public ’s alarm , and the sadistic and bigoted attitudes of many prison guards and even federal prosecutors and judges toward Muslims have resulted in the use of law for persecution .
The case of Sami Al - Arian , who was a professor of computer science at the University of South Florida , is a pure example of the use of law as a weapon for persecution .
Most Americans know only the Israeli side of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The Palestinian side is rarely heard .
Even prominent Americans , such as former president Jimmy Carter , who point out that there are two sides to the story , are subjected to demonization and name - calling .
Sami Al - Arian was gaining success as a voice for a more even - handed Middle East policy .
He spoke to intelligence personnel and military commanders at MacDill Air Force Central Command .
He gave interviews .
He even invited the FBI to attend meetings where he spoke .
This was too much for the Israeli Lobby , which has enjoyed a total monopoly on the explanation of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the United States .
The hysteria following 9/11 created the opportunity to destroy Sami Al - Arian .
Alexander Cockburn ( CounterPunch , March 3 , 2007 ) reports that at the direct instigation of Attorney General Ashcroft trumped - up terrorism and conspiracy charges were leveled at Al - Arian .
The neoconservative media and right - wing talk radio went to work on Al - Arian .
Pushed by Gov. Jeb Bush , the university fired him .
He was arrested and deemed too dangerous for bail .
He was held in solitary confinement for two and a half years while the federal government tried to manufacture some evidence against him .
Wikipedia reports that  Amnesty International said Al - Arian ’s pre-trial conditions ‘ appeared to be gratuitously punitive ’ and stated ‘ the restrictions imposed on Dr. Al - Arian appeared to go beyond what were necessary on security grounds and were inconsistent with international standards for humane treatment .’
The government failed to produce any evidence .
The jury acquitted Al - Arian on all serious charges and voted 10 — 2 for acquittal on all other charges .
The jury acquitted him despite U.S. District Court judge James Moody ’s many biased rulings against Al - Arian .
Knowing that Al - Arian and his family could not stand the strain of solitary confinement for another two and a half years while a new case was prepared , the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would retry him .
His attorney urged him to make a plea in order to end the ordeal .
Al - Arian ’s plea is innocuous and bears no relationship to the serious charges on which he was tried .
According to Wikipedia , as part of the plea agreement  the government acknowledged that Al - Arian ’s activities were non-violent and that there were no victims to the charge in the plea agreement . 
Under the plea agreement , Al - Arian ’s sentence amounted essentially to time served , but he was double - crossed by Judge Moody , who according to Alexander Cockburn used inflamed language about Al - Arian having blood on his hands  ( a charge rejected by the jury ) and handed down the maximum sentence .
The terrorist prosecutors had yet more in store for Al - Arian .
In October 2006 , federal prosecutor Gordon Kromberg , reportedly notorious as an Islamophobe ,  demanded , in violation of the plea agreement , that Al - Arian testify before a grand jury in Alexandria , Virginia , investigating an Islamic research center .
According to Wikipedia , in a verbal agreement that appears in court transcripts , federal prosecutors agreed [ as part of the plea agreement ] that Al - Arian would not have to testify in Virginia . 
Al - Arian ’s lawyers saw Kromberg ’s subpoena of their client as a setup , and Al - Arian refused to testify .
On January 22 , 2007 , Al - Arian was brought before a federal judge on contempt charges .
He described to the judge the extraordinary abuse he had suffered at the hands of federal prison officials .
The guards and officers all felt free to abuse Al - Arian , because they had heard the lie on right - wing talk radio and from neoconservative media that he was a terrorist who hated Americans .
The hostile judge sentenced Al - Arian to eighteen months more on a civil contempt charge for refusing to testify about a case that he knew nothing about .
Kromberg contrived to put Al - Arian in a situation in which truthful answers in court under oath could be turned into a perjury charge by offering the defendants reduced charges in exchange for their testimony that Al - Arian was involved with them in some alleged activity and lied under oath .
Alternatively , Al - Arian would be cited for civil contempt for refusal to testify .
The ease with which Kromberg violated the plea agreement and abused the prosecutorial power in full view of federal judges should give pause to every American .
When a university professor , who has done nothing but try to correct the one - sided story Americans are fed about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , can be treated in this way by the U.S. Department of Justice , civil liberty in the United States is in a precarious condition .
The ease with which Al - Arian was transformed into a terrorist should be a lesson to us all .
People in charge of Homeland Security are no less inclined than police and prosecutors to make expansive interpretations of their mandate and what constitutes terrorism and suspect behavior .
On May 28 , 2007 , the Associated Press reported that the Alabama Department of Homeland Security had included among terrorist groups listed on its Web site environmentalists , antiwar protesters , abortion opponents , and gay - and animal - rights advocates .
It is an ancient practice of government to hype fear in order to gain arbitrary power that can be turned against anyone .
Perhaps this expansive definition of terrorist explains the eighty thousand names on the government ’s no -fly list .
Another problem with arbitrary and undefined power is that it ends up being exercised by people who tend to receive low marks for good judgment and intelligence .
English film director Mike Figgis was held for five hours in an interrogation cell at Los Angeles International Airport because U.S. immigration officers are unfamiliar with the professional language of television show producers and lacked the common sense to avoid a misunderstanding .
When asked the reason for his visit , Figgis said :  I ’m here to shoot a pilot . 
 Shoot ,  of course , means to film , and pilot is the first episode of a new TV show .
The people providing our security concluded that Figgis had voluntarily confessed to a plot to come to America in order to murder an airline pilot .
Figgis survived his assumption that people in Los Angeles understood movie talk , but the desire of people empowered to thwart terrorism to use their power is great .
Any excuse will do .
Sliding Toward Dictatorship
The assaults of the Bush regime on civil liberty , the Constitution , and the separation of powers are more determined and more successful than its military assaults on the Middle East , which provide the war time  justification for the attack on civil liberty in the United States .
The regime and its supporters are determined to raise the president to dictatorial powers , at least in times of war , the initiation of which is being turned into a presidential prerogative .
On May 9 , 2007 , President Bush signed the National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive .
If in the president ’s opinion a catastrophic emergency  occurs , the directive places all governmental power in the hands of the president , effectively abolishing the checks and balances in the Constitution .
Underlying this directive is the unitary executive doctrine , a theory pushed by the Federalist Society , an important source of law clerks , DOJ appointees , and judicial nominees for the Republican Party .
The doctrine , supported by Supreme Court justices such as Samuel Alito , claims that the executive power of the president is completely separate and independent of the legislative and judicial powers and not subject to infringement by them .
The manner in which this doctrine is being institutionalized is creating the additional claim that executive power is the supreme power .
In effect , unitary executive theory is elevating the president to a dictator with the power to ignore or suspend laws .
The unitary executive doctrine is a direct attack on the constitutional separation of powers established by the Founding Fathers .
One of the alleged advantages of the unitary executive is that the president can act more quickly and efficiently if he is not subject to interference from Congress and the judiciary .
However , as Justice Louis Brandeis explained in 1926 ,  the doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power .
The purpose was not to avoid friction , but , by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments , to save the people from autocracy . 
News reports that the Bush administration has contracted with Halliburton to build detention centers in the United States at a cost of $ 385 million revive memories of the World War II detention of Japanese American citizens .
It has not been explained who are the intended detainees for the new detention centers .
Do the American people want to trust with detention centers an executive branch , which claims the power to set aside habeas corpus , statutory law , due process , and the prohibition against torture ?
Polls show that 36 percent of the American public and more than half of New Yorkers lack confidence in the 9/11 Commission Report .
Despite a significant percentage of the public ’s disbelief in the explanation of the event that took America to war in the Middle East , Congress and the media continue to tolerate the Bush administration ’s aggressive rhetoric , which seeks to widen the war on terror from Afghanistan and Iraq to Iran , Syria , and Lebanon .
The diligence with which Vice President Cheney and the neoconservatives press for an attack on Iran , and the extreme position that the Bush administration has taken on executive power , raise the question whether the Bush administration has an agenda that takes precedence over America ’s constitutional democracy .
Never in its history have the American people faced such danger to their constitutional protections as they face today from those in the government who hold the reins of power and from elements of the legal profession and the federal judiciary that support energy in the executive .
An assertive executive backed by an aggressive U.S. Department of Justice and unobstructed by a supine Congress and an intimidated corporate media has demonstrated an ability to ignore statutory law and public opinion .
The precedents that have been set during the opening years of the twenty - first century bode ill for the future of American liberty .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Friday that politicians who suggest that lifting a ban on offshore oil drilling would ease rising fuel prices in the United States were “ blowing smoke . ”
The comments were seen by the U.S. media as a slap at Republican leaders including President George W. Bush and the party ’s presumptive presidential nominee John McCain , who have recently spoken in favor of more offshore drilling as America tries to wean itself from its dependence on foreign oil .
A spokesman for the governor , however , said the comments were not directed at McCain , nor at Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , who has backed McCain ’s stance on offshore drilling .
Rising oil prices and record - high $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline and their impact on the faltering U.S. economy have put energy concerns squarely at the center of the contest between McCain and Democrat Barack Obama in November .
Speaking at a climate change gathering of politicians and business leaders hosted by fellow Republican Crist , Schwarzenegger said politicians have been “ throwing around all kinds of ideas in response to the skyrocketing energy crisis , from rethinking nuclear power to pushing biofuels and more renewables and ending the ban on offshore drilling . ”
“ Anyone who tells you that this will bring down our gas prices immediately or any time soon is blowing smoke , ” he said .
“ America is so addicted to oil it will take us years to wean ourselves from it and to look for new ways to feed our addiction is not the answer . ”
Schwarzenegger ’s press secretary Aaron McLear said the comments were not a swipe at fellow Republicans for the simple reason that they had not claimed more offshore drilling would immediately lower gasoline prices .
“ The governor was not referring to Gov. Crist or Sen.
McCain when he said those who suggested offshore oil drilling would lower gas prices are misguided .
Neither have suggested that to be the case , ” McLear said .
ENERGY PLAN
McCain has embraced offshore drilling in recent days and proposed a plan to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 .
Obama has criticized McCain ’s drilling stance , and instead has advocated a plan to slap new taxes on oil company profits .
Crist , who has been mentioned as a possible Republican vice presidential candidate , recently supported McCain ’s call for an end to the federal moratorium on offshore drilling .
His support , criticized by some newspapers and leaders , strayed from decades of opposition to offshore drilling by Florida residents and politicians , including President Bush ’s younger brother , Jeb , who preceded Crist as governor .
McCain qualified his position , saying states should decide individually on offshore drilling , and Crist appeared to moderate his at the climate conference on Wednesday when he said drilling would only be acceptable if it were safe , far enough from shore and clean enough for the state ’s beaches .
Crist said he had not talked to Schwarzenegger about the offshore drilling issue at the climate change meeting but brushed off the “ blowing smoke ” comment , telling Reuters : “ I think he was talking about the fact that we need to diversify all of our energy alternatives in order for it to have a comprehensive and lasting effect and I would agree with that . ”
At the same gathering last year , Crist announced a comprehensive greenhouse gas reduction program for Florida patterned on California ’s plans for cleaner cars , expansion of renewable energy sources and caps on polluting industries .
California , which has led the U.S. global warming fight in the absence of federal action , unveiled details on Thursday of an ambitious blueprint to counter climate change , aiming to reduce pollutants by 10 percent from current levels by 2020 .
It includes a cap - and - trade program for carbon dioxide emissions , requires oil companies to make cleaner fuels and utilities to provide 33 percent of their energy from renewable sources like wind and solar .
“ This is going to be something the world will be watching very closely , ” Schwarzenegger said .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) -
The openly gay U.S. Episcopal bishop at the center of the Anglican church ’s global battle over homosexuality , has entered into a civil union with his longtime partner at a private ceremony .
About 120 guests gathered at St. Paul ’s Church in New Hampshire for Saturday ’s ceremony for Bishop Gene Robinson and his partner of more than 19 years , Mark Andrew .
The event was kept private out of respect for next month ’s worldwide Anglican conference , Robinson ’s spokesman , Mike Barwell , said on Sunday .
“ It was absolutely joyful , ” Barwell said by telephone .
“ A lot of his supporters and friends were there , including many members of the gay and lesbian community . ”
The 77 million - member Anglican Communion , a global federation of national churches , has been in upheaval since 2003 when the Episcopal Church consecrated Robinson as the first bishop known to be in an openly homosexual relationship in more than four centuries of church history .
The Episcopal Church is the U.S. branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Disputes over scriptural authority , the blessing of gay unions and other matters have become a worldwide issue and threaten turmoil this summer when Anglicans gather for their once - a - decade Lambeth Conference in Britain .
Robinson has in the past received death threats and wore a bulletproof vest under his vestments at his consecration in 2003 .
Two uniformed police officers stood guard at Saturday ’s ceremony in the state capital Concord , said Barwell .
Robinson and Andrew held two ceremonies -- a non-religious one in which they became legal partners followed by a formal church service to give blessings to God for their relationship .
Robinson , 61 , a divorced father of two , praised New Hampshire ’s lawmakers when they passed legislation last year to make the state the fourth in the country where same - sex civil unions are legal .
The law took effect January 1 .
Robinson has suggested states go further and follow Massachusetts , which in 2003 became the first U.S. state to legalize gay marriage .
Robinson has said he wanted to enter into the civil union before leaving for England to ensure Andrew and his two daughters had legal protections given the threats to his life .
Civil unions grant largely the same state rights as married couples -- from insurance coverage to tax benefits and hospital visiting rights -- but lack the full , federal legal protections of marriage .
Robinson has been excluded from the Anglican Communion ’s Lambeth Conference but plans to attend as an outside observer .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Philadelphia officials plan to challenge a lawsuit by the local Boy Scouts that seeks to stop the city evicting the group because of its no -gays policy .
The city , which has allowed the Cradle of Liberty scouts to use a city building rent - free for 80 years , has said the group must either scrap its policy or start paying “ fair market rent ” of $ 200,000 a year or leave by May 31 .
City officials say the no-gays policy , which follows Boy Scouts ’ national rules , violates its 1982 Fair Practices Ordinance , which prohibits discrimination against certain classes of people , including on the basis of sexual orientation .
“ We are not going to subsidize the violation of our ordinance , ” said city solicitor Shelley Smith .
“ It ’s still our intention to take the legal action necessary to evict them . ”
Lawyers for the Boy Scouts , in the suit filed on Friday , argued the group has a right to set its own rules without government interference because it is a private organization .
That was set down by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled in 2000 that the Boy Scouts and its local organizations have a right of “ expressive association ” under the First Amendment , the suit said .
Filed in federal court , the suit also claims that other groups that exclude certain classes of people under the ordinance occupy city buildings at little or no rent but only the Boy Scouts have been subjected to eviction .
And the proposed fair market rent of $ 200,000 a year is more than double the most expensive office space based on square footage in Philadelphia , the suit says .
“ Both the proposed eviction and the ‘ fair market rent ’ requirement is intended to punish Cradle of Liberty for its constitutionally protected membership policy , ” the suit says .
Glassdoor , a Sausalito , Calif . - based startup in stealth mode , has raised $ 3 million in a second funding round led by Benchmark Capital .
The company ’s site has little to say about its plans , except that it will have “ something live in mid-2008 . ”
I called a Benchmark representative , but she was mum as well .
PEHub says Glassdoor is a social networking company focused on employment conditions .
The company is led by chief executive Robert Hohman , formerly president of Hotwire.com and engineering team leader at Expedia.com , and Board Chairman Richard Barton , who is also chief executive at real estate site Zillow .
Commentary : The real culprit of 9/11 ?
By Arnaud de Borchgrave
UPI Editor at Large
Washington , DC , Jul. 22 ( UPI ) --
On the eve of the publication of its report , the 9/11 Commission was given a stunning document from Pakistan , claiming that Pakistani intelligence officers knew in advance of the 9/11 attacks .
The document , from a high - level , but anonymous Pakistani source , also claims that Osama bin Laden has been receiving periodic treatment for dialysis in a military hospital in Peshawar , the capital of Pakistan 's Northwest Frontier Province adjacent to the Afghan border .
The document was received by the Commission this week as its own report was already coming off the presses .
The information was supplied to the Commission on the understanding that the unimpeachable source would remain anonymous .
The report received by the 9/11 Commission from the anonymous , well - connected Pakistani source , said : " The core issue of instability and violence in South Asia is the character , activities and persistence of the militarized Islamist fundamentalist state in Pakistan .
No cure for this canker can be arrived at through any strategy of negotiations , support and financial aid to the military regime , or by a ' regulated ' transition to ' democracy ' . "
The confidential report continued , " The imprints of every major act of international Islamist terrorism invariably passes through Pakistan , right from 9/11 -- where virtually all the participants had trained , resided or met in , coordinated with , or received funding from or through Pakistan -- to major acts of terrorism across South Asia and Southeast Asia , as well as major networks of terror that have been discovered in Europe . "
Even before the 9/11 Commission received the report on Pakistan 's role in the terrorist attacks , the 9/11 Commission 's own report stated : " Pakistan was the nation that held the key to his ( bin Laden 's ) ability to use Afghanistan as a base . "
A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy categorically denied Thursday that Osama bin Laden had ever been treated " in any military hospital anywhere in Pakistan . "
" The reports , based on unnamed intelligence sources , are usually a figment of the writer 's imagination , " Mohammed Sadiq , Pakistan 's deputy chief of mission in Washington told United Press International .
Asked to comment on the claim that Pakistan was aware of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks before they occurred , Sadiq said : " This is basically the recycling of old charges , the unproven old charges ...
We have been working very closely with the U.S. administration and it is important to note that the U.S. administration also has always rejected these charges as false .
No one seems to know these imaginary intelligence sources . "
Pakistan is still denying President Pervez Musharraf knew anything about the activities of Dr. A.Q. Khan , the country 's most prominent nuclear scientist who had spent the last 10 years building and running a one - stop global shopping center for " rogue " nations .
North Korea , Iran and Libya did their shopping for nuclear weapons at Khan 's underground black market outlet .
After U.S. and British intelligence painstakingly pieced together Khan 's global nuclear proliferation endeavors , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was assigned last fall to inform Musharraf .
Khan , a national hero for giving Pakistan its nuclear arsenal , was not arrested .
Instead , Musharraf pardoned him in exchange for an abject apology on national television in English .
Few in Pakistan believed Musharraf 's story that he was totally in the dark about Khan 's operation .
Prior to seizing power in 1999 , Gen. Musharraf was -- and still is -- Army Chief of Staff .
For the past five years , Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence chief reported directly to Musharraf .
Osama bin Laden 's principal Pakistani adviser prior to 9/11 was retired Gen. Hamid Gul , a former ISI chief who is " strategic adviser " to the coalition of six politico - religious parties that governs two of Pakistan 's four provinces .
Known as MMA , the coalition also occupies 20 percent of the seats in the federal assembly in Islamabad .
Hours after 9/11 , Gul publicly accused Israel 's Mossad of fomenting the 9/11 plot .
Later , Gul said the U.S. Air Force must have been in on the conspiracy as no warplanes were scrambled to shoot down the hijacked airliners .
Gul spent two weeks in Afghanistan immediately prior to 9/11 .
He denied having met Osama bin Laden during that trip , but has always said he was an " admirer " of the al - Qaida leader .
However , he did meet with Mullah Mohammad Omar , the Taliban leader , on several occasions .
Since 9/11 , hardly a week goes by without Gul denouncing the U.S. in both the Urdu and English - language media .
In a conversation with this reporter in October 2001 , Gul forecast a future Islamist nuclear power that would form a greater Islamic state with a fundamentalist Saudi Arabia after the demise of the monarchy .
Gul worked closely with the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when he was in charge of ISI .
He was " mildly " fundamentalist in those days , he explained after 9/11 , and indifferent to the U.S.
But he became passionately anti-American after the U.S. turned its back on Afghanistan following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , and began punishing Pakistan with economic and military sanctions for its secret nuclear buildup .
A ranking CIA official , speaking not for attribution , said the agency considered Gul to be " the most dangerous man " in Pakistan .
A senior Pakistani political leader , also speaking on condition his name not be used , said , " I have reason to believe Hamid Gul was Osama bin Laden 's master planner . "
" Pakistan has harvested an enormous price , " the anonymous report said , for its apparent ' cooperation ' with the U.S. , and in this it has combined deception and blackmail -- including nuclear blackmail -- to secure a continuous stream of concessions .
Its conduct is little different from that of North Korea , which has in the past chosen the nuclear path to secure incremental aid from Western donors .
A pattern of sustained nuclear blackmail has consistently been at the heart of Pakistan 's case for concessions , aid and a heightened threshold of international tolerance for its sponsorship and support of Islamist terrorism .
" To understand how this works , it is useful to conceive of Pakistan 's ISI as a state acting as terrorist traffickers , complaining that , if it does not receive the extraordinary dispensations and indulgences that it seeks , it will , in effect , ' implode , ' and in the process do extraordinary harm .
" Part of the threat of this ' explosion ' is also the specter of the transfer of its nuclear arsenal and capabilities to more intransigent and irrational elements of the Islamist far right in Pakistan , who would not be amenable to the logic that its present rulers -- whose interests in terrorism are strategic , and consequently , subject to considerations of strategic advantage -- are willing to listen to ... " ... It is crucial to note that if the Islamist terrorist groups gain access to nuclear devices , ISI will almost certainly be the source ... At least six Pakistani scientists connected with the country 's nuclear program were in contact with al - Qaida and Osama bin Laden with the thorough instructions of ISI .
" Pakistan has projected the electoral victory of the fundamentalist and pro-Taliban , pro-al - Qaida Muttahida Majlis - e - Amal ( MMA ) in the November elections as ' proof ' that the military is the only ' barrier ' against the country passing into the hands of the extremists .
The fact , however , is that the elections were widely rigged , and this was a fact acknowledged by the European Union observers , as well as by some of the MMA 's constituents themselves .
The MMA victory was , in fact , substantially engineered by the Musharraf regime , as are the various anti-U.S. ' mass demonstrations ' around the country .
" Pakistan has made a big case out of the fact that some of the top line leadership of al - Qaida has been arrested in the country with the ' cooperation ' of the Pakistani security forces and intelligence .
However , the fact is that each such arrest only took place after the FBI and U.S. investigators had effectively gathered evidence to force Pakistani collaboration , but little of this evidence had come from Pakistani intelligence agencies .
Indeed , ISI has consistently sought to deny the presence of al - Qaida elements in Pakistan , and to mislead U.S. investigators ... This deception has been at the very highest level , and Musharraf himself , for instance , initially insisted he was ' certain ' bin Laden was dead .
" ... ISI has been actively facilitating the relocation of the al - Qaida from Afghanistan to Pakistan , and the conspiracy of substantial segments of serving Army and intelligence officers is visible . " " ... The Pakistan Army consistently denies giving the militants anything more than moral , diplomatic and political support .
The reality is quite different .
ISI issues money and directions to militant groups , specially the Arab hijackers of 9/11 from al - Qaida .
ISI was fully involved in devising and helping the entire affair .
And that is why people like Hamid Gul and others very quickly stated the propaganda that CIA and Mossad did it . " " ... The dilemma for Musharraf is that many of his army officers are still deeply sympathetic to al - Qaida , Taliban militants and the Kashmir cause .
The radical sympathies of many ISI operatives are all too apparent .
Many retired and present ISI officers retain close links to al - Qaida militants hiding in various state sponsored places in Pakistan and Kashmir as well as leaders from the defeated Taliban regime .
They regard the fight against Americans and Jews and Indians in different parts of the world as legitimate jihad . "
The report also says that " according to a senior tribal leader in Peshawar , bin Laden , who suffers from renal deficiency , has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of ISI if not of Gen. Pervez Musharraf himself . "
The same source , though not in the report , speculated Musharraf may be planning to turn over bin Laden to President Bush in time to clinch his reelection bid in November .
Staff at the 9/11 Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comments regarding the Pakistan memo .

I was recently looking at some of Paul Taylor 's writings on what he calls Abstract Stone Duality .
It 's partly another approach to ' topologising ' computer science , independently of Escardo 's work .
I 'm not yet in a position to say much about what he does , except that it gives a neat new language to talk about computable continuous functions without having to build things up from Set Theory .
But just for fun I want to look , out of context , at one teeny weeny little thing that he mentions , the Sierpinski space .
If you 've not met general topology before , it can be a tough topic to grasp .
So what I want to do is look in detail at how we might think about a really simple seeming problem from a topological perspective .
Haskell defines a type called ( ) .
There is one value of type ( ) , confusingly called ( ) .
Most of this post is about functions of the type ( ) -> ( ) .
You 'd imagine there could n't be much to say .
But this topic is much more complicated than some people might imagine .
How many functions of type ( ) -> ( ) are there ?
( Before proceeding , the character ⊥ should look like _|_. Apologies if your font / browser makes it looks like something else . )
Let 's start with the obvious function of this type .
It seems like this is the only possible function .
The argument can only be ( ) and the result can only be ( ) .
What other choices could we make ?
Well here 's another implementation :
It certainly looks different , but it still just maps ( ) to ( ) .
So it appears that f1 and f2 are the same .
But there is a way to tell them apart .
Make the following definition : Attempting to evaluate loop sends Haskell into an infinite loop .
Either you 'll get an error message , or your computer will loop forever , never giving a result .
Similarly , evaluating f1 loop will also fail to terminate with a sensible result .
But f2 loop terminates fine and returns ( ) .
Because Haskell is a lazy language , f2 does n't need to evaluate its argument before giving its result .
f1 , on the other hand , returns its argument , so looking at the result causes non-termination .
So amazingly , f1 and f2 are different .
We have at least two distinct functions of type ( ) -> ( ) .
Are there any more ?
We can treat a non-terminating function as if it returns a special value called ⊥ ( pronounced bottom ) .
So we can summarise the above in a kind of truth table :
That immediately suggests two more functions , f3 and f4 , which are also illustrated .
So it now looks like there are four functions of type ( ) -> ( ) .
Here 's a possible implementation of f3:f3 is simply a function that deliberately sabotages itself .
But f4 is the interesting one .
In order to have f4 ⊥ = ( ) , f4 must ignore its argument so that it does n't get caught in a quagmire of non-termination .
But if it ignores its argument , then it has to ignore its argument when f4 ( ) is evaluated .
So f4 ( ) must also equal ( ) .
In other words , f4 can not be implemented .
We have only three functions of type ( ) -> ( ) .
So how can we characterise these functions mathematically ?
Haskell functions do n't correspond to mathematical functions from the set {( ) } to {( ) } .
If we think of ( ) as a set with two elements , { ( ) , ⊥} , then Haskell functions still do n't correspond to functions from this set to itself .
Let 's give the set {⊥ , ( ) } a name , S . One approach to formalising Haskell functions is to impose an ordering on S. Here 's one : ⊥< =⊥⊥ <= ( ) ( ) < =( ) ( Now you can see why ⊥ is called " bottom " .
If you think of <= as a ranking , ⊥ is at the bottom of the heap . )
A monotone function is defined to be a function f such that if x< =y then f(x ) < =f (y ) .
If we plot a ' graph ' of f with ⊥ and ( ) along the axes , monotone functions are the ones that do n't descend as you go from left to right :
The possible Haskell functions correspond precisely to the monotone functions .
( Mathematicians would probably call these functions monotonically increasing but the computer science literature I have just seems to call them monotone ) .
Another useful definition is the notion of a strict function .
This is one that maps ⊥ to ⊥ and so goes through the ' origin ' on the graph above .
In a strict language you can't implement f2 .
But maybe you can think of another possible implementation of a function of type ( ) -> ( ) : When working with fully lazy evaluation this is indistinguishable from f3 so we can ignore it .
But in a strict language we can distinguish f3 and f5 .
In Haskell , for example , we can use the function seq to force evaluation of its first argument before moving onto its second .
f3 `seq` ( ) and f5 `seq` ( ) are distinguishable because the first evaluates to ( ) but the second gives ⊥.
So the answer to the original question is ( I think ) : * 1 in a total language or " in mathematics " * 3 in a lazy language like Haskell when working completely lazily * 4 in Haskell when using seq to enforce strictness * 3 in a strict language like OcamlYou'd think I 'd have exhausted everything that there is to say by now .
But there 's a whole lot more .
But before I get to it I need to talk a bit about topology in my next post .
And I 'm completely ignoring the philosophical issue of what ⊥ means when you can't tell the difference between an answer of ⊥ and a slow computer taking longer than you expect to compute ( ) .

This problem was trickier than I originally anticipated .

Here ’s part 5 of the ongoing serialization of Refactoring HTML , also available from Amazon and Safari .
XHTML is simply an XML - ized version of HTML .
Whereas HTML is at least theoretically built on top of SGML , XHTML is built on top of XML .
XML is a much simpler , clearer spec than SGML .
Therefore , XHTML is a simpler , clearer version of HTML .
However , like a gun , a lot depends on whether you ’re facing its front or rear end .
XHTML makes life harder for document authors in exchange for making life easier for document consumers .
Whereas HTML is forgiving , XHTML is not .
In HTML , nothing too serious happens if you omit an end - tag or leave off a quote here or there .
Some extra text may be marked in boldface or be improperly indented .
At worst , a few words here or there may vanish .
However , most of the page will still display .
This forgiving nature gives HTML a very shallow learning curve .
Although you can make mistakes when writing HTML , nothing horrible happens to you if you do .
By contrast , XHTML is much stricter .
A trivial mistake such as a missing quote or an omitted end - tag that a browser would silently recover from in HTML becomes a four - alarm , drop - everything , sirens - blaring emergency in XHTML .
One little , tiny error in an XHTML document , and the browser will throw up its hands and refuse to display the page , as shown in Figure 1.2 .
This makes writing XHTML pages harder , especially if you ’re using a plain text editor .
Like writing a computer program , one syntax error breaks everything .
There is no leeway , and no margin for error .
Figure 1.2 : Firefox responding to an error in an XHTML page
Why , then , would anybody choose XHTML ?
Because the same characteristics that make authoring XHTML a challenge ( draconian error handling ) make consuming XHTML a walk in the park .
Work has been shifted from the browser to the author .
A web browser ( or anything else that reads the page ) does n’t have to try to make sense out of a confusing mess of tag soup and guess what the page really meant to say .
If the page is unclear in any way , the browser is allowed , in fact required , to throw up its hands and refuse to process it .
This makes the browser ’s job much simpler .
A large portion of today ’s browsers devote a large chunk of their HTML parsing code simply to correcting errors in pages .
With XHTML they do n’t have to do that .
Of course , most of us are not browser vendors and are never going to write a browser .
What do we gain from XHTML and its draconian error handling ?
There are several benefits .
First of all , though most of us will never write a browser , many of us do write programs that consume web pages .
These can be mashups , web spiders , blog aggregators , search engines , authoring tools , and a dozen other things that all need to read web pages .
These programs are much easier to write when the data you ’re processing is XHTML rather than HTML .
Of course , many people working on the Web and most people authoring for the Web are not classic programmers and are not going to write a web spider or a blog aggregator .
However , there are two things they are very likely to write : JavaScript and stylesheets .
By number , these are by far the most common kinds of programs that read web pages .
Every JavaScript program embedded in a web page itself reads the web page .
Every CSS stylesheet ( though perhaps not a program in the traditional sense of the word ) also reads the web page .
JavaScript and CSS are much easier to write and debug when the pages they operate on are XHTML rather than HTML .
In fact , the extra cost of making a page valid XHTML is more than paid back by the time you save debugging your JavaScript and CSS .
While fixing XHTML errors is annoying and takes some time , it ’s a fairly straightforward process and not all that hard to do .
A validator will list the errors .
Then you go through the list and fix each one .
In fact , errors at this level are fairly predictable and can often be fixed automatically , as we ’ll see in Chapters 3 and 4 .
You usually do n’t need to fix each problem by hand .
Repairing XHTML can take a little time , but the amount of time is predictable .
It does n’t become the sort of indefinite time sink you encounter when debugging cross - browser JavaScript or CSS interactions with ill - formed HTML .
Writing correct XHTML is only even mildly challenging when hand authoring in a text editor .
If tools generate your markup , XHTML becomes a no-brainer .
Good WYSIWYG HTML editors such as Dreamweaver 8 can ( and should ) be configured to produce valid XHTML by default .
Markup level editors such as BBEdit can also be set to use XHTML rules , though authors will need to be a little more careful here .
Many have options to check a document for XHTML validity and can even automatically correct any errors with the click of a button .
Make sure you have turned on the necessary preference in your editor of choice .
Similarly good CMSs , Wikis , and blog engines can all be told to generate XHTML .
If your authoring tool does not support XHTML , by all means get a better tool .
In 2008 , there ’s no excuse for an HTML editor or web publishing system not to support XHTML .
If your site is using a hand - grown templating system , you may have a little more work to do ; and you ’ll see exactly what you need to do in Chapters 3 and 4 .
Although the process here is a little more manual , once you ’ve made the changes , valid XHTML falls out automatically .
Authors entering content through databases or web forms may not need to change their workflow at all , especially if they ’re already entering data in a non-HTML format such as markdown or wikitext .
The system can make the transition to XHTML transparent and painless .
The second reason to prefer XHTML over HTML is cross - browser compatibility .
In practice , XHTML is much more consistent in today ’s browsers than HTML .
This is especially true for complex pages that make heavy use of CSS for styling or JavaScript for behavior .
Although browsers can fix markup mistakes in classic HTML , they do n’t always fix them the same way .
Two browsers can read the same page and produce very different internal models of it .
This makes writing one stylesheet or script that works across browsers a challenge .
By contrast , XHTML does n’t leave nearly so much to browser interpretation .
There ’s less room for browser flakiness .
Although it ’s certainly true that browsers differ in their level of support for all of CSS , and that their JavaScript dialects and internal DOMs are not fully compatible , moving to XHTML does remove at least one major cause of cross - browser issues .
It ’s not a complete solution , but it does fix a lot .
The third reason to prefer XHTML over HTML is to enable you to incorporate new technologies in your pages in the future .
For reasons already elaborated upon , XHTML is a much stronger platform to build on .
HTML is great for displaying text and pictures , and it ’s not bad for simple forms .
However , beyond that the browser becomes primarily a host for other technologies such as Flash , Java , and AJAX .
There are many things the browser cannot easily do , such as math and music notation .
There are other things that are much harder to do than they should be , such as alerting the user when they type an incorrect value in a form field .
Technologies exist to improve this and more are under development .
These include MathML for equations , MusicXML for scores , Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) for animated pictures , XForms for very powerful client - side applications , and more .
All of these start from the foundation of XHTML .
None of them operates properly with classic HTML .
Refactoring your pages into XHTML will enable you to take advantage of these and other exciting new technologies going forward .
In some cases , they ’ll let you do things you ca n’t already do .
In other cases , they ’ll let you do things you are doing now , but much more quickly and cheaply .
Either way , they ’re well worth the cost of refactoring to XHTML .

An east Hollywood garage owner who was shot in the chest when he confronted two youths scrawling graffiti on his Thai Town business remained in stable condition Thursday , according to authorities and a relative .
The shooting occurred in the 5000 block of Hollywood Boulevard shortly after 1 p.m.
Wednesday when workers at the auto body shop spotted taggers painting 6 - foot - high black letters on a wall , police said .
The gunshot victim and his employees were writing down license plate information when the alleged taggers got out of their car , said Sgt. Alfredo Flores of the Los Angeles Police Department .
The owner told the two youths -- each described as not much taller than 5 feet -- not to tag his property , Flores said .

One of the youths pulled out a handgun , shot the man in the chest , got back in the car and drove away .
Authorities have not released the victim ’s name .
Authorities suspect that the youths are tied to a local gang known as Armenian Power .
Surveillance video from the shop is being used by detectives , who said they think they have identified the youths and are searching for them now , said Police Cmdr.
Pat Gannon .

He said other youths had been questioned but no arrests had been made .
A vehicle believed to have been used by the assailants was found Wednesday in the San Fernando Valley and seized by officers .
The auto body shop had previously been tagged with graffiti and the owner had installed video cameras connected to the store ’s computers to monitor activity .
At the shop Thursday morning , a man who identified himself as the victim ’s brother declined to speak to reporters , except to say that his brother was doing fine .
The taggers ’ bold black letters were still fresh on the building ’s beige wall .
Police advised residents that taggers , even those who seem like young kids , are often armed and can be dangerous .

“ They ’re out there tagging , they ’re criminals , ” Flores said .
“ Call the police .
Get the most info as you can , be the best witness , be involved in your community , take a stand . ”
Flores stressed that by taking a stand he meant residents should keep police informed , not confront taggers themselves .
Vilma Infante , 42 , a single mother who works as a nanny , was on her way to take the bus to work Thursday .
She said the shooting was the most violent tagging incident she has seen in her eight years in the neighborhood .
She described tagging as “ a big problem for the neighborhood . ”
“ It ’s pure vandalism , ” she said .
“ I mean , do n’t they think that they are destroying their own neighborhood ? ”

At the Norwood Market a block from the scene of the shooting , owner Feroz Ahmed , 39 , said he has been friendly with the wounded man , who had stopped in to buy something shortly before he was shot .
Ahmed said he has had to call city crews to paint over graffiti on the sides of his store so often in the three years he has owned it that they just started coming every week .
“ I have 20 years of experience in this business , and I know not to mess with them , ” Ahmed said of the taggers .
“ Sometimes you feel like you are in the taggers ’ hands , so you feel powerless . ”

Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report .
You can often tell if someone understands how wrong their actions are by the lengths to which they go to rationalize them .
It took 81 pages of twisted legal reasoning to justify President Bush ’s decision to ignore federal law and international treaties and authorize the abuse and torture of prisoners .
Eighty - one spine - crawling pages in a memo that might have been unearthed from the dusty archives of some authoritarian regime and has no place in the annals of the United States .
It is must reading for anyone who still doubts whether the abuse of prisoners were rogue acts rather than calculated policy .
The March 14 , 2003 , memo was written by John C. Yoo , then a lawyer for the Justice Department .
He earlier helped draft a memo that redefined torture to justify repugnant , clearly illegal acts against Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners .
The purpose of the March 14 memo was equally insidious : to make sure that the policy makers who authorized those acts , or the subordinates who carried out the orders , were not convicted of any crime .
The list of laws that Mr. Yoo ’s memo sought to circumvent is long : federal laws against assault , maiming , interstate stalking , war crimes and torture ; international laws against torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ; and the Geneva Conventions .
On April 4 , 1967 , African - American civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King addressed a gathering of religious antiwar activists at Riverside Church in New York City .
On April 4 , 1968 , he was assassinated .
``I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution , we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values .
We must rapidly begin the shift from a ` thing - oriented ' society to a `person - oriented ' society .
When machines and computers , profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people , the giant triplets of racism , materialism , and militarism are incapable of being conquered . '' -- MLK .

MLK : Beyond Vietnam : A Time to Break Silence
***
I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice .
I join with you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organisation which has brought us together : Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam .
The recent statement of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines : “ A time comes when silence is betrayal . ”
That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam .
The truth of these words is beyond doubt but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one .
Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth , men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government ’s policy , especially in time of war .
Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one ’s own bosom and in the surrounding world .
Moreover when the issues at hand seem as perplexed as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict we are always on the verge of being mesmerised by uncertainty ; but we must move on .
Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony , but we must speak .
We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision , but we must speak .
And we must rejoice as well , for surely this is the first time in our nation ’s history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history .
Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us .
If it is , let us trace its movement well and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance , for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us .
Over the past two years , as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart , as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam , many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path .
At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud :
Why are you speaking about war , Dr. King ?
Why are you joining the voices of dissent ?
Peace and civil rights do n’t mix , they say .
Are n’t you hurting the cause of your people , they ask ?
And when I hear them , though I often understand the source of their concern , I am nevertheless greatly saddened , for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me , my commitment or my calling .
Indeed , their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live .
In the light of such tragic misunderstandings , I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly , and I trust concisely , why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church — the church in Montgomery , Alabama , where I began my pastorate — leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight .
I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation .
This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front .
It is not addressed to China or to Russia .
Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam .
Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue , nor to overlook the role they can play in a successful resolution of the problem .
While they both may have justifiable reason to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States , life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides .
Tonight , however , I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the NLF , but rather to my fellow Americans , who , with me , bear the greatest responsibility in ending a conflict that has exacted a heavy price on both continents .
The importance of Vietnam
Since I am a preacher by trade , I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my moral vision .
There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I , and others , have been waging in America .
A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle .
It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor — both black and white — through the poverty program .
There were experiments , hopes , new beginnings .
Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war , and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube .
So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such .
Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home .
It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population .
We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem .
So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools .
So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village , but we realise that they would never live on the same block in Detroit .
I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor .
My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness , for it grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years — especially the last three summers .
As I have walked among the desperate , rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems .
I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action .
But they asked — and rightly so — what about Vietnam ?
They asked if our own nation was n’t using massive doses of violence to solve its problems , to bring about the changes it wanted .
Their questions hit home , and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today — my own government .
For the sake of those boys , for the sake of this government , for the sake of hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence , I can not be silent .
For those who ask the question , “ Are n’t you a civil rights leader ? ” and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace , I have this further answer .
In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , we chose as our motto : “ To save the soul of America . ”
We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people , but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself unless the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear .
In a way we were agreeing with Langston Hughes , that black bard of Harlem , who had written earlier :
O , yes ,
I say it plain ,
America never was America to me ,
And yet I swear this oath –
America will be !
Now , it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war .
If America ’s soul becomes totally poisoned , part of the autopsy must read Vietnam .
It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over .
So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent , working for the health of our land .
As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were not enough , another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 1964 ; and I cannot forget that the Nobel Prise for Peace was also a commission — a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for “ the brotherhood of man . ”
This is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances , but even if it were not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ .
To me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I am speaking against the war .
Could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men — for Communist and capitalist , for their children and ours , for black and for white , for revolutionary and conservative ?
Have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them ?
What then can I say to the “ Vietcong ” or to Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this one ?
Can I threaten them with death or must I not share with them my life ?
Finally , as I try to delineate for you and for myself the road that leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God .
Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood , and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children , I come tonight to speak for them .
This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation ’s self - defined goals and positions .
We are called to speak for the weak , for the voiceless , for victims of our nation and for those it calls enemy , for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers .
Strange liberators
And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond to compassion my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula .
I speak now not of the soldiers of each side , not of the junta in Saigon , but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now .
I think of them too because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries .
They must see Americans as strange liberators .
The Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1945 after a combined French and Japanese occupation , and before the Communist revolution in China .
They were led by Ho Chi Minh .
Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom , we refused to recognise them .
Instead , we decided to support France in its re-conquest of her former colony .
Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not “ ready ” for independence , and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long .
With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self - determination , and a government that had been established not by China ( for whom the Vietnamese have no great love ) but by clearly indigenous forces that included some Communists .
For the peasants this new government meant real land reform , one of the most important needs in their lives .

For nine years following 1945 we denied the people of Vietnam the right of independence .
For nine years we vigorously supported the French in their abortive effort to re-colonise Vietnam .
Before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the French war costs .
Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu , they began to despair of the reckless action , but we did not .
We encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will .
Soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at re-colonisation .
After the French were defeated it looked as if independence and land reform would come again through the Geneva agreements .
But instead there came the United States , determined that Ho should not unify the temporarily divided nation , and the peasants watched again as we supported one of the most vicious modern dictators — our chosen man , Premier Diem .
The peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly routed out all opposition , supported their extortionist landlords and refused even to discuss reunification with the north .
The peasants watched as all this was presided over by U.S. influence and then by increasing numbers of U.S. troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem ’s methods had aroused .
When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy , but the long line of military dictatorships seemed to offer no real change — especially in terms of their need for land and peace .
The only change came from America as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt , inept and without popular support .
All the while the people read our leaflets and received regular promises of peace and democracy — and land reform .
Now they languish under our bombs and consider us — not their fellow Vietnamese — the real enemy .
They move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met .
They know they must move or be destroyed by our bombs .
So they go — primarily women and children and the aged .
They watch as we poison their water , as we kill a million acres of their crops .
They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees .
They wander into the hospitals , with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one “ Vietcong ” - inflicted injury .
So far we may have killed a million of them — mostly children .
They wander into the towns and see thousands of the children , homeless , without clothes , running in packs on the streets like animals .
They see the children , degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food .
They see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers , soliciting for their mothers .
What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform ?
What do they think as we test our latest weapons on them , just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe ?
Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building ?
Is it among these voiceless ones ?
We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions : the family and the village .
We have destroyed their land and their crops .
We have cooperated in the crushing of the nation ’s only non-Communist revolutionary political force — the unified Buddhist church .
We have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon .
We have corrupted their women and children and killed their men .
What liberators ?
Now there is little left to build on — save bitterness .
Soon the only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call fortified hamlets .
The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these ?
Could we blame them for such thoughts ?
We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise .
These too are our brothers .
Perhaps the more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies .
What of the National Liberation Front — that strangely anonymous group we call VC or Communists ?
What must they think of us in America when they realise that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem which helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the south ?
What do they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of arms ?
How can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of “ aggression from the north ” as if there were nothing more essential to the war ?
How can they trust us when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign of Diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land ?
Surely we must understand their feelings even if we do not condone their actions .
Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed them to their violence .
Surely we must see that our own computerised plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts .
How do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is less than twenty - five percent Communist and yet insist on giving them the blanket name ?
What must they be thinking when they know that we are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam and yet we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organised political parallel government will have no part ?
They ask how we can speak of free elections when the Saigon press is censored and controlled by the military junta .
And they are surely right to wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them — the only party in real touch with the peasants .
They question our political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded .
Their questions are frighteningly relevant .
Is our nation planning to build on political myth again and then shore it up with the power of new violence ?
Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence when it helps us to see the enemy ’s point of view , to hear his questions , to know his assessment of ourselves .
For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition , and if we are mature , we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition .
So , too , with Hanoi .
In the north , where our bombs now pummel the land , and our mines endanger the waterways , we are met by a deep but understandable mistrust .
To speak for them is to explain this lack of confidence in Western words , and especially their distrust of American intentions now .
In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence against the Japanese and the French , the men who sought membership in the French commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of Paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies .
It was they who led a second struggle against French domination at tremendous costs , and then were persuaded to give up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a temporary measure at Geneva .
After 1954 they watched us conspire with Diem to prevent elections which would have surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over a united Vietnam , and they realised they had been betrayed again .
When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate , these things must be remembered .
Also it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva agreements concerning foreign troops , and they remind us that they did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had moved into the tens of thousands .
Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace , how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made .
Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces , and now he has surely heard of the increasing international rumors of American plans for an invasion of the north .
He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy .
Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor weak nation more than eight thousand miles away from its shores .
At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless on Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy , I am as deeply concerned about our troops there as anything else .
For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalising process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy .
We are adding cynicism to the process of death , for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved .
Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese , and the more sophisticated surely realise that we are on the side of the wealthy and the secure while we create hell for the poor .
This madness must cease
Somehow this madness must cease .
We must stop now .
I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam .
I speak for those whose land is being laid waste , whose homes are being destroyed , whose culture is being subverted .
I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam .
I speak as a citisen of the world , for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken .
I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation .
The great initiative in this war is ours .
The initiative to stop it must be ours .
This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam .
Recently one of them wrote these words :
``Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct .
The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies .
It is curious that the Americans , who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory , do not realise that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat .
The image of America will never again be the image of revolution , freedom and democracy , but the image of violence and militarism . ''
If we continue , there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam .
It will become clear that our minimal expectation is to occupy it as an American colony and men will not refrain from thinking that our maximum hope is to goad China into a war so that we may bomb her nuclear installations .
If we do not stop our war against the people of Vietnam immediately the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some horribly clumsy and deadly game we have decided to play .
The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve .
It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam , that we have been detrimental to the life of the Vietnamese people .
The situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways .
In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam , we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war .
I would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do immediately to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict :
End all bombing in North and South Vietnam
Declare a unilateral cease - fire in the hope that such action will create the atmosphere for negotiation .
Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference in Laos .
Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in any meaningful negotiations and in any future Vietnam government .
Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in accordance with the 1954 Geneva agreement .
Part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the Liberation Front .
Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done .
We most provide the medical aid that is badly needed , making it available in this country if necessary .
Protesting the war
Meanwhile we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment .
We must continue to raise our voices if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam .
We must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative means of protest possible .
As we counsel young men concerning military service we must clarify for them our nation ’s role in Vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection .
I am pleased to say that this is the path now being chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater , Morehouse College , and I recommend it to all who find the American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one .
Moreover I would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors .
These are the times for real choices and not false ones .
We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly .
Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions , but we must all protest .
There is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam .
I say we must enter the struggle , but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing .
The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit , and if we ignore this sobering reality we will find ourselves organising clergy - and laymen - concerned committees for the next generation .
They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru .
They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia .
They will be concerned about Mozambique and South Africa .
We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy .
Such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam , but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God .
In 1957 a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution .
During the past ten years we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which now has justified the presence of U.S. military “ advisors ” in Venezuela .
This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counter - revolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala .
It tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Colombia and why American napalm and green beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru .
It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us .
Five years ago he said , “ Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable . ”
Increasingly , by choice or by accident , this is the role our nation has taken — the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investment .
I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution , we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values .
We must rapidly begin the shift from a “ thing - oriented ” society to a “ person - oriented ” society .
When machines and computers , profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people , the giant triplets of racism , materialism , and militarism are incapable of being conquered .
A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies .
On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life ’s roadside ; but that will be only an initial act .
One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life ’s highway .
True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ; it is not haphazard and superficial .
It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring .
A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth .
With righteous indignation , it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia , Africa and South America , only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries , and say : “ This is not just . ”
It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America and say : “ This is not just . ”
The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just .
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war : “ This way of settling differences is not just . ”
This business of burning human beings with napalm , of filling our nation ’s homes with orphans and widows , of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane , of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged , cannot be reconciled with wisdom , justice and love .
A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death .
America , the richest and most powerful nation in the world , can well lead the way in this revolution of values .
There is nothing , except a tragic death wish , to prevent us from reordering our priorities , so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war .
There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood .
This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism .
War is not the answer .
Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons .
Let us not join those who shout war and through their misguided passions urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations .
These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness .
We must not call everyone a Communist or an appeaser who advocates the seating of Red China in the United Nations and who recognises that hate and hysteria are not the final answers to the problem of these turbulent days .
We must not engage in a negative anti-communism , but rather in a positive thrust for democracy , realising that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice .
We must with positive action seek to remove those conditions of poverty , insecurity and injustice which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops .
The people are important
These are revolutionary times .
All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression and out of the wombs of a frail world new systems of justice and equality are being born .
The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before .
“ The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light . ”
We in the West must support these revolutions .
It is a sad fact that , because of comfort , complacency , a morbid fear of communism , and our proneness to adjust to injustice , the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries .
This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has the revolutionary spirit .
Therefore , communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions we initiated .
Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty , racism , and militarism .
With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores and thereby speed the day when “ every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain . ”
A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional .
Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies .
This call for a world - wide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one ’s tribe , race , class and nation is in reality a call for an all - embracing and unconditional love for all men .
This oft misunderstood and misinterpreted concept — so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force — has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man .
When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response .
I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life .
Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality .
This Hindu - Moslem - Christian - Jewish - Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John :
Let us love one another ; for love is God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God .
He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
If we love one another God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day .
We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation .
The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever - rising tides of hate .
History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self - defeating path of hate .
As Arnold Toynbee says :
``Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil .
Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word . ''
We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today .
We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now .
In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late .
Procrastination is still the thief of time .
Life often leaves us standing bare , naked and dejected with a lost opportunity .
The “ tide in the affairs of men ” does not remain at the flood ; it ebbs .
We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage , but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on .
Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilisations are written the pathetic words : “ Too late . ”
There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect .
“ The moving finger writes , and having writ moves on … ”
We still have a choice today ; nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation .
We must move past indecision to action .
We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world — a world that borders on our doors .
If we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion , might without morality , and strength without sight .
Now let us begin .
Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter — but beautiful — struggle for a new world .
This is the calling of the sons of God , and our brothers wait eagerly for our response .
Shall we say the odds are too great ?
Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard ?
Will our message be that the forces of American life militate against their arrival as full men , and we send our deepest regrets ?
Or will there be another message , of longing , of hope , of solidarity with their yearnings , of commitment to their cause , whatever the cost ?
The choice is ours , and though we might prefer it otherwise we must choose in this crucial moment of human history .
As that noble bard of yesterday , James Russell Lowell , eloquently stated :
Once to every man and nation
Comes the moment to decide ,
In the strife of truth and falsehood ,
For the good or evil side ;
Some great cause , God ’s new Messiah ,
Off ’ring each the bloom or blight ,
And the choice goes by forever
Twixt that darkness and that light .
Though the cause of evil prosper ,
Yet ’tis truth alone is strong ;
Though her portion be the scaffold ,
And upon the throne be wrong :
Yet that scaffold sways the future ,
And behind the dim unknown ,
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his own .

The bad news has come from Illinois , Louisiana and Mississippi -- a string of unexpected Republican defeats in congressional elections that have prompted GOP leaders to say , with candor unusual in politics , that the party is facing an outright catastrophe this November .
Increasingly , top Republicans are calling on their party to reinvent itself or risk driving away more voters and donors .
The GOP image is so stale , said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Va. ) , in a memo to colleagues last week , that “ if we were a dog food , they would take us off the shelf ” because nobody is buying it .
But even while facing crisis , the GOP is finding that change , if it comes , will not come easily .
The difficulty of a swift reinvention was on display last week as the central players in Washington ’s conservative community gathered for their weekly strategy session , the Wednesday Meeting , held in a conference room of Grover Norquist ’s Americans for Tax Reform organization .
Advertisement
A senior advisor to the GOP ’s presumptive presidential nominee , John McCain , was on hand along with the Republican Party ’s national chairman to make the case for McCain ’s brand of Republicanism .
McCain ’s approach -- tough on taxes , but receptive to immigrants and committed to easing global warming -- could help paint the GOP in new colors , more attractive to independent voters , Latinos and women .
Some GOP leaders now say that by embracing McCain and his policy platform , Republicans would instantly “ rebrand ” and reinvigorate their party .
At first , that message from McCain advisor Carly Fiorina and RNC Chairman Mike Duncan seemed to resonate with the 200 or so Republicans in the room , many still absorbing the loss only hours before of a Mississippi House seat once considered among the party ’s safest .
But one participant at the Wednesday Meeting rose to question the soundness of the Arizona senator ’s plans for more government action to combat global warming .
Similar ideas , the speaker said , had proved to be a disaster in Europe .
Heads nodded and dozens of economic conservatives and global - warming skeptics applauded .
Advertisement
Global warming is one of several knotty topics causing Republicans to skirmish among themselves as they reckon with a horrific political landscape : President Bush ’s record - low approval ratings , an unpopular war , a sagging economy and persistent scandals .
Before last week ’s loss in a special congressional election in Mississippi , the party took a similar hit at the beginning of the month in Louisiana and , in March , another in Illinois .
The disconcerted and divided mood of the party contrasts sharply with its optimism and unity only a few years ago around plans to build an era of political dominance .
As with global warming , those who want a tough line on immigration and border security have also been at odds with the McCain .
Advertisement
U.S. Rep . Tom Tancredo of Colorado wrote on the website Townhall.com that McCain and the Republican National Committee were hurling “ obstructions ” at members of Congress who want to run on the “ winning issue ” of tough border and immigration enforcement .
Tancredo took aim at McCain ’s decision to speak to a Latino civil rights and advocacy organization , National Council of La Raza , accusing the presidential candidate of “ shameful pandering to a special - interest lobby . ”
Budgeting and earmark reform also prompted squabbling among Republicans in the last week .
McCain and his allies say the GOP can rebrand itself as the party of reform by fighting pork - barrel spending and ending congressional earmarks , the narrowly drawn instructions that individual members slip into legislation that often benefit a specific company or individual .
But as the White House and McCain disparaged the $ 300 - billion farm bill under consideration last week as one example of overspending and earmarking projects , Minnesota Sen .
Norm Coleman and other key farm state Republicans up for reelection this year voted for it .
This kind of tension demonstrates how difficult it may be to develop a policy consensus , even though there is widespread acknowledgment that the party may face significant losses in November without it .
Advertisement
McCain ’s supporters argue that that his policy proposals would bring a new image to the party , one that solves its problems by recalling old virtues of conservatism -- such as spending control and smaller government -- while appealing to key groups of voters needed by the GOP : Latinos , women and young people .
Like President Bush , McCain has split from the party base in backing more liberal immigration laws and criticizing conservatives for ethnically insensitive rhetoric .
As a result , McCain aides believe now that the Arizona senator has the potential to do well among Latino voters , perhaps winning more than the 40 % that Bush did in 2004 .
That , they say , could assure victory in Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada -- states the Democratic nominee would have to carry in order to win .
It could also help McCain win Florida , a state he cannot afford to lose .
While reaching out to Latinos , McCain showed last week that he is fully aware of the risks that his immigration stance poses in alienating a vocal portion of conservative Republicans .
Advertisement
He chose his words carefully when he delivered a major address in Columbus , Ohio , laying out his first - term goals .
He predicted that he would fix the country ’s immigration problems through “ tremendous improvements to border security infrastructure and increases in the border patrol , and vigorous prosecution of companies that employ illegal aliens . ”
By 2013 , he said , he hoped “ illegal immigrants who broke our laws after they came here [ will ] have been arrested and deported . ”
Only then did McCain offer some of his more familiar rhetoric that some say is welcoming toward illegal immigrants .
He predicted that with the borders secured , Americans would accept the “ practical necessity to institute a temporary worker program and deal humanely with the millions of immigrants who have been in this country illegally . ”
In other recent speeches , McCain promised conservative judicial appointments and affirmed his commitment to gun rights .
And , despite his past opposition to some of Bush ’s tax cuts , he now pledges to keep them in place .
Advertisement
His efforts show signs of paying off .
Republican strategists who once sought to annihilate McCain for his independence are now enthusiastically backing his candidacy , offering strategic advice and affirmation of his conservative credentials .
They include Bush ’s former senior strategist , Karl Rove ; and Norquist , the anti-tax activist .
Norquist acknowledges that McCain ’s approach to capping global warming emissions has inflamed some conservatives , calling it the most significant issue dividing the party now .
More important than angering conservatives , Norquist says , is that McCain ’s position means “ he wo n’t be able to draw a sharp contrast ” with his Democratic opponent on this topic , and thus will miss the opportunity “ to do what Bush did to Gore : travel the coal states and tell workers that the Democratic candidate favors environmental rules that will cost you your job . ”
McCain strategists say their candidate ’s global warming position is substantively correct and provides a clear way to distinguish him from the unpopular current president .
Still , the McCain approach to reducing greenhouse gases -- a government - run system to cap emissions -- continues to draw heated objections .
Advertisement
Economic conservatives believe McCain ’s so - called “ cap and trade ” system is unworkable , violates free - market principles and would harm business interests .
Some question whether McCain overstates the threat of warming .
And the controversy is not cooling .
Late last week , conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh castigated McCain for his “ embrace of a radical environmental agenda , ” calling it a sign that the Republican Party “ is abandoning conservatism , abandoning those things and those people that made it victorious . ”
Advertisement
McCain ’s chief economic advisor , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , said taking on the problem of global warming could prove beneficial for the party .
“ We are looking at an electoral environment which is extremely difficult for Republicans , ” he said .
“ In those circumstances , everyone should rethink existing positions carefully . ”

However , the rapidity and volatility of current oil prices may be due to a more narrow set of factors surrounding the production of light sweet crude : the comparative quality and scarcity of light sweet crude , world demand , and guerrilla systems disruption .
The run-up in oil prices over the last four years is usually framed , likely correctly , as a combination of torrential demand from developing countries ( China and India ) , speculation , and peak supply .
Other analysis indicates that production is also being damaged due to NOC mismanagement , political instability , and rapid increases in domestic consumption within oil exporting countries .
This is a guest post by John Robb .
John is an author , an entrepreneur , a blogger at Global Guerrillas , and a former USAF pilot in special operations .
His book , Brave New War was published in April 2007 by Wiley , which can be purchased here .
The book apparently is influential , since Robb was named one of the " Best and Brightest " by Esquire Magazine and invited to speak at a plethora of venues ( the DoD , CIA , NSA , NIC , Highlands Forum , Center for Biosecurity , and many more ) .
The book is also being used in universities from the Naval Post Graduate School to Johns Hopkins .
The Basics
1 ) Light sweet crude is at the top of the oil quality pyramid .
Current excess production capacity , the bulk of new production slated to come online , and the vast majority projected reserves are from the lower strata in the pyramid .
2 ) The world demands light sweet crude -- this demand is structural ( not easily shifted ) since most of the current infrastructure is built to process light sweet .
As a result , it trades at a significant premium to heavy crude .
This puts oil producers in a difficult bind : increased production of heavy crude without a corresponding increase in infrastructure to process it will result in a rapid collapse of prices for heavy crude .
Therefore , heavy crude is kept in the ground until prices / infrastructure can support it .
3 ) Guerrilla systems disruption .
Much of our global production of light sweet crude is located in countries where small bands of guerrillas , loosely organized within what 's called an open source insurgency , have been disrupting production and preventing investment .
The cumulative impact of this activity may constitute a " Shadow OPEC " ( akin to the impact of thousands of ants vs. that of an elephant ) .
Let 's look at this in detail .
A Concentration of Disruption
The war in Iraq has proven to be a proving ground for the strategies and tactics of 21st Century warfare , much like the Spanish Civil War was for WW2 .
Unfortunately , the bulk of the improvement has been in how small groups of guerrillas / terrorists can defeat a nation - state .
Of particular note has been the increasing use of sabotage and targeted violence to induce systemic failures in critical infrastructure .
These use of these methods have been concentrated in many of the states that produce light sweet crude .
1 ) Iraq .
Ongoing disruption of critical oil infrastructure has kept Iraqi oil production below pre-war production levels .
It has also kept new investment ( from global sources ) that is necessary to repair existing infrastructure , let alone expand it , away .
2) Nigeria .
Disruption of Nigerian production has radically reduced production ( 600 - 800,000 barrels a day ) already and it is growing .
3 ) Others .
Attacks on oil workers in Algeria may indicate the potential of guerrilla tactics to the new model .
Attacks on natural gas infrastructure in Mexico last fall and its ongoing guerrilla war may translate into new disruption this year .
Venezuela is in an ongoing crisis and may succumb to guerrilla warfare that disrupts production in the next couple of years .
A Shadow OPEC
So , given production limitations and strong / concentrated demand , even small disruptions by guerrilla groups on light sweet crude production is likely to have a direct influence on global oil pricing ( in contrast , disruptions aimed at heavy crude production should have little impact on global pricing ) .
Further , there are already active groups in many of the most critical production areas .
Fortunately , from the demonstrated behavior of these groups it does n't appear that guerrilla / terrorist groups have fully grasped their potential market power with small attacks ( despite aspirational pronouncements from al Qaeda and large scale attacks in 2005 / 2006 ) .
Once they do , as bad as disruption is today , it could get MUCH worse .
Why ?
A direct connection to scalable profits .
Most guerrillas / terrorists are highly entrepreneurial .
They participate in everything from land scams to protection money to smuggling to kidnapping .
Further , many guerrilla groups already directly profit from the sale of bunkered / smuggled oil to international markets ( already worth billions ) .
While higher global prices improve the returns from that activity , so much more money could be made through connections to financial partners able to profit from price movements on international markets .
These profits would be nearly impossible to trace .
As we saw with e-mail spam / phishing , even the faintest whiff of profits can turn a loose collection of individuals / groups into a torrential crime - fueled marketplace generated billions and attracting tens of thousands of participants .
Are we about to see the same occur with oil ?
' Jomo Gbomo ' is only an e-mail away ....
Shoes off , and packed so tightly in a mosque that they sweat in the chilly night , several thousand men in eastern Iran await their hero .
The air is electric .
When he arrives , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is greeted like a rock star : with a collective inhale the crowd jumps up to catch a glimpse of the firebrand populist .
" Sit down !
Sit down ! " a cleric implores , as laudatory whistling intensifies .
" The friend of the Imam [ Mahdi ] has come ! "
While Mr. Ahmadinejad is under attack across Iran 's political spectrum for his economic policies and unyielding nuclear rhetoric , even his detractors say these frequent visits to Iran 's provinces are shrewd politics that give him a serious shot at reelection in 2009 .
The president now also gloats – over Iranian rivals who say he brought the country close to war , as much as over American hawks championing attacks – about a new US National Intelligence Estimate that said this week Iran halted a nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The report is " a victory for the Iranian nation in the nuclear issue against all international powers , " Ahmadinejad told rallying supporters Wednesday in the western city of Ilam .
He warned : " If you want to start up a new game , the Iranian people will resist and will not step back one inch . "
Reaching out to the pious and poor
A rare journey by a Western reporter , concurrent with one of Ahmadinejad 's visits last month to South Khorasan Province where he handed out toys , cash , and executive support for big - ticket development projects , shows how the president is building his political base outside the capital , Tehran .
An unannounced visit to an experimental irrigation project , among many being touted by the president 's aides , also found that a large infusion of cash , received the day before this reporter 's visit , will enable operations to expand 20 - fold , creating more than 1,100 new jobs with credit going to Ahmadinejad .
As the president began a second round of 30 provincial visits in the city of Birjand , his entourage of aides and ministers spread out to villages to check on development projects , cut red tape , and receive 130,000 personal letters full of requests for money and jobs , as well as complaints – adding them to the 9 million letters the president has already accumulated over 2 - 1 / 2 years in office .
Iranians have as many problems as ever , from corruption to soaring prices and unemployment .
But during this trip , the president spent millions in this province alone – from new petrochemical factories to shantytown improvement .
He promised that next fiscal year , 40 percent of Iran 's budget would go to rural areas .
All of this adds to a perception here of Ahmadinejad as a pious populist , a man searching for solutions , and not part of the problem .
Some even link him to the Shiite Muslim savior , the Mahdi , whom they expect will one day return to bring universal justice .
" Ahmadinejad is the best president that we have ever had . …
He is an angel , the envoy of the Imam of the Age [ Mahdi ] , " says one sandwich - shop owner in Sarayan , a few hours north of Birjand .
" But still , our town has lots of problems , " laments the owner , who was refused a loan from city hall to expand his eatery into a guesthouse .
" You have to have a friend to have your request approved .
Problems , problems .... "
Such faith in Ahmadinejad contrasts sharply with the view in Tehran , where criticism of the president is daily fare .
The moderate Mardom - Salari newspaper calls provincial trips a " backward step " drawn from the first days of ancient Greek democracy .
Better to improve the overall economy , the paper chided , so fewer Iranians feel compelled to write personal requests .
But the carefully crafted image plays well among the president 's core constituents : legions of pious Iranians who still say they believe his promise to bring them a share of Iran 's vast oil wealth ; and ideological warriors of the basiji ( volunteer ideological forces ) militia and Revolutionary Guards forces who have profited most from government contracts .
" There are only two ways Ahmadinejad can be defeated , " says a political scientist in Tehran , who asked not to be named .
" Another [ reformist ] mass vote or Supreme Leader [ Ayatollah Sayyed Ali ]
Khamenei fully withdraws his support for Ahmadinejad – and I do n't see either one happening . "
The president , says this analyst , " is getting smarter on how he spends money , targets his campaigns , and at negative campaigning . "
In recent weeks , Ahmadinejad has lambasted critics of his nuclear policy as " traitors . "
" People are beginning to realize he is really messing up the economy , " says the analyst .
" But the only people [ who see it ] are the urban middle and educated classes .
Those people do not have the votes or the will to challenge him . "
' In the heart of the people '
On the hustings in Birjand , national TV shows Ahmadinejad being driven in a modest car early one morning to a poor sector .
Standing in the street , people reach out to shake the president 's hand and share their problems .
He responds by placing his arms on their shoulders .
Another scene shows him in a poor family 's house , sitting with a mother as she grieves for two sons martyred in the Iran - Iraq War of the 1980s .
The president 's body language is pitch - perfect .
He sits with head down , hands clasped respectfully in his lap as the woman tells the former Revolutionary Guards officer : " I 'm sure you remember the Imposed War .... "
More footage shows the minister cutting ribbons on finished projects and breaking ground on new ones .
Similar scenes are repeated every provincial visit .
" The amount of projects and development in the past two years is equal to the entire history of the province , " says Abolfazl Noferesti , the press chief for the South Khorasan governor , who was appointed by the president .
Long neglected by Tehran , this province spreads across the sprawling deserts and barren outcroppings of eastern Iran and was the first to be visited by the president in 2005 .
The projects launched then are now 20 to 90 percent complete and the governor 's office makes sure people know whom to applaud – especially with parliamentary elections due next March .
" People get very happy and thankful to the president and to God , when they see these projects being implemented , " says Mr. Noferesti .
" One of the reasons that Mr. Ahmadinejad is in the heart of the people is because whatever [ he ] promises , he follows it up until it is implemented .
We speculate [ that ] in the next elections the approval and development related to these trips will be reflected . "
Looking to Iran 's 2009 elections
Aides deny that a reelection campaign is under way .
But the men and women who crammed into the mosque for prayers – where most could only feel the brief electric presence of Ahmadinejad since he did not speak – were handed leaflets extolling the " Secrets of the Successful Ninth Cabinet . "
One black - shrouded woman , eager to see the president , sneaked through a door from the women 's section to the men's , before being dragged back by other women .
The campaign handout credited Ahmadinejad with " removing the depredation from the face of this desert province , " and used carefully cherry - picked national statistics that ranged from an explosion of cellphone usage to a boost in foreign investment .
It listed diplomatic " greatness " and national pride engendered by nuclear defiance .
There was also a photo of Mr. Khamenei and a message saying the supreme leader " thanks God " for a " pious president " and a working cabinet " the nation wants , the men whose sleeves are up and belted for service to the people . "
Among those presidential foot soldiers is Mehdi Kalhor , a senior media adviser pressed into agriculture duty .
In South Khorasan , he visited several farms , including an experimental irrigation project that makes clay tubes to seep moisture to crops – cutting to zero the typical 75 percent water loss from evaporation .
Ahmadinejad " went through this process of evaluating problems from village level , " says Mr. Kalhor .
" He ca n't go everywhere so he sends us to check [ on needs ] , and we report back to him . "
The president himself had visited the site two years ago , but no money had come .
" It was n't going anywhere .
It was stopped at the gates of bureaucracy , " says Kalhor of the project near Bideskan , 100 miles northwest of the provincial capital .
" I came back to Birjand and spoke to the president .
In 2 - 1/ 2 hours it was resolved ; before , it would take 20 years . "
Such intervention makes good politics , and Kalhor admits : " What 's happening in our country is not hidden from ourselves – we know who gets the vote and who does n't . "
But how real are these claims of the president 's men ?
During an unscripted visit to Bideskan to find out , the director was effusive .
" It was so fast – yesterday I was called by the governor 's office to collect the money , " says Mohsen Hedjazi .
The pilot project now churns out 15,000 dried clay tubes daily and it plans to increase staff from 70 to 1,200 within four months .
Did the president make his dreams come true ?
Mr. Hedjazi does not hesitate : " Yes . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Routine brain scans in a group of middle - aged people showed that 10 percent of them had suffered a stroke without knowing it , raising their risk for further strokes and memory loss , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

People with atrial fibrillation , the most common type of irregular heart beat in people over 65 , had more than twice the rate of these silent strokes , they said .
Silent cerebral infarctions or SCIs are brain injuries caused by a blood clot that interrupts blood flow to the brain .
“ The findings reinforce the need for early detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in midlife , ” Dr. Sudha Seshadri of Boston University School of Medicine and colleagues wrote in the journal Stroke .
“ This is especially true since SCIs have been associated with an increased risk of incident stroke and cognitive impairment , ” they wrote .
The researchers based their findings on routine magnetic resonance imaging or MRI scans from about 2,000 people with an average age of 62 .
They were the children of participants in the long - running Framingham study -- a study of the health and habits of nearly an entire town in Massachusetts .
People in this so - called Framingham Offspring Study had medical exams every four to eight years .
Brain scans of these people found that 10.7 percent had a stroke even though they showed no stroke symptoms .
Of these , 84 percent had only a single lesion in the brain .
RISK PROFILE
The researchers then looked back to their medical records to see if these people had a risk profile that might predict a stroke .
What they found was that atrial fibrillation more than doubled the risk of silent stroke .
In atrial fibrillation , the heart ’s two upper chambers do not pump effectively enough to empty properly , leaving blood to pool and raising the risk of blood clots .
Three percent to 5 percent of people over 65 have this problem .
The study could not determine whether treating atrial fibrillation would reduce the risk of silent stroke , the researchers said .
Other factors that increased the risk of silent stroke included high levels of blood homocysteine , a sulfur - containing amino acid found in the blood ; carotid artery disease ; high blood pressure and especially high systolic blood pressure -- the top number in the blood pressure reading .
About two - thirds of people over the age of 65 have high blood pressure , according to the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute .
High blood pressure has long been implicated as a risk factor for silent strokes .
“ Although previous studies have also reported a significant association of hypertension and tHcy ( total homocysteine ) , ours is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate a significant relationship between atrial fibrillation and SCI , ” the researchers wrote .
Warning signs of a stroke include changes in balance , slurred speech or a droopy face , weakness in one side , partial vision loss and severe headache , according to the American Stroke Association .
Stroke is the No. 3 cause of death in the United States , behind heart disease and cancer .
Neither Honest Nor Trustworthy : The 10 Worst Corporations of 2007 by Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman Abbott
Blackwater
BP
Chiquitta
Countrywide
ExxonMobil
Gen Re
Murray Energy
Purdue Pharma
SAIC The U.S. public holds Big Business in shockingly low regard .
A November 2007 Harris poll found that less than 15 percent of the population believes each of the following industries to be " generally honest and trustworthy : " tobacco companies ( 3 percent ) ; oil companies ( 3 percent ) ; managed care companies such as HMOs ( 5 percent ) ; health insurance companies ( 7 percent ) ; telephone companies ( 10 percent ) ; life insurance companies ( 10 percent ) ; online retailers ( 10 percent ) ; pharmaceutical and drug companies ( 11 percent ) ; car manufacturers ( 11 percent ) ; airlines ( 11 percent ) ; packaged food companies ( 12 percent ) ; electric and gas utilities ( 15 percent ) .
Only 32 percent of adults said they trusted the best - rated industry about which Harris surveyed , supermarkets .
These are remarkable numbers .
It is very hard to get this degree of agreement about anything .
By way of comparison , 79 percent of U.S. adults believe the earth revolves around the sun ; 18 percent say it is the other way around .
The Harris results are not an aberration .
The results have not varied considerably over the past five years - although overall trust levels have actually declined from the already very low threshold in 2003 .
The Harris results are also in line with an array of polling data showing deep concern about concentrated corporate power .
An amazing 84 percent told Harris in a poll earlier in 2007 that big companies have too much power in Washington .
By contrast , only 47 percent said that labor unions have too much power in Washington ( compared to 42 percent who said labor has too little power ) , and 18 percent said nonprofit organizations have too much power in Washington .
These results have proven durable .
At least 80 percent of the public has ranked big companies as having too much power in Washington since 1994 .
In 2000 , Business Week and Harris asked a broader question : Has business gained too much power over too many aspects of American life ?
Seventy - four percent agreed .
The November 2007 poll also asked about support for measures to control corporations .
These results are eye - opening as well , though perhaps not in the expected way .
Harris asked which industries " should be more regulated by government - for example for health , safety or environmental reasons - than they are now ? "
Only oil companies ( 53 percent ) , pharmaceutical companies ( 53 percent ) and health insurance companies ( 52 percent ) crossed the 50 percent threshold .
Even the tobacco industry managed to escape in the survey with only 41 percent favoring greater regulation .
The data trends significantly negative - against greater regulation - over the last five years .
Does this show that while people distrust Big Business , they equally distrust the government to constrain corporate power ?
No .
The U.S. skepticism to regulation is only skin deep .
When polls present specific regulatory proposals for consideration , U.S. public support is typically strong and often overwhelming - even when arguments against government action are presented .
For example : After hearing arguments for and against , 76 percent favor granting the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulatory authority over tobacco , with 22 percent opposed .
After hearing arguments for and against , 75 percent favor legislation that would significantly increase energy efficiency , including auto fuel efficiency standards , and the use of renewable energy .
Eighty - five percent favor country - of - origin labeling for meat , seafood , produce and grocery products , and three quarters favor a legislative mandate .
Seventy - one percent say it is important that drugs remain under close review by the FDA and drug companies after they have been placed on the market .
And , from a Harris finding a week after the poll showing skepticism about industry regulation in general , the polling agency found that those who think there is too little government regulation in the area of environmental protection outpaced those who think there is too much by a more than 2 - to - 1 margin ( 53 to 21 percent ) .
What the Harris findings on attitudes to regulation do show is that the business campaign against regulation as an abstract concept has been very successful .
It highlights the need for consumer , environmental , labor and other corporate accountability advocates to defend the concept of regulation , and to connect the rampant corporate abuses in society with the deregulation and non-regulatory failures of the last three decades .
There 's little doubt that the general public attitude toward regulation significantly affects the willingness of politicians - none too eager to offend business patrons in the first place - to take on corporate power .
With the 10 Worst Corporations of 2007 , we aim to show - again - that Big Business is out of control and to connect comparable abuses to the failure of government overseers , regulators and enforcers .
The task ahead is to reassert the supremacy of the people over corporations , and for democratic government to impose controls and limits on what corporations can and cannot do .
Presented alphabetically , here are the 10 Worst Corporations of 2007 : Abbott : Blackmailing Thailand Imagine you are the only pharmacist in an isolated town .
You impose massive mark - ups on the drugs you sell .
A customer needs a life - saving medication , but can't afford your high price .
So , the customer finds a pharmacy in a faraway town , which agrees to supply the medicine for a quarter of your price .
Then the customer comes back .
She needs several other medicines that you sell , and is willing to pay your standard profiteering price .
At least one of those medicines is not available at the other pharmacy , or anywhere else .
You refuse to sell the medicines , unless the customer agrees to stop buying the life - saving medicine from the other pharmacy .
If you engaged in this kind of behavior in the United States , you would be in violation of the U.S. pharmacist code of ethics , which commands that " a pharmacist promotes the good of every patient in a caring , compassionate and confidential manner . "
You would also be breaking the law in most , if not all , states .
Should the ethical and legal treatment be any more lenient if it's not a pharmacist refusing to serve an individual , but a pharmaceutical company - motivated solely by retaliatory animus - denying medicines to an entire country ?
Does n't denying medicines on a mass scale out of animus merit harsh punishment ?
Consider the case of Abbott Laboratories in Thailand .
In January 2007 , Thailand issued a compulsory license on an AIDS drug made by Abbott .
A compulsory license is a lawful authorization of generic competition for a product that remains on patent .
In Thailand 's case , the government issued a license that would enable its public health sector to buy generic versions of lopinavir / ritonavir , sold by Abbott under the brand - name Kaletra .
Kaletra is a very important second - line AIDS drug , used for patients who have developed resistance to first - line drugs .
One reason Kaletra is so important is that Abbott has endeavored to prevent other companies from combining ritonavir , which makes other AIDS drugs more effective , with products they control [ see " The 10 Worst Corporations of 2004 , " Multinational Monitor , December 2004 ] .
Thailand is a leader among developing countries in providing treatment to people living with HIV / AIDS .
Its treatment program started early and covers most people with HIV .
The natural progression of treatment is that people need to shift drugs over time , and an increasing number of Thais living with HIV now need Kaletra .
Abbott has a discount program for Kaletra for developing countries , but its discount price for middle - income countries like Thailand was $ 2,200 per person per year .
Thailand 's per capita income is under $ 3,000 , according to the World Bank .
In a detailed white paper explaining its decision , the Thai government estimated that 50,000
Thais will need second - line treatment in the near future .
The cost of providing lopinavir / ritonavir at Abbott 's price to this population would be more than the entire current budget for AIDS drugs , according to the government .
Within a year of the license , according to Thailand 's National Health Security Office , the government had managed to triple the number of people receiving lopinavir / ritonavir , to roughly 2,500 .
The white paper estimated the government would be able to shift 8,000 people onto lopinavir / ritonavir based on the immediate cost savings from buying generic .
That number will grow as generic costs fall over time .
Big Pharma viewed Thailand 's actions as a major threat .
Most worrisome to the industry was the example Thailand set .
" There could be 'a spreading epidemic of disrespect for IP [ intellectual property ] rights , ' " Billy Tauzin , head of PhRMA , the U.S. pharmaceutical industry trade association , said in May .
Although Thailand 's actions were consistent with its obligations under national and international law , Big Pharma was able to employ the U.S. government ( as well as the European Union ) to pressure Thailand .
In April 2007 , the U.S. Trade Representative designated Thailand a " priority watch " country , a designation indicating it to be a serious violator of U.S. patent and copyright interests , and triggering close scrutiny from U.S. trade officials [ see " Big Pharma and AIDS : Act II Patents and the Price of Second - Line Treatment , " Multinational Monitor , March / April 2007 ] .
Abbott executives also took matters into their own hands .
In March , the company withdrew applications to market seven new medicines in Thailand .
One of those medicines was the heat - stable formulation of lopinavir / ritonavir - meaning it does not require refrigeration , an important consideration in a tropical country like Thailand .
Public health advocates in Thailand and around the world reacted with outrage .
" What Abbott has done by withdrawing seven drugs from Thailand is using drugs as a bargaining chip , " says Jon Ungphakorn , the executive secretary of the AIDS Access Foundation in Thailand .
" This is unacceptable ; it is a moral outrage that Abbott is doing this .
It 's playing games , not only with the patients in Thailand , but with patients all over the world .
Abbott knows that what it 's doing is intimidating the whole developing world against using the same measures - legal measures - that Thailand has used to get access . "
Dr. Tido von Schoen - Angerer , director of Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders ' Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines , agreed .
" What Abbott is doing is trying to protect high drug prices by actively denying an entire population access to new medicines it produces , " Dr. von Schoen - Angerer said .
" This is as unprecedented as it is shocking .
We consider it unethical and utterly unacceptable . "
Abbott declined repeated requests from Multinational Monitor to comment on the dispute .
Campaigners in Thailand called for a boycott of Abbott .
In April , health advocates around the world held coordinated protests against the drug multinational .
Its hard - line approach notwithstanding , Abbott was not immune to the market pressure applied by Thailand .
In demonstrating how it could reduce prices for Kaletra by 75 percent , Thailand was laying out a road map for other middle - income countries .
In April , Abbott reduced its price for Kaletra for middle - income countries from $ 2,200 to $ 1,000 .
The pressure campaign on Abbott also had some effect .
In July , the company announced it would register its pediatric formulation for Kaletra in Thailand .
Otherwise , Abbott continues to maintain its new - drug boycott of Thailand .
Should denying medicines as a form of collective punishment be legal in a civilized world ?
Actually , it 's not so obvious that Abbott 's actions are legal .
In April , a coalition of Thai consumer and health organizations - the Foundation for Consumers , AIDS Access Foundation , the Thai Network of People Living with HIV / AIDS and the Thai NGO Coalition on AIDS - filed a complaint with the Thai Trade Competition Commission .
It called for the instigation of criminal prosecution against Abbott .
Sean Fynn , associate director of the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property at American University 's Washington College of Law , prepared a supporting memorandum for the health and consumer groups ' complaint .
Explains Flynn , " Abbott 's response to the compulsory license - withholding a new version of its Kaletra product from the Thai market - appears to directly contravene the Thai Competition
Act which prohibits ' suspending , reducing or restricting services , production , purchase , distribution , deliveries or importation without justifiable reasons . '
An unwillingness to comply with a legal and justifiable government order cannot be a ' justifiable reason ' for suspending the supply of life - saving medicines to Thai citizens . "
In December , however , the Thai Trade Competition Commission declined to pursue the complaint .
It argued that Abbott does not have sufficient market share - even though it has a monopoly on its patented medicines - to trigger the terms of the country 's competition law .
Blackwater : Deadly Cowboys in Iraq On September 16 , 2007 , Blackwater private military contractors escorting a State Department convoy in Iraq fired machine guns and grenade launchers at civilians at a busy intersection .
Seventeen civilians died .
The incident crystallized Iraqi fury at the unaccountable , cowboy - like actions of foreign military contractors ( the polite term for mercenaries ) .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki said the company should be ejected from Iraq .
The Iraqi Minister of Interior reportedly suspended the company 's right to operate outside of the Green Zone .
Blackwater said its personnel operated properly in the incident , but numerous reports and news accounts blamed the company 's contractors for the slaughter .
In the wake of the incident , attention in Washington suddenly focused on the legal Twilight Zone in which U.S. - employed private contractors operate - not subject to Iraqi law , U.S. military law or U.S. civilian law .
But , in the subsequent months , attention has died down .
Blackwater continues to operate in Iraq , with no more accountability than existed on September 15 .
The investigations that followed the September 16 massacre did establish two things beyond any doubt .
First , the September 16 incident was not exceptional .
It fit a pattern of outrageous conduct by Blackwater contractors .
Second , Blackwater was representative of a broader problem of reliance on private contractors .
Blackwater was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince , an ex-Navy Seal and scion of a prominent Michigan Republican family .
Its business is based almost entirely on servicing the U.S. government , though it has designs on providing military services to other countries .
Prince says that 90 percent of the company 's business is contracts with the U.S. government .
He testified before the House Oversight Committee in October that he could not - or would not - say how much the company earned .
He did testify that key contracts paid the company a 10 percent profit rate .
Blackwater obtained more than $ 1 billion in contracts from the U.S. government from 2001 to 2006 , rising from $ 736,000 in 2001 to more than half a billion dollars in 2006 .
Blackwater 's main contract is providing security to State Department operations in Iraq .
It has roughly 1,000 personnel in Iraq .
In October , the majority staff of the House Oversight Committee prepared a devastating report that concluded , " The Blackwater and State Department records reveal that Blackwater 's use of force in Iraq is frequent and extensive , resulting in significant casualties and property damage . "
Blackwater is legally and contractually bound to only engage in defensive uses of force to prevent " imminent and grave danger " to themselves or others .
In practice , however , the vast majority of Blackwater weapons discharges are preemptive , with Blackwater forces firing first at a vehicle or suspicious individual prior to receiving any fire .
The House Oversight Committee report found that from 2005 to 2007 , Blackwater personnel were involved in almost 200 incidents involving firearms discharge .
In 84 percent of cases , Blackwater personnel were the first to fire .
The Committee 's report showed that reckless activity by Blackwater mercenaries was common .
It described one case as follows : On November 28 , 2005 , a Blackwater motorcade traveling to and from the Ministry of Oil for official meetings collided with 18 different vehicles during the round trip journey ( six vehicles on the way to the ministry and 12 vehicles on the return trip ) .
The written statements taken from the team members after the incident were determined by Blackwater to be " invalid , inaccurate and , at best , dishonest reporting . "
According to a Blackwater contractor who was on the mission , the tactical commander of the mission " openly admitted giving clear direction to the primary driver to conduct these acts of random negligence for no apparent reason . "
The only apparent sanction resulting from this incident was the termination of two of the employees .
The State Department is supposed to exercise oversight of Blackwater , but the House Oversight Committee found the department had utterly failed in this duty .
" Even in cases involving the death of Iraqis , it appears that the State Department 's primary response was to ask Blackwater to make monetary payments to ' put the matter behind us , ' rather than to insist upon accountability or to investigate Blackwater personnel for potential criminal liability . "
The oversight committee 's report was issued just prior to a high - profile hearing in which Erik Prince defended the company .
" We have to provide that protective screen , " he testified .
" We only play defense , and our job is to get those reconstruction people that are trying to weave the fabric of Iraq back together , to get them away from that X , the place where the bad guys , the terrorists , have decided to kill them that day . "
Prince emphasized repeatedly that no individual protected by Blackwater had ever been killed or seriously injured .
He said the company had fired more than 100 personnel for violating company and State Department rules , but besides also fining them , could do no more to punish them for wrongful acts .
It was up to the Justice Department to prosecute them , he said .
Representative Danny Davis , D - Illinois , asked , " You do admit that Blackwater personnel have shot and killed innocent civilians , do n't you ? "
Prince replied , " No , sir .
I disagree with that .
I think there have been times when guys are using defensive force to protect themselves , to protect the package they are trying to get away from danger .
There could be ricochets .
There are traffic accidents .
Yes .
This is war .
You know since 2005 , we have conducted in excess of 16,000 missions in Iraq and 195 incidences with weapons discharged .
In that time , did a ricochet hurt or kill an innocent person ?
That is entirely possible .
Again , we do not have the luxury of staying behind to do that terrorist crime scene investigation to figure out what happened . "
Concluded Representative Henry Waxman , D - California , " We have never had anything of this magnitude before , where we have turned so much of our military activity over to private military - [ activity ] that used to be , for the most part , provided by the U.S. military itself . "
As Waxman noted , the October hearing showed that relying on Blackwater is incredibly expensive - more than $ 400,000 per contractor per year - and has undermined the U.S. military objective , by fostering animosity toward the United States .
It has also led to the deaths of untold numbers of Iraqis , terrorized the Iraqi civilian population , and added to the lawless atmosphere in Iraq in which violence is pervasive and ( Iraqi ) life is cheap .
BP : Taking the Public BP is a giant multinational oil company .
It spends a lot of money trying to get us to believe that it is something else : a decent , clean , conscientious corporation .
It is not .
It kills workers in Texas .
It pollutes Alaska .
It manipulates markets .
And it uses the tricks of the corporate criminal class to escape penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the harm it causes .
In October , BP cut a deal with the Justice Department to pay $ 373 million in fines and restitution related to a series of crimes and instances of wrongdoing : a felony violation of the Clean Air Act connected to a 2005 refinery explosion that killed 15 contract employees , a violation of the Clean Water Act related to major pipeline leaks in Alaska , and a conspiracy to manipulate the propane market .
The $ 50 million fine in connection with the Texas refinery explosion was the largest ever under the Clean Air Act , a source of pride at the Justice Department .
Not everyone was impressed .
" I note with curiosity that when an average citizen commits a felony it usually leads to a prison sentence , " says Representative John Dingell , D - Michigan , the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
" Yet , apparently , when a big oil company commits a felony that causes 15 deaths , it pays a criminal penalty equal to less than a day 's corporate profits .
Until the Department of Justice starts holding corporate executives accountable , I am not sure that there will be a meaningful shift in corporate culture . "
" It is troubling , " says Representative Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , " that many of the same BP executives who were responsible for the management failures that led to the criminal charges and settlements announced today are still employed by BP , and , in some cases , have been promoted to the highest levels of the company .
This does not reflect the kind of corporate culture change we would expect if the company 's leadership took to heart the consequences of its mismanagement . "
For BP , the October settlement put to rest a series of debacles that has beset the company over the last several years .
But it 's certainly not the end of the company 's mischief .
In February 2007 , the company announced that it had chosen the University of California ( UC ) at Berkeley , in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , to host the Energy Biosciences Institute ( EBI ) .
Funded with $ 500 million over 10 years , the agreement would double the amount of corporate funding for research on campus , and change the direction of biofuels research at UC Berkeley for years to come .
" In launching this visionary institute , BP is creating a new model for university - industry collaboration , " says Beth Burnside , UC Berkeley vice chancellor for research .
That 's one way to look at things .
Another is to characterize the BP - Berkeley deal as the farthest - reaching effort by a corporation in recent U.S. history to colonize a major university .
The agreement drew harsh criticism from much of the university community in part because the deal was hatched without input from professors , students and others in the university community .
In March 2007 , students opposing the deal demonstrated outside the Chancellor 's office on the Berkeley campus .
Two students were arrested for dumping molasses on the steps of a university building ( it looked like oil ) .
They had a lot to protest .
The Energy Biosciences Institute , dedicated to problems related to global energy production and primarily expected to research biofuels , is projected to encompass 24 laboratories on the three campuses , representing an unprecedented occupation of university space and cooptation of public resources by a corporation .
BP will actually construct a building on the UC Berkeley campus , where it will be able to conduct proprietary research , off limits to Berkeley personnel .
There may be no precedent for such absolute ceding of public university space to secret , for - profit industry research .
The deal will enable BP to expropriate a major public investment .
Various public institutions are kicking in tens of millions of dollars to the project .
Much more importantly , BP will be able to capitalize on the long - term public investment in UC - Berkeley and the other institutions , including the students and faculties who enjoy very significant public support .
BP gets to control whatever useful technologies emerge from its colonial project .
The terms of the Energy Biosciences Institute contract between BP and the public partners give BP the right to exclusively license and commercialize inventions developed in the Institute 's shared university / BP facilities , even inventions developed entirely by university scientists ( provided they are BP - funded ) .
The company will almost surely be able to cherry pick publicly funded inventions .
The deal also likely gives BP power to direct the research agenda at the Energy Biosciences Institute .
The deal specifies that BP representatives will serve in " high - level " positions on the Institute 's governing committees .
" BP researchers will be able to suck up the best of what Berkeley 's scientists have to offer , retreat behind locked , guarded doors and pursue their corporate agenda without giving anything back , " says John Simpson of the the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica , California .
" Academic research is based on an exchange of ideas and information .
This is a one - way street benefiting only BP . "
Chiquita : Payments to Paramilitaries
In March , Chiquita entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice , in which it admitted making illegal payments in Colombia to a right - wing militia designated as a terrorist organization by the United States .
Under terms of the deal , Chiquita agreed to pay $ 25 million in fines to the U.S. government .
The victims of that terrorist paramilitary have a simple question :
Why is Chiquita paying the U.S. government , but not them ?
The Justice Department 's announcement of the deal was damning enough .
" From sometime in 1997 through February 4 , 2004 , " explained the Justice Department 's release , " Chiquita paid money to the AUC [ the Spanish acronym for a paramilitary organization whose English name is United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ] in two regions of the Republic of Colombia where Chiquita had banana - producing operations : Urabá and Santa Marta .
Chiquita made these payments through its wholly - owned Colombian subsidiary known as ' Banadex . '
By 2003 , Banadex was Chiquita 's most profitable operation .
Chiquita , through Banadex , paid the AUC nearly every month .
In total , Chiquita made over 100 payments to the AUC amounting to over $ 1.7 million . "
The U.S. government designated the AUC as a foreign terrorist organization in September 2001 .
That designation - which made it a crime for U.S. persons or companies to make payments to the AUC - " was well - publicized in the American public media , " notes the Justice Department 's release .
" The AUC 's designation was even more widely reported in the public media in Colombia . "
Yet Chiquita 's payments continued - 50 payments totaling more than $ 800,000 followed .
In February 2003 , top Chiquita officers learned of the payments and consulted with outside counsel .
Chiquita 's outside lawyers unequivocally stated payments should stop .
The advice from numerous communications : " Must stop payments . "
" Bottom Line : CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT . "
" Advised NOT TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT through CONVIVIR . "
" General Rule : Cannot do indirectly what you cannot do directly . "
Concluded with : " CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT . "
" You voluntarily put yourself in this position .
Duress defense can wear out through repetition .
Buz [ business ] decision to stay in harm 's way .
Chiquita should leave Colombia . " " [ T ] he company should not continue to make the Santa Marta payments , given the AUC 's designation as a foreign terrorist organization [ . ] "
" [ T ] he company should not make the payment . "
But the company continued to make payments .
Two months later , Chiquita self - reported the payments to the Justice Department .
But even then payments continued - 20 more payments of more than $ 300,000 through June 2004 , at which time Chiquita sold its Colombian subsidiary .
Chiquita 's version of the story is that it had been in a horrible dilemma .
The then - leader of the AUC , Carlos Castaño , met with a senior executive of Banadex and threatened that he would harm Banadex personnel and property if the company did not pay protection money .
" The payments made by the company were always motivated by our good faith concern for the safety of our employees , " says Chiquita CEO Fernando Aguirre .
" Nevertheless , we recognized - and acted upon - our legal obligation to inform the Department of Justice of this admittedly difficult situation . "
The plea deal , he says , " is in the best interests of the company . "
Says company spokesperson Michael Mitchell , " Our payments were entirely motivated by safety concerns . "
" It was a difficult ethical dilemma , " he says .
" The Department of Justice admitted it was a difficult situation . "
A lawsuit filed in July 2007 by family members of Colombians killed by the AUC paints a less sympathetic view of Chiquita 's dilemma .
The family members are represented by the Washington , D.C. - based EarthRights International and other lawyers .
" The stability and social control provided by the AUC was to Chiquita 's benefit , " charges the suit , " in allowing exportation of bananas without interruption due to conflict .
The influence of the AUC in the leadership of the banana workers ' trade unions was also to Chiquita 's benefit , as it reduced labor strife .
The AUC also provided protection services to banana plantations dealing out reprisals against real or suspected thieves , as well as against social undesirables , suspected guerrilla sympathizers or supporters , and anyone who was suspected of opposing the AUC 's activities and social programs . "
The lawsuit also charges that Chiquita facilitated the illegal transfer of thousands of assault rifles to the AUC .
The family members filing the suit - all named as John or Jane Doe to protect them from retaliation - allege the AUC killed their relatives because they were active in labor organizing and advocating for marginalized groups .
The suit seeks to represent a class of all people harmed by the AUC's " campaign of military and social control " aiming to " exert total control over the land and inhabitants of the banana - growing region of Colombia . "
The family members ask that the class include " individuals who were the objects of acts constituting extrajudicial killing , forced disappearance , torture , cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , kidnapping , rape , forced displacement , crimes against humanity , or crimes against civilians constituting war crimes . "
Chiquita " categorically denies " the allegations in the lawsuit , according to company spokesperson Mitchell .
" We reiterate that Chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families . "
" The company , " he says , " was forced to make payments to both left - and right - wing paramilitary organizations to protect the lives of our employees at time when kidnappings and murders were frequent , and government authorities were unable to provide security and protection . "
In the 1990s , Mitchell says , the company 's workforce was put in grave danger by the escalation of violence in the region .
" Among hundreds of documented attacks by left - and right - wing illegal groups were the 1995 massacre of 28 innocent Chiquita employees who were ambushed and killed on a bus on their way to work , and the 1998 cold - blooded murder of two more of our workers on a farm while their colleagues were forced to watch . "
In this context , the company was " forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce .
It is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose . "
Countrywide : Subprime Kings
Many factors combined to create the current housing crisis in the United States .
Low interest rates after the 2001 stock market crash spurred the housing boom .
Housing prices skyrocketed above historic trendlines .
People were duped into thinking prices would rise forever , but it was inevitable that the housing bubble would burst , and houses would suddenly be worth a lot less .
With house prices falling , lots of people are now finding they owe more than their house is worth .
This problem is exacerbated by predatory loan arrangements that have left millions facing suddenly rising mortgage payments .
A lot of people and corporations deserve blame for this state of affairs .
Instead of warning consumers about the housing bubble - which would have gone a long way to counter the excessive price run-ups - then - Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan denied a bubble was occurring .
Wall Street firms created exotic investment instruments that made possible the purchase and trading of large numbers of mortgages .
This created conditions so that banks and initial lenders took less care in issuing mortgages - since they would n't be responsible for mortgages gone bad .
The Wall Street firms not only sold these instruments to duped investors , they took on major liabilities on their own - even though it was obvious the housing bubble would have to burst .
Rating agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor 's , which evaluated the riskiness of these new mortgage investment instruments , failed utterly .
The housing bubble meant mortgage investments were sure to lose money , but the ratings agencies gave them top ratings anyway .
Along with the " innovation " of the Wall Street firms , the ratings agencies helped maintain a market that dramatically exacerbated , and to a considerable degree may have created , the housing bubble .
Financial bubbles create an incentive for criminal and shady activity .
Just like the stock bubble of the late 1990s created the climate for Enron and dozens of other companies to cook their books , the housing bubble created incentives for predatory lenders to exploit consumers .
The predatory lenders offered low rates , at least at first .
Rates would rise later , but the lenders said that - because home prices were rising so fast and would continue to do so - borrowers could always refinance with a new loan .
The biggest of the predatory lenders was Countrywide , a mortgage lender acquired by Bank of America in January 2008 .
The company and its CEO , Angelo Mozilo , made a bundle , while setting up thousands and thousands of families for financial ruin .
" Over the past few years , " says Martin Eakes of the Center for Responsible Lending , " by steering millions of people into bad loans , Countrywide has been the largest rogue mortgage lender in the country .
According to Countrywide 's own data , more than 80 percent of its exotic adjustable - rate loans were made to borrowers that do not meet current banking standards .
Countrywide knew that these homeowners would not be able to make their monthly loan payments after dramatic payment increases became effective . "
The Center for Responsible Lending has compiled a dossier on Countrywide 's irresponsible practices , presented in a report , " Unfair and Unsafe . "
Its devastating report , based on customer complaints , lawsuits , regulatory actions , news accounts , government reports and company documents , shows how Countrywide engaged in rampant wrongdoing : o Predatory lending .
" Lawsuits filed around the country have accused Countrywide of preying on borrowers through a variety of unfair and fraudulent tactics that have siphoned equity out of their homes and pushed many into foreclosure , " notes " Unfair and Unsafe . "
" Borrowers and regulators have accused the company of : steering borrowers with good credit into higher - cost ' subprime ' loans ; gouging minority borrowers with discriminatory rates and fees ; working in cahoots with mortgage brokers who use bait - and - switch tactics to land borrowers into loans they can't afford ; targeting elderly and non-English - speaking borrowers for abusive loans ; and packing loans with inflated and unauthorized fees . "
In one lawsuit , Albert Zacholl , a 74 - year - old man living in Southern California , alleges that Countrywide and a pair of mortgage brokers " cold - called and aggressively baited " him .
They promised him $ 30,000 cash , a mortgage that would replace his previous mortgage ( which was leaving him owing more each month ) and a monthly payment that would not exceed $ 1,700 .
Zacholl told the brokers that his income consisted of a pension of $ 350 a month and Social Security payments of $ 958 , and that with help from his son , he could afford a mortgage up to $ 1,700 .
According to the lawsuit , the broker falsified his loan application by putting down an income of $ 7,000 a month , and then arranged for a high - interest mortgage that required him to pay more than $ 3,000 a month ( and failed to deliver the $ 30,000 cash payment ) .
The motivation for the scam , according to the lawsuit , was to collect $ 13,000 in fees .
In court papers , the Center for Responsible Lending reports , Countrywide responded that Zacholl " consented to the terms of the transaction " and that any problems were the result of his own " negligence and carelessness . "
Dangerous products .
Countrywide has been a leader in pushing unsound mortgage terms .
These include " exploding " subprime adjustable rate mortgages - with reasonable interest rates in the first year that jump in subsequent years , often by as much as 30 percent to 50 percent .

Conflicts of interest .
" Countrywide has created a corporate structure designed to allow its subsidiaries to work hand - in - hand in squeezing borrowers with excessive fees and penalties , " according to " Unfair and Unsafe . "
Countrywide affiliates handle appraisals , credit reports , flood certifications and other documentation for new loans ; provide " force - placing " insurance for borrowers whose homeowners insurance has lapsed ; and serve as a foreclosure trustee .
The interconnections enable Countrywide to charge high fees , and deny borrowers the benefit of third parties ' independent judgment and independent interests .

Broken promises on loan modifications .
The company has a history of failing to fully live up to its promises to help borrowers keep their homes by modifying onerous loans , according to " Unfair and Unsafe . "
The report cites a Fall 2007 Credit Suisse review that ranked Countrywide as one of the mortgage lenders least willing to adjust loan terms .
Countrywide says it is committed to working out fair arrangements to keep homeowners in their houses .
In December , it entered into an arrangement with the community group ACORN designed to help subprime borrowers .
" During the first 11 months of 2007 , Countrywide helped more than 69,000 customers retain their homes through solutions such as loan modifications , long - term repayment plans , special forbearance and other options , " says Steve Bailey , a Countrywide senior managing director of loan administration .
" Regardless of the reason for the payment difficulties , Countrywide wants to try to find reasonable solutions for our borrowers . "
Abusive loan servicing .
Borrowers claim that Countrywide has engaged in sloppy and fraudulent loan servicing that has produced unwarranted fees and foreclosures .
With the collapse of the housing market in 2007 , Countrywide 's fortunes turned , its mortgage - backed securities plummeted in value , and the company seemed on the edge of bankruptcy .
In January 2008 , Bank of America agreed to buy the company .
Do not weep for company co-founder and long - time CEO Angelo Mozilo , however .
Mozilo grabbed compensation worth $ 185 million from 2002 - 2006 , according to an analysis by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Between November 2006 and December 2007 , Mozilo sold $ 150 million in stock - effectively jumping from a sinking corporate ship for which he was supposedly at the helm , or at least on the captain 's deck .
" Particularly , the discrepancy between Mr. Mozilo's compensation and Countrywide 's performance is striking , " concludes the Oversight Committee analysis .
" In 2007 , Countrywide announced a $ 1.2 billion loss in the third quarter and an additional loss of $ 422 million in the fourth quarter . "
By the end of the year , the company 's stock fell 80 percent from its February peak .
" During the same period , Mr. Mozilo was paid $ 1.9 million in salary , received $ 20 million in stock awards contingent upon performance , and sold $ 121 million in stock . "
Mozilo retired as CEO in 2006 , remaining as company chair and an employee .
The House Oversight Committee analysis shows that his compensation contract , taking effect in 2007 , was outrageous , and based in part on recommendations from a compensation consultant loyal to Mozilo rather than Countrywide .
Even so , Mozilo was bitter that the company did not give him everything he wanted .
In an e-mail message turned up by the Oversight Committee , Mozilo wrote to the compensation consultant : " I appreciate your input but at this stage in my life at Countrywide this process is no longer about money but more about respect and acknowledgement of my accomplishments .
...
Boards have been placed under enormous pressure by the left wing anti business press and the envious leaders of unions and other so called ' CEO Comp Watchers ' and therefore Boards are being forced to protect themselves irrespective of the potential negative long term impact on public companies .
I strongly believe that a decade from now there will be a recognition that entrepreneurship has been driven out of the public sector resulting in underperforming companies and a willingness on the part of Boards to pay for performance . "
With attention focused on the discrepancy between Mozilo 's compensation package and Countrywide 's well - being , he waived various payments - totaling $ 37.5 million - he could have received once Bank of America finalizes its takeover .
In March 2008 , Mozilo appeared before the House Oversight Committee to explain his compensation .
" Countrywide 's board , " he testified , " has aligned the interests of our top executives , including me , with shareholders by making our compensation primarily performance - based - namely , tied to earnings per share and share price appreciation .
Since 1982 through early 2007 , Countrywide 's stock appreciated over 23,000 percent , reaching a peak market value of over $ 25 billion from a starting value of zero .
As a result , over recent years , I have received substantial income from bonuses under a formula that was approved by our shareholders on at least two occasions . "
He also received substantial stock options , explaining , these were " options that required the price of the stock to rise above the option price before any income could be realized , thereby aligning me squarely with our shareholders . "
In anticipation of his retirement , he testified , he put in place a plan to cash in some stock options earned in earlier years .
His sales were thus planned in advance of Countrywide 's downturn .
But he continues to hold substantial shares in Countrywide - shares worth much less than before the company 's stock collapsed .
Mozilo testified that he is " very proud of the home ownership opportunities that Countrywide has provided for over 20 million families , " while acknowledging the hardship faced by homeowners and Countrywide employees and shareholders .
" In my 55 years in the industry , " he said , " this by far is the worst housing crisis I have ever seen , combined with an unprecedented collapse of the credit and liquidity markets . "
" The problem we face , " he said , " is the deterioration of the value of homes .
As values were going up , we had no problem .
We had no delinquencies and no foreclosures , because people had options , because people run into three things in their lives generally - loss of job , loss of marriage , loss of health .
When that happens and they own a home , and it impacts their income , they generally have a way out - sell the house , refinance , do something .
" That equity that they have in their homes has been virtually wiped out .
And that 's what 's exacerbating this whole foreclosure problem . "
Was n't that problem entirely foreseeable ?
Did n't Countrywide 's lending policies - which generously might be called aggressive - depend on constantly rising housing values in what was obviously a bubble market ?
ExxonMobil : Planetary Endangerment
It is no longer possible for even ExxonMobil to deny the reality of climate change .
Here is the current company line , as elaborated by CEO Rex Tillerson in a November 2007 speech : " Many more questions on this complex subject remain and require continued research .
But it has become increasingly clear that climate change poses risks to society and ecosystems that are serious enough to warrant action - by individuals , by businesses and by governments . "
Well , sure , lots of questions remain .
And action is certainly " warranted . "
But that understates things by several orders of magnitude .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a collaboration of hundreds of the world 's leading climate scientists that won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize , always presents its findings in the most cautious and restrained language .
The IPCC concludes in its Fourth Assessment report , issued in April 2007 : " Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level . "
Not only were 11 of the 12 years from 1995 to 2006 among the 12 warmest years recorded , the last 50 years in the Northern Hemisphere were probably the warmest in the last 1,300 years .
" Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [ greenhouse gas ] concentrations . "
The IPCC details a series of horrors likely to befall the planet to rival the 10 Plagues the Bible says were visited upon Egypt .
Projections include :
By 2020 , between 75 and 250 million people in Africa are projected to be exposed to increased water stress .
By 2020 , in some countries , yields from rain - fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent .
Agricultural production throughout Africa is projected to be severely compromised .
Sea level rise will affect heavily populated coastal areas in Africa by the end of the century , imposing costs on affected countries of at least 5 percent to 10 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
African desertification will increase by 5 percent to 8 percent by 2080 .
Freshwater availability throughout Asia will be a serious problem by the 2050s .
Flooding in heavily populated Asian coastal areas will intensify ( posing risks to lives and imposing massive economic costs ) .
New patterns of flood and drought will lead to more infant and child deaths from diarrhea in Asia .
By 2020 , significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in Australia 's Great Barrier Reef .
By 2050 , ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia and New Zealand are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding .
Mountainous areas in Europe will face glacier retreat , reduced snow cover and winter tourism , and extensive species losses ( in some areas up to 60 percent under high emissions scenarios by 2080 ) .
By mid-century , increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia .
Semi-arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid - land vegetation .
Biodiversity will be lost everywhere .
Heatwaves will increase in number , intensity and duration in North America and Europe .
In a company statement , ExxonMobil responded to the April report from the IPCC , with its new line that " Because the risks to society and ecosystems could prove to be significant , ExxonMobil believes that it is prudent now to develop and implement global strategies that address the risks … "
But there was a caveat .
Here 's the end of that sentence : " keeping in mind the central importance of energy to the economies of the world . "
The company therefore favors " putting policies in place that start us on a path to reduce emissions , while understanding the context of managing carbon emissions among other important world priorities , such as economic development , poverty eradication and public health . "
It 's hard to find words to describe this posture .
If the world fails to mobilize the needed , increasingly urgent response to climate change - a disturbingly likely scenario - future generations will look back on this kind of talk , and the global warming denialism that Exxon so long funded , and know who to blame for the misery and suffering that could have been avoided .
If in fact addressing climate change would interfere with other important world priorities like poverty eradication and public health , perhaps there would be some moral hand - wringing about doing what must be done to prevent the worst climate change projections from being realized .
However , the very cautious IPCC report conveys in unmistakable terms that global warming will impose the greatest burdens on the world 's poorest countries .
Climate change will devastate agricultural production and rural societies in Africa .
New disease challenges will be worst in tropical countries .
Flooding will be most severe in developing countries .
Adapting to climate change will be expensive but ultimately affordable for rich countries ; it will drain poor countries ' economies , however .
You only need common sense to know that the rich will be better able to buy their way out of both the hardships and inconveniences imposed by climate change .
Many people concerned about global warming are seeking ways to pressure or incentivize ExxonMobil and the rest of Big Oil to change their business model .
The idea is for the companies to shift from providing oil and gas to becoming energy service corporations , as ready to deliver solar power as gasoline .
We 're not in that camp .
We think ExxonMobil and Big Oil will need to be displaced , and will be .
The most serious problem is that ExxonMobil , as the largest and most vociferous of the oil majors , exerts its political and economic power to distort policy debates and stop governments from taking proportionate action to address climate change .
We 're not upset that ExxonMobil refuses to invest its obscenely large profits - $ 39.5 billion in 2007 - in renewable energy research and development .
We place the company on the 10 Worst list because it continues to deploy its political power to stop the U.S. Congress from enacting a windfall profits tax , or ending tax and royalty subsidies for the oil industry , and directing the proceeds for renewable energy .
Gen Re : Case Closed .
Why ?
In 2006 , the Justice Department abruptly dropped a federal criminal probe into allegations of insurance fraud at Berkshire Hathaway 's General Reinsurance ( Gen Re ) unit .
Paul McNulty was the U.S. Attorney in Alexandria , Virginia at the time .
In March 2006 , McNulty went on to become the Deputy Attorney General .
He is currently a partner at Baker & McKenzie in Washington , D.C. McNulty did not return a call seeking comment for this article .
Did anyone pressure McNulty or his successor , Chuck Rosenberg , the current U.S. Attorney , to close down the investigation ?
The case was looked at by the Justice Department 's Inspector General , Glenn Fine .
Fine 's office will not comment on the current status , if any , of the investigation .
Fine was dragged in after evidence was presented to his office that federal officials may have incinerated more than 100 boxes of grand jury information in April 2007 , just days after the Virginia Lawyer 's Weekly published an article titled , " Further Federal Indictments In Reciprocal Case Unlikely . "
The driving forces behind the criminal investigation of Gen Re were Thomas Gober , a certified fraud examiner based in Glen Allen , Virginia - and David Maguire , the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Alexandria charged by McNulty with shepherding the case .
For 12 years of his 18 - year career , Gober has worked with federal investigators and prosecutors , ferreting out significant insurance and reinsurance fraud schemes .
Most recently , he worked closely with Maguire on the criminal prosecution of the top executives at Reciprocal of America ( ROA ) , a major Virginia insurance company that went belly up in January 2003 .
ROA provided malpractice insurance to lawyers , doctors and hospitals .
When the company went out of business , the policy holders were left without coverage - and victims of malpractice , in many cases , were left with no way to collect damages .
The collapse of ROA resulted in unpaid liabilities totaling $ 500 million .
The work of Maguire , Gober and a handful of FBI agents led to the February 2003 guilty pleas of former ROA president Kenneth Patterson and former ROA CFO Carolyn Hudgins .
The two pled guilty to manipulating ROA 's books .
By cooking the books , the ROA executives concealed from regulators the company 's financial weakness .
Their failure to maintain sufficient reserves paved the way for the company 's collapse .
In Richmond , Virginia , Judge James Spencer sentenced Patterson to 12 years in prison and Hudgins to five years in prison .
Also caught up in the ROA case was the giant Gen Re company - a unit of the Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire Hathaway .
Gen
Re is a reinsurer , a company which effectively provides insurance to insurers Between 2004 and 2007 , McNulty , Maguire and their team of a half dozen FBI agents , Assistant U.S. Attorneys and forensic auditors began to build their case against Gen Re .
They believed they had accumulated evidence that Gen Re had entered into sham transactions with ROA .
The Justice Department lawyers believed these deals helped ROA hide its losses from regulators .
Gober says that McNulty " repeatedly championed the ROA case and all of our diligent work , " until McNulty left in March 2006 to become the Deputy Attorney General at Main Justice .
The prosecution team believed that the evidence against Gen Re was overwhelming .
Maguire , Gober and FBI agent David Hulser drafted a more than 60 - page indictment against top Gen Re executives .
At the same time , lawyers for the giant reinsurer were pressuring the government to drop the case or settle it as part of an overall global settlement with other matters the government was looking at involving Gen Re .
When McNulty left for Main Justice in March 2006 , he was replaced by Chuck Rosenberg .
Soon thereafter , the case was derailed .
In March 2007 , in an effort to salvage years of work on the case , Gober wrote a seven - page letter to Judge Spencer - the judge who had sentenced ROA executives Patterson and Hudgins to long jail terms - chronologically laying out the derailment and pleading for advice .
" First , David Maguire was totally removed from working the case , " Gober wrote .
" Dave called me into his office and apologized about leaving the case , telling me that Main Justice had told him he was being removed due to ' health concerns , ' " Gober wrote .
" Dave had lost about 10 pounds while working on the ROA matter ... something I did not consider very troubling ( or even unusual ) because this has been a very large and very complex case .
Dave is a brilliant prosecutor and he knows all of the facts of the ROA case ; indeed , he can literally recite them from memory . "
Maguire was replaced by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Gill , another Texas import .
In his letter to Judge Spencer , Gober says that in the very first " team meeting " after Maguire 's removal , Gill announced to the team of FBI agents and prosecutors that he was " glad we are all in agreement that this case is all about [ name redacted ] and that Gen Re is no longer a target . "
" To say the least , the team was a bit shocked about this ' announcement ' concerning ' how we all felt . ' "
Gober wrote .
Gill said he wanted to focus on an in - house ROA lawyer " who essentially had made many of the day - to - day reinsurance decisions that had impacted ROA and resulted in its eventual collapse . "
But the " team " also wanted to focus on Gen Re and top Gen Re executives because they believed , as Gober put it , that " the Gen Re issues were significant and far - reaching . "
" We discovered a fraud scheme which included , but was not limited to , the execution of ' side letter agreements ' between the reinsurer and ROA which resulted in a misleading balance sheet impression for the insurance regulators , " Gober wrote .
" In effect , we found that Gen Re was permitting the insurer to ' rent ' reinsurance certification but there was no true shifting back of risk . "
" Because Gen Re is owned by the parent company of Berkshire Hathaway , and the two richest men in the world ( Warren Buffett and Bill Gates ) serve on the Berkshire Hathaway Board of Directors , I became quite concerned when the case against Gen Re was allowed to ' go away , ' " Gober wrote .
" Why , I wondered , was this happening when the entire team - prior to Mr. McNulty 's elevation at the Justice Department - had been so absolutely sure we had a ' slam dunk ' case ?
Nevertheless , I decided to make the best of a bad situation .
If Gen Re was going to be let go , that was a decision over my head .
At least , I thought , the case was going to be forcefully and professionally pursued " against the ROA lawyer .
Because the prosecutorial team felt that the case against the ROA lawyer was so strong , they prepared a prosecution memo outlining their case .
That memo was submitted to Gill in February 2007 .
But the team heard nothing from Gill .
All Gill would say to Gober was that he just " felt " there was not a strong enough case against the lawyer .
Gober was so upset with the decision not to proceed against Gen Re and the ROA lawyer that he wrote a letter to McNulty outlining his concerns .
McNulty never responded to the letter .
" What has happened to this case ? " Gober rhetorically asked Judge Spencer .
" The facts are the same ( or better ) as they were when Paul McNulty left to become the # 2 man in the Justice Department .
The only thing that is ' different ' is that two fellows from Texas have been brought in and they do not seem to want to do anything with this matter but let it die .
I am very troubled that everyone on our team , and we are talking about seasoned professionals , concluded this was ( and remains ) a very important case that needs to go forward .
Yet , somehow , the U.S. Attorney goes to D.C. and the new guy comes in and the case is over , for all intents and purposes .
Something is just wrong about all of this . "
Gober is concerned not just because a criminal prosecution of a powerful U.S. corporation has been derailed .
He 's concerned not just because the case involved the largest single insurance collapse in the history of Virginia that cost $ 500 million and has left more than 80,000 policyholders with an insolvent and liquidated insurer .
Gober is concerned also because the case " has exposed a serious problem in the reinsurance industry which is going to have to be addressed and corrected , " he wrote to Judge Spencer .
" Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake , and very powerful people are interested in this matter simply dying , " he wrote .
" I am not one of them .
Nothing would be worse than to see a case like this one pushed ' under the radar ' by greedy people who simply want more and more money through fraud .
Based on what has been going on lately at the Justice Department , I am very worried about how all of this has happened and what should be done to correct it . "
Judge Spencer , through his clerk , suggested that Gober directly and personally approach Glenn Fine , the Inspector General .
On April 2 , 2007 , the Virginia Lawyer 's Weekly wrote the first article outlining Gober 's account .
( A few months later , in July 2007 , the McClatchy Newspapers ran a more detailed article titled " Justice Department Drops Massive Accounting Fraud Case , " by Marisa Taylor . )
On April 3 , the day after the Virginia Lawyer 's Weekly article hit the stands , Gober wrote a frantic e-mail to Fine 's office warning that the FBI was planning on incinerating crucial evidence in the case .
" I know from working past FBI cases that documents are stored for years , " Gober wrote to the Office of Inspector General 's ( OIG ) Keith Bonanno .
" The agents must not know of your inquiry . "
On April 5 , Gober wrote again to Bonanno .
" Yesterday , all documents were hauled off from our site office to the FBI incinerator , " Gober wrote .
" My hard drive which held all of the case data was taken as well .
It is my hard drive and it was to be ' wiped clean ' before its return to me .
I pushed for them to back it up before wiping clean or all case data would be gone .
Please request that the data be copied before my drive is re-formatted .
Otherwise , the investigation may be for naught .
Two independent sources told me that the agents were going to incinerate them to ' get ahead of the ball ' and ' not let this drag on forever . ' "
OIG 's Bonanno responded later that day .
" Our office contacted the USAO [ U.S. Attorney Office ] in Richmond and instructed that they ( and / or the FBI ) cease destruction of documents related to the case since there is a pending OIG / OPR review , " Bonanno wrote .
Before the whip came down , the government was in pretty serious negotiations with Gen Re to settle the ROA case amicably .
Joshua Hochberg was at the time head of the Justice Department 's Fraud Section .
Hochberg is currently a partner at McKenna Long & Aldridge in Washington , D.C. Hochberg did not return a call seeking comment for this article .
In May 2005 , Hochberg wrote to Maguire about the settlement of the Gen Re case .
" The bottom line has always been - what do we want to do with Gen Re . " Hochberg wrote .
" The options range from indicting the company , to a plea by a subsidiary to a deferred prosecution or a non-pros [ non- prosecution ] agreement with lots of favorable terms for the government , including large $ , monitors , cooperation .
…
Indicting the company would have enormous collateral consequences .
As you know , when we met with Gen Re 's counsel , we made no promises about any final resolution . "
Thomas Hanusik was at the time assistant chief of the Fraud Section .
He 's now a partner at Crowell & Moring .
Hanusik said he would have no comment on this story .
On July 20 , 2005 , Hanusik wrote to Maguire to detail negotiations he had with Ron Olson , a partner at Munger Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles .
Olson is an attorney for Gen Re and a member of the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors .
Olson could not be reached for comment .
But he told McClatchy 's Marisa Taylor that " there was no knowledge at Gen Re that people at Reciprocal of America were hiding information from regulators or auditors . "
He said the Gen Re had entered into " side deals " with ROA , and that these were the industry norm .
The company has since banned such arrangements as bad business practice , he told Taylor .
He described the criminal case as " maybe the longest investigation I remember being associated with .
We were extremely frustrated . "
Maguire responded to Hanusik 's July 2005 note the next day .
" I think we need a strong united front on Gen Re 's culpability on ROA in order to get them to fess up and pay a share of the $ 450 million ROA loss commensurate with their conduct , " he wrote .
" From the mid-1980s until approximately 2001 , ROA grew from a small , marginally capitalized Virginia reciprocal insurer of approximately 100 hospitals and a few hundred doctors and lawyers into four commonly managed reciprocal insurers of more than 80,000 insureds in many different states across the country , " Maguire wrote .
" This phenomenal growth , however , could not have happened without the world believing that ROA was fully and truly reinsured by Gen Re and the receipt of consistently high ratings from A.M. Best ( A Ratings from 1983 to 2001 ) , a national respected ratings service of insurance companies , which also believed ROA was truly backed by Gen Re . "
" Unfortunately , for more than 18 years , material facts about the true nature of ROA 's reinsurance relationship with Gen Re were falsely represented and concealed from Best , the insurance commissioners , state legal and medical societies and hospital associations that endorsed ROA to its members , and the insureds themselves .
Indeed , the losses that drove ROA into insolvency were the very losses that were supposedly covered by reinsurance contracts with Gen Re , " Maguire wrote .
" The dark little secret we have uncovered is that when Gen Re has to pay larger that [ sic ] expected losses , it uses it [ sic ] might to dump the losses back on the reinsured . "
The Gen Re investigation ultimately did not come out entirely to the company 's liking - and company executives have not escaped accountability , at least as relates to other matters .
The ROA case led federal prosecutors to investigate a similar alleged arrangement between Gen Re and the insurer AIG .
A federal jury would later find four top Gen Re executives and an AIG executive guilty of conspiracy and securities fraud , in a scheme also allegedly involving sham transactions , these intended to make AIG 's finances appear stronger than they actually were .
Murray Energy : Collapse of Decency Mining disasters can transfix a nation .
Miners trapped underground , and the uncertainty of whether they survived a collapse , evokes empathy for the miners , their families and their community in even the hardest of hearts .
Not many people have experience deep underground , but until the fate of the involved miners is established , the drama and suspense feels very personal to the millions waiting for updates , desperately hoping for good news and fearing the worst .
In the United States , the millions following the rescue typically watch the disasters play out according to a familiar script .
Families , miners and mine operators are stricken with fear , supportive of each other , and articulate about the raw emotional urgency of rescue operations .
In August 2007 , a major calamity struck the Crandall Canyon coal mine in Utah .
Six miners were killed in the mine collapse .
Ten days later , two rescue workers and a mine inspector were killed trying to reach the six trapped men .
The second set of fatalities marked Crandall Canyon as particularly tragic .
There was something else unusual about the Crandall Canyon disaster .
With the nation watching , the mining company did not display the usual humility .
Rather than relying on PR professionals , Robert Murray , CEO of Murray Energy , the operator of Crandall Canyon , stepped into the spotlight .
A day after the mine collapse , he began a nationally televised new conference by proudly relating how he had built up the company , and fulminated against climate change legislation .
" Without coal to manufacture our electricity , " he exclaimed , " our products will not compete in the global marketplace against foreign countries , because our manufacturers depend on coal , low - cost electricity , and people on fixed incomes will not be able to pay their electric bills .
And every one of these global warming bills that has been introduced in Congress today to eliminate the coal industry will increase your electric rates four - to five - fold . "
He went on to insist , against all evidence at the time - and the very detailed evidence now available - that the disaster was caused by an earthquake .
He concluded his lengthy remarks by denouncing former mine industry regulators and the leaders of the United Mine Workers of America , as well as reporters from the Associated Press and Fox News .
Referring to the experts and the union , he said , " These individuals have given very false statements to the media and to America , for their own motives .
They know nothing about the natural disaster that occurred here .
They know nothing about the damage in the mine and the circumstances surrounding the trapped miners , or the rescue efforts that are under way .
And I caution the media to very much question the veracity of these sources and their motivations . "
Murray maintained the same tone in subsequent interviews , belligerently denying that he knew of previous cave - ins in the same mine , or that the trapped miners were engaging in a particularly dangerous operation known as " retreat mining . "
The Ohio - based Murray Energy and its affiliates mine more than 20 million tons of coal annually , according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
From 2004 through the end of 2007 , a Multinational Monitor analysis found , the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) cited companies controlled by Murray for safety violations more than 7,500 times .
That astounding fact says quite a bit about the culture at Murray Energy .
But nothing can match the chilling report issued in March 2008 by Senator Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , chair of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee .
The report shows a callous and utter indifference to miners ' lives and well - being .
There were countless opportunities to recognize the dangers posed by Murray Energy 's perilous plans for Crandall Canyon , but Murray Energy ignored , discounted or suppressed the warning signs , and feckless regulators let the company proceed .
Summarizes Kennedy , " The Committee 's investigation has revealed that the owner of Crandall Canyon mine , Murray Energy , disregarded dangerous conditions at the mine , failed to tell federal regulators about these dangers , conducted unauthorized mining and - as a result - exposed its miners to serious risks . "
The report explains that " the mining operations proposed by Murray Energy , and approved by MSHA , at Crandall Canyon were among the most dangerous ever attempted . "
Murray Energy was undertaking retreat mining or pillar extraction - pulling out the mine 's supporting pillars , in the opposite direction from which the mine advanced .
Often the plan is designed to provided for controlled roof collapse .
The retreat mining at Crandall Canyon was the deepest MSHA had ever authorized .
The deeper the mine , the greater the stress on supporting pillars , and the more dangerous it is to remove them .
Murray Energy took over Crandall Canyon mine from a previous operator , Andalex , in August 2006 .
It immediately began to pressure MSHA to lessen safety inspections , according to the Kennedy report .
A few weeks after Murray Energy began operating Crandall Canyon , an MSHA official e-mailed a colleague , " [ Murray Energy ] also told my supervisor they have been very successful at getting MSHA people removed in other districts .
I expected we would have trouble with this operator , but did n't expect it on the 2nd day after they took over [ the mine ] . "
Six weeks later , another MSHA official wrote to the administrator of MSHA 's Office of Coal Mine Safety and Health , " Over the course of the first 10 days of Murray Energy ownership they have aggressively opposed enforcement actions taken by [ MSHA ]
Inspectors Durrant and Shumway , accused them both of retaliation , met with Supervisor Farmer and attempted to dictate how inspections should be performed at the mines .
All indications so far are that this operator intends to use whatever means available to try to leverage enforcement at their mines . "
By August 2007 , if not earlier , internal company documents show , Murray Energy had adopted a policy of contesting all MSHA safety violations , regardless of the merits .
The Kennedy report shows that Murray Energy 's pressure tactics worked , and the agency lightened up on enforcement activities .
Internal company memos relate MSHA commitments to " pul[l ] back enforcement . "
The August tragedy at Crandall Canyon could have been avoided if the retreat mining had never been undertaken .
Andalex , the previous operator of the mine , had concluded that retreat mining could not be conducted safely in the area where the mine collapse occurred .
The company even argued against the retreat mining encouraged by the Utah state department overseeing mine leases , which earns royalties from the sale of extracted coal .
Murray Energy had an entirely different approach .
The company presented a plan based on a technical analysis of retreat mining safety at Crandall Canyon performed by a consultant , Agapito .
In a review conducted after the disaster , the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health found Agapito 's work to be deeply flawed .
Under federal law , MSHA must review and approve plans for underground coal mining .
The Kennedy report concludes that " the record shows that MSHA 's review of the company 's mine plan was often rushed , superficial and pro forma .
Indeed , mining expert and former MSHA engineer Robert Ferriter described MSHA 's review of Crandall Canyon 's mine plan as a ' broken system . ' "
The MSHA engineer initially reviewing Murray Energy 's plans urged rejecting the proposal .
A supervisor told the engineer that his analysis was flawed .
Rather than conducting a new one , according the Kennedy report , the supervisor " seems to have simply accepted the company 's rebuttal of Del Duca 's analysis at face value , " authorizing the plan to go forward .
Even after the plan was approved , however , the Kennedy report shows , " there were multiple warning signs during mining operations - including heightened seismic activity and a major mine bounce [ a bounce is a mine collapse in which the pressure on pillars leads them literally to explode outward ] - that should have raised red flags for both MSHA and the mine operator .
The company ignored these signs of danger and did not tell MSHA about them , as the company promised it would do . "
In February 2007 , Murray Energy began retreat mining in a northern section of the mine .
Internal company records show 17 separate reports of roof falls , cave - ins and bounces .
An internal memo to Robert Murray identified these problems , beside which Murray wrote " noted . "
Only one of the 17 incidents listed in internal company records was reported in the official logs Murray Energy is required to maintain by law , according to the Kennedy report .
On March 11 , the northern section where the retreat mining was being conducted - 900 feet away from the southern section that would be the site of the August tragedy - collapsed .
Because the collapse occurred at night , when no miners were nearby , no one was hurt .
" The multiple warning signs that preceded the March bounce and the force of the collapse itself should have alerted MSHA and the company to fundamental flaws in the barrier pillar retreat mining plans , " asserts the Kennedy report .
" MSHA and Murray Energy knew that the depth of cover and other geological characteristics of the South barrier pillar were extremely similar to the North , yet they allowed retreat mining to go forward in the South . "
Internal company documents make clear that Robert Murray had been notified of the March collapse .
This directly conflicts his claim in the wake of the August disaster that he did not know about similar , earlier problems .
Murray Energy also failed to formally report and investigate the March collapse , likely in violation of federal law , according to the Kennedy report .
The report notes , " A possible - and inexcusable - reason for this reporting failure was a tacit agreement between Murray Energy and MSHA to excuse the company from the Mine Act 's reporting requirements . "
On July 17 , the company began retreat mining in the southern section of the mine .
Problems , including bumps and bounces , quickly became apparent and were reported to Robert Murray ( who marked " good " on an internal memo saying progress was being made though significant warning signs were evident ) .
Only one of the bumps and bounces was noted in mine pre-shift reports .
The memo to Murray , which he marked , makes clear that - his subsequent claims notwithstanding - he did know that retreat mining had been underway in the southern section of the mine .
Although the company had badgered and perhaps misled MSHA into authorizing an unreasonably dangerous retreat plan , it is possible it was deviating even from the approved plan , the Kennedy report concludes .
" It is impossible to know to a certainty what happened in the moments before the August 6th collapse , " the report states .
" However , the investigation has uncovered evidence indicating that , at the time of collapse , the company was conducting unauthorized mining . "
There is evidence that the company was both conducting unauthorized mining of floor coal , and extracting coal from a barrier pillar MSHA had specifically prohibited mining .
Murray Energy flatly denies , without elaboration , the findings of the Kennedy report .
Its subsidiary UtahAmerican Energy issued an official statement , but refused to comment further .
" We are shocked and outraged that the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pension ( HELP ) Committee , after conducting a superficial review of only some of the facts , would level such serious and biased allegations .
This report is politically motivated , irresponsible and unjustifiable , " Michael O. McKown , general counsel of UtahAmerican Energy , said in the statement .
" This matter merits considered and non-political judgements . "
" This sensational and irresponsible report makes slanderous allegations against innocent individuals , " McKown said .
" We are confident that , with a full review of the facts , this will be established .
It is clear that the Senate HELP Committee report is precipitous and wrong .
It is obviously political grandstanding to certain constituents of some of its members .
Given the complex technical nature of this matter , the incompleteness of the factual record and the lack of knowledge of the Committee , we consider the Senate HELP Committee 's report to be completely unreliable . "
" Mr. Robert E. Murray , UtahAmerican and our employees all mourn the loss of our miners and grieve for their families , " McKown said .
" Mr. Murray , our Company and our employees have always been totally committed to the safety of our employees .
Mr. Murray and the Company would never knowingly expose any employee to danger , and he has n't in his 50 years of experience .
For anyone to imply otherwise is blatantly false .
Once the facts are known , they will show that Mr. Murray deserves tremendous credit for his courage and leadership under very difficult conditions .
We are confident that the comprehensive review of the facts will render a far more accurate and unbiased accounting of what happened in this tragedy .
We will reserve further comment until such time as the facts can be clearly known . "
The Kennedy report concludes that enough is already known .
" Miners were exposed to unnecessary and extreme risks , " the report states .
" The mine operator and MSHA must be held accountable for their failures of diligence , care and oversight .
The Secretary of Labor should refer the case to the Department of Justice for prosecution . "
Purdue Pharma : White - Collar Drug Dealers
How does street crime work ?
You commit the crime , you do the time .
How does corporate crime work ?
Big Pharma corporation commits a crime and hires a high - paid white - collar crime defense lawyer .
Defense lawyer approaches prosecutor and says , " Let 's make a deal . "
You agree not to prosecute the company .
I 'll give you a shell company that does little business but has a similar name .
That company pleads guilty to the crime .
It no longer sells drugs and thus when Medicare lists the shell as a company with which Medicare will not do business , it loses nothing .
We turn over a couple of executives .
They plead guilty .
And you promise no jail time .
You can hold a press conference and say , " We cracked down on corporate crime . "
And we can get on with our business of making millions of dollars off average people addicted to our opiate of choice .
That 's pretty much what came down in 2007 when the Justice Department went after the maker of OxyContin , the addictive pain killer that addicts will die for .
OxyContin offers major benefits for cancer patients and others in chronic pain .
But it 's also an easy high for thousands of down and out Americans .
Crush the pill and snort it .
It 's like heroin - without the needles .
It 's big in Appalachia .
You do n't need to ship it in from overseas .
You can get it at your local doctor 's office or pharmacy .
Talk to family doctors working in hill country and one of the first issues they raise is Oxy addiction .
Abuse is so rampant that some hill doctors have stopped prescribing it .
No more break - ins and harassing phone calls from addicts claiming back pain .
In 2007 , John Brownlee , the U.S. Attorney in Roanoke , Virginia , charged that " Purdue , under the leadership of its top executives , continued to push a fraudulent marketing campaign that promoted OxyContin as less addictive , less subject to abuse and less likely to cause withdrawal . "
" In the process , " said Brownlee , " scores died as a result of OxyContin abuse and an even greater number of people became addicted to OxyContin ; a drug that Purdue led many to believe was safer , less abusable and less addictive than other pain medications on the market . "
Brownlee charged that Purdue officials drafted an article published in a medical journal claiming that OxyContin had less euphoric effect and less abuse potential than short - acting opioids .
The company then had its sales representatives distribute the article to healthcare providers .
Said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Peter D. Keisler , Purdue " misled physicians about the addiction and withdrawal issues involved with OxyContin . "
Brownlee tried to pin the blame where it rightly belongs - on the company and executives who pushed the drug on an unsuspecting public with claims that it was less addictive than other painkillers .
Emphasis on the word " tried . "
If you read the papers , you might now believe that Purdue Pharma , the Stamford , Connecticut - based maker of OxyContin , pled guilty to illegally touting OxyContin .
You might believe , as the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers reported , " Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to one felony count of fraudulently misbranding a drug . "
One problem .
Purdue Pharma did not plead guilty to this crime .
It was Purdue Frederick that pled guilty .
Why is this distinction important ?
Under federal law , pharmaceutical companies convicted of a felony are automatically excluded from federal insurance programs like Medicare .
The idea behind mandatory exclusions is clean government - if a party commits a serious crime , the federal government should n't do business with it .
Unless you are a giant corporation with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits at stake .
Then you get a deal .
In this case , the deal was brokered by Howard Shapiro , a partner at WilmerHale in Washington , D.C. - the lawyer for Purdue Pharma .
Shapiro did not return calls seeking comment for this story .
Shapiro offered up Purdue Frederick to plead guilty .
What is Purdue Frederick ?
We sent an e-mail off to company spokesperson James Heims .
We asked , " What is the difference between Purdue Frederick and Purdue Pharma ? "
He wrote back immediately .
" They are independent , associated companies .
Please let me know if you have further questions . "
Well , yes , we do have further questions .
Why did Purdue Frederick plead guilty and not Purdue Pharma ?
No answer .
We call Mr. Heims .
Now he 's busy .
No response .
So , we turn to the press packet sent out by Heidi Coy , the public affairs representative for U.S. Attorney Brownlee .
It 's 89 pages .
It contains Brownlee 's statement , the press release , the information , the agreed statement of facts , the plea agreements with Purdue Frederick , Michael Friedman , the president and CEO , Howard Udell , the company 's general counsel , and Paul Goldenheim , the company 's former medical director .
But it does n't contain the non-prosecution agreement .
And , not surprisingly , out of the hundreds of mainstream news outlets that carried this story , not one mentioned the non-prosecution agreement .
The non-prosecution agreement is the one that protects the companies that make the money .
Purdue Frederick takes the hit .
It 's the felon .
It is excluded from government programs .
But so what ?
We can assume it has little if any government business to lose .
( Brownlee says he does n't know .
The company wo n't return calls . )
The more than 200 other affiliated Purdue Pharma companies scattered around the world and listed in Appendix A of the non-prosecution agreement get off .
No felony charge .
No exclusion .
Business as usual .
Purdue is a privately held , very secretive company controlled by the Arthur Sackler family .
Arthur Sackler is the guy who , before he delivered OxyContin , brought to you the marketing for Librium and Valium .
Walk on the Mall in Washington and you walk by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur Sackler Gallery .
Purdue was very happy with the deal to resolve the OxyContin criminal charge .
In a statement , Purdue said , " Nearly six years and longer ago , some employees made , or told other employees to make , certain statements about OxyContin to some healthcare professionals that were inconsistent with the FDA - approved prescribing information for OxyContin and the express warnings it contained about risks associated with the medicine .
The statements also violated written company policies requiring adherence to the prescribing information . "
The company said that , since 2001 , it has cured these problems .
It also insisted that " any attempt to connect the agreed to plea of misbranding by Purdue with abuse and diversion of OxyContin is completely false . "
In his statement that he read before the cameras , U.S. Attorney Brownlee said that Purdue Frederick is the " manufacturer and distributor " of OxyContin .
Well , as it turns out , they used to be .
No longer .
Now , that 's Purdue Pharma .
In an interview , Brownlee admitted that Purdue Frederick was chosen to plead guilty because " we did n't want to ban the future sale of the drug . "
Had Purdue Pharma been forced to plead guilty , OxyContin would have been excluded from Medicare coverage , he said .
" And we did n't want that , " Brownlee said .
Actually , it 's the company that would have been excluded from Medicare .
It 's up to the government to decide what this means .
Could it have ordered Purdue to let other companies make OxyContin and sell it to Medicare ?
Yes , it could .
The other document that was not sent out in the press packet was the corporate integrity agreement .
This was the agreement that Purdue Pharma entered into and that requires the company to hire an independent monitor to make sure it does n't engage in future criminal activity .
Brownlee wo n't give the name of the independent monitor who has been appointed .
Why not ?
He wo n't say .
The bottom line is that Brownlee prosecuted a case that few other U.S. Attorneys would touch .
He proceeded against a powerful privately held and secretive pharmaceutical company with major resources at its disposal .
He secured a guilty plea against an entity and three top executives .
As part of the settlement , the company will pay over $ 600 million in fines , restitution and a civil settlement .
The three executives will pay collectively over $ 34.5 million in penalties .
But in the end , he pulled his punches .
Purdue Pharma was not charged .
The independent monitor 's name has not been made public .
And perhaps most importantly , the executives will not face jail time .
Why not ?
Brownlee dodges the question .
This irks Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen 's Health Research Group .
Wolfe calls the fines and guilty pleas " an important message to the drug industry that this kind of malicious , death - dealing behavior will not be tolerated . "
But the government could have come down much harder on what he calls " white - collar drug pushers . "
Wolfe points out that from 2000 through 2006 alone , according to data from Drug Topics , the news magazine for pharmacists , there have been $ 9.6 billion in retail U.S. sales of OxyContin .
It was one of 25 top - selling drugs from 2000 to 2005 - it was the 11th largest selling prescription drug in 2003 .
" The government should have forced the company to disgorge far more of its ill - gotten profits in this case , " Wolfe says .
" Hundreds of thousands of people are languishing in jail for relatively minor drug possession or distribution crimes involving illegal drugs or , in a smaller number of cases , prescription drugs such as OxyContin .
Why have the three wealthy Purdue executives , who have pleaded guilty to orchestrating this dangerous promotional campaign , escaped jail time , and why are they paying merely $ 34.5 million in penalties ?
The damage to the public from these white - collared drug pushers surely exceeds the collective damage done by traditional street drug pushers .
Why do we have such a double standard of justice ? "
SAIC : The Government - Contractor Complex
When investigative reporters Donald Barlett and James Steele were fired from Time magazine in May 2006 , the magazine cried poverty .
" They 're very good , but very expensive , and I could n't get anyone to take them on their budget , " said John Huey , editor in chief at Time .
Time magazine then turned around and paid $ 4 million for photographs of Brad Pitt and Angela Jolie 's baby .
" That $ 4 million would pay for about 10 more years of salary and expenses for Barlett and Steele and their research help , " said Steve Lovelady , of the Columbia Journalism Review , at the time .
Luckily , Brangolina central - Vanity Fair - picked up Barlett and Steele .
They came back with an exposé of SAIC - Science Applications International Corporation - the mega - giant defense and intelligence contractor that straddles the Potomac .
Through a spokesperson , SAIC told Multinational Monitor it would not comment on the Vanity Fair article .
Buried deep inside Vanity Fair 's 500 - page Hollywood issue , surrounded by anorexic male and female models pushing bras , perfume , jewelry and handbags - is a 10 - page profile of the permanent government on the Potomac .
Barlett and Steele open with a nod to Hollywood : " One of the great staples of the modern Washington movie is the dark and ruthless corporation whose power extends into every cranny around the globe , whose technological expertise is without peer , whose secrets are unfathomable , whose riches defy calculation , and whose network of allies , in and out of government , is held together by webs of money , ambition and fear .
…
" To be sure , there is n't really such a corporation : the Omnivore Group , as it might be called .
But if there were such a company - and , mind you , there is n't - it might look a lot like the largest government contractor you 've never heard of : a company known simply by the nondescript initials SAIC ( for Science Applications International Corporation ) , initials that are always spoken letter by letter rather than formed into a pronounceable acronym . "
In 2006 , SAIC raked in nearly $ 8 billion , almost all of it from the government .
The company holds more than 9,000 contracts with the federal government .
Barlett and Steele say that while Halliburton and Bechtel supply the muscle - building infrastructure - SAIC sells brainpower .
Founded almost 40 years ago in San Diego , the core of the company 's sprawling operations are now in the Washington , D.C. suburbs , where it serves the Pentagon and the National Security State , as well as other arms of the federal government .
Two developments over the last 15 years have spurred SAIC 's growth .
One is the outsourcing of federal government operations , an ongoing trend that got a huge boost with then - Vice President Al Gore 's " Reinventing Government " initiative .
Under the Bush administration , contracting out has gone into overdrive .
A permanent government of contractors like SAIC now do what the government once did - typically at greater expense than when the same functions were performed in house .
The second boost for SAIC was the 9/11 terrorist attack , and the U.S. response - which includes the Iraq War , despite the fact that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 .
" There is n't a politically correct way to put it , but this is what needs to be said : 9/11 was a personal tragedy for thousands of families and a national tragedy for all of America , but it was very , very good for SAIC , " Barlett and Steele write .
" In the aftermath of the attacks , the Bush administration launched its Global War on Terror , whose chief consequence has been to channel money by the tens of billions into companies promising they could do something - anything - to help .
SAIC was ready . "
Ready to capitalize on the business opportunity , that is .
The extent to which the company delivers useful services to the government is not so clear .
Barlett and Steele document a long list of whistleblower lawsuits and federal criminal investigations of the company , and describe how several of SAIC 's projects have turned out to be colossal failures .
One example is the Iraqi Media Network .
A week before the invasion of Iraq , Barlett and Steele write , " SAIC was awarded yet another no -bid contract , this one for $ 15 million , which within a year would balloon to $ 82 million .
The contract gave SAIC the responsibility for establishing a ' free and independent indigenous media network ' in Iraq , and for training a cadre of independent Iraqi journalists to go with it .
The selection of SAIC for this job may have seemed counter - intuitive .
A year earlier , SAIC had been involved in a Pentagon program designed to feed disinformation to the foreign press . "
" The job of establishing the Iraqi Media Network 's infrastructure - cables , transmitters , dishes - was rife with corruption and waste , " Barlett and Steele write .
In March 2004 , the Pentagon 's inspector general found widespread violations of normal contracting procedures .
" One of the more blatant transgressions concerned SAIC 's overall manager of the media effort in Iraq .
The investigators discovered that he had bought a Hummer and a pickup truck in the United States and then chartered a DC - 10 cargo jet to fly them to Iraq .
When a Pentagon official refused to allow the charge , the inspector general reported , 'SAIC then went around the authority of this acquisition specialist to a different office within the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to gain approval and succeeded . ' "
SAIC hired Don North , a former NBC news staffer , to help build the Iraqi Media Network .
North and his colleagues aimed to create an independent media operation .
Their hopes were quickly dashed .
" With SAIC 's cooperation , " Barlett and Steele write , " the network quickly devolved into a mouthpiece for the Pentagon - ' a little Voice of America , ' as North would put it .
Iraqis openly snickered at the programming .
Every time North protested , he recalls , he was rebuffed by SAIC executives .
' Here I was going around quoting Edward R. Murrow , ' North says , ' and the people who were running me were manipulating and controlling a very undemocratic press and media that was every bit as bad as what Saddam had established . ' "
With no authentic independent culture , the Iraqi Media Service was just a pawn of its controllers .
When it was turned over to the Iraqi government , it continued as a propaganda machine , but with a different message .
Today , in an ironic twist , it " spews out virulently anti-American messages day and night . "
Failure does not seem to hurt SAIC much .
Nor do elections seem to matter much for the company that has become a fixture in Washington .
" Political change causes scarcely a ripple , " Barlett and Steele write .
" As one former SAIC manager observed in a recent blog posting : ' My observation is that the impact of national elections on the business climate for SAIC has been minimal .
The emphasis on where federal spending occurs usually shifts , but total federal spending never decreases .
SAIC has always continued to grow despite changes in the political leadership in Washington . ' "

Two women hug like long - lost sisters beneath a gazebo at north Phoenix 's Roadrunner Park .
Gina Niedzwiecki and Ruth Murray had been chatting by phone for months , since they 'd learned of their sadly similar stories .
But this sunny day in mid-January marks the first time they 've met in person , and their excitement is palpable .
The women have their children with them , which include Murray 's eight ( the oldest is 16 ) and Niedzwiecki's two little girls .
As they quickly set out a picnic lunch -- they 've been through that drill before -- the women giggle about being peas in a pod : devout Catholics , close - knit families , long marriages , devoted moms , ingrained work ethics , love of children , small in stature , big in personality .
Finally , they start to talk about their former divorce mediator , 53 - year - old Gary Karpin .
Karpin became the focus of both women 's hearts -- and pocketbooks -- after they turned to him for help on their divorces , Niedzwiecki's in 2003 and Murray 's last year .
" Not such a good guy , is he , Gina ? " Murray says .
" Nope , " Niedzwiecki replies , smiling at her new friend 's intentional understatement .
Gary Karpin operates what he says is a booming one - man business that he variously calls " Divorce With Dignity " or " Divorce Associates . "
His late - model silver Corvette and his sprawling home in Gilbert that he bought for $ 495,000 in 2001 may be testament to his success .
His Web site claims he " can help you overcome these trying times without the costs and fees that a typical divorce could cost you . "
Karpin 's print advertisements say he 'll " settle all issues -- no trial -- no court appearance -- be divorced in 90 days -- low cost -- low stress -- judge approved -- focus on best interests of children -- attorney supervised . "
Those lofty promises have led hundreds of people to Karpin 's office at 3420 East Shea Boulevard in Phoenix since he set up shop there in the late 1990s .
And no doubt , many of his customers would say he 's done a fine job for them at what they considered a reasonable price .
But Gina Niedzwiecki and Ruth Murray did n't just entrust Karpin with their money :
They also gave him their hearts , after the twice - divorced Gilbert resident convinced them of his romantic interest in them .
They admit that the unexpected attention from the trim , classical - guitar - playing Christopher Walken look - alike had flattered them , especially during the dark , lonely times after they split from longtime spouses .
" I was a separated mother of eight kids living in a 952 - square - foot house and working my butt off , " says Murray , a letter - carrier for the U.S. Postal Service .
" What man would possibly be interested in that ? "
The pair say they 'd assumed Karpin was a licensed lawyer , and that he did nothing to dissuade them .
For his part , Karpin says he never claims to be a licensed attorney , and notes small type in his fee agreement that calls him a " mediator , " not a lawyer .
" I never , ever give legal advice , " he tells New Times .
" Telling people the content of the law , telling the people what their options are , is not giving legal advice . "
But Karpin 's office walls are lined with his apparent credentials , including his law degree from a Vermont school and a certificate from Maricopa County Superior Court deeming him qualified in mediation .
And even a satisfied customer that Karpin produced for New Times says she believed he was a licensed attorney .
" He 's not an attorney ? " asked Caitlin Gallup , who went to Karpin with her estranged husband a few years ago for mediation .
" I was sure he was a lawyer who happened to do mediation .
This makes me think about some things . "
Gallup says the bill came to about $ 6,000 , and she credits Karpin with " being able to manage the conflict and expectations of myself and my ex-husband , somewhat like a counselor and lawyer combined .
At the end of the day , it was about the outcome . "
In the late 1990s , Karpin called his business the " Law Offices of G.J. Karpin and Associates , " and referred to himself as a " retired " prosecutor .
Actually , Karpin was " retired " as an attorney by the Vermont Supreme Court in 1992 , when it disbarred him .
One of Karpin 's print advertisements depicts his photo and a caption beneath that says " Dr. Gary . "
That ad focuses on the counseling side of Karpin 's business , and claims : " 80 percent of my couples reconciled or dismissed their divorce or both after completing counseling . "
Karpin told New Times in the first of two in - person interviews that he earned his doctorate in early - childhood counseling in 1982 from Vermont 's Castleton State College .
But a spokeswoman at Castleton State says the institution never has offered a doctoral program .
Records there show that Karpin did earn an undergraduate degree in 1982 , with an emphasis in Elementary Education and Theatre Arts .
( He also earned a bachelor 's degree from Marlboro College , also in Vermont . )
When confronted with that at a second interview , Karpin claimed he'd never said he had a doctorate from Castleton .
He now said that he calls himself " Dr. Gary " because of his law degree -- a juris doctorate .
Karpin repeatedly declined to show New Times any of his diplomas .
Karpin was an attorney , at least for six years .
But a hearing officer for the State Bar of Vermont wrote of him in 1991 : " [ He has ] engaged in an unprecedented pattern of submitting false statements , submitting false evidence and using other deceptive practices . "
That 's just what Niedzwiecki , Murray and other embittered consumers have alleged in complaints to the State Bar of Arizona .
Last April , the Bar filed a pending lawsuit against Karpin under a new rule that allows civil sanctions against those who engage in the unauthorized practice of law .
Among other things , the Bar wants a county judge to order Karpin to repay more than $ 100,000 in fees , and to impose other sanctions .
Karpin has responded in court papers by saying he " provides an invaluable service to the legal community and to individual clients , as [ he ] has successfully mediated literally thousands of divorces through supreme skill , expertise and knowledge , whereby even . . . difficult and contested cases have been successfully mediated .
" These decrees have been submitted to Commissioner Eve Parks on a continuous basis for years , for quick approval and resolution of matters usually involving children . "
Not so quickly in the case of Gina and Joe Niedzwiecki .
That one took about 15 months from start to finish .
Gina says she now knows she was far more vulnerable than she 'd realized to Karpin 's patter , which can be charming and seductive .
Bright and articulate , she had a fine job as a bank administrator until multiple sclerosis forced her into a medical retirement about five years ago .
Then Gina made the decision to file for divorce from her husband Joe after two decades of marriage .
That would have been stressful enough without her illness , and without the responsibilities of two young daughters .
Gina does n't have family in Arizona , and that surely contributed to her sense of isolation .
That 's where Gary Karpin stepped in .
He would exact a devastating price from Gina , both financially and emotionally , over a year - plus period that ended last summer .
During that time , she paid Karpin $ 87,767 to complete the paperwork in what seems to have been a relatively simple and amicable divorce .
In other words , Gina Niedzwiecki paid Karpin an average of $ 1,350 a week for more than a year for services that the divorcing couple may have completed themselves , or hired an attorney for a few thousand bucks .
" What that guy charged that lady is outrageous , incredible , " says Norman Davis , presiding Superior Court judge of the county 's Family Court .
" Two experienced attorneys in an average case with the facts described here do n't approach what he charged .
Lawyers charge that much 1 percent of the time , if that .
It just is n't right .
I 'd like to hear his explanation for all this . "
Karpin 's explanation is like the man himself -- blustery and glib .
" I 'm sure none of this is going to get into your story , [ but ]
I put in two years of work to get a decree to make her a wealthy woman , " he says , claiming that Gina 's " investment " of $ 87,000 turned into a " $ 300,000 return " in her divorce settlement .
" You 're not going to take this amazing decree and tell me that she got ripped off , " Karpin continues .
" It 's a decree she never would have gotten in any other scenario .
. . .
I 'm actually very proud of the work I did in this case . "
As for Gina , Karpin says , " She 's not a victim , she 's more like a seductress .
She 's very pretty and used her attractiveness , and manipulated me .
. . .
She 's the farthest thing in the world to being a victim . "
Gina collected the money from myriad sources :
She borrowed from her 401 ( k ) retirement fund and from friends , maxed out credit cards , and turned over the proceeds from the sale of a house .
After she came to her senses last summer , Gina taped phone calls with Karpin during which he demanded yet another $ 9,000 from her .
Those calls , copies of which Gina submitted with her written complaint to the Bar last October , show how Karpin tried to woo her romantically in one breath , and angrily vowed to sue her for the money in the next .
Fran Johansen plans to retire from the State Bar of Arizona next week .
That should bring a smile to the faces of Gary Karpin and others who have been in her sights since she went to work more than five years ago as the Bar 's first unauthorized - practice - of - law attorney .
Johansen had a thriving family law practice of her own until turning to public service in 1999 .
She 's a good listener -- and , man , she 's heard some stories .
She 's also compassionate and well - organized , a good combination in her job .
Johansen says she still feels passionately about the need " to try to stop scam artists from acting as attorneys and doing things they have no right to do , sometimes for large sums of money . "
Many crypto-attorneys gravitate toward Family Court , an arena of aggrieved spouses , high - priced attorneys , and a court docket manned by overloaded judges .
Johansen chuckles at accusations by Karpin and others that she 's had a personal vendetta against non-lawyers .
" I know that 's what Gary and some others think , " Johansen says , " but they 're barking up the wrong tree .
I understand mediation pretty well , and I think that 's fine for the right couples .
But mediators can't advocate for either side .
By definition , they are supposed to be independent overseers of an agreement between divorcing couples .
That 's where Gary has gotten into trouble with us , that and some other things . "
One theme of the complaints against Karpin , Johansen says , " is that when a young woman comes in , [ whom he ] becomes interested in , he becomes their advocate .
But he still charges them whatever he thinks he can get from them . "
Johansen used to forward some complaints against Karpin and others to the state Attorney General 's Office for possible criminal prosecution .
But she admits to having been very frustrated by the form letters sent to her in response by a legal assistant in the state agency 's Consumer Protection and Advocacy unit .
Those letters claimed that investigations could n't proceed " because both staff and resources are limited . "
The dismal situation did n't change when Terry Goddard became attorney general in January 2003 , even after winning election in part on a platform of fighting white - collar crime .
" I had to tell people there was very little I could do for them , " Johansen says .
" I 'm talking about folks who genuinely had been hurt , at least financially , and never had anything like this happen to them . "
But things brightened some in July 2003 , when a new Arizona Supreme Court rule went into effect .
Until then , Arizona had been the only state lacking civil or criminal sanctions against the unauthorized practice of law .
The new rule created a board that licenses and regulates document preparers , of whom there are dozens in this state .
Gary Karpin , for one , would n't qualify for such a license because of his previous disbarment .
But there 's nothing to prohibit him from running a mediation business -- hearing people out and making suggestions about a course of action , but without giving legal advice .
The new rule also allows the State Bar to seek civil penalties against those who collect fees for doing the work of lawyers , especially giving legal advice .
Evidence is overwhelming that Karpin has done exactly that -- given legal advice , taken sides in a dispute , and sometimes charged far more than attorneys .
Still , no local agency other than the State Bar -- whose powers are limited with non-lawyers -- has yet to try to stop him .
" These guys are very good at what they do , " Fran Johansen says , speaking of Karpin and others .
" And there are victims out there [ from these mediators ] just the same as if they 'd been held up at gunpoint . "
Karpin replies , " The Bar has a hard - on for me .
They do n't like me , do n't like what I 'm doing , because I 'm pushing them and I 'm pushing them hard .
And they do n't seem to be able to do anything about me . "
Gary Karpin moved to Arizona , land of the fee and home of the brazen , in the mid-1990s .
He migrated here a few years after losing his ticket to practice law in Vermont , shortly after his 40th birthday .
It 's no wonder Karpin sought a fresh start far from home .
Records at the Vermont Supreme Court show that Karpin was admitted to the Bar in October 1987 , after earning a law degree from Vermont Law School .
He worked in that state as a prosecutor for almost a year before going into private practice by himself .
But the Vermont Bar soon got several complaints about Karpin 's work , both as a prosecutor and as a sole practitioner .
As a prosecutor , for example , he 'd filed a petition alleging that a couple had been providing inadequate care for their child .
After Karpin left the agency , he agreed to represent the couple in the same matter .
That 's unethical , though standing alone would n't have cost him his legal career .
But Karpin also had other complaints pending against him .
Probably the worst one involved his inept handling of , and deception about , a case involving an illiterate client who was suing over a bad car deal .
Vermont Supreme Court records show that Karpin bribed his former secretary to take the blame for his own legal failures .
Eventually , the secretary came clean , which did n't help Karpin 's status with the state 's disciplinary board .
That panel wrote of him : " [ Karpin's ] conduct in this matter demonstrates an appalling lack of concern for this client and the client 's matter .
When the matter began to go badly , his only concern was for self - preservation .
. . .
The Panel believes this to have been dishonest and self - serving . "
In asking the state Supreme Court to disbar Karpin , the panel concluded that " the depth and breadth of [ Karpin's ] conduct is so significant and wide - ranging that he is a threat to the public , the profession , the courts and his clients . "
The high court unanimously agreed in 1992 to disbar him .
Karpin 's illiterate client later sued him for professional malpractice , and won an $ 88,000 verdict , including $ 75,000 in punitive damages .
In Arizona , Karpin reinvented himself in the mid-'90s as a mediator available for couples seeking to avoid headaches of high - dollar attorneys and an overburdened court system .
He took a weeklong class in mediation at Maricopa County Superior Court , collected a certificate , and hung up a shingle .
That 's all it took , plus a steady advertising budget and a sophisticated rap to hook needy clientele in the lucrative turf battle with the Bar over the divorce dollar .
Unquestionably , a market for divorce mediators existed in Arizona , then and now .
Study after study talks about unmet legal needs of the poor and even middle - class , mostly because too many attorneys simply cost too much .
Then and now , Karpin 's shtick combines a self - help New Age sensibility -- " Transformative Mediation for Couples That Want to Reconcile , " one of his ads pitches -- with hardball divorce - attorney tactics .
And like any intelligent salesman , which Karpin is , he 's expert at reading people and , when it suits him , exploiting their weaknesses while they 're at their most susceptible .
But just as in Vermont , complaints about Karpin started to flow into the State Bar in Arizona in the late 1990s , some from attorneys and others from consumers .
Fran Johansen started to see a pattern in the complaints ; there are now 26 on file at the Bar .
Karpin , it seemed , occasionally was using his mediation business to pick up women .
" There 's nothing wrong , " Karpin says , " with connecting with someone intellectually , personally or emotionally as long as it's not sexual . "
But in 1999 , for example , an estranged couple ( we 'll call them the Nolans ) first met with Karpin to mediate their divorce .
Patrick Nolan ( who asked New Times to change his last name ) said he and his then - wife would pay Karpin $ 1,500 each to perfect their divorce decree .
" All of a sudden , I was getting letters from him on my ex's behalf , " says the father of four daughters .
" I got my own lawyer and never saw him again .
I know all about his intimidation tactics , but he 's still very , very believable at first .
And he knows the system .
He 's a con artist . "
Nolan says his wife told him before their divorce was final that she was dating Karpin .
Eventually , she moved in with the mediator -- Karpin says they 're engaged to be married .
Karpin says Nolan never quarreled about the original divorce decree , which " must mean that my product was satisfactory for him . "
Karpin sued Patrick Nolan last April 1 for defamation , slander , restraint of trade and other allegations .
He dropped his case on January 13 .
Court records indicate Nolan is the primary custodial parent of the couple 's four daughters .
" I have n't spoken to Karpin since I went to the one session years ago , " he says .
" He 's all about money and control , and I hate it when my kids get to go to his house to see their mother every other weekend .
Sometimes , I want to strangle the guy . "
On May 9 , 2003 , Gina and Joe Niedzwiecki went for a " free initial consultation " with Gary Karpin .
Gina had decided to divorce Joe , and though the split was tough on both , they resolved to make it as painless as possible .
They paid Karpin $ 975 at the end of the first session , and took paperwork with them to fill out before the next meeting .
Much later , Gina painstakingly typed a history of her interactions with Karpin over the next 15 months .
She also attached canceled checks and other proof of her payments to the mediator , an astounding sum of $ 87,767 .
Before the third session , the couple paid Karpin another $ 1,000 .
But Gina says her estranged husband left in anger after Karpin asked him for financial information that the couple already had provided , and demanded more money .
At Karpin 's request , Gina says , she and Joe sat in separate rooms during their fourth mediation meeting , in July 2003 .
She later paid Karpin yet another $ 3,000 on a joint credit card , but she says Joe canceled the payment after he learned about it .
Joe apparently never spoke to Karpin again , but Gina returned to his office the following week .
She later wrote that Karpin told her she now needed to pay him $ 5,000 because the divorce issues were heating up .
Gina paid up , this time with her own funds .
She met with Karpin about once every other week for months , and says he finally completed a draft of the couple 's potential divorce settlement in October 2003 .
But she says it was filled with inaccuracies .
A second draft that December also was fraught with mistakes , which Karpin apparently blamed on his " typing pool . "
Gina says she saw an ad for Divorce With Dignity in New Times around that time with Karpin 's photograph , and mentioned it to him .
She says he told her the photo had been the idea of " corporate , " not his .
" I always thought he was an attorney working for a large firm , " she says .
" I signed my checks to ' Divorce Associates . '
It never occurred to me that he was n't a lawyer . "
Gina kept paying and paying and paying .
She says one reason she kept paying him was because he promised repeatedly to return her so - called " good - faith retainer " money when her case ended .
But the bigger reason probably is that Gina was emotionally hooked on Karpin , with whom she says she 'd been conversing about everything but the divorce .
" I felt there was a ' connection ' between the two of us , " Gina later wrote to the Bar .
" I liked him a lot , and I 'm sure he knew that .
And I got very clear signs from him that he felt the same .
. . .
He repeated many times during the 15 months , ' Let 's get you single so we can take this to the next level . ' "
In early April 2004 , Gina says , Karpin told her that county court commissioner Eve Parks was " having trouble " with the terms of the Niedzwieckis ' proposed divorce agreement : " He adamantly told me time and time again that he was n't God , but he would do what he could to convince [ Parks ] to agree to our consent decree as written . "
In a phone conversation that Gina taped months later , Karpin said he had " counseled with [ Parks ] constantly on your case with direct phone hook - up .
With Judge Eve Parks , like I do almost every other day on all my cases . "
( Regarding his supposed relationship with Parks , Karpin tells New Times : " I 've talked with Eve Parks on the telephone and I know her in a professional setting .
. . .
I submit decrees to her , to her room , to her situation .
I 've worked with her a lot .
. . .
She 's called me on the phone asking me to redo my paperwork . " )
But Parks tells New Times that she 's never spoken to Gary Karpin , and recalls leaving a voice message at his office only once in her seven years on the bench , to ask him to amend paperwork in a case .
" I emphatically deny that I talked to this man every other day , or whatever he is saying , " the commissioner says .
" I have absolutely no relationship with him , and I would n't know him if he sat in my office unless he introduced himself . "
Parks adds that Karpin " does n't represent the people whose cases come before me -- he 's not an attorney -- and he would n't have any standing to discuss these so - called ' trouble spots ' in someone else 's divorce decree . "
Court records also show that Karpin did n't file the divorce petition in the case until April 20 , 2004 .
That was almost a year and thousands of dollars in fees after the couple first had met with him , and after he'd told Gina about Parks ' alleged " trouble " with the agreement .
A few months passed , with Karpin repeatedly telling Gina he still was waiting for Commissioner Parks to get back to him .
On June 1 , remarkably , she paid him another $ 7,500 .
Finally , in late July , Gina says , Karpin told her she'd have to appear before Parks in a few days , and scheduled an emergency appointment to practice her testimony with him .
( Karpin denies this . )
She says he asked her intimate questions about her sex life with her husband during the mock testimony , the relevance of which eluded her .
" I could n't believe I had to go through this , " she wrote later .
" Joe and I had signed off our agreement months prior .
Why did [ Commissioner ]
Parks want me to testify before her ?
Joe and I were in agreement .
Our divorce was not complex , and it just did n't make sense . "
The meeting ended with yet another $ 7,500 payment from Gina to Karpin .
Court documents show that no evidentiary hearings ever were scheduled in the Niedzwiecki case , which means Karpin was lying to Gina .
On August 2 , Parks ' colleague , Commissioner Myra Harris , signed the couple 's divorce decree .
Gina says she phoned Karpin as soon as she got the news in a letter from the court .
She says he asked her to come by to complete the " final paperwork " and to bring with her the last payment -- $ 25,000 .
" He said ' corporate ' normally charges 20 percent of the total award amount , which for me would be $ 36,000 [ more in legal fees ] . . . but luckily he got ' them ' down to $ 25,000 . "
When she got to the office , Gina says , she looked on as Karpin pretended to make a phone call to alleged " senior partner " Robert Green Jr .
Gina listened as Karpin seemingly pleaded with Green to cut her a financial break on the $ 25,000 bill .
Afterward , he asked Gina to give him $ 15,000 of " earnest money , " after which he said he'd again plead with " the firm " to waive the remaining $ 10,000 .
Gina again did as told , coming up with the money that day , she says , by borrowing $ 2,000 from a friend to cover the check .
But that still was n't enough for Dr. Gary .
A few days later , he asked Gina to meet with him for lunch .
Sadly , he said " corporate " was demanding the remaining $ 10,000 , but might settle for $ 9,000 if she paid it immediately .
Gina says she arranged to withdraw $ 10,000 from her former employer 's 401 ( k ) fund .
Rob Green is a real attorney , though he 's currently serving a 30 - day suspension from the Bar for misconduct unrelated to Karpin .
He had agreed in writing in July 2002 to oversee Karpin 's work , hoping foolishly , he says , of picking up some spillover clients from the busy mediator .
But Green tells New Times that he looked at only a few of Karpin 's files over the next two years , and says he never spoke to Karpin about Gina Niedzwiecki .
Green adds that , by last summer , he 'd written three letters to Karpin ending their association , at least two of them after learning that Karpin was using his name in advertisements .
" I had wanted it to work instead of being skeptical because I thought Gary could bring me business , " Green says .
" But I basically left him to his own devices , which was my mistake .
He definitely was misrepresenting himself to people by saying he was an attorney .
Clients that he referred to me told me that he either had inferred that he was an attorney or had flat - out told them that .
It 's not that he can't do good work .
But I would say that he 's a danger to this community . "
After penalties for early withdrawal and taxes , Gina Niedzwiecki collected $ 8,900 from her 401( k ) .
When she got the money , she says she mailed a personal check to Karpin for $ 9,000 .
She says she was convinced that , if she did n't pay , the " firm " would place a lien on her home or garnish her alimony payments , as Karpin had warned .
By now , Gina finally was starting to see the light .
Deeply troubled and embarrassed , she says she called the acquaintance who had recommended Karpin more than a year earlier .
She says the woman told her that Karpin apparently was a disbarred attorney from Vermont , and suggested Gina check him out on the Internet .
Gina put a stop - payment on the $ 9,000 check later that day , August 23 .
Still ambivalent , however , she canceled that order later that night , then stopped the check again for keeps on August 25 after investigating Karpin on the Net .
The next day , Gina says she left a voice message for Karpin asking for a copy of her file and an itemized bill .
Then she called the State Bar and spoke with Fran Johansen , who asked her to document her experience with Karpin in writing .
Even physically , that would be no small task for Gina , as her multiple sclerosis makes it difficult for her to type .
By then , Karpin knew of the stop - payment on the $ 9,000 and had gone ballistic .
He left Gina 15 voice messages within a day 's time , which she later included in her complaint package to the Bar .
From the first one : " I 've got all kinds of problems with this now .
Other people 's checks are bouncing relying on your check so it 's totally screwed up the business account .
I 'm gonna have to step into court on this .
I need you to make good on those funds today , this afternoon . . . "
From another : " You 've caused a lot of damage here by doing this secretly and deceptively without telling me what 's going on .
You 've hurt other people with your actions , and I do n't understand it . "
And : " I apologize to you for flipping out .
It was a mistake .
. . .
Number two , I wo n't agree to arbitration or anything else .
I do n't care about the money .
You could keep the money .
I really do n't care about it . "
Over the next month or so , Gina taped all of her conversations with Karpin .
" The reality is that I was scammed out of that money , " Gina told him in an August 30 phone call .
" If you [ or ] anybody says that , I 'll sue the shit out of them , " Karpin said .
" I 'll go into court with my work that I did and the result that you got , and I 'll defend that until I 'm dead . "
" I was vulnerable . . .
I was a target , " Gina told him .
" I admit that .
I acknowledge that . "
" How dare you ! " Karpin retorted .
He reiterated that she should " talk to Judge Eve Parks almost daily , if not every two or three days , " and reminded Gina that her stop - payment on the $ 9,000 had wreaked havoc in Family Court .
Gina asked him why Commissioner Harris , not Parks , had signed the divorce decree .
" Judge Parks ' assistant signed it , " Karpin replied , sounding exasperated .
" But [ Parks ] was in charge of the case the whole time .
And all my communications to her on the telephone , directly to her about the case . . . it all occurred , and it was all a matter of getting the decree approved exactly how you wanted it done . "
Shortly before the end of the August 30 phone call , Gina asked Karpin : " Gary , am I really that stupid ?
Tell me .
For my own learning , if you are my friend , how do I avoid getting myself into a situation like this next time ? "
" Trust my judgment and check in with me , " Karpin told her .
Within a day , however , he sang an uglier tune .
" Let me be very , very clear about this , " he told Gina .
" If I hear from anyone the accusations that you made to me personally , that 's defamation and slander .
So I 'm warning you ahead of time . . .
I will act upon it in a legal way to protect my rights under the law . "
He now also threatened to sue Gina for the $ 9,000 that he said she still owed him .
When that approach did n't seem to work , he invited her on a vacation trip to Mexico .
" The bottom line on that is , she still owes me $ 9,000 , " Karpin tells New Times .
" And by the way , when [ the Bar lawsuit against Karpin ] is tossed , I 'm going to sue her for $ 9,000 , get a judgment if I win .
If I do n't , I do n't .
And then I 'm going to file a lien against her home , just as I said in my so - called nasty tapes , which are not nasty at all .
It 's the law . "
In another taped conversation last October 6 , Gina tried to press him for reimbursement of all but about $ 4,000 of the $ 87,000 she 'd paid .
He tap - danced deftly around that one , talking instead about a beloved horse of his , Mr. Shoes , who had died .
Mr. Soft Shoes then ambled on : " You want to make some money ?
Hook your wagon to me . "
In writing and by phone , Gina continued to demand her case file .
Then , last October 22 , Karpin left her a humdinger of a voice - mail message .
He claimed the office cleaning crew had thrown out her thick case file , and there was nothing that could be done about it .
" I did an exam of the Dumpster at some risk to myself , " Karpin said , " and unfortunately the materials no longer exist .
They were discarded in error .
So I apologize to you ; there 's nothing I can do about it . "
Gina spoke to the manager of the building at which Karpin rents space .
The manager told her in a tape - recorded interview that " our maintenance people claimed that they really did n't remove anything . "
On January 18 , Gary Karpin agreed to meet with New Times at his office .
It would be the first of two interviews , the latter on January 20 .
After a short discussion of the allegations against him ( he denied any wrongdoing ) , Karpin mentioned that he had an appointment with Ruth Murray , the mother of eight and Gina Niedzwiecki's new pal .
Karpin said he was meeting with Murray to discuss her request for a refund of at least some of the $ 3,500 or so she 'd paid him last summer for mediating her contemplated divorce .
Like Niedzwiecki , Murray once had become sweet on Karpin , especially after he promised at first to do her case for free .
But their relationship had soured after unexpected bills started to amass , and -- just like Gina -- she 'd watched in amazement as Karpin had pretended to call his " boss " to ask for a reduction of the bill .
" I thought , ' Oh my God !
He 's faking the phone call , ' " Murray wrote to the State Bar in a 14 - page handwritten complaint dated last July 28 .
" He went on and on [ about ] how we were the parents of eight and are good people , and we wanted to work something out .
Then : beep , beep , beep , like the phone disconnected .
I was sure at that point . "
When Murray showed up for her January 18 meeting with Karpin , he asked if she 'd mind chatting in the presence of a reporter .
Certainly not , she replied .
" You know what , " he told her , as the three sat around a table in a conference room , " when someone says to me , ' Can I get a refund ? '
I always call them back and say , ' Let 's talk . ' "
" Gary , " Murray replied , " at first you said to me that you 'd talk to me in court . "
" You bet , " Karpin countered .
" After that complaint that you made , and the stuff you exaggerated and whatnot .
The point is , I was going to wait , then get you into court , get you on cross-examination on the witness stand , and cut you into little pieces , figuratively speaking . "
" I hope so , " Murray shot back , " because that would get you into a whole new trial . "
" You think I betrayed you -- I think you betrayed me , " Karpin continued .
" That 's the harsh reality .
People can make a connection , and it does n't have to be sexual .
Did we ever have sex ? "
" No , " Murray said , " because , as I told you , I 'm not that kind of person . "
Their conversation veered to the work that Karpin had performed for Ruth and Jack Murray .
" I was under the impression that you were a lawyer , " she told him .
" Did I ever tell you I was an attorney - at - law ? " he answered .
" Ever ? "
" When you told me that you might do it for free , and I said , ' I do n't mean to offend , but you are a lawyer .
All lawyers want money . '
And you just laughed . "
" Well , you had made a joke . "
" And then you told me you would do it pro bono , totally lawyer language . "
Karpin then asked Murray if she 'd reconciled with Jack , the father of her eight children .
She said she had .
" Great ! " he said .
" Now , let me ask you a question !
Could it be possible , just a little bit , that some of the work that we did , establishing communication , talking about the best interest of your kids , setting up a cooperative framework , contributed just a little bit to your reconciliation ? "
Murray replied in a whisper : " I think Jack was jealous of you .
He noticed something between us .
He was surprised I hit him with the divorce , and that guys were still noticing me . "
Asked by the reporter if she wished she 'd never met Karpin , Murray said : " Do I have to tell the truth ?
He kind of ripped my heart out of my chest and stomped on it .
. . .
I felt like , ' Oh my God , I let him manipulate me and play with my heart , ' only to find out that this had happened before . "
" That 's fine , " Karpin responded .
" But my policy is , if someone comes to me respectfully like you have , with a request for a refund , I 'll give it to them , not a doubt . "
Except if your name is Gina Niedzwiecki , who requested the $ 83,000 refund .
" Gina is exception to the exception to prove the rule , " Karpin said , not missing a tick .
The reporter left the conference room to allow Karpin and Murray to work out the specifics of the refund .
Later , she told New Times that he promised to get back with her .
Murray 's not counting her chickens .
And as for her reunion with her husband , she had this to say : " I guess you can say we 've really reconciled .
What I 'm trying to say is , I 'm pregnant . "

Daniel Bauen made a nifty pedal - powered tennis ball launcher
Both cleanly powered and built from 2 recycled bicycles , scrap steel and wood , leaking 5 gallon water jug and a lacross stick , our pedal powered tennis ball launcher was created as a unique entry for the Innovate or Die pedal powered machine contest .
It allows players varying in skill levels to practice to be better at both tennis and cycling .
The launcher is towed to the court on its built - in bicycle trailer .
A bike is secured to it and functions to drive the device .
Pedaling the cycle as one would on a trainer drives the two launcher wheels .
The cyclist then aims and pulls the lever to launch balls to the hitter .
Graham Calvert also sought personal injury damages
Greyhound trainer Graham Calvert , 28 , of Houghton - le - Spring , near Sunderland , said the company failed in its " duty of care " and the judge agreed .
But Mr Justice Briggs ruled on Wednesday that William Hill was not liable for the losses .
He ordered Mr Calvert to pay £ 175,000 interim costs to the firm , but the payment is on hold pending an appeal .
The judge said he would only pay 80 % of the estimated £ 420,000 bookmakers costs after the late disclosure of key evidence .
He ruled that although the company failed to take " reasonable steps " to stop Mr Calvert from telephone gambling , Mr Calvert 's " pathological gambling " would still probably have led to his financial ruin .
In summary of his ruling the judge said : " William Hill 's failure to take reasonable care to exclude him from telephone gambling ... did not therefore cause Mr Calvert any measurable financial or other loss . "
New accounts
Mr Calvert had also sought further compensation after he claimed he had not only lost money but also his wife , health and livelihood .
William
Hill was accused of manipulating his gambling disorder to gain as much revenue as possible by letting him place bets after asking it to close his account under a self - exclusion scheme .
It was alleged the bookmaker allowed Mr Calvert to open two new accounts and to make bets totalling about £ 3.5 m between June and December 2006 .
During this period he lost a total of £ 2.1 m .
The company denied any wrongdoing and said it could not be held legally liable for Mr Calvert 's losses .
David Hood , spokesman for William Hill , said : " We stated from the outset that there was no case to answer to Mr Calvert .
" The judge found that no general duty of care is owed to problem gamblers and that Hills handling of Mr Calvert 's calls did not cause his loss . "
National database
The judge granted permission to appeal against the ruling and Mr Calvert has until 16 April to lodge an appeal .
Ward Hadaway , the law firm representing Mr Calvert , said : " It is particularly disappointing that the judge decided not to award our client any damages because he was so critical of William Hill .
" The criticism was of the way in which they dealt with our client and of their self - exclusion procedures generally .
" He found that William Hill had failed Mr Calvert in a number of different ways .
" The judgment highlighted the need for a national database allowing problem gamblers to self - exclude from all bookmakers in one go . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. carbon - capping bill aimed at curbing climate change died on Friday in the Senate but its supporters looked to the next president to enact a global warming law as early as 2009 .
The bill aimed to cut total U.S. global warming emissions by 66 percent by 2050 .
Opponents said it would cost jobs and raise fuel prices in an already pinched American economy .
Far from being discouraged , Sen .
Joe Lieberman said international observers would be gratified that the measure got support from a majority in the Senate , including presumptive presidential nominees John McCain and Barack Obama .
“ I think people around the world are going to be greatly encouraged by the fact that 54 members of the U.S. Senate are saying they want to support a real response to global warming , ” Lieberman , the independent senator from Connecticut who sponsored the bill , said after the measure ended with a procedural vote .
The vote showed 48 senators favored the bill with 36 opposed .
Six more senators , including Illinois Democrat Obama and Arizona Republican McCain , wrote letters saying they would have voted in favor if they had been in town to vote .
Sixty votes were needed to take the bill to the next stage of consideration .
“ In America change does n’t happen overnight , it takes time to turn the ship of state , ” said Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who shepherded the bill .
She noted that Senate climate change legislation was first introduced in 2003 and the 2005 version got only 38 votes .
“ This is coming , ” Boxer said .
She said supporters planned to start work next week on a “ roadmap ” for the next president .
SETTING THE STAGE FOR A NEW PRESIDENT
President George W. Bush has consistently opposed any economy - wide cap - and - trade plan and had vowed to veto this bill if Congress approved it .
Senate leaders opposed to the bill used a variety of tactics during weeklong debate on the Senate floor , including a rare maneuver by Republicans that forced clerks to read an updated version of the 491 - page bill aloud .
That took 10 hours .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky discounted the vote ’s importance .
“ This whole exercise will have had no effect on either climate change or gas prices , ” he said .
Environmental groups were jubilant , even as the bill was defeated .

“ Today ’s vote sets the stage for a new president and Congress to enact strong legislation that will more effectively build a clean energy economy and prevent the worst consequences of global warming , ” a coalition of green groups , including Environmental Defense Fund , National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council , said in a statement .
The statement accused lawmakers allied with the coal and oil industries of blocking progress on the measure .
The Climate Security Act would have cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 2 percent per year between 2012 and 2050 , based on 2005 emission levels , its proponents said .
The bill would have capped carbon emissions from 87 percent of U.S. power plants , oil refineries and other pollution sources , cutting emissions to 19 percent below current levels by 2020 and 71 percent below current levels by 2050 .
These are more modest targets than those set by the Kyoto Protocol .
The United States is alone among major industrialized
nations in rejecting the Kyoto pact .
Carbon dioxide , which contributes to the climate - warming greenhouse effect , is emitted by fossil - fueled vehicles , coal - fired power plants and natural sources , including human breath .

Officers believe the boxes were being used to store criminal assets
Six suitcases packed with suspected gold dust and about £ 30 m in cash have been found during searches of safety deposit centres in London , police say .
Detectives also found heroin and cocaine , evidence linked to child sex abuse and forged passports .
The Met Police believe criminals used the centres in Park Lane , Hampstead and Edgware to store criminal assets .
Armed police continue to guard the buildings as specialist officers search the 7,000 safety deposit boxes .
So far only a third of the boxes have been opened and the finds have also included a firearm , counterfeit currency , several works of Renaissance art and a substantial amount of high value jewellery .
I am confident that this operation will have a damaging impact on organised crime in London and around the rest of the country
Commander Allan Gibson Speaking after the raids Commander Allan Gibson said : " Search teams have been working around the clock to open all the boxes at the location and are progressing well , although we are likely to remain at the locations for some time yet .
" This is a complex and unique investigation that will use all of the expertise within the economic crime command and the findings are within our expectations at this stage .
" I am confident that this operation will have a damaging impact on organised crime in London and around the rest of the country . "
Scotland Yard said that Met 's Specialist Crime Directorate raided seven properties in total on Monday 2 June as part of Operation Rize - three safe depositories , an office and three residential addresses .
Two people were arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences .

What are these ?
Scientists at UC San Diego , UC Santa Barbara and MIT have developed nanometer - sized “ nanoworms ” that can cruise through the bloodstream without significant interference from the body ’s immune defense system and — like tiny anti-cancer missiles — home in on tumors .
Their discovery , detailed in this week ’s issue of the journal Advanced Materials , is reminiscent of the 1966 science fiction movie , the Fantastic Voyage , in which a submarine is shrunken to microscopic dimensions , then injected into the bloodstream to remove a blood clot from a diplomat ’s brain .
Using nanoworms , doctors should eventually be able to target and reveal the location of developing tumors that are too small to detect by conventional methods .
Carrying payloads targeted to specific features on tumors , these microscopic vehicles could also one day provide the means to more effectively deliver toxic anti-cancer drugs to these tumors in high concentrations without negatively impacting other parts of the body .
“ Most nanoparticles are recognized by the body ’s protective mechanisms , which capture and remove them from the bloodstream within a few minutes , ” said Michael Sailor , a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego who headed the research team .
“ The reason these worms work so well is due to a combination of their shape and to a polymer coating on their surfaces that allows the nanoworms to evade these natural elimination processes .
As a result , our nanoworms can circulate in the body of a mouse for many hours . ”
“ When attached to drugs , these nanoworms could offer physicians the ability to increase the efficacy of drugs by allowing them to deliver them directly to the tumors , ” said Sangeeta Bhatia , a physician , bioengineer and a professor of Health Sciences and Technology at MIT who was part of the team .
“ They could decrease the side effects of toxic anti-cancer drugs by limiting their exposure of normal tissues and provide a better diagnosis of tumors and abnormal lymph nodes . ”
The scientists constructed their nanoworms from spherical iron oxide nanoparticles that join together , like segments of an earthworm , to produce tiny gummy worm - like structures about 30 nanometers long — or about 3 million times smaller than an earthworm .
Their iron - oxide composition allows the nanoworms to show up brightly in diagnostic devices , specifically the MRI , or magnetic resonance imaging , machines that are used to find tumors .
“ The iron oxide used in the nanoworms has a property of superparamagnetism , which makes them show up very brightly in MRI , ” said Sailor .
“ The magnetism of the individual iron oxide segments , typically eight per nanoworm , combine to provide a much larger signal than can be observed if the segments are separated .
This translates to a better ability to see smaller tumors , hopefully enabling physicians to make their diagnosis of cancer at earlier stages of development . ”
In addition to the polymer coating , which is derived from the biopolymer dextran , the scientists coated their nanoworms with a tumor - specific targeting molecule , a peptide called F3 , developed in the laboratory of Erkki Ruoslahti , a cell biologist and professor at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research at UC Santa Barbara .
This peptide allows the nanoworms to target and home in on tumors .
“ Because of its elongated shape , the nanoworm can carry many F3 molecules that can simultaneously bind to the tumor surface , ” said Sailor .
“ And this cooperative effect significantly improves the ability of the nanoworm to attach to a tumor . ”
The scientists were able to verify in their experiments that their nanoworms homed in on tumor sites by injecting them into the bloodstream of mice with tumors and following the aggregation of the nanoworms on the tumors .
They found that the nanoworms , unlike the spherical nanoparticles of similar size that were shuttled out of the blood by the immune system , remained in the bloodstream for hours .
“ This is an important property because the longer these nanoworms can stay in the bloodstream , the more chances they have to hit their targets , the tumors , ” said Ji-Ho Park , a UC San Diego graduate student in materials science and engineering working in Sailor ’s laboratory .
Park was the motivating force behind the discovery when he found by accident that the gummy worm aggregates of nanoparticles stayed for hours in the bloodstream despite their relatively large size .
While it ’s not clear yet to the researchers why , Park notes that “ the nanoworm ’s flexibly moving , one dimensional structure may be one the reasons for its long life in the bloodstream . ”
The researchers are now working on developing ways to attach drugs to the nanoworms and chemically treating their exteriors with specific chemical “ zip codes , ” that will allow them to be delivered to specific tumors , organs and other sites in the body .
“ We are now using nanoworms to construct the next generation of smart tumor - targeting nanodevices , ” said Ruoslahti .
We hope that these devices will improve the diagnostic imaging of cancer and allow pinpoint targeting of treatments into cancerous tumors . ”
Other researchers involved in the development were Michael Schwartz of UC San Diego , Geoffrey von Maltzahn of MIT , and Lianglin Zhang of UC Santa Barbara .
The project was funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health .

A few weeks ago , we posted an item about an ad executive in Australia named James Hurman who auctioned off his smoking habit , agreeing to pay a steep fine ( about $ 800 ) for every cigarette he smoked after the auction closed .
He wound up selling the contract , he writes , “ for NZ $ 300 [ about US $ 240 ] to somebody at the agency where I work — someone close enough to know if I owe them ! ”
Hurman had tried to quit smoking many times but was particularly keen in this case because he and his wife were expecting their first child .
Here ’s a follow up note from Hurman about some interesting behavior modification that took hold once the auction was over .
While Hurman represents a sample set of just 1 , his story may well be instructive for the billions of us who routinely struggle to change our own behaviors .
Hi Stephen ,
I wanted to write you and let you know how my campaign went …
I think perhaps you ’ll be interested in what ’s happened since .
Obviously the idea was to give myself such a great disincentive that I ’d be able to overcome the cravings and choose not to smoke cigarettes .
I ’ve quit many times in the past and found it difficult , exhibiting each time the usual symptoms of annoyingly persistent cravings and irritability , my resolve breaking pretty easily around alcohol and late nights .
This time , however , the symptoms did n’t arrive .
The first week , when I would usually be highly irritable , I was completely unperturbed .
The cravings , albeit there , were minor .
The first month went by unusually smoothly .
Then on the 2nd of May I had a night out that I ’d been worried about — I work in advertising and we had our industry awards night which is a huge blind - drunk - and - out - til - six - in - the - morning style affair .
In terms of risk , this was high .
I was kind of sure I ’d either falter or have a massive internal struggle keeping my drunk self in check .
When I came to the next day I realized I had n’t been even slightly tempted .
I was out all night with smokers and as inebriated as I ’ve ever been , but I had n’t had to talk myself out of having a cigarette once .
The cravings simply were n’t there — which breaks with my past experiences of quitting .
Subsequently , the past two weeks I ’ve had two similar nights out ( I ’ve a baby on the way and I ’m getting it out of my system ! ) and the same thing ’s happened — been absolutely tanked and hanging around smokers but have n’t been the slightest bit tempted .
Same goes for during the day when I ’m sober .
Thinking about it I wonder whether the scale of the disincentive has had a deeper psychological effect than simply giving me a reason to resist the cravings — it ’s actually removed the cravings themselves .
Which , as I understand it , is possible given that the actual physical dependency only lasts a few days , and then the cravings are purely an act of the mind .
Could it be that the cravings only manifest in a context in which the mind considers it not - immediately - detrimental to smoke ?
Could it be that when you introduce immediate danger , the mind , instead of bothering to consciously rationalize its way around the craving , just extinguishes the craving ?
The other answer would be that I ’m so desperate for my idea to work that I ’m talking myself into it !
IS IT really over ?
In the middle of March investors were worried that the financial system was going to hell in a handcart .
Analysts competed to produce the highest possible forecast for losses from the credit crunch .
Just six weeks later , everything seems a lot calmer .
Stockmarkets have stabilised and corporate credit spreads ( the excess interest rates paid by risky borrowers ) have come down sharply .
Gold is cheaper .
Bankers talk about having put the worst behind them .
This week the Bank of England 's twice - yearly Financial Stability Report was cautiously optimistic ( see article ) and America 's Federal Reserve was relaxed enough to cut the pace of its monetary easing ( see article ) .
Rates may even have reached the bottom .
Optimists can point to one big relief .
When the Fed helped JPMorgan Chase to rescue Bear Stearns , it sent a signal to the markets — a kind of “ No Bank Left Behind ” Act .
If the Fed was willing to save an investment bank , without any retail depositors , then the system would not be brought down by a “ plumbing problem ” , such as the collapse of a counterparty in the derivatives market .
The boost to confidence has helped banks to repair their balance sheets by raising large sums from both shareholders and the bond markets .
Maybe financial Armageddon had been avoided .
A sea of troubles
Maybe .
But the fight ahead still looks bloody .
Although the system as a whole is safer , plenty of problems remain for particular banks .
In the money markets , the banks are still having to pay a high margin over official rates to borrow short - term money , despite the ingenious efforts of the Bank of England , European Central Bank and America 's Fed .
Investors are still worried that banks could get into trouble .
There is probably more troubling news to come on write - offs ; declared losses so far are well short of the $ 945 billion that the IMF estimated were the global losses from the crisis , much of it outside the banking system .
The malaise that started the crisis — the American housing market — is still getting worse .
The month - on - month decline in the Case - Shiller index of house prices in 20 large cities is accelerating ; on the latest reckoning , it was down by 12.7 % over the 12 months to February 29th .
As the decline continues , more homeowners will default on their loans .
And losses are now emerging in areas other than housing .
After a long period with scarcely any bond defaults by companies , there have been 21 failures this year , according to Standard & Poor 's , a rating agency ; some 122 issuers , with debt of around $ 102 billion , are deemed vulnerable to default .
Ominously , corporate debt is the shaky foundation for trillions of dollars of derivative contracts .
Consumers round the world are grappling with higher food and fuel prices .
British house prices are now showing annual declines .
Europe 's economies seem to be deteriorating .
In April the Belgian business confidence indicator , a good gauge of the continent 's conditions , suffered the biggest decline in its 28 - year history .
Commercial property looks vulnerable , as do some emerging markets , especially in central and eastern Europe .
And things are shaky in Japan , where industrial production declined more than 3 % in the latest month .
Imagine that you had fallen asleep last July and that you had been spared the dread words “ credit crunch ” and “ Bear Stearns ” .
On waking today , you would be astonished at how low American interest rates had fallen ( especially in the light of headline inflation ) .
But you would still be alarmed at the state of housing markets , the prospects for consumer spending and the trend in forecasts of economic growth .
You would not assume that the worst was over .
Nor should investors , just because they have had to live through it all .
Reports from the Dutch media are hinting that Arsenal striker Robin van Persie may be left out of the coach Marco van Basten ’s squad for UEFA ’s Euro 2008 .
The forward continues to be sidetracked by leg problems that basically derailed his entire Premiership season .
He was only able to train lightly because of a sore thigh and van Basten insists that only players who are fully fit will be named to his Euro squad which is due in one week .
Light running apart from the team commanded the majority of van Persie ’s day .
Group C includes World Cup champions
Italy , always dangerous France , a strong Romanian side , and the Netherlands .
The squad kicks off its run through the Group of Death against Italy on June 9th in Berne .

BRUSSELS , May 23 ( Reuters ) - The European Union is preparing sanctions against Iran ’s biggest bank but wants to see how Tehran responds to a new offer by major powers on its nuclear programme before acting , diplomats said on Friday .
An EU diplomat said the 27 - nation bloc was making legal and technical preparations for an asset and funds freeze on state - owned Bank Melli -- a measure long sought by the United States to raise pressure on Iran to halt uranium enrichment .
But a source in the EU ’s Slovenian presidency said Brussels would await an Iranian response to an updated offer of political and economic incentives , due to be delivered to Tehran soon by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , before ministers decide to approve the sanctions .
The West suspects Iran of seeking the ability to make nuclear weapons while the oil - producing Islamic Republic insists its secretive programme is purely aimed at generating energy .
The U.N. Security Council passed a third sanctions resolution against Iran last month and Washington has been pressing the Europeans to deny targeted Iranian banks access to the international financial system .
At the same time , the United States , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany have agreed in principle to send a renewed offer of cooperation in areas ranging from civilian nuclear energy to aviation , trade , the fight against drug smuggling and security if Tehran complies with U.N. demands .
U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey , who has been leading the banking sanctions drive , said last month the world ’s top banks have already largely stopped dealing with Iran .

According to GoNintendo , the latest issue of Nintendo Power reveals the proud return of the Castlevania series to consoles .
Castlevania Judgment is , believe it or not , a 3D fighter , pitting classic characters from throughout the series against each other in mortal combat .
Yes , not at all the exact opposite of what Castlevania fans have been asking for .

GoNintendo's report from the mag hints at appearances from characters like Simon Belmont and Alucard , the use of sub - weapons like holy water and boomerangs , and ( surprise ! ) motion controls .
Odd , yes , but while Konami may not be known for its fighting games — outside of Yie Ar Kung Fu — it had dabbled in 3D fighters when they were in their heyday .
It was also responsible for one - third of the line - up Dream Mix TV World Fighters , a Japan - only fighting game that featured Simon Belmont and Solid Snake and was terrible .

DIMSDRIVE recently published the results of a survey into what people get up to in the bathroom .
They interviewed 6,436 people from their internet monitor group by means of a private internet - based poll .
41.3 % of the sample was male and by age 1.0 % were in their teens , 17.2 % in their twenties , 37.1 % in their thirties , 27.4 % in their forties , 12.7 % in their fifties , and 4.6 % aged sixty or older .
This is a subject where I ’ve previously translated another survey , so it might be useful as a cross-reference .
There are lots of interesting figures here that back up various preconceptions that I think many of us have about the Japanese love of bathing .
I used to just have a quick shower or bath once or twice a week before I married , but I ’ve been coerced into washing every day , and now quite miss a bath if for some reason I can’t have one , such as when on holiday .
However , I only usually just jump into the tub for a minute or less to warm myself up just before bed time , with the majority of the bathroom time spent under the shower .
Q1 : About how often do you take a bath , including shower only ?
( Sample size = 6,436 )
Almost every day 85.3 %
Four or five times a week 9.6 %
Two or three times a week 4.4 %
Once a week 0.3 % Less than that 0.3 % Never 0.1 %
Note that if no bath at home , going to a local bathhouse is counted instead .
By age , the seven non -bathers were perhaps three men in their twenties and three in their thirties and just one over sixty .
Younger people were more likely to bath every day , with women slightly more than men .
Q2 : When do you most often take a bath ?
( Sample size =6,429 ) Morning only 6.7 % Daytime only 0.9 % Evening only 73.7 % Morning and evening , or more often 7.9 % Other 1.1 %
No particular fixed time 9.7 %
Younger people were slightly more likely to bath or shower in the morning .
People living alone were almost thrice as likely to wash in the morning , and twice as likely to wash either twice or more per day or at no particular time ; conversely those living with others were half as likely again to wash in the evenings , perhaps due to the Japanese custom of sharing the bath water .
Q3 : Where do you most often start washing from ?
( Sample size =6,429 ) Head or hair 47.2 % Face 18.8 % Arms 13.6 % Neck 8.4 % Legs or feet or toes 3.0 % Hands or fingers 2.9 % Bottom 2.1 % Chest 1.4 % Shoulders 1.0 % Stomach 0.7 % Back 0.2 % Other 0.7 % Women were amost two and a half times more likely to start with their face , presumably related to removing make - up .
Q4 : What do you use to wash your body ?
( Sample size =6,429 ) Nylon towel 46.2 % Cotton towel 22.3 %
Wash towel or glove 11.7 % Body sponge 8.7 % Other towel 7.1 % Net - like sponge 6.7 % Body brush 5.0 % Loofah 1.0 %
Other type of sponge 0.5 % Scrubbing brush 0.4 % Other 2.3 %
Do n’t use anything 7.8 % Q5A : How long do you spend in the bathroom ( not just bath tub ) in summer ?
( Sample size =6,429 ) All Men

More than two hours 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Q5B :
How long do you spend in the bathroom ( not just bath tub ) in winter ?
( Sample size =6,429 ) All Men
N=2,655 Women

More than two hours 0.1 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Q6 : Apart from washing , what do you do in the shower or bath ?
( Sample size =6,429 , multiple answer )
Think about things 36.0 % Shave 33.8 % Brush teeth 24.4 %
Wash the bathroom 22.9 % Massage , stretch , exercise 17.1 % Play with children 16.1 % Read a book or magazine 10.2 % Sing 9.5 % Sleep 4.7 % Listen to the radio 3.5 % Listen to music 3.3 % Drink 3.2 % Watch television 2.6 % Do aromatherapy 2.4 %
Talk on telephone or send mail 1.0 % Eat 0.5 % Other 1.9 %

An obvious , common sense
question that no one will answer

Michael Moore , the maker of " Sicko " and " Fahrenheit 911 , " has been widely criticized for his apparent lack of interest in examining the details of the 9/11 cover story .
This may have been the case in the past , but things have clearly changed .
In this short video , Moore asks an obvious common sense question that no one seems to be able to answer :
" Why ca n't we see the Pentagon videos from 9/11 ? "
The Pentagon is surrounded by dozens of video security cameras and yet except for one useless clip , none of this footage has ever been released .
Why not ?
What struck the Pentagon on 9/11 ?
Whatever it was it failed to leave the wreckage of an airliner .

Old Obama , New Obama
Ralph Nader stands for shifting the power from the big corporations back to the people .
Period .
Full stop .
End of story .
Contrast that with Senator Obama .
The old Obama said that he thought NAFTA was a " big mistake . "
The new Obama is n’t so sure .
The old Obama said he would abide by public spending limits in this election .
The new Obama says he wo n’t .
The old Obama said he was for a change in foreign policy and surrounded himself with innovative thinkers with a chance to make a difference .
The new Obama has surrounded himself with veterans of the military industrial complex status quo .
The old Obama talked economic populism .
The new Obama talks corporate - speak and surrounds himself with economists from the Chicago School .
You know where Nader and Gonzalez stand on corporate power .
And that is n’t changing .
We ’re at six percent nationwide in the most recent CNN poll .
We ’re going to be on ten state ballots by the end of June .
And we ’re shooting for 40 by the end of the summer .
Together , we are moving forward .
And together , we will make a difference in November .
Onward .

Art is deathless , the poets say .
Unless it is n’t .
One of the strangest exhibits at the opening of “ Design and the Elastic Mind , ” the very strange show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that explores the territory where design meets science , was a teeny coat made out of living mouse stem cells .
The “ victimless leather ” was kept alive in an incubator with nutrients , unsettlingly alive .
Until recently , that is .
Image Credit ... Ionat Zurrs
Paola Antonelli , a senior curator at the museum , had to kill the coat .
“ It was growing too much , ” she said in an interview from a conference in Belgrade .
The cells were multiplying so fast that the incubator was beginning to clog .
Also , a sleeve was falling off .
So after checking with the coat ’s creators , a group known as SymbioticA , at the School of Anatomy & Human Biology at the University of Western Australia in Perth , she had the nutrients to the cells stopped .
Though she has said “ I felt cruel when I turned it off , ” Ms. Antonelli said in the more recent interview that it was , essentially , a simple decision tinged with a bit of regret .
“ It was the only piece in the show that was alive , ” she said .
“ It really was an amazing piece . ”
ROVE McMANUS , Rove The Simpsons have influenced a lot of my comedy friends .
There 's an episode , a Cape Fear parody , where Sideshow Bob gets hit in the face with about 20 rakes and it takes a good minute and a half for him to go through them all , which , in television terms , is a very long time for a joke , and it 's a perfect comedy moment .
It 's now a yardstick for comedians when we talk about how you can keep going with a joke in that same way .
We call it The Sideshow Bob Rake Idea .
And when , if a joke falls flat , rather than just stop and move on , you keep going and reference the fact that the joke did n't work and all you 're doing is making it worse for yourself , we use the phrase , " How will I get out of this hole ?
I 'll dig my way out " .
That 's a Simpsons line .
What I like most about The Simpsons is that it's a comedy first and a cartoon second .
You hear about shows that are going to " be the next Simpsons " but it 's a kid 's show .
The Simpsons was never meant for kids .
Most of the laughs come from Homer .
He 's just so stupid .
I love the arguments he has with his brain where his brain just walks out on him - you hear his brain actually walk out and shut the door .
It 's those little moments that we can relate to .
We 've all probably had a Homer moment at some point .
There 's only a finite amount of plot lines but they still come up with good ones and it's not just about The Simpsons family now .
It 's not just the crazy little professor guy any more , everybody knows his name 's John Frink .
Even principal Skinner 's got a backstory through his time in Vietnam and his problems with his mother and how he 's getting it on with Mrs Krabappel , and so from that you can have an entire episode that does n't even involve the core family .
That 's why the series has managed to last this long and will probably last for a long time into the future .
When I was in Los Angeles , I had the chance to sit down at a Simpsons table read , and you really see where the success of the series comes from .
They read it as live , they do n't stop .
They get a crowd of people in and as they get a laugh they write a note .
I do n't know how many shows would do that .
Most people just put it to air and hope for the best .
ED KAVALEE , Nova FM
The pace of the comedy is so quick .
There are so many jokes per show .
I watch a lot of old sitcoms and they would have one long shot of a scene that might go six or seven minutes with four or five punchlines .
The Simpsons is just joke after joke .
But at the same time the characters are so clear .
Characters they came up with 20 seasons ago , like Mo the bartender , are so wonderfully fleshed out now .
I remember about five years ago they released a genealogy of all the different characters and how they link to each other and you forget so much .
In a little town with 30 - odd characters they 've just created so many different things .
I think I was 10 when I started watching and I remember the big divide was between those who thought it was funny and those who thought it was stupid , and thought that Bart was dumb and not very cool .
And then about four seasons in they switched the focus to Homer .
You watch the episodes back , and I saw one the other day that Adam West was in - and I 've only recently gotten into the Batman television series - and it's like the more things you know about , especially pop culture wise , the more jokes you can get from The Simpsons , which is why you can watch the episodes over and over again .
It 's been a while since there 's been a really classic episode like " Monorail " , but it 's impossible to watch an episode of The Simpsons , even now , where you do n't get three or four really good laughs .
You forget how much it 's influenced people , when it first started people would say " D'oh " and you 'd prick your ears up and go " that 's from The Simpsons " .
Now it 's just part of the common lexicon .
JO STANLEY , Fox FM
My favourite thing about The Simpsons is that they are masters at sugar - coating some very clever , pointed social comments .
Not just about America , which I think is pretty risky at times , but also about their own network .
So they are fearless and that inspires me .
Obviously they have the power to be fearless but I think they were always like that .
So they were always true to their own belief system and their own ethics .
And also being clever and satirical is as funny as being completely pointless and silly just for the sake of it .
Probably my favourite joke ever on The Simpsons is when they are watching television and the commentator character says , " and now we cross to a man who has had the hiccups for 25 years " .
And he goes , " Hic ! Kill me .
Hic !
Kill me .
Hic !
Kill me . . . "
Those sort of incidental jokes that they slot in there - in between the plot points and the things that are moving the show along - are just so clever .
It 's taught me that you can never work too hard and you can never put too many jokes into something .
It 's so amazing that it has n't lost its relevance or its sharpness , it 's still as relevant as it has ever been .
ADAM ELLIOT , animator The Simpsons have had an impact on so much of Western popular culture , it 's hard to explain how they 've directly influenced my own work .
The fact that the show has always been pitched to adults first , then children , has paved the way for filmmakers like myself who want to tackle serious subject matter in animation .
While The Simpsons are very cartoony in their look , they are very seriously adult in their content - and often really subversive - and for lots of us working in animation they have been absolute trailblazers .
GEORGE McENCROE , Mix 101.1
When The Simpsons first came out we would gather at a friend 's house and watch it every Sunday night .
I still love it .
I watch it with the kids .
I think Family Guy has taken that whole genre to an even darker , more stomach - churning place , but without The Simpsons you would n't have Family Guy .
That sort of satire for the masses was a big step and I loved that they could say so many powerful things in such a deliciously warm and funny and unintimidating way .
It showed that you can deliver a good blow with humour rather than taking to the soapbox .
You can address homophobia and racism , you can address all sorts of really important things in a way that 's tongue - in - cheek .
They came at the big issues from the side and made people laugh at themselves .
And they showed the all - American family being so dysfunctional and yet likeable .
It really made you like Americans for the first time , it was like , " Yes , you understand sarcasm and satire and being irreverent and the importance of that " .
It felt so outrageous that it was being done in America .
There is still a naive joy about The Simpsons , which is hard to beat .
ADAM ZWAR , Wilfred
You can't really create anything new in comedy because The Simpsons have already done it .
I do n't know how they continue to keep it so groundbreaking .
Every year the standard is maintained .
How many comedy shows do you see that in ?
It has influenced me in how free the writers are .
Whether you can be that free because you 're doing animation I 'm not sure , but either way they just take such risks , continually .
If you look at Ricky Gervais ' episode of The Simpsons you just realise how great they are .
They 've got one of the great comic geniuses writing an episode and I reckon it does n't quite stack up when put against the average middle - range episode .
I identify with Homer , totally .
He 's the great innocent and his desires in life are the most base desires of every man .
You kind of forgive yourself for being a man when you watch Homer .
And Marge is beautiful , is n't she ?
I wonder if there 's a correlation between Marge and Larry David 's wife ( Cheryl Hines ) in Curb Your Enthusiasm .
Just like Homer , Larry David 's a really difficult man to live with but he's also got this incredibly understanding wife who puts up with him and she 's so kind and on certain days she can be a little bit sexy as well .
ROBYN BUTLER , The Librarians Through osmosis , The Simpsons have bled into everybody 's style of humour because it's that short , snappy , satirical way of writing .
Because it has been there for 20 years it 's informed everybody who 's gone on to write comedy , even in general sitcom terms .
I was addicted to it as a younger person .
I was living in a share house then and it was the new thing that we all sat around to watch .
It was a big deal because it was really subversive at the time .
They got away with saying anything .
Now my children are addicted to it .
They sit and watch it and I cook dinner and I laugh at different things to what they laugh at .
And it 's still firing and being funny and satirical , and after 20 years that 's pretty impressive .
Marge is my favourite .
She 's Homer 's moral compass and yet sometimes she can slide off her own moral compass and she can be a little trashy herself .
Unlike Lisa , she is n't always steadfastly morally upright , and I admire both those things .
I also admire her unending love for that big , fat , balding slob .
Homer kind of makes me want to drink beer .
Because he is so completely fallible , and he 's the one we all identify with .
ADAM ROZENBACH , Spicks and Specks
It was funny how you just thought it was great and then two years later when you saw an earlier episode you realised how much the characters were different , how different everyone looked and you just could n't go back to the old ones .
Once it had evolved it was hilarious .
The Simpsons set the tone for Shrek and all those other movies and shows that had jokes that were for adults but were for kids .
All those undertones just go over kids ' heads but they could watch it and laugh while Homer fell over or if Bart was a naughty kid .
I most identify with Krusty the Klown .
I love the way he 's just trotting it out , he 's given up .
I can relate .
I think the show has lost the depths of the storylines .
It does n't push the boundaries as much any more .
Homer seems to be a lot more stupid than he was and it seems Lisa is more righteous than ever .
But the new generation is getting on board and I guess if you 're a parent and you 've got 12 - year - old kids you probably want them watching The Simpsons rather than Family Guy or American Dad , which are definitely adult shows .
REBEL WILSON , The Wedge I was about 11 when I first saw The Simpsons .
I had a cassette tape with the song
Do the Bartman on it , and this other song called Deep Deep Trouble and it was like a Bart Simpson rap .
I changed some of the words to make it about me and I performed it in a talent quest in Sydney .
I got highly commended but some seven - year - old ballet girl won .
I really liked the musical elements of The Simpsons - occasionally they 'd break out into into these production numbers , which were really funny and that 's what I do in my new show , a TV musical called Bogan Pride .
I saw The Simpsons movie , which I thought was good , but when you see stuff like Borat or shows on Australian TV like Chris Lilley 's show , the comedy 's a lot edgier .
I thought The Simpsons movie was a bit old - fashioned in that the jokes were very family - friendly .
It had that edge about 10 years ago but now it seems a bit tame .
But it 's still got good character comedy .
CHAS LICCIARDELLO ,
The Chaser The Simpsons has taught me that as long as you have a spoonful of sugar you can make intelligent , serious points on TV .
I have watched it since the early ' 90s , and I have always found it funny .
I 'm not a philosopher about it , I 'm not one of the university lecturers who can reel off the classical references , I just think that in a barren television landscape , I find The Simpsons a shining light .
I do n't think they 've reinvented the wheel or were revolutionary in any way in terms of writing , they are just very good at it .
There have been tight , clever , funny comedies before - they have just managed to do it for a long time .
DAVE HUGHES , comedian
I remember being really nervous in hotel rooms before doing stand - up comedy gigs and having The Simpsons on and being able to laugh .
It has helped me relax over the years .
I once got described in an Age review as Homer Simpson - like .
I took it as a compliment .
The show grew on me .
Initially I thought , " this is a really badly drawn cartoon " , but it did n't take long before I tuned into it .
There probably is n't a day that goes by where you do n't see at least two minutes of The Simpsons .
I do n't know where Channel Ten would be without them .
The Simpsons were certainly at the forefront of making it funny to be in a dysfunctional family .
Family Guy would never be here if not for The Simpsons .
I 've moved past The Simpsons and I watch Family Guy instead .
Obviously The Simpsons ' staying power is phenomenal , but at the moment I 'm in a non-Simpsons phase .
That 's not to say that you can't fall back in love with them .
PAULY FENECH , Pizza
One thing I love about The Simpsons is that it proved that you can have a whole city of characters that are funny and you do n't just have to have four characters with two guests .
The Simpsons proved my theory that you can parody anything in comedy , you can mix up the genres .
It showed me that if you have good comedy characters in an animation , people will believe that they 're real .
They 're just the Simpsons .
They 're in people 's psyches .
It 's like they 're real people we know in a parallel universe .
I 've had a soft spot for Mo the whole time .
He 's always got these weird things on the side , he 's always trying .
He 's the underdog that never comes through .
I think everybody identifies with Homer .
Marge reminds me of what happens to women when they get into a stable relationship - they focus on the cleaning and all the rest of it .
The best thing about The Simpsons is that they 've attacked everybody but somehow have managed to go from being a naughty show to being mainstream .
They 've been around so long they 're acceptable .
They 're crazy .
They 've got the hidden gay theme of Monty Burns and Smithers .
Normally , an American sitcom would n't go anywhere near that .

I finally got around to watching and listening to Bob Ippolito ‘s “ Exploring Erlang ” video , and I do n’t know of any more thorough hour - long introduction to the language than this one .
If you ’re interested in Erlang but are too busy or too lazy to read Joe Armstrong ’s great book or any of the many papers and articles that describe Erlang , then Bob ’s talk is for you .
A few interesting points for me :
In a few places Bob mentions that while he finds Erlang syntax unusual it ’s really no big deal , and you quickly get used to it .
I can verify that he ’s absolutely right .
A lot of people seem to get really hung up on this issue ; if you ’re one of them , all I can say is that your concerns are very greatly exaggerated .
Along the lines of the previous point , one of the questions Bob takes after his presentation is from a gentleman who says that his technical lead refuses to use Erlang — in a telephony application , no less — and that his tech lead rolled his own stuff for concurrency and interprocess communication .
Hmm , I wonder if that technical leader ’s initials are “ N.I.H . ”
It would be interesting to see how well his solution could hold up in the environments in which Erlang has already well proven itself .
Given all the attempts I ’ve seen over my career at solving such things , many of them made by people who mistakenly think it ’s not that difficult to get right , my guess is “ not that well . ”
Bob mentioned that he finds Erlang to be a very small and thus easily learnable language .
He ’s absolutely right about that , too ; I wish I could count the number of times I ’ve said the exact same thing in conversation , in presentations , and in writing .
Many people who come from Java or C++ or other general - purpose languages assume that languages need to be huge to be useful , so they assume that small languages must be toys , and they also assume any “ real ” language requires years to learn .
How incredibly wrong they are .
Bob keeps the whole discussion grounded by explaining how Erlang saves him and his team time and money .
In case it ’s not clear , he ’s talking about actual time and actual money .
He explains that he can serve millions of web requests per day from just a single machine ( though he naturally uses more than one for redundancy and reliability ) , for example , and by mentioning the small size of his team — I think he said 8 ? — he hints at the productivity that Erlang affords .
My experiences are , again , quite similar .
Coincidentally I also watched Jim Weirich‘s “ Shaving with Occam ” presentation from the MountainWest RubyConf 2008 held at the end of March , and was pleasantly surprised to find that he devoted a good portion of his talk to Erlang .
He mentioned how it was like Lisp in the sense that it has a small core , simple rules for manipulating that core , and powerful abstractions for building new things from the simple rules and small core .
Yet , I should n’t be surprised .
I do n’t know Jim at all , but judging from the dates he mentions in his talk I think his career spans around 30 years .
It ’s also pretty clear that he ’s had broad and deep experience with many technologies during that time .
From what I ’ve seen , people like Jim who have an incredibly deep first - hand understanding of the utility and importance of simplicity , brevity , and powerful abstractions in software development seem to have no problem whatsoever quickly seeing and comprehending the immense value of Erlang .
You ’re still not exploring Erlang ?
What are you waiting for ?

She opposed making it easier to bring criminal prosecutions of companies that knowingly sell defective products and also criticized a measure that would make it easier for the commission to publicly disclose reports of faulty products .
While manufacturers had agreed on another provision that would give independent company laboratories the authority to test products and certify their safety , Ms. Nord said she objected to the provision and preferred that the legislation give the commission the authority to defer to the work of the laboratories , should it choose to .
Some of Ms. Nord ’s complaints were similar to the ones that business groups and manufacturers have raised , including that the legislation would be unnecessarily burdensome .
But in other areas , such as whistleblower protection for company employees , her complaints went beyond those of industry .
While companies generally have not objected to giving protection to whistleblowers in the industries regulated by the commission , for example , she said it would “ dramatically drain the limited resources of the commission , to the direct detriment of public safety . ”
While Ms. Nord said she supports the committee ’s efforts in general , she issued a more modest proposal than the one under consideration in the Senate .
It would , among other things , increase the maximum amount of civil penalties to $ 10 million , create incentives for companies to quickly halt sales of recalled products , and give the government the authority to seize assets of a company found to have violated criminal safety laws .
Senator Pryor said Ms. Nord ’s objections to the measure surprised him .
“ It ’s hard for me to know if it ’s just ideological or she is just expressing the wishes of the administration , ” Mr. Pryor said .
“ Either way it comes to the same conclusion and that is that they say they want more resources , but they are very reluctant to accept those resources . ”
Consumer advocates also said they were stunned by Ms. Nord ’s letter .
“ It was remarkable to send a letter like that to a committee , when you ’re in dire straits and you need increased funding and you ’ve acknowledged that , ” said Ellen Bloom , director of federal policy at Consumers Union .

Thai Fine Art student and artist Kittiwat Unarrom is the son of a baker .
All that baking exposure growing up has been a clear influence , but his artistic need to see things a little differently definitely flared up as he created the tacitly named “ Body Bakery ” – brutally , gruesomely , almost unbelievably realistic looking sculptures of dismembered human body parts sculpted entirely from bread .
Here ’s the real kicker – they ’re packaged like food and up for sale at his showroom / gallery / exhibition / bakery / torture - chamber / oddity / tourist attraction in Ratchaburi , Thailand .
Check out the video below to see the packaged goods and some footage of Unarrom at work :
I ’m vacillating between being incredibly impressed at his ( disturbingly authentic ) sculptural skills and a desire to vomit .
I ’ve seen some hyper - realistic sculpture before , but , at the risk of becoming completely inarticulate … these really , really , really look like heads .
Unarrom himself is almost charmingly candid about his art …
“ Of course , people were shocked and thought that I was mad when they saw the works .
But once they knew the idea behind it , they understood and became interested in the work itself , instead of thinking that I am crazy . ”
Inspired and informed by anatomy books and visits to forensic museums , he makes sure that none of your various body part bread desires go unfulfilled : he also makes feet , hands , and internal organs which come displayed impaled on hooks .
Made from dough , raisins , cashew nuts , and chocolate , all of the works on display are totally edible .
( insert cannibalism joke here . ) ( insert “ eat me ” joke here . ) ( insert “ put your foot where your mouth is ” joke here . )
“ When people see the bread , they do n’t want to eat it .
But when they taste it , it ’s just normal bread .
The lesson is ‘ do n’t judge just by outer appearances . ”
Right .
That ’s the lesson …

The computers cost almost $ 800 , while the average wage is under $ 20
The first legalised home computers have gone on sale in Cuba , but a ban remains on internet access .
This is the latest in a series of restrictions on daily life which President Raul Castro has lifted in recent weeks .
Crowds formed at the Carlos III shopping centre in Havana , though most had come just to look .
The desktop computers cost almost $ 800 ( £ 400 ) , in a country where the average wage is under $ 20 ( £ 10 ) a month .
But some Cubans do have access to extra income , much of it from money sent by relatives living abroad .
Since taking over the presidency in February , Raul Castro has ended a range of restrictions and allowed Cubans access to previously banned consumer goods .
In recent weeks thousands of Cubans have snapped up mobile phones and DVD players .
But only now have the first computer stocks arrived .
Internet access remains restricted to certain workplaces , schools and universities on the island .
The government says it is unable to connect to the giant undersea fibre - optic cables because of the US trade embargo .
All online connections today are via satellite which has limited bandwidth and is expensive to use .
Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , Cuba 's ally and a critic of the US , is laying a new cable under the Caribbean .
It remains unclear whether , once the connection is completed , the authorities will then allow unrestricted access to the world wide web .
It 's time to retire the NSFW acronym and associated phrases .
I 've simply seen far too many electrons sacrificed in long , pointless arguments about what " not safe for work " means .
Whose work ?
Are you bleaching the hot tubs at Playboy Mansion or arranging candlelight vigils for Citizens Against Potty Mouths ?
Are you European ?
To hear some Europeans tell the story , everyone over there watches hard - core porn and smokes hashish between staff meetings where they discuss where to find the best porn and hashish .

Most people end up taking one of two stances , each filling in important words .
First , there are those who read the classic warning as " not safe for ( my ) work . "
These people are touchy .
They 're the first to dive into the comments and sear off your eyebrows for not realizing that some people have jobs where the boss does not look kindly on the word jockstrap .
In fact , as far as I can tell , these people have such strict work policies that the only web activity they 're allowed to do on company time is complain about improper blog post labeling .
Most people , however , read NSFW as " not safe for ( the platonic ideal of ) work . "
Apparently there 's this archetypal concept of a workplace that exists in the universal consciousness , and you should consult the great mother mind before putting anything on the web .
Of course , not everyone is hooked into the same plane of hyper - awareness , and thus you get arguments .
For instance : bikinis ?
Are photos of women in bikinis safe for work ?
What about one - piece bathing suits ?
Tight pants ?
I 've seen someone argue that a cartoon of a fully - clothed wolf - lady in a turtleneck sweater and slacks was just too steamily erotic to be work - safe .
( I do n't know where the arguer worked , but I hope it was n't the Disney Store . )
And then there are those sad , twitchy souls who get hung up on the work - safety of URLs .
You could post a link to a recipe for baked chicken , but if the URL contained the word breasts , they'd be convinced they 're going to be shoved roughly out the backdoor of the building , to be unemployed forever as each new workplace hears of the unforgivable sin of that fateful day when you ruined their life .
Now , I know geekfolk love their acronyms and all , but I 'm tired of the whole stupid conflict .
Maybe , possibly , we could agree that the scope and depth of human reaction to matters biological can't be flattened into a binary designation as if stomping on a soda can ?
Hell , even the Motion Picture Association of America has five different categories for the relative acceptability of a movie , and its system is arbitrary and biased .
What makes us think we can get away with only work - safe and not work - safe ?
Here 's my cutting - edge solution :
How about if we actually describe things ?
This is n't semaphore , people .
Unless you routinely blog in the middle of a desperate escape from a burning building , you 've got plenty of time to say something like : " Warning : visual depiction of pert nipples and raspberry jam " or " Beware : contains pictures of Drew Barrymore in a business suit , eating ice cream and giving the camera that look " or " Cuidado : cloacas ! "
If we just added those extra few words , a few additional strikes of the keyboard , then everyone could make an informed , adult decision to look around real quick before clicking through , and people could stop complaining .
Except for those URL guys – they 're hopeless .

Born helpless , nude and unable to provide for himself , Lore Sjöberg eventually overcame these handicaps to insist that NSFW is pronounced " nossfaw . "

Never fear , though , John McCain is in no sense offering a third Bush term :
In an interview he gave to the Weekly Standard ’s Stephen Hayes in 2006 for Hayes ’s biography , “ Cheney : The Untold Story of America 's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President , ” McCain said : “ I will strongly assert to you that he has been of enormous help to this president of the United States . ”
Going further , McCain even told Hayes in comments heretofore unpublished that he ’d consider Cheney for an administration post .
Asked whether he’d be interested in Cheney had the vice president not already have served under Bush for two terms , McCain said : “ I do n’t know if I would want him as vice president .
He and I have the same strengths .
But to serve in other capacities ?
Hell , yeah . ”
McCain 's just a guy who wants to continue most of Bush 's policies and admires Bush 's key henchmen and wants to keep them serving in government office .
But that does n't mean he represents more of the same .
It 's just a different kind of change -- hell yeah !

Voter ID card Vs National ID card June 13 , 2007
Posted by bdoza in BANGLADESH Tags : National ID card
The other day ( 11.06.07 ) I was listening to a Live Program on ETV .
The guests were two Election Commissioner –one is Mr. Sohul Hussain and the other is Brig .
General ( Retd ) Shakhawat Hussain .
Few journalists were also allowed to ask question directly to them and there were provision for the public to ask questions directly to the guests .
The whole program was moderated by Samina Jaman , a well known media producer .
One interesting question which touched me is why Election Commission is thinking of preparing National ID card rather than Voter ID card for which they are dictated by the constitution .
The question was raised by more than one journalists and when mediator connected Justice Naimuddin ( once an election Commissioner ) he also put forward the same question to the guests .
The fact which came out is that the Election Commission is primarily working for voter list and Voter ID card but data that is collected by the process could be utilized to produce the national ID card .
Virtually they are preparing a database which in future will be taken up by the other ministries or other organizations and will be utilized to serve many other purposes .
So a national ID card would be produced as a bi-product of the database preparation for the election .
It is said that finger prints of the voters would be taken by ‘ bio - matrix ’ system and be shown along with the photo in the voter ID card .
This ID card will not only be used in casting votes but may be used in many other purposes - such as in opening bank accounts , in getting passports , in getting license from the trade bodies etc .
As the voter ID card is for the voters who are above the age of 18 years , so initiative will be taken in future by other organizations to complete the ID card for all .
We appreciate the idea .
Bangladesh is becoming more digital and more scientific .

Post script :
29 June 2007
Recently I have read an Interview of the Chairperson of ‘ Bela ’ , an NGO in Daily Prothom Alo where she told that EC should better prepare the Voter ID card , not the National ID .
She told that it wii not be possible to complete the National ID card by 18 months .
We khow that Experts with whom the EC has consultaed opined that the procedure for both National ID and Voter ID is almost same .
It willl take no Extra time and it is possible to complete the work within 18 months of time frame .
People with minimum knowledge on digital technology will not differ with the experts .
3 Dec 2007
Controversy over the Voter and National ID card gradually faded away .
Both EC and Government were committed to the decision and gradually different areas of the country are being covered by the ID card program .
After completion of the port city , Chittagong voter registration with photography is started at Dhaka .
Chief Election Commissioner is pleased with the progress of the work and hope to complete the task earlier than expected .
He also declared that EC will present an election this time that the nation will feel proud of .
The ordinary citizen also became listed as voter and he enjoyed the total process - the Registration worker ( school teacher ) came to the house and recored the data in a sheet , took the signature and took the impression of the fingers .
Then few days later , for photography he and his family had to go the camp equipped with laptop and camera .
The data were checked and picture was taken along with digital impression of fingers .
22 January 2008
Yesterday I was listening to an ‘ expert ’ in an interview who was talking against the recording of the fingerprints by biometrix system .
He argues that it is taking extra time to complete the process and finger prints may not be evident in many persons who work hard with their hands .
The ordinary citizen believes that even with the few lapses , fingerprints by the biometrix technology will help in many ways to prevent false voting , to identify criminals , to confirm one ’s identity in the matter of disputes , etc .
25 January 2008
Chief Election Commissioner Dr. Shamsul Huda Chowdhury was saying to the journalists that the voter list that they are preparing will be national database , the benefit of which will be felt when all the works will be completed .
26 January 2008
The Election Commission has floated the voter list in the web at http://www.voterlist.gov.bd for correction by the voters themselves by using their pin numbers .
Now the voter list of Dhaka has been given and time allowed for correction is 15 days .
The voter list of other areas will be displayed gradually .
18 Feb 2008
The EC has undertaken special drive o f10 days to include the elders , ill and disabled people in the voter list after completion of the normal voter listing in the Dhaka city , which will be gradually extended to the other areas .
A relative of a jaundice patient was rather excited when she saw the field personnels of the EC came to the hospital to list her relative in the voter list ( a TV channel ) .
EC also arranged to include the inmates of the jails to be listed in the voter list and it is decided that that voting camp will be stationed in the jails for the inmates .
Hope that EC would be careful not to include the inmates who could n’t be voter as per law .
They may be included in the national database .
4 Mach 2008
EC declared that they have crossed 50 % of the voter list by this time and they are 1 month ahead of the schedule .
The progress is hailed by the UN representative and others .
8 Mar 08
Government has taken initiative to form a ‘ National ID card Registration Body ’ , first of its kind in Bangladesh to instutionalise the Voter ID and National ID card initiative .
16 March 08
CEC hopes to publish the draft voter list by June 08 which is earlier than the declared roadmap .
After June , he hopes to declare the date of national election .
30 Mar 08
5.16 crore ( 51.6 m ) voters , 60 % of the total voters , have been registered , another 3 crore will be registered by the end of June 2008 , CEC hopes .
25 April 2008
‘ The ongoing Voter registration process is of international standard ’ says a survey funded by UK Department of International Department ( DFID )
‘ It is going to be a list of quality no less than that of America or England ’ said one of the consultant of the survey titled ‘ Monitoring voter listing process and focal group research ’
10 May 2008
One Election Commissionar said yesterday that the voter listing will be completed by June and in October they will able to declare the national election schedule .
20 May 2008
It ’s a great day for me .
Me and my family got the ID card today .
Over the card printed ‘ National ID Card ’ both in English and Bengali .
Then my name , my father ’s name and mother ’s name , my date of bith - no mistake and then at last my ID no .
In the opposite page , my address is written down and an authorised signature of EC and a date of delivery .
We have to colect it from a school , a make - shift centre for local EC .
But I expected it to be delivered at home .
3 June 2008
The Election Commission published full page ad on leading dailies with a big Bangadeshi map in the centre showing the progress of the voter listing in different areas of Bangladesh .
It shows that 7 crore of the voters are already listed which covers the 85 % of the total voters .
EC is expecting to complete the voter list by June and to publish the final complete voter list by October 2008 .
The Chief Adviser retaliated in a meeting with the business leaders that by December 2008 the election will definitely held .
26 June 2008
Daily Star reports ‘ whopping success for EC ’ , 8 crore voters already registered , electronic database ready .
5 July 2008
EC informed to contact the server rooms for any correction of Voter ID cards and who missed the earlier chances to enlist as voters .
8 July 2008
Bangladesh Election Commission has ubdated their website .
It is now nice and informative http://www.ecs.gov.bd/English/
9 July 2008
The voter listing is completed today with 8 crore 5 thousand enlisted as voters throughout the country .

A giant , crown - like Au36 ring aggregate with continuous metal - metal contacts ( see picture ; gold ( I ) centers are in ball and stick representation ) is formed by an Au( I ) - Au( I ) bonding interaction directed self - assembly .
( c ) Wiley - VCH 2008
Chinese researchers have recently made a “ golden crown ” with a diameter of only a few nanometers .
It is a large ring - shaped molecule containing 36 gold atoms .
The lords of the ring , a team of researchers from the Universities of Beijing , Hong Kong , and Nanjing report their unusual compound in the journal Angewandte Chemie : the molecular ring structure is held together exclusively by gold –gold bonds and is thus the largest ring system made of gold atoms produced to date .
Large molecular rings have fascinated chemists for over 40 years — ever since the discovery of crown ethers in 1967 .
The pioneers in this area , C. J. Pederson , J.-M. Lehn , and D. J. Cram received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery in 1987 .
In the meantime , large molecular ring systems have played an important role in the search for new functional materials and in nanotechnology .
The synthesis of ring systems held together exclusively by metal–metal bonds has remained a challenge .
Small rings made of positively charged gold atoms have been know for some time , but only recently could the Chinese team make a ring containing 16 gold atoms .
Now , the researchers , led by Shu - Yan Yu , Yi- Zhi Li , and Vivian Wing - Wah Yam , have introduced a new representative of this class of compounds , the biggest gold ring to date that is held together by means of gold –gold bonds : a ring system containing 36 univalent gold atoms .
The researchers started their synthesis with a ring system containing six gold atoms .
Three of the gold atoms are linked into a triangle .
Each of these gold atoms is attached to another gold atom that sticks out from the corner of the triangle .
Three organic ligands are then bound to this flat double triangle to form a molecule that resembles a three - blade propeller .
Six such “ propellers ” can be linked into a larger ring by means of a self - assembly process .
Within this ring system , the gold atoms are arranged into a shape that resembles a crown : six double triangles are each bound to each other by two corners .
The free double - corners point outward in a pattern that alternates above and below the plane of the ring .

FIFTY police swoop on boy , 12 , for taking £ 10 note hanging out of a cash machine
More than 50 police officers swarmed on a 12 - year - old boy accused of stealing a £ 10 note which was hanging out of a cashpoint .
The army of officers was called after a row broke out when a woman , 27 , accused Pascoe Petgrave of stealing the tenner from an HSBC bank machine in Thornton Heath , south London .
Pascoe Petgrave , 12 , is seen in the background , being arrested by several police officers in Thornton Heath , south London
Pascoe , who stands at just 4ft 7in , said he had been given his mum's bank card to withdraw money when he spotted the note - but the woman who had been nearby claimed it belonged to her .
Pascoe 's cousins - two women aged 21 and 28 - stepped in to stand up for him and a large crowd gathered before the trio were arrested on suspicion of theft .
The boy 's mother Maxine , a 38 - year - old nurse , who was called to the scene by the cousins , then watched in astonishment as her son was handcuffed and taken into police custody .
All three cousins have since been bailed while enquiries continue .
Maxine Petgrave at home with Pascoe
Mrs Petgrave said yesterday : ' He 's never been in any trouble before .
This was a horrific ordeal for my 12 - year - old boy , he was handcuffed and put into a headlock .
' When my house was burgled a year ago I wish they had sent just one of those officers .
How did a row over a £ 10 note hanging out of an ATM machine get to that point ? '
A Croydon police spokesman confirmed they were investigating an allegation of theft of £ 10 .
When asked why 50 officers had been present , she added : ' Police attended the scene and during the course of investigating the matter , a large crowd had gathered .
Elements of this crowd were hostile to police activity which resulted in a call for further assistance being made .
That was answered by other colleagues , who subsequently attended . '

Who Do You REALLY Want ?

FEBRUARY 2 , 2008
Weekend America gets a lot of letters about coverage of the campaign , and one complaint keeps coming up about media coverage in general : too much focus on the personalities , not enough on the issues .
So we decided to run a little experiment .
We 've taken the remaining candidates for president , given them pseudonyms , and summarized what they stand for .
Rollover the fake names to see the candidate behind the position .
I 'm Shirley Winslow ( McCain ) and I approve this message .
A vote for Shirley Winslow is a vote against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
I also support a mandatory cap - and - trade system to reduce carbon emissions as a means of fighting global warming .
I think there should be a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants including learning English and paying fines but I do support a fence on the Mexican border .
I have promised affordable health care for every American in a Winslow administration but I oppose a mandate to get there and I think we can do it without raising taxes .
Over in Iraq , I think we need more troops and I oppose a timeline for withdrawal .
When it comes to Iran , we should form an alliance with European countries to apply economic and diplomatic pressure .
No military action without congressional approval .
I 'm Shirley Winslow and thanks for your time .
I 'm Fred Frazier ( Obama ) and I approve this message .
I would abolish the Bush tax cuts for households earning more than $ 250,000 and use that money to fund health insurance for children .
Illegal immigrants should have a path to citizenship but it might include paying some fines and learning the English language .
I 've supported the construction of a fence along the Mexican border .
We need to get out of Iraq , something a Frazier administration would accomplish by withdrawing one or two brigades a month , finishing within 16 months .
I would n't rule out the use of force against Iran to stop them from obtaining nuclear weapons but I would be fine meeting directly with the president of Iran .
I'm Fred Frazier and I hope I 've earned your vote .
I 'm Vicki Hampton ( Huckabee ) and I approve this message .
We 've got to get rid of all federal income and payroll taxes and replace them with a 23 percent national sales tax on everything but education .
That will happen in a Hampton White House .
As far as health care goes , we can make it more affordable through tax credits and cost controls .
I think we need to move away from fossil fuels and into a culture that embraces alternative energy sources within ten years .
To tackle the immigration issue , I say give illegal immigrants 120 days to register and then go back to where they came from , after which they can apply to return .
I supported the idea of invading Iraq and I oppose a timetable for troops to return .
As for Iran , I favor direct diplomacy .
I 'm Vicki Hampton .
Thanks for listening .
I 'm Doris Franzi ( Romney ) and I approve this message .
I think corporations should have lower tax rates and taxes on unearned income for middle class families should be eliminated .
The Franzi administration will take that business friendly attitude into health care as well , favoring a free - market consumer - based system .
In our quest for greater energy independence , I support alternative fuels , including biodiesel and ethanol , as well as nuclear power and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
I do n't believe in giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship and I oppose a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
Oh , and I also support a constitutional amendment against gay marriage .
I 'm Doris Franzi and I 'll see you in Washington .
I 'm Phillip Gronko ( Clinton ) and I approve this message .
On the subject of immigration , I support illegal immigrants learning English as part of a path to citizenship .
But I also favor tougher penalties in a Gronko administration for those who hire illegal immigrants and I support the construction of a fence along the US - Mexican border .
I think everyone in America should be required to have health insurance even if it means that insurance is subsidized by the government .
On the subject of Iraq , a Gronko presidency would mean a phased withdrawal within my first 60 days in office with the goal of most troops being out by 2013 .
Meanwhile in Iran , I would engage in direct diplomacy .
I would n't rule out using force but I would get congressional approval first .
I support the death penalty and lobbied in favor of a bill that would expand the list of capital offenses .
I'm Phillip Gronko and thanks for your support .
I 'm Lou Crandall ( Ron Paul ) and I approve this message .
I think we should withdraw all troops from Iraq immediately and shut down Guantanamo Bay while we 're at it .
As for Iran , well , they have a right to nuclear weapons if they want them and the Crandall administration will engage in direct diplomacy .
Domestically , I think the economy can be improved by ending the war , balancing the budget , and getting rid of the income tax .
Illegal immigrants should not have a path to citizenship and I support the fence along the border .
I 'm firmly pro-life and also firmly opposed to the death penalty .
I 'm Lou Crandall .
Thanks for your support .
The mystery man behind the looting of a Bronx charity to finance the startup of liberal radio network Air America was arrested yesterday in Guam .
Evan Montvel - Cohen was picked up by border - patrol officers at Guam International Airport on an outstanding warrant from Hawaii .
He had been indicted there last month for money laundering and the theft of more than $ 60,000 from a Honolulu landscaping firm , prosecutors said .
“ We at DOI are not surprised to hear that Mr. Montvel - Cohen was arrested on theft and money - laundering charges , ” said Rose Gill Hearn , commissioner of the city ’s Department of Investigation , which probed the looting of the Gloria Wise Boys & Girls Club in Co-op City .
It was Montvel - Cohen who , as development director for Gloria Wise , convinced other club officials in 2003 and 2004 to give $ 875,000 of taxpayer money to the radio network where he was a top executive and co-founder .
He also received loans from the club of more than $ 45,000 that were never repaid .
Montvel - Cohen , 43 , was never charged here , but two other directors at Gloria Wise pleaded guilty to misappropriating $ 1.2 million , some of which was used for personal expenses for club officials , including cars and home renovations .
The $ 875,000 was repaid by Air America only after DOI launched a wide - ranging probe into the transfer of city and state funds meant to help children and the elderly in the northeast Bronx .
But DOI was never able to speak with Montvel - Cohen , who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself , Hearn said .
“ As DOI ’s 2006 report into fraud at the Gloria Wise Boys & Girls Club showed , he was indeed someone of interest to us because of his pivotal role in the transfer of hundreds of thousands of dollars of Gloria Wise funds to a start - up commercial radio station , ” she said .
DOI has no immediate plans to pursue Montvel - Cohen .
Jim Fulton , a spokesman for the Honolulu city prosecutor , said Montvel - Cohen ripped off the landscaping company by using the firm ’s credit cards to pay for $ 30,000 of hotel and travel expenses .
He ’s also charged with stealing another $ 30,000 – money he claimed he used to pay the company ’s state excise taxes , but pocketed instead .
Cohen , who returned to his native Guam after bolting from Hawaii , was returning from the Philippines when the outstanding warrant was discovered .
Fulton said Montvel - Cohen has returned to the broadcast business , working for Sorensen Media Group , owned by his pal Rex Sorensen , one of the original Air America founders .
Sorensen and Montvel - Cohen operate several TV and radio outlets in the Pacific Islands .

Individuals with conservative ideologies are happier than liberal - leaners , and new research pinpoints the reason : Conservatives rationalize social and economic inequalities .
Regardless of marital status , income or church attendance , right - wing individuals reported greater life satisfaction and well - being than left - wingers , the new study found .
Conservatives also scored highest on measures of rationalization , which gauge a person 's tendency to justify , or explain away , inequalities .
The rationalization measure included statements such as : " It is not really that big a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others , " and " This country would be better off if we worried less about how equal people are . " [ 7 Things That Will Make You Happy ]
To justify economic inequalities , a person could support the idea of meritocracy , in which people supposedly move up their economic status in society based on hard work and good performance .
In that way , one 's social class attainment , whether upper , middle or lower , would be perceived as totally fair and justified .
If your beliefs do n't justify gaps in status , you could be left frustrated and disheartened , according to the researchers , Jaime Napier and John Jost of New York University .
They conducted a U.S. - centric survey and a more internationally focused one to arrive at the findings .
" Our research suggests that inequality takes a greater psychological toll on liberals than on conservatives , " the researchers write in the June issue of the journal Psychological Science , " apparently because liberals lack ideological rationalizations that would help them frame inequality in a positive ( or at least neutral ) light . "
The results support and further explain a Pew Research Center survey from 2006 , in which 47 percent of conservative Republicans in the U.S. described themselves as " very happy , " while only 28 percent of liberal Democrats indicated such cheer .
The same rationalizing phenomena could apply to personal situations as well .
" There is no reason to think that the effects we have identified here are unique to economic forms of inequality , " the researchers write .
" Research suggests that highly egalitarian women are less happy in their marriages compared with their more traditional counterparts , apparently because they are more troubled by disparities in domestic labor . "
The current study was funded by the National Science Foundation .
How often do you let other people 's nonsense or things you can't control change your mood ?
Do you let traffic delays , poor service in a restaurant , an insensitive comment , or an interruption of your internet or cable service ruin your day ?
If this happens to you , as it often does to me , it means that you have too much " garbage " in your life .
You are letting the " clutter " , the " refuse " of day to day life distract you from what should be the focus of your efforts .
I have been doing some mental and emotional housekeeping , working on reducing my obsession with trivialities that are not worth my time and effort .
I have been paying a lot of attention to the amount of food I consume , weight and waist size has been the focus of my attention .
I 've recently learned that what I consume can not only impact my pants size , but my ability to put my pants on myself without the assistance of a team of trained professionals .
Yesterday I found an article on the AARP website : How Aging Changes The Brain that caught my attention .
It gave me hope , but it also is causing me to re-evaluate my diet .
In healthy people , the basic ways our brains learn probably do n't change much as we age — it 's just that learning may take a bit longer .
But when we learn something well , it tends to stick with us just as well as it did in younger years .
However there are often physical changes that take place in the brain as we age .
Specific changes vary greatly from one person to the next , and may include the following , depending on their medical and psychological history :
Brain mass shrinks
Outer surface thins
White matter decreases
Chemical messengers decrease
The brain is made up of 60 % fat .
Several types of fat are used in the make - up of the brain two of which our bodies are unable to produce .
If we do not take these fats in during our daily diets then our brain cannot work to its best .
The two fats , essential fatty acids ( called essential because the body cannot make them on its own ) are Omega 3 which is found in linseed or flax seed and oily fish with small amounts in white fish and almonds - and Omega 6 which is plentiful in evening primrose oil and sunflower seeds and sunflower seed oil .
These essential fats must come from the diet .
And they must come from the diet in a balanced ratio .
When the ratio of the essential fatty acids becomes imbalanced — that is , when the omega - 6s overwhelm the omega - 3s or vice versa — the body experiences inflammation which can result in serious chronic inflammatory conditions .
Consuming high quantities of omega - 6 puts the body at risk for some of today ’s most life - threatening conditions : heart disease , cancer , hypertension , diabetes , arthritis , and some autoimmune disorders .
Americans consume 11 - 30 times MORE omega - 6 fatty acids than omega - 3s — mostly in the form of vegetable oils ( corn , safflower , etc. ) that have been partially hydrogenated .
Unfortunately , these partially hydrogenated oils are all too often “ hidden ” in highly processed , packaged convenience foods like cookies , cakes , crackers , fried foods , fast foods , chips , granola bars , candy bars , and more .
Clearly , avoiding processed , convenience , and fast foods not only promotes better health , but it allows the body to get the most benefit from the heart - healthy omega - 3s .
Many people reach very old age and are still sharp as ever .
Genetics clearly plays a role in " successful aging , " but how we live our lives on a day - to - day basis is also critical .
To help your brain age well , you can :
Perform physical exercise ( especially aerobic exercise )
Engage in intellectually stimulating mental activity
Eat a healthy diet
Maintain social connections ( spending time with friends and family members , for example )
Learn to manage stress
Develop a positive attitude toward yourself and your world

But it is surely relevant to point out that the United States has an all - volunteer Army .
Alex wo n’t be drafted , and his mommy ca n’t enlist him .
He can decide when he ’s an adult whether he wants to serve .
And , of course , McCain supports the volunteer army .
All of this is pretty much par for the course in political advertising .
And I ’m of the latitudinarian school when it comes to campaign discourse ; politics is supposed to be rough and ready .
So , why , I wondered after first seeing the MoveOn ad , did I find it so ... creepy ?
I was having trouble putting my finger on just why until I came across a post by a mother of a soldier recently deployed in Iraq , at the Web site BlueStarChronicles.com .
Here ’s what the mother of an actual soldier has to say about the remarks of the mother of the prospective non-soldier in the ad :
“ Does that mean that she wants other people ’s sons to keep the wolves at bay so that her son can live a life of complete narcissism ?
What is it she thinks happens in the world ?
...
Someone has to stand between our society and danger .
If not my son , then who ?
If not little Alex then someone else will have to stand and deliver .
Someone ’s son , somewhere . ”
This is the sober truth .
Unless we enter a world without enemies and without war , we will need young men and women willing to risk their lives for our nation .
And we ’re not entering any such world .
We do , however , live in a free country with a volunteer army .
In the United States , individuals can choose to serve in the military or not .
The choice not to serve should carry no taint , nor should it be viewed with the least prejudice .
If Alex chooses to pursue other opportunities , he wo n’t be criticized by John McCain or anyone else .
But that ’s not at all the message of the MoveOn ad .
The MoveOn ad is unapologetic in its selfishness , and barely disguised in its disdain for those who have chosen to serve  and its contempt for those parents who might be proud of sons and daughters who are serving .
The ad boldly embraces a vision of a selfish and infantilized America , suggesting that military service and sacrifice are unnecessary and deplorable relics of the past .
And the sole responsibility of others .

mylo COM - 2の欠陥
昨 年7月1日の日記「アドレスバー百景 その1」で旧型myloにアドレスバーがない件について書いていた。今年、そのmyloに新型「COM-2」が発売されたというので、アドレスバーがどうなっているか確かめるため、3月に購入した。
3月某日、myloが家に届いた。箱を開けて取り出し電源を投入。Webブラウザを起動して早速アドレスバーを調べてみると、概ねPSPと同様の方式になっていた。あまり良い設計ではなく、がっかりした。
次に、SSL接続時のオレオレ証明書の警告はどのようになっているだろうかと、オレオレ証明書で運用されているサイトにアクセスしてみた。
まず、https:// ページに入ろうとしていることを示す「セキュリティ保護がされているページに移ります」というお知らせ画面が出た（これは正規のSSLサイトでも表示される）。ここで「OK」ボタンを押すと……
なんと、何の警告もなく、ページが表示されてしまった。
念のため証明書の内容を確認してみると……
自己署名の証明書になっていた。
これは明らかにセキュリティ脆弱性だ。この種類の脆弱性（ブラウザが証明書を検証しない）は、伏せておくよりも早く事実を公表して利用者に注意を促した方がよいという考え方もあり、すぐに日記に書こうかとも考えたが、このケースではIPA、JPCERT/CCを通した方が修正が早く行われるのではないかと考え、IPAの脆弱性届出窓口に通報した。
この届け出は3月27日に受理された。そして本日、JVNで公表となった。修正版が提供されているので、利用者はアップデートで対応できる。
脆弱性情報の届け出では、意見として次のように書いておいた。
盗聴やなりすましの危険性がある異常事態であることを明示して警告し、ボタンを押したくらいでは容易に接続できないような、ユーザーインターフェイスにするべき。 特に、公衆無線LANでの使用を前提としているこの製品では、これは現実的な危険をもたらす重大な欠陥。
これが通じたのか、修正バージョンのmylo COM-2では、図4の警告が出るように改善された。
それにしても、信じ難い脆弱性だった。ここまで誰でも即座にわかる脆弱性に出くわしたのは、これまでの8年の経験の中で初めてだった。SSLの実装について何のテストも行われていなかったとしか考えられない。
それはともかくとして、この機会に述べておきたいのは、ここ数年のモバイル環境では、この脆弱性は極めて現実的な危険をもたらすという点である。
SSL が本当に必要とされる時代
ここ数年で、携帯型ゲーム機器に無線LAN機能が搭載されるようになり、公衆無線LANサービスの需要が高まっているようである。特に、昨年発売されたiPod touchが、無線LAN経由で閲覧するWebブラウザを搭載し、この使い勝手がたいへん快適であることから、おそらく、これまでになく広い層の人々が、公衆無線LANサービスを使い始めているのではないかと推測する。
実際私も、通勤の際には駅までの徒歩の区間で、livedoor
Wirelessを利用して、iPod touchのSafariで、ネット情報のチェックをしている。東京の山手線の沿線とその内側ではほとんどの地域で（ちょっと移動すれば）livedoor
Wirelessのアクセスポイントに接続できる状況になっている。
ここで問題となるのが、偽アクセスポイントの危険性である。livedoor
Wirelessをはじめとして、現在多くの公衆無線LANサービスにおいて、アクセスポイントへの接続のアクセス制御が、WEPキーによって行われている 。そして、そのWEPキーは、当該サービスの利用者全員に共通の同一のキーとなっている。サービス加入時にメールでWEPキーの文字列が送られてくるのだが、その文字列でGoogle検索してみると、公開Webページに書き込んでいる人もいるようだ。これは、livedoorだけでなく、マクドナルドなどで使えるBBモバイルポイントなどでも同じである。
このような公衆無 線LANの運用方法自体を批判する声もあるだろうが、現実的にはやむを得ない状況のようだ。全員共通のWEPキーはあってないようなものであり、ANY接続を拒否するためと、せいぜい電波法109条の2に基づく法的防御の意味 くらいしかない。
例えば、livedoor Wirelessを使う場合、無線LANクライアントに、livedoor
Wireless のSSIDである「 livedoor-web」と、そのWEPキーである「XXXXXXXXXXXXX」（誰でも知ることができるがここでは書かない）を設定することになるのだが、その設定をした無線LANクライアントは、これと同じ名前のSSIDと同じWEPキーが設定された無線LANアクセスポイントであれば、どこのものであろうと自動的に接続してしまう。
そのため、livedoor以外の誰かが自分の所有する無線LANアクセスポイント機器に、「livedoor-web」というSSIDを設定し 、livedoor Wirelessに加入して知ったWEPキーを設定して、アクセスポイントを設置したら、周辺を行き交う人がiPod touchなどを使ってネットサーフィンすると、そのアクセスポイント経由でインターネットにつながるという事態が生じ得る。
このとき、そのアクセスポイント設置者は、通信内容を盗聴できてしまうだけでなく、偽DNSサーバを設置することで、いわゆるpharming攻撃ができてしまう。つまり、例えば、iPod touch利用者が銀行へアクセスする際に、ブックマークから銀行を選んでアクセスしたとしても、偽アクセスポイントに接続しているため、偽DNSにより偽のIPアドレスへつながってしまうという事態が生じ得る。アドレスバー上では本物の銀行のドメイン名が表示されているのに、実際には偽サイトだということになる。
しかし、本来ならば、ここで役に立つのがSSLである。利用者がパスワード等を入力する際に「安全なWebサイト利用の鉄則」の手順にしたがって行動し、https:// のページであることと、アドレスバーに表示されたドメイン名が知っている本物サイトであることの両方を確認してから入力するようにしていれば、たとえ偽アクセスポイントに接続していても、偽サイトにつながることはない。偽サイト設置者が偽サイト用のサーバ証明書を用意しても、ブラウザが、証明書が不正であることを検出し、オレオレ証明書の警告を出すからだ。
ところが、mylo COM-2は、この不正な証明書の確認を怠っていた。利用者が注意していても、偽サイトにつながってしまう。
オレオレ警告を無視することの危険性については11月25日の日記「オレオレ警告の無視が危険なこれだけの理由」でも書いたが、「SSLってそんなに重要なんですか・・・？」みたいな声が出てくる。「『インターネットは盗聴可能』というけど、実際どこで盗聴できるというの？」という声がよく出てくるのだが、最近の公衆無線LANの普及はまさにその危険が現実になっているのであり、myloはまさに、そのような場で使うことを想定した機器であったはずだ。
日本のWebブラウザ実装者の怠慢
Mozillaにせよ 、Internet Explorerにせよ、メジャーなWebブラウザは基本的に、米国を中心にした主に英語圏の人たちによって開発されてきた。Operaの事例もあるが、それらは世界の人々からの批判的評価にさらされることで、いくつものセキュリティ上の問題点が改善されてきている。
その一方、携帯電話やゲーム機等、日本企業が独自にWebブラウザを実装している製品が多数ある。日本がコンシューマーエレクトロニクスで世界をリードしてきたがゆえであろう。しかし、そうした製品は、開発者の顔が見えないものばかりだ。セキュリティ上の改善について能動的に耳を傾ける様子がみられない。携帯電話のWebの世界は、秘密保持契約で技術者が縛られ、オープンな議論が許されない閉鎖的な環境に陥っている。そうした製品にはアドレスバーが存在しないものが多く、それでは駄目だということを以前から繰り返し各方面に対して言ってきたろころだが、今のところ改善が見られない。
そして今回の不具合であるわけだが、これは明らかに脆弱性であるので修正されたけれども、その他にもある、セキュリティ上の不備について、どうしたら改善してもらうことができるのだろうか。
例えば、サーバ証明書の内容を確認する機能はどうか。
サーバ証明書の内容を目視確認することが、どんなときに必要とされ、何を確認すればよいのかは、「安全なWebサイト利用の鉄則 」 の「( A ) 初めて訪れたサイトの場合」に説明されている。知らないドメイン名のサイトを訪れたときに、自分の知っている組織が運営しているサイトかどうかを、証明書の発行先の組織名で確認する。
しかしどうだろう、mylo COM-2のサーバ証明書の表示機能では、図5のように、普通の人には何が何だかわからないものが表示される。
何が表示されているかというと、上から順に見ると、最初に表示されているのは中間認証局の証明書だ。最初に中間認証局証明書の発行元であるルート認証局の名前、そしてその発行先が中間認証局の名前、その下を見ていくとやっと最後に、肝心のサーバ証明書の発行先の組織名が現れる。こんな形式で見せられても、どこをみればいいのかさっぱりわからず、誰も見なくなってしまうだろう。
これは、携帯電話でも似たような状況だ。例えば、図6は、ウィルコムのAH-K3001Vのサーバ証明書表示機能の様子だが、図のように、発行者と発行先が逆に表示されるという杜撰さだった。
auのEZwebブラウザはというと、図7のように、データをただ垂れ流しているだけだ。
たいていの機器で、証明書の表示機能はメニューの奥深いところにひっそりと用意されている。「用意しないといけないようだから付けた」といった単純労働で製作されていて、「ユーザに活用してもらうにはどう設計すれば良いか」といった知的な工夫は見られない。
折しも先日 、PayPalがSafariからのアクセスを遮断するのではという話が出ていた。後にPayPalによって否定されたようだが、EV-SSLに対応する様子を見せないApple Computer に対する牽制だったのかもしれない。PayPalはフィッシング被害の草分け的存在であり今も被害が盛んなようだ。それだけ深刻だということだろう。
i Pod touch のSafariはサーバ証明書の確認機能がないとか、スクロールするとアドレスバーが消えてしまうという話は、10月20日の日記にも書いていたが、先日のUSENIXのUPSEC'08
( Usability , Psycology , and Security ) で「 iPhish : Phishing Vulnerabilities on Consumer Electronics」という発表があり、同様の指摘がされたようだ。この論文では、Nintendo DSと Wiiも槍玉に挙がっている。
新型myloのアドレスバーはイマイチでがっかりしたと上で書いたが、どんなふうになっているかというと、図8の画面のように、ブラウザのコンテンツ領域の上部に被さる形で巨大なアドレスバーが現れる。
これはいかにも邪魔なもので、「 DISP 」ボタンを押すことで消せるようになっている。図9の例は、myloの公式コンテンツなのに、アドレスバーが邪魔で「閉じる」ボタンが押せない様子を示している。
こんな設計では皆、アドレスバーを消して常用してしまうだろう。おそらく、誰かの指示でアドレスバーを付けることにはなったものの、ろくに知的な検討をすることもなく「邪魔だから消せるようにしておけばいいや」的な発想で作られたんだろうと推察する。
とりあえず日本 のWebブラウザ実装に携わるベンダらは、定期的に勉強会を開くなりして情報共有をしてはいかがだろうか。私はいくらでもアイデアを提供するつもりでいるのだが。例えば、「日本電子認証協議会」は現状では認証局側の集まりのようだが、ブラウザ実装ベンダも参加して、EV-SSLに限らず、ブラウザに欠かせない実装の手引書でも整えたらいいのにと思う。
Possible McCain SecDef questions recognition of Israel [ CORRECTED ]
A Democratic source , just in time for the Aipac conference sends over two clips from Charlie Rose :
The first is McCain saying he thinks Fred Smith , the chief of FedEx , would make a good Secretary of Defense .
The second is Smith , in a more recent Charlie Rose interview , sympathizing with George Marshall 's opposition -- overruled by Harry Truman -- to recognizing Israel .
" In retrospect , there would be a large body of thought thta would have said that Marshall was correct in what would precipitate from that recognition , which is now sixty - some - odd years of war , " he says , going on to say that McCain reminds him of Marshall .
[ SEE CORRECTION BELOW . ]
McCain has pressed to keep Obama on the defensive on Israel , and the RNC likes to point to Jimmy Carter 's hostility to Israeli policy to taint Democrats .
But in fact , pro- and anti-Israel stances are historically bi-partisan , particularly among an older generation of Republicans , and McCain supporter James Baker , for instance , draws some of the same ire as Carter from parts of the Jewish and pro-Israel communities .
CORRECTION : I missed an edit in the middle of the video , which I should n't have posted , and have removed from above .
It cut a crucial passage in which Smith said he sided with Truman in the dispute .
The full transcript is after the jump , and the edit undermines the point the video is trying to make .
In the full video , Smith says that Truman made the " right decision , " but that Marshall was " prophetic " -- words that still might give pause to some , but put him on the other side of the issue .
Full transcript after the jump .
FRED SMITH : But Marshall was the architect of the victory worldwide , not just in Europe .
I think Marshall`s greatest contribution when Roosevelt made him chief of staff was to go down sometimes two and three deep in the officer ranks and take the people that had talent that he had trained in the inner war years , and it was that group of leadership , including Eisenhower , and Marshall`s amazing managerial capabilities that really was the most important element in winning World War II , I believe .
CHARLIE ROSE : But he advised Truman against recognizing the state of Israel .
FRED SMITH : Well , in retrospect , there would be a large body of thought that would have said that Marshall was correct in what would precipitate from that recognition , which is now 60 - some - odd years of war .
CHARLIE ROSE : Exactly 60 years .
FRED SMITH : Yes .
So I think Truman made the right decision .
But Marshall`s job was to advise ...
CHARLIE ROSE :
So he was prophetic about the problems that might come about .
FRED SMITH : He was certainly prophetic as to the problems that would come .
Now that NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander is settled in on the arctic plains of Mars , takingpictures and starting to gather samples , space agencies all over the world areplanning and building the next robots and gadgets they plan to send to probethe mysteries of the red planet .
NASA plansto waste no time in getting back to Mars after Phoenix finishes its three - monthmission .
By September or October of next year , launch is set for the MarsScience Laboratory , a beefed - up rover that will further explore the Martiansurface ( it will be the largest vehicle ever sent to Mars ) .
And Americanswo n't be the only ones visiting the red planet : The European Space Agency ( ESA ) is currently working on its own rover , dubbed ExoMars , which would be equippedto scout out signs of past or present life on Mars .
The Chinese and Russianspace agencies are also collaborating on a mission to the planet ' sasteroid - like moon , Phobos .
Mega-rover
The MarsScience Laboratory ( which wo n't be the craft 's final name ) will be much largerthan its Mars Exploration Rover ( MER ) cousins , Spirit and Opportunity , which are currently still cranking around the Martian surface .
The " mega - rover " will weigh in at about 2,040 pounds ( 925 kg ) ?
sort ofthe monster truck of Mars rovers .
This heftysize should allow the rover to take more instruments to Mars to poke and prodthe surface ?
the payload will be about 10 instruments to be exact , weighing inat a total of 154 pounds ( 70 kg ) .
Like other Mars landers and rovers before it , MSL will of course have cameras to snap pictures of the Martian landscape andhelp guide its six wheels across the terrain .
One camera , the Mars Hand Lens Imager , will take extreme close - up shots of the surface .
But unlikethe MERs , which were like geologists on Mars , MSL is designed to be more of achemist .
One MSL tool , called ChemCam , will be new to Mars .
It is a laser thatcan be used to zap Martian rocks to create a fine dust that it can then analyzeto determine the rock 's composition .
These scans should help scientistsdetermine what to take a closer look at .
" If welike that rock , we get up close and personal with that rock , " said Fuk Li , manager of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , where MSL is being designed and assembled .
The rovercan do this with its drill , which can suction onto a rock , bore down into it , and extract a sample of the powder to be analyzed by the instruments inside therover , including an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer , the Sample Analysis atMars instrument and an X - ray diffraction and fluorescence instrument called CheMin .
The rover ' ssize will also enable it to venture further across the Martian landscape , up to12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) from its landing site , which it is projected to reachsometime during July 2010 .
The wheelsover the rover , which will be attached to long , spindly legs , will enable thevehicle to roll over rocks if it needs to , " but the fact that we can climbover the rocks does n't mean we want to on Mars , " Li said , because of thepossible damage they could do to the craft .
Go , go 'Sky Crane '
With theproposed launch date just a little more than a year away , engineers at JPL areworking to get the craft , which is among the biggest they have ever assembled , ready in time .
" We 'rein the middle of putting the spacecraft together , " Li said , likening thejob to " a three - dimensional jigsaw puzzle . "
The MSLteam has finished the wheels and deck of the rover and are working on building the avionics and computer power distribution system that will go inside andhelp run the vehicle .
The incomplete rover is affectionately referred to as the " Scarecrow . "
" It hasno brain , that 's why they call it the Scarecrow , " Li said .
Whereexactly MSL will land has yet to be determined .
NASA has its MarsReconnaissance Orbiter looking at six candidate sites within 30 degrees northand south latitude of the equator .
To get toits landing site , wherever that ends up being , MSL will have a cruise stage to guide it to Mars , similar to other spacecraft , a heat shield to protect it during its initialdescent , and a parachute and back shell that will separate from the craft duringits descent , also like other Martian probes .
But afterthis stage , MSL will use a completely newway of touching down on the surface , with a system called Sky Crane .
TheSky Crane will have cords that attach it to the lander .
As the rover falls tothe surface , the Sky Crane 's thrusters should slow their descent and then " very , very , very slowly , " it will lower the rover down with thecords , Li said .
As this ishappening , the rover unfolds its wheels .
When these touch the surface , the SkyCrane senses , " Aha !
I 've landed , " Li said , and detaches its cordsfrom the rover and flies away and crashes on the surface .
The missionis slated to last for two Earth years ( one Martian year ) .
While Spirit and Opportunity have lasted far longer than their three - month - long planned mission ( and are still kicking ) , Li and other NASA scientists are n't counting on MSLlasting longer , because like both MERs , the mechanical joints of MSL willeventually wear down with age .
" We 'redesigning it to last two years , " Li said .
Mission to the moon
TheEuropean Space Agency ( ESA ) is also planning their own rover that would beaimed at looking for extinct or current life on Mars .
Dubbed ExoMars , the 650 million euro ( $ 876 million ) mission would include instruments , including a few from the United States , aimed at characterizing the Martianbiological environment .
One of the planned instruments is a drill that couldbore into the terrain to about 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) below the surface , which hasnever been done before on Mars .
ExoMars iscurrently slated to lift off in 2013 aboard either a European Ariane 5 rocketor a Russian Proton rocket .
It would include an orbiter to relaycommunications , a descent module and a rover .
The rover would land either usingan inflatable breaking system or parachute system .
ESA isplanning to power the rover using solar arrays .
The rover would be able totravel a few kilometers over the Martian surface , navigating autonomously usingoptical sensors .
The Chineseand Russian space agencies are also currently planning a Martian mission , buttheirs will be aimed at one of Mars ' two moons , Phobos .
Russia last tried to reach the tiny satellite with its Phobos - 1 and Phobos - 2 probes , whichwere lost in 1988 and 1999 , respectively .
The new Phobos - Gruntprobe , currently being built at Lavochkin Scientific Production Associationin Khimki , Russia , would launch in 2009 .
The anticipated three - year - longmission aims to deliver rocks from Phobos back to Earth , map the surface of thesatellite and analyze the plasma and dust that surrounds it .
Of coursethese steps are only just the next of many steps in exploring our ruddyneighbor .
Eventually , both NASA and the ESA hope to return samples of Mars ' red - orange rocks and one day send humans to take the first actual step on theplanet .

A just released LA Times / Bloomberg poll has Barack Obama leading John McCain by twelve points , 49 % - 37 % .
On a four man ballot that includes Ralph Nader and Bob Barr , Obama leads 48%-33 % , with Nader and Barr splitting 7 % .
McCain seems to have two big problems according to the poll , George W. Bush , and lack of enthusiasm about his candidacy .
The poll found that Bush ’s approval rating has sunk to 23 % .
Republicans definitely lack enthusiasm about McCain .
Only 58 % of self described conservatives said that they would vote for McCain , 15 % said that they would vote for Obama , 14 % said that they will vote for someone else , and 13 % were undecided .
In contrast , 79 % of liberals said that they will vote for Obama .
Only 45 % of McCain supporters say that they are enthusiastic about voting for him compared to 81 % of Obama supporters .
50 % of Obama supporters called themselves very enthusiastic about their candidate , but only 13 % of McCain supporters feel the same way .

McCain and Obama are tied with white voters at 39 % .
It is no surprise that voters prefer Obama on the issues of the economy and healthcare , but the real shocker is that voters support his tax plan over McCain’s .
The only issue that McCain leads on is terrorism .
The two candidates are tied on the issue of Iraq .
Obama leads McCain among women 54% - 29 % , but McCain has a slight lead with Independents 36 % - 33 % .
This poll confirms the results of a Newsweek Poll released over the weekend that found Obama leading McCain by 15 points .
The Republicans have big problems here .
They are up against a great candidate , while their own party rank and file is apathetic about their nominee .
This might normally be enough to cost any party an election , but when you throw in George W. Bush ’s 77 % disapproval rating , and McCain ’s willingness to follow Bush ’s policies , what is developing here is a perfect recipe for a big Obama win .
LA Times Article
Bloomberg Article
NO OTHER country puts as much emphasis on “ freedom ” as the United States .
Patrick
Henry demanded “ liberty or death ” .
The national anthem calls America “ the land of the free ” .
Great reformers from Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King have urged America to live up to its ideal of “ freedom ” .
When a group of French Americanophiles wanted to flatter the United States , they sent the Statue of Liberty .
And no other country boasts as much about its mission to give freedom to the rest of the world .
Woodrow Wilson thought that he had a God - given duty to bring liberty to mankind .
George Bush regards his foreign policy as a crusade for freedom — “ the right and hope of all humanity ” .
But how good is America at living up to its own ideals ?
A new study by Freedom House tries to answer this question .
The fact that Freedom House has devoted so much attention to the United States is significant in its own right .
Founded in 1941 by a group of Americans who were worried about the advance of fascism , Freedom House is now the world 's leading watchdog of liberty .
The fact that “ Today 's American : How Free ? ” is such a thorough piece of work makes it doubly significant .
The judicious tone of “ How Free ? ” will undoubtedly disappoint leftists .
Freedom
House bends over backwards to give the authorities the benefit of the doubt .
Other countries have recalibrated the balance between freedom and security in the face of terrorists who want to inflict mass casualties on civilians .
America 's recent sins , however , are minor compared with those of its past .
Newspapers have published highly sensitive information without reprisals .
Congress and the courts have repeatedly stepped in to restore a more desirable constitutional balance .
But the verdict on the Bush years is nevertheless sharp .
“ How Free ? ” not only details and condemns the administration 's familiar sins , from Guantánamo to extraordinary rendition to warrantless wiretapping .
It reminds readers of its aversion to open government .
The number of documents classified as secret has jumped from 8.7 m in 2001 to 14.2 m in 2005 — a 60 % increase over three years .
Decade - old information has been reclassified .
Researchers report that it is much more difficult and time - consuming to obtain information under the Freedom of Information Act .
Government whistleblowers have repeatedly been punished or fired — even when they have been trying to expose threats to national security that their bosses preferred to overlook .
Richard Levernier had his security clearance revoked for revealing that some of the country 's nuclear facilities were not properly secured .
Border security agents have been punished for pointing out that the border is inadequately monitored , and airport baggage - handlers and security people for pointing to weaknesses in the security system .
The Office of Special Counsel , which was established to enforce laws designed to protect the rights of such people , is widely regarded as “ inept and even hostile to whistleblowers ” .
“ How Free ? ” also has some hard things to say about America 's criminal - justice system .
The incarceration rate exploded from 1.39 per 1,000 in 1980 to 7.5 in 2006 , driven , among other things , by the war on drugs .
America now has one of the highest rates of imprisonment in the world : 5.6 m Americans , or one in every 37 adults , has spent time behind bars .
Even though prison - building is one of the country 's great growth industries , overcrowding is endemic , with federal prisons operating at 131 % of capacity .
America is also one of the few countries to ban felons and , in some states , ex-felons from voting .
At any one time 4 m Americans — one in every 50 adults — is disenfranchised because of past criminal convictions .
This includes 1.4 m blacks , or 14 % of the black male population .
Freedom House 's strictures are , if anything , too soft .
America insists on criminalising victimless crimes such as prostitution .
Last week Deborah Jeane Palfrey , the so - called DC Madam , committed suicide ; the government had thrown the book at her , including racketeering and mail fraud , because it really wished to penalise the arranging of assignations between consenting adults .
In her suicide note to her mother she wrote that she could not “ live the next six - to - eight years behind bars for what you and I have both come to regard as this ' modern - day lynching ' . ”
The wrong lemonade
The American legal system also seems to have lost any sense of proportion .
Christopher Ratte , a professor of archaeology , recently tried to buy his seven - year - old son a bottle of lemonade at a baseball game .
He was handed a bottle of Mike 's Hard Lemonade , an alcoholic drink , by mistake .
Officials noticed the boy sipping the drink and immediately whisked him off to hospital .
He was fine .
But the family was condemned to legal hell : the police at first put the seven - year - old into a foster home and a judge ruled that he could go home only if his father moved out .
It took several days of legal wrangling to reunite the family .
“ How Free ? ” repeatedly argues , even as it dredges through the most depressing material , that the American system has proved admirably self - correcting .
The response of civil - liberties advocates has been swift and dogged .
The Supreme Court has forced the administration to extend the Geneva conventions to inmates in Guantánamo and other military prisons .
Congress has reined in warrantless wiretapping .
The press has repeatedly published leaked material .
This is perhaps a little optimistic — the courts have been slow and Congress half - hearted .
But nevertheless the self - correction is now entering a higher gear .
All the current presidential candidates , Democratic and Republican alike , have condemned torture and rendition and declared their desire to close Guantánamo .
Freedom House 's new publication will be an important contribution to this process of self - correction .
A historical look at the stuff that gets us hammered .
Who 's ready for the first round ?
Beer
To quote Homer Simpson , is there anything it can't do ?
Most likely invented in Persia circa 7,000 B.C.E. , beer 's gone on to become hugely important in almost every ancient society it 's touched .
Back in Sumerian culture , the drink was considered positively divine - a fact confirmed when archaeologists dug up the 4,000 - year - old " Hymn to Ninkasi . "
The ode to the goddess of brewing actually doubles as a recipe for a barley - based beverage guaranteed to make people feel " exhilarated , wonderful and blissful . "
The epic of Gilgamesh tells us a similar tale ; one of the main characters , Enkidu , is said to have had " seven cups of beer , and his heart soared . "
After seven rounds we can definitely see why .
In ancient Egypt , wages were often paid to the poor in beer , or as they called it , hqt .
It was sort of light beer , apparently , and not very intoxicating , which explains how construction workers of the day managed to drink three daily rations of it and still build their masterpiece : the not - at - all - leaning pyramids of Giza .
Wine A wine snob will happily tell you , for hours on end , how difficult it is to make a decent wine and how many complicated steps are involved .
This may be true , but it 's ridiculously easy to make basic wine .
The beverage in its roughest form probably goes back thousands of years to primitive cultures who mistakenly left grapes in the sun for too long and then attempted to eat them .
As it turns out , all the yeasts needed to ferment grapes actually grow on grape skin .
( No additives necessary ! ) Around 5,000 B.C.E. , the people of present - day Georgia and Iran started making wine in clay pots .
By the time of ancient Greece , wine had acquired a religious significance ; perhaps in homage to Dionysus , the Greeks planted vines in all their colonies , including France and Egypt .
( We 'd love to know what the French make of the fact that they have the Greeks to thank for their vaunted grapes . )
California winemakers should also praise God , literally , for the fruits of their labor : when Christian missionaries arrived there , they planted the region 's first vines so they'd have something to transmogrify into the blood of Jesus when they took Communion .
Champagne
As you probably know , bubbly comes from the Champagne region of France , a longtime center of trade ( and also a region in the path of rampaging hordes : Attila the Hun , among others , left footprints there ) .
As you may also know , Dom Perignon was in fact a real person - his first name was Pierre - and , in a sense , he 's the inventor of the sparkly stuff .
A Benedictine monk , the Dom served as treasurer of an abbey in the Champagne region starting in 1688 .
The region had slightly chilly weather that year , and the growing season was unusually short anyway - which meant grapes spent less time fermenting on the vine and more time fermenting in cellars .
Essentially , it was this process that led to carbon dioxide being trapped inside the bottles .
At first the Dom was horrified ; this was a sign that he'd failed in his duties as treasurer ( which included , for some reason , winemaking ) .
Try as he might , he could n't get rid of the bubbles .
Finally , resigned to dealing with them , he blended grapes to make a light white wine , which suited the effervescence far better than a heavy red .
He also realized he'd have to solve another problem caused by trapped carbon dioxide : a considerable number of his bottles exploding .
So , instead of stopping them with wood and oil - soaked hemp , he started using a soft material from Spain : cork .
This lovely story , by the way , does n't sit so well with the natives of Limoux , France .
They allege that they were making sparkling wine in their backyards as early as the 1500s , and that Perignon stole their idea .
We 've got to side with the Dom on this one : After all , the guy was a monk .
Vodka Believe it or not , the name really does come from the Russian word for " water , " which is " voda , " and the Russians have a pretty good claim to inventing the stuff .
Production from grains has been documented there as far back as the 9th century .
It was n't , however , until around the 14th century that vodka became known as the Russian national drink , and for good reasons ; it was served everywhere , even at religious ceremonies .
Poland likes to boast that its own vodka production goes back even further than Russia 's , to the 8th century , but what was going made in that region at the time was more like grappa or brandy .
Later Polish vodkas were called " gorzalka , " or " burnt wine , " and were used as medicines , as were all distilled liquors in the Middle Ages .
Vodka was also used as an ingredient in early European formulations of gunpowder .
By the way , for those of you who turn your noses up the fruit - infused vodkas that have recently hit the market : they 're the original .
Early vodkas were not quite as palatable as your average Grey Goose , so makers often masked the taste with fruits and spices .
Gin
If you 're unsurprised that vodka used to be given as medicine , you probably wo n't be shocked to learn that gin was invented specifically for that purpose .
14th - century Europeans distilled juniper berries in hopes of fighting the plague ( then again , almost everything they did was in hope of fighting the plague ) .
But gin as we know it did n't come along until the mid-1600s .
That 's when one Dr. Sylvius concocted the first formulation in the Netherlands , hoping it would serve as a primitive type of dialysis for kidney patients .
( We 're guessing he did n't particularly care about its effect on the liver . )
By the end of the century , gin had become popular in Britain because it was sold at cut -rate prices , despite a very widespread rumor that it could induce abortion , which lead to it being nicknamed " mother 's ruin . "
Later , when the Brits started to occupy India , they found it useful in yet another medical mixture : the gin and tonic .
The quinine in the tonic water was effective in fighting malaria .
Tequila
As vodka was to Russia , tequila was to Mexico ; it 's been made there since at least the 16th century and was originally used in religious rituals .
( Having drunk a little too much tequila once , we can testify to its ability to cause drinkers to beseech God for mercy . )
The name comes from a town founded in 1656 .
And while José Cuervo did n't exactly invent the drink , he was the first to commercialize it .
As for its migration northward , a fellow named Cenobio Sauza brought the stuff to the U.S. in the late 1800s ; we can't help but wonder if this is why frat boys on spring break still refer to this stuff as " the sauce . "
Rum Yo - ho - uh - oh and a bottle of rum - the drink tastes great , but its history is n't so sweet .
The story , as far as we can tell , starts in India , where in 300 , B.C.E. , Alexander the Great saw some sugarcane and memorably called it " the grass that gives honey without bees . "
All well and good , until Christopher Columbus went and brought sugarcane to the Caribbean .
There , it flourished and became the engine of the slave trade .
Africa sent slaves to the Caribbean , which sent sugar to New England , which sent rum and other goodies to Africa , which sent more slaves to the Caribbean .
Known as the triangular trade , pondering the implications of it all is enough to make a person want a stiff drink .
But not , preferably , one steeped in rum .
Now that the shock of the earthquake ( which they could not control ) in Sichuan Province has dissipated somewhat , China ’s leaders are focusing again on something that they think they can control : people .
Sports fans attending the 2008 Olympics in Beijing will have a long list of rules to carry in their pockets along with their tickets .
On its Web site last week , the Chinese Olympic organizing committee listed a set of restrictions for the 500,000 overseas visitors expected in August .
Olympic spectators are being told not to bring in “ anything detrimental ” to China , including printed materials , photos , records or movies .
Religious or political banners or slogans are banned .
So are rallies , demonstrations and marches  unless approved by authorities in advance .
It also says that visitors with mental illnesses and sexually transmitted diseases will be barred from the country .
We shudder at how those judgments  many of them highly subjective or intrusive  will be made .
The International Olympic Committee has long prohibited political activities at Olympic venues , and we respect the goal of trying to put aside divisions while celebrating a common humanity .
But Beijing is using those restrictions for its own authoritarian ends .
To win the right to host the Games , China promised to improve its human - rights record .
It keeps moving mostly in the opposite direction .
In recent days , authorities effectively disbarred two prominent human - rights lawyers who volunteered to defend Tibetans charged in violent anti-China protests .
They also broke up a gathering of 100 parents who were peacefully protesting shoddy school construction and the deaths of their children in the May 12 earthquake .

Gordon Brown 's choice of that year to start selling off Britain 's gold reserves with the precious metal 's price close to an unprecedented low is well documented .
What is less well known is that 1999 marked the peak for North Sea oil production and - by an unfortunate twist of fate - the very nadir of the oil price .
The rest of us may have been too busy partying like it was 1999 , but on the eve of the millennium Britain was quietly , unwittingly , selling off the family silver on the cheap .
The article below is a wonderful example of pundit cluelessness and or wanton incompetence , and I 'm going to rip it to shreds in detail below .
Gordon Brown , who has been lauded for years ( and in particular around 1999 ) as a great Chancellor of the Exchequer is now fair game and everything he has ever done must now be seen in light of his current meltdown .
With that in mind , it is not surprising to see articles now popping up to pin blame on him then for oil prices now .
The biggest story of the day must somehow be his fault too .
But given that oil and energy is a topic that touches upon quite a few ideological traps , he is of course going to be blamed for all the wrong things , in order for the story to fit with the narrative .
The last sentence of the above paragraph is testimony to how far our pundits are from any kind of informed commentary on the subject .
Is it really a " unfortunate twist of fate " that oil prices were at their lowest when the highest volumes of oil under our control were extracted , or just a logical consequence of supply and demand rules that they are usually so keen to credit for other favorable economic outcomes ?
After the oil shocks of the 70s , the US and the UK were lucky to be able to exploit new oil reserves situated on their territory - in Alaska or the North Sea .
These finds , the last major production areas found on the planet to date , flooded the market in the 80s and 90s , duly bringing prices down , and prompting the Economist to write , in March 1999 : " The price of oil has fallen by half in the past two years , to just over $ 10 a barrel .
It may fall further . "
Commodities were seen as a relic of the past , as the dotcom age was promising us unprecedented wealth based on knowledge rather than heavy stuff .
Gold was on a 20 year downwards trajectory and all central banks were wondering what to do with their bulky and useless stocks of the metal .
Holding it was , then , seeing as silly , and oil was seen as an sideshow - cheap , plentiful and boring .
But hey , let 's rewrite history with the benefit of hindsight , and blame Brown for actions which were then lauded as modern and proper .
Britain was pumping around 2.8 m barrels of oil every day , but the price averaged a mere $ 18 and dropped at one stage into single figures .
Fast - forward to today , and while the oil price has rocketed up to a record $ 135 a barrel , the UK is producing only 1.5 m barrels a day .
The Prime Minister cannot be blamed for the fact that Britain 's oil production peaked at precisely the wrong time , nor can he really do anything meaningful to the oil price - despite his pledges yesterday .
However , the rising price has underlined just how fast the North Sea is declining , and raised questions over whether Mr Brown 's policies have served to accelerate its demise .
Well , the Prime Minister can actually be blamed for not doing anything about the UK's oil production when he arrived at n°11 back in 1997 .
It was not fashionable then , and it certainly was not what his predecessors had done , but oil&gas production could have been curtailed and limited in order to last longer .
This is what the Dutch did with their gas reserves - limiting by law the production of their giant Groningen gas field so as to husband the resource for longer .
It 's not as if information on the likely decline of production was not available then , and as if the government did not have the means to direct an immediate stabilisation of production so as to ensure a longer tail .
And even if you accept that if was not a priority topic by 1999 , the real issue was not what he did or did not do then , but what he has not done since , as it became obvious that production was declining .
The country has lost 1.4 mb/ d of production capacity in 10 years , has become a major importer of the stuff , and still has no energy policy beyond " the markets will provide " or " blame the evil Russians . "
And as to " doing nothing about oil prices " - how about focusing on the one side of the supply - demand balance that we can actually do something about : our demand ?
There 's lots that governments can do , from the mundane ( fuel efficiency resquirements , construction standards ) , to the all encompassing ( fuel taxes , speed limits , public transport investment ) to the brutal ( rationing , forbidding the sale of cars with low fuel efficiency , closing off highways ) .
But no , the common wisdom does not focus on that , it focuses on this :
However , the Government is culpable for its management of the tax regime .
Some years ago Mr Brown switched the system to a more modern scheme , charging oil companies a supplement to corporation tax for their North Sea profits , but allowing them to offset the investment they poured in .
It was a sensible change , designed to encourage companies to spend more on finding new fields .
However , in 2005 , the Treasury suddenly and unexpectedly raised this supplementary tax rate .
Ah .
Tax increases .
that 's the real problem .
Of course .
It is , as we know , the root of all evil .
All businesses are reluctant to invest in a region if they fear its tax policies will change suddenly and without warning - none more so than oil companies , which make their investment decisions on a 20 to 30 - year horizon .
Tax instability ( which happens only whan taxes go up , not down , of course ) is the cause of the production decline .
No matter than the tax was increased only in 2005 , ie 6 years after production started declining , and that it was increased by a few % at a time when oil prices had already climbed up from $ 15 to $ 50 - it Just .
Has .
To. Be. The. Reason .
Oil. Production .
Declined .
As we are reminded again :
Even so , the speed of the North Sea 's decline has taken almost all experts by surprise .
According to Kevin Norrish , commodities analyst at Barclays Capital , since the turn of the millennium production has consistently disappointed expectations .
" With no major new projects on the horizon to make up for the accelerating decline rates in the UK 's mature fields , the prospect of significantly arresting the established decline in output looks poor , " he said .
Likewise , the amount of investment injected into the region has been consistently lower than many had forecast .
" Experts " were surprised .
Presumably the very same experts that were " surprised " when Iraqis did not welcome US and UK soldiers with flowers , or when oil prices went above $ 50 , and above $ 60 , and above $ 80 , and above $ 100 , etc ...
The same experts that are still listened to today , and quoted widely .
But it all makes sense for them :
This is hardly surprising .
Over the past decades the North Sea has become one of the Government 's biggest corporate tax cows , generating more than £ 230bn in revenue since 1968 .
The Treasury is expecting to make around £ 10 bn this year from oil revenues , though experts at Grant Thornton think this could rise as high as £ 16bn due to higher oil prices .
However , this windfall has come at a price .
If , as thought , it is responsible for depressing production in recent years , it has helped make the UK a net oil importer two years earlier than expected .
It 's government fault that production is declining , and more precisely , it 's Gordon Brown 's fault for increasing taxes at the wrong moment .
The man cannot keep his hands of our hard earned money ( " our ? " you ask innocently - yes , " our " - are n't you a shareholder of BP , Shell et al ?
What a pity . )
Not only does this have serious implications for energy policy , it has pushed the current account deficit sharply higher and contributed to a weaker pound .
It has meant that whereas a few years ago Britain was well positioned to benefit from a high oil price , the implications today are far more damaging for the economy .
We hit the jackpot !
Brown's tax increases not only explain the oil crisis itself ( killing incentives , despite today 's prices , to invest in more North Sea production ) , but it also explains Britain 's huge trade deficit ( see , nothing to do with the financial sector 's growth slowly killing the manufacturing sector , à la Anglo Disease ) AND it suggests that there is a simple , successful energy policy round the corner ( lower taxes on energy companies ) .
The Conservative and Labour governments since Thatcher have benefited immeasurably from the North Sea 's constant stream of revenues in the past decades .
Only now are the full implications of its decline sinking in .
Lady
Thatcher , in her infinite wisdom , bestowed future governments with a golden goose , and now that damn evil , incompetent , ( shall we dare say it - socialist ) Brown has spoiled it all .
Damn him .
Sigh ...
While the last sentence touches one profound truth ( British governments over the past 20 years have had it easy thanks to the North Sea bonanza ) , it also points that the real issues are not even on the radar yet .
Oil production decline ( in the case of the UK , but the logic is the same as regards global stagnation of production ) is only caused by pesky governments interfering with private sector investment , and there is no problem that cannot be resolved by lower taxes or less regulation .
Peak oil is not even on the radar screen , Demand - side policies are inexistent ( beyond , occasionally , a token , throwaway mention ) and , of course , irrelevant .
As usual , all that matters are supply - side policies .
Maybe it 's time to call it , as properly suggested long ago by George Bush Sr for their economic cousins , voodoo energy policies - it's all the more appropriate as it appears to mostly include the hope that production will somehow , magically , increase - or that an alternative solution will just as magically emerge painlessly .
