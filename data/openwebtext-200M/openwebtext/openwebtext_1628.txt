If you read “ Nirvana is a verb , not a place , ” and it helped your practice , then this short article will probably make a lot of sense too .
One of the things I love about Buddhism is that it makes us look at our actions — what we do and do n’t do — as the literal creator of our individual worlds .
In order for our actions not to continue the chain of suffering , we have to look into our minds and see what ’s really going on there .
We have to understand how consciousness creates our sense of reality .
As we do this in the way the Buddha showed , we begin to cultivate a skillful world - view that continually asks :
Is this feeling , thought , action , going to increase stress and suffering , or move me closer to end of stress and suffering ?
Taking responsibility for the yes ’s and no’s of our hearts and minds , we increasingly become the masters of our own lives .
We begin to feel a joy build that , yes , we really can find a happiness that nothing or no one can take away from us , because this happiness is not dependent on conditions or on others .
May this article help and inspire you to take responsibility for your the suffering in your life , without judgment or self - condemnation , but with wisdom and loving - kindness .
“ The Buddha once asked his monks , “ Which do you think is greater : the water in the oceans or the tears you ’ve shed while wandering on ? ”
His answer : the tears .
Think of that the next time you gaze at the ocean or play in its waves . ”
Samsara
by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
Samsara literally means “ wandering - on . ”
Many people think of it as the Buddhist name for the place where we currently live — the place we leave when we go to nibbana .
But in the early Buddhist texts , it ’s the answer , not to the question , “ Where are we ? ” but to the question , “ What are we doing ? ” Instead of a place , it ’s a process : the tendency to keep creating worlds and then moving into them .
As one world falls apart , you create another one and go there .
At the same time , you bump into other people who are creating their own worlds , too .
The play and creativity in the process can sometimes be enjoyable .
In fact , it would be perfectly innocuous if it did n’t entail so much suffering .
The worlds we create keep caving in and killing us .
Moving into a new world requires effort : not only the pains and risks of taking birth , but also the hard knocks — mental and physical — that come from going through childhood into adulthood , over and over again .
The Buddha once asked his monks , “ Which do you think is greater : the water in the oceans or the tears you ’ve shed while wandering on ? ”
His answer : the tears .
Think of that the next time you gaze at the ocean or play in its waves .
In addition to creating suffering for ourselves , the worlds we create feed off the worlds of others , just as theirs feed off ours .
In some cases the feeding may be mutually enjoyable and beneficial , but even then the arrangement has to come to an end .
More typically , it causes harm to at least one side of the relationship , often to both .
When you think of all the suffering that goes into keeping just one person clothed , fed , sheltered , and healthy — the suffering both for those who have to pay for these requisites , as well as those who have to labor or die in their production — you see how exploitative even the most rudimentary process of world - building can be .
This is why the Buddha tried to find the way to stop samsara-ing .
Once he had found it , he encouraged others to follow it , too .
Because samsara- ing is something that each of us does , each of us has to stop it him or her self alone .
If samsara were a place , it might seem selfish for one person to look for an escape , leaving others behind .
But when you realize that it ’s a process , there ’s nothing selfish about stopping it at all .
It ’s like giving up an addiction or an abusive habit .
When you learn the skills needed to stop creating your own worlds of suffering , you can share those skills with others so that they can stop creating theirs .
At the same time , you ’ll never have to feed off the worlds of others , so to that extent you ’re lightening their load as well .
It ’s true that the Buddha likened the practice for stopping samsara to the act of going from one place to another : from this side of a river to the further shore .
But the passages where he makes this comparison often end with a paradox : the further shore has no “ here , ” no “ there , ” no “ in between . ”
From that perspective , it ’s obvious that samsara ’s parameters of space and time were not the pre-existing context in which we wandered .
They were the result of our wandering .
For someone addicted to world - building , the lack of familiar parameters sounds unsettling .
But if you ’re tired of creating incessant , unnecessary suffering , you might want to give it a try .
After all , you could always resume building if the lack of “ here ” or “ there ” turned out to be dull .
But of those who have learned how to break the habit , no one has ever felt tempted to samsara again .

The asparagus has a long and storied history .
It was mentioned in the myths and the scholarly writings of ancient Greece , and its cultivation was the subject of a detailed lesson in Cato the Elder 's treatise , On Agriculture .
But it was n't until the turn of the 18th century that discussion of the link between asparagus and odorous urine emerged .
In 1731 , John Arbuthnot , physician to Queen Anne , noted in a book about food that asparagus " affects the urine with a foetid smell ... and therefore have been suspected by some physicians as not friendly to the kidneys . "
Benjamin Franklin also noticed that eating asparagus " shall give our urine a disagreeable odor . "
Since then , there has been debate over what is responsible for the stinky pee phenomenon .
Polish chemist and doctor Marceli Nencki identified a compound called methanethiol as the cause in 1891 , after a study that involved four men eating about three and a half pounds of asparagus apiece .
In 1975 , Robert H. White , a chemist at the University of California at San Diego , used gas chromatography to pin down several compounds known as S - methyl thioesters as the culprits .
Other researchers have blamed various " sulfur - containing compounds " and , simply , " metabolites . "
More recently , a study demonstrated that asparagusic acid taken orally by subjects known to produce stinky asparagus pee produced odorous urine , which contained the same volatile compounds found in their asparagus - induced odorous urine .
Other subjects , who normally did n't experience asparagus - induced odorous urine , likewise were spared stinky pee after taking asparagusic acid .
The researchers concluded that asparagusic acid and its derivatives are the precursors of urinary odor ( compared , in different scientific papers , to the smell of " rotten cabbage , " " boiling cabbage " and " vegetable soup " ) .
The various compounds that contribute to the distinct smell — and were sometimes blamed as the sole cause in the past — are metabolized from asparagusic acid .
Exactly how these compounds are produced as we digest asparagus remains unclear , so let 's turn to an equally compelling , but more answerable question :
WHY DOESN'T ASPARAGUS MAKE YOUR PEE SMELL FUNNY ?
Remember when I said that some people do n't produce stinky asparagus pee ?
Several studies have shown that only some of us experience stinky pee ( ranging from 20 to 40 percent of the subjects taking part in the study , depending on which paper you read ) , while the majority have never had the pleasure .
For a while , the world was divided into those whose pee stank after eating asparagus and those whose did n't .
Then in 1980 , a study complicated matters : Subjects whose pee stank sniffed the urine of subjects whose pee did n't .
Guess what ?
The pee stank .
It turns out we 're not only divided by the ability to produce odorous asparagus pee , but the ability to smell it .
An anosmia — an inability to perceive a smell — keeps certain people from smelling the compounds that make up even the most offensive asparagus pee , and like the stinky pee non-producers , they 're in the majority .
Producing and perceiving asparagus pee do n't go hand - in - hand , either .
The 1980 study found that some people who do n't produce stinky pee could detect the rotten cabbage smell in another person 's urine .
On the flip side , some stink producers are n't able to pick up the scent in their own urine or the urine of others .

If so , let us know by emailing us at bigquestions@mentalfloss.com .
Today ’s Glenn Beck Program was all about the troops– namely , the reason America is doing so poorly in Afghanistan has nothing to do with them .
It has to do with the “ politicians and their grimy little fingers on everything , ” so , today , Glenn Beck performed a thought experiment where those politicians do n’t exist , and he is King of America .
Surprise : King Beck would be “ the opposite of what Obama is . ”
Beginning the segment by arguing in favor of our troops in Afghanistan– “ you ’re telling me these guys cant kick the ass of the people in the caves ? ” –
Beck accuses the Obama administration of diplomatic promiscuity , arguing that the reason so many foreign leaders hate the United States is that “ we do n’t stand for anything . ”
The first step to standing for something , he proposes , is to refuse to ally with a foreign power simply because we have a common enemy –
“ I ’m not going to get into bed with you because the other guy is worse . ”
To fix the current diplomatic situation , Beck put together a comprehensive foreign policy he presented on his chalkboard– the policy he would put into motion “ if I were king . ”
Among the most important rules of King Beck ’s foreign policy ?
“ Mind our own business , ” but if you mess with America , “ ” we will wipe you off the face of the planet . ”
He suggested he is not beyond using nuclear weapons to keep America ’s enemies from attacking .
Note the repeated use of the word “ king ” to describe the position he would be holding should he have the power to implement foreign policy .
Putting together such a diplomatic plan– one that sounds highly appealing to neo-conservatives and libertarians alike– like like composing a campaign platform , and lest you should begin to wonder whether today ’s new page in the chalkboard manifesto will end up as a tab under “ Issues ” on GlennBeckForPresident.com , Beck is keeping the terminology as far away from a realistic presidential campaign as he can , at least for now .
Have a tip we should know ?

Is the Sun going to enter a million - degree galactic cloud of interstellar gas soon ?
Scientists from the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences , Los Alamos National Laboratory , Southwest Research Institute , and Boston University suggest that the ribbon of enhanced emissions of energetic neutral atoms , discovered last year by the NASA Small Explorer satellite IBEX , could be explained by a geometric effect coming up because of the approach of the Sun to the boundary between the Local Cloud of interstellar gas and another cloud of a very hot gas called the Local Bubble .
If this hypothesis is correct , IBEX is catching matter from a hot neighboring interstellar cloud , which the Sun might enter in a hundred years .
First full - sky maps of the emissions of energetic neutral atoms ( ENA ) , obtained last year by IBEX , showed a surprising arc - like feature called the Ribbon .
This astonishing discovery was later announced by NASA as one of the most important findings in space exploration made in 2009 .
Shortly after the discovery six hypotheses were proposed to explain the Ribbon , all of them predicting its relation to processes going on within the heliosphere or in its neighborhood .
In a paper recently published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , a Polish - US team of scientists led by Prof.
Stan Grzedzielski from the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw , Poland , offers a different explanation .
" We observe the Ribbon , " says Grzedzielski " because the Sun is approaching a boundary between our Local Cloud of interstellar gas and another cloud of a very hot and turbulent gas . "
Energetic neutral atoms , registered by IBEX detectors , are born out of ions ( protons ) speeding from the very hot Local Bubble when they exchange charge with the relatively cool atoms " evaporating " from the Local Interstellar Cloud .
The newly created ENA have no electrical charge and therefore can dash freely in straight lines from their birth site , oblivious of the impeding magnetic fields .
Some of them may reach Earth orbit and be detected by IBEX .
" Had the Ribbon ENA been created at the boundaries of the heliosphere , their birth site would be relatively nearby , within just a couple of hundreds of astronomical units , " explains Dr Andrzej Czechowski from SRC PAS , one of the co-authors of the paper .
" According to our hypothesis , they are born much , much farther away . "
The team of Polish and US scientists suggests that the Ribbon ENA are born by electrical charge exchange between the atoms which " evaporate " from the Local Interstellar Cloud into the nearby Local Bubble of a very hot and fully ionized gas .
The Local Bubble is probably a remnant of a series of supernova explosions that occurred a few million years ago and thus is not only very hot ( at least million degree Kelvin ) , but also turbulent .
The protons in the Local Bubble nearby to the boundary with the Local Cloud snatch electrons from the neutral atoms and run away in all directions , some of them reaching IBEX .
" If our hypothesis is correct , then we are catching atoms that originate from an interstellar cloud that is different from ours , " says Dr. Maciej Bzowski , co-investigator of the mission and head of the Polish IBEX team .
But since the creation of such ENA atoms is occurring throughout the entire boundary layer between the clouds , why do we see the Ribbon ?
" It 's a purely geometrical effect , which we observe because the Sun is presently just in the right place , within a thousand of astronomical units from the cloud boundary , " explains Grzedzielski .
" If the cloud - cloud boundary is flat , or better slightly extruded towards the Sun , then it appears the thinnest towards the center of the Ribbon and thicker at the sides , right where we see the edge of the Ribbon .
If we were farther away from the boundary , we would see no Ribbon , because all the ENAs would be re-ionized and dispersed in the intervening gas of the Local Cloud . "
The model developed by the Polish - US team suggests that the boundary between the Local Cloud and the Local Bubble might be not within a few light years from the Sun , as it was believed earlier , but within just a thousand of astronomical units , a thousand - fold closer .
This might mean that the Solar System could enter the million - degree Local Bubble cloud as early as the next century .
" Nothing unusual , the Sun frequently traverses various clouds of interstellar gas during its galactic journey , " comments Grzedzielski .
Such clouds are of very low density , much lower than the best vacuum obtained in Earth labs .
Once in , the heliosphere will reform and may shrink a little , the level of cosmic radiation entering the magnetosphere may rise a bit , but nothing more .
" Perhaps future generations will have to learn how to better harden their space hardware against stronger radiation , " suggests Grzedzielski .
IBEX is the latest in NASA 's series of low - cost , rapidly developed Small Explorers space missions .
Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , TX , leads and developed the mission with a team of US and international partners .
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , manages the Explorers Program for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington DC .

A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit by a creationism think tank and school that attempted to force the state of Texas to allow it to offer master 's degrees in science education .
In 2008 , the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board rejected the Dallas - based Institute for Creation Research 's application to offer master 's degrees , which taught science from a biblical perspective .
The institute 's graduate school sued in 2009 , claiming the board violated its constitutional right to free speech and religion .
' Disjointed , incoherent '
U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin found no merit in the institute 's claims and criticized its legal documents as " overly verbose , disjointed , incoherent , maundering and full of irrelevant information . "
In an e-mailed statement , school representatives said they were reviewing the decision and may appeal .
The National Center for Science Education , an Oakland , Calif . - based nonprofit that defends the teaching of evolution , cheered the decision .
" The Coordinating Board made a principled decision in the first place , and it is good to see it was upheld in a court of law , " said Glenn Branch , the center 's deputy director .
The Institute for Creation Research 's graduate school , which is based in California , has been offering master 's degrees in that state since 1981 , according to its website .
Aimed at aspiring Christian schoolteachers , the curriculum critiques evolution and champions a literal interpretation of the biblical account of creation .
Accredited in California
In California , the school is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools , an agency that is not recognized in Texas .
To operate its graduate school in Texas , the institute needed preliminary approval from the Coordinating Board and accreditation from a regional body , the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools .
The institute never got past its first hurdle .
After heated meetings packed with public speakers , board members denied the application .
" Religious belief is not science , " Texas Commissioner of Higher Education Raymund Paredes said at the time .
" Science and religious belief are surely reconcilable , but they are not the same thing . "

Posted by John , May 13th , 2010 - under Rugby league , Strikes .
The class struggle can erupt in the unlikeliest of places .
Last week some rugby league super stars began talking publicly about going on strike .
First , a bit of background .
For international readers rugby league is the dominant male winter sport in two Australian states – New South Wales and Queensland .
It has a salary cap system .
Each of the 16 clubs can only spend $ 4.2 million on player salaries , with a little leeway for other payments totalling about $ 400,000 on top of that .
Each club has a squad of 25 players , meaning their average remuneration is about $ 180,000 .
Salaries in fact range from a minimum of a bit over $ 50,000 up to about $ 500,000 .
By comparison the average wage in Australia is a little over $ 60,000 .
So while rugby league players might appear to be well paid compared to ordinary workers , the real story is who gets the major share of the rewards from the exploits of the players .
And surprise , surprise , the people who do the work do n’t receive the full value they create .
Their bosses do .
The National Rugby League has a television rights contract with a couple of media outlets .
One of them is Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox Sports pay - TV .
The other is the free to air Channel Nine , effectively owned by private equity group CVC Asia Pacific .
Rugby League is incredibly popular on both pay - TV and free to air .
Its combined audience is over 120 million , roughly equal to that of the other major male winter sport , Australian football .
The TV deal the Australian Football League ( AFL ) struck with TV stations is $ 760 million over five years .
The National Rugby League ( NRL ) deal , which ends in 2012 , is $ 500 million over 6 years .
There are two ways in which the deal robs players .
First the salary cap means that only just over $ 400 million of the $ 500 million is distributed to the players .
Second , the $ 500 million deal itself is much less than the AFL gets from media interests for an equivalent viewing audience .
In other words Fox Sports and CVC Asia -Pacific make more profit on either attracting subscribers or selling time during rugby league games to advertisers than happens for AFL .
The Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal , in which that club spent more than the cap on players and won two premierships as a result , has bought the salary cap issue to the fore .
So too have recent fairly high profile player defections overseas or to other codes .
The players are unhappy .
They do n’t believe they are being fairly rewarded .
The history of capitalism is the history of class struggle .
If players want to win better rewards for themselves then the best way to do that is to do what many workers around the world know or have shown has a chance of winning – going on strike .
This cuts off the flow of the profits players make for the media and NRL clubs and would concentrate their minds on the need to reward those who actually produce the profits for the big boys .
As the Builders Labourers Federation used to say , if you do n’t fight you lose .
And who knows .
If the players were to strike maybe other workers could follow suit to improve their own wages and conditions .
Armed with machine guns , members of the Zeta drug cartel from Mexico are attacking boats and robbing sailors of their loot — and gadgets — on a lake that straddles the Texas / Mexico border .
So reports a San Antonio , TX television news station , anyway :
If you go too far across the lake and past the international boundary bouy , you are in Mexican territory and subject to attacks by pirates toting assault weapons .
" It is unsafe in Mexico .
Do n't go to Mexico , " warned Game Warden Capt .
Fernando Cervantes .
" We can not cross over onto that side .
If a boat goes across , that 's it .
We stop there at the line . "
One man fishing on the lake Thursday , Lucas Garza , said he'd be staying away from the boundary .
" We 're not planning on going to that side , " he said .
" We just know there 's no good news on that side . "
He and his friends have heard the warnings about Zeta cartel pirates ambushing boats on the Mexican side , operating with virtual impunity as they steal cash and electronics at machine gun-point .

Loneliness is more prevalent among the young than those past retirement age , a survey suggests , amid profound changes in the way we live and interact .
Across all ages one in 10 people in the UK often feel lonely , the Mental Health Foundation has found , a state which can impact upon one 's physical health .
The charity highlights the decline of community and a growing focus on work .
Technology can isolate but is also an unrivalled means of connecting people , the poll of 2,256 people concludes .
The Lonely Society report described the generational differences uncovered in its survey as " striking " .
Nearly 60 % of those aged between 18 to 34 questioned spoke of feeling lonely often or sometimes , compared to 35 % of those aged over 55 .
The young people we work with tell us that talking to hundreds of people on social networks is not like having a real relationship and when they are using these sites they are often alone in their bedrooms
Sarah Brennan
Young Minds
But it is possible there are generational differences in the subjective interpretation of what it is to be lonely .
In addition , the survey did not break down the differences between the active 55 - year - old enjoying retirement and the frail , isolated 80 - year - old .
Chronic elderly isolation was brought to the fore earlier this year with the deaths of a Northamptonshire husband and wife , whose bodies were found in their frozen home in the middle of Britain 's coldest winter .
The changing nature of the family , with fewer children who themselves often move away , has increased the prospect of elderly isolation .
This has also become more likely as a result of longer life expectancies , the report noted .
But neighbourhoods have also changed , with the local services such as post offices that tended to form the heart of old communities on the decline .
The report also found gender differences , with more women than men reporting loneliness , and more likely to feel depressed as a result .
It highlighted the fact that the proportion of people living alone , both male and female , had doubled between 1972 and 2008 .
Facebook era
New technology meanwhile may be both a boon and a burden , the report suggested .
" Living in isolation and loneliness is a stark reality for thousands of older people today .
People over 65 are twice as likely as other age groups to spend over 21 hours of every day alone
Age UK
At one level , it has enabled people to make connections they might not otherwise have made , and virtual friendships can evolve into real - life relationships .
The report cites the example of the parenting website Netmums , which says that because of contacts made online 10,000 women meet face - to - face every month , reducing the sometimes intense sense of isolation new mothers can experience .
But there are also concerns that technology is being used as a replacement for genuine human interaction .
Nearly a third of young people questioned for the report said they spent too much time communicating with friends and families online when they should see them in person .
Whether this has any genuine biological impact is unclear , but it has been suggested that physical presence is needed for the hormone oxytocin to be released - believed to be the chemical process underpinning the relationship between social contact and healthy hearts .
Manhattan meetings Sarah Brennan , head of the charity YoungMinds , said : " The young people we work with tell us that talking to hundreds of people on social networks is not like having a real relationship and when they are using these sites they are often alone in their bedrooms .
" Loneliness is a big problem which we need to start to tackle .
In the last few years our communities have broken down and become atomised .
We need to foster these relationships again and invest in our young people 's wellbeing so that they have somewhere to go or to turn to when they are feeling lonely . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Our choices might make us lonely - I would n't blame modern life .
Delirium , UK Dr Peter Byrne of The Royal College of Psychiatrists said the report challenged the perception that loneliness was restricted to isolated , elderly " Eleanor Rigbys " , with its findings on the young .
He added : " Economic changes that disrupt people 's work - life balance and family life , and send people hundreds of miles for work , are likely get worse during this recession .
Openness about being lonely , and vulnerable friends and neighbours , is an important first step . "
But while many more of us may be living alone in cities , with some thought loneliness can be averted , the report suggested .
" For example , Manhattan in New York has 50 % lone households , more than anywhere else in the United States , yet its ' urban village ' model sustains social networks because people habitually use alternative meeting places , including cafes and public spaces , " the authors wrote .
" According to evolutionary psychology , cities could in fact be our perfect environment because of the demands they make on our complex social brains , but only if they are well designed . "

1. David Cameron is the adroit driver of the coalition .
He proposed an offer that the weakened Lib Dems could n't refuse .
His own strategy is to replace Tory nationalism with a 21st - century version of One - Nation " Whig " Conservatism , one that can appeal to urban and suburban multicultural Britain .
( See my article " The end of Thatcherism " at OurKingdom . )
Do n't blame Nick ; Labour was n't interested in changing .
2. Nick Clegg 's speech today confirms his commitment to the " modern liberty " agenda of rolling back the intrusive , database state .
It is a tremendously positive outcome of the coalition agreement and a framework of principle that helps bind it together .
Tragically , Labour were positive enemies of progress in this respect and do n't understand what has hit them .
Just because the BBC refuses to cover an issue does n't mean it is not important .
3 . But the coalition smacks of an attempt to create a new establishment ( male , public school , enlightened ) to replace the turpitude of New Labour 's political class .
While it is wonderful on liberty , noises about appointing swarms of new lords suggest an underlying attempt to preserve the old order .
The expenses scandal is n't over yet .
4 . The Tory aim is to win the next election outright .
The Lib Dems need a strategy that will leave them stronger not weaker when they leave the coalition .
If , as he told James Macintyre , Nick Clegg wants to be prime minister , he has to be better at playing chess than David Cameron .
5 . The Tories will be stupid to tell voters we can decide on our electoral system and then refuse to permit us the choice of a significantly different one .
They can't " restore trust " by spending millions on a referendum designed not to trust us .
The Lib Dems will be hammered , too , if they go along with this .
A proportional choice should be included in the referendum .
Liberty can only be safeguarded by democracy but democracy is the coalition 's political fault line .
6 . A new generation that grew up under the spin of New Labour , and for which the wit and facility of the web are second nature , is starting to mobilise against being fitted up by half - measures that preserve the old regime .
The demand for fair votes has taken to the streets under the colour of suffrage and added a new dimension to UK politics .
The purple revolution may pause for breath but it is likely to grow -- it is an irresistible claim , not a protest .
7. Britain is much better in many ways thanks to New Labour , but the new leaders will need not just to admit they were wrong on Iraq , but explain why they persisted in being wrong when so many of us , including the Lib Dems , were right .
A dishonest electoral system gave them many more seats than they deserved , but this will be corrected and they have no chance of expanding the support they need until they rethink what kind of a state they offer voters , and how we can be sure it will be both politically and economically honest , as well as creating policies that do n't need borrowed money .
If , like the Compass " A New Hope " conference sponsored by the New Statesman , Labour ignores the implications of its database state , then its cause is already hopeless and it will lose the next election .
8 . The desire to preserve the Union and prevent a boost for the SNP in Scotland was an important motive for Cameron 's offer of a coalition .
Otherwise , the government would have had one MP , rather than 12 , from north of the border .
But its effect might be to destroy the Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament elections next year .
The national question is a burning fuse that might be slowed but can't be extinguished .
9 . The coalition agreement stipulates that there will be a report on what to do about the West Lothian Question , that is to say , the unfairness of the present arrangements for the English ( England returned a Tory majority ) .
The official answer to the West Lothian Question has always been not to ask it .
Once England enters the mix as an acknowledged grievance , stand back !
10 .
The row over whether parliament can be forced to rewrite the fundamental rule that if a government loses the confidence of the House it has to resign shows that the British constitution 's famed flexibility has been tested to destruction .
To put it politely , the UK 's uncodified constitution is broken beyond repair .
The coalition wo n't whistle it back together again .
This could provide a way for Labour to be more democratic in its strategy than the Liberal - Conservative government .
11 . The " Portillo moment " of election night , signalling that something historic had happened , was Caroline Lucas 's victory .
The Greens have a politics of the totality , linking the economy and our environment to our democracy .
If " new politics " means anything , it means green .
The Greens need to grow .
12 . Will the dire state of the deficit and the coming cuts be used to preserve the dominance of the City and its economic system ?
Or is that system so obviously dysfunctional and deep cuts so likely to provoke rioting that the Conservatives ( for such they are ) will seek a " fair " way out of the mess to preserve the social order ?
No one understands what is going to happen to capitalism on a world scale .
All we know is that the UK is exceptionally exposed , not least thanks to the policies of Brown and Balls , and there is a fear that something dreadful awaits us just over the horizon .

Daniel Okrent , who served as the first public editor of The NYTimes and most recently authored the new book , Last Call : The Rise and Fall of Prohibition , was interviewed yesterday by Terry Gross on Fresh Air .
Here ’s how she kicked off the session :
GROSS : [ C ] an you see a style of activism or a moralistic streak in American politics today that you think is descended from the leaders of temperance ?
Mr. DANIEL OKRENT ( Author , “ Last Call : The Rise and Fall of Prohibition ” ) :
Well , I certainly think that styles of activism and political agitation come directly from what happened in the years leading up to Prohibition .
The issue was n’t entirely Prohibition .
That was a stand - in issue for a whole set of issues , just the same way today I think we could say that same - sex marriage is a stand - in issue .
If you tell me what you think about same - sex marriage , I can probably tell you what you think about 10 other things .
And Prohibition became the same sort of political football that people on either side would use trying to struggle to get it toward their goal , which was control of the country .
But the parallels do n’t stop with same - sex marriage .
How about race ?
GROSS : So if you believed in Prohibition , what are some of the other things you were likely to believe in ?
Mr. OKRENT : Well , there was a mix .
I should n’t oversimplify , but it largely had to do with a xenophobic , anti-immigrant feeling that arose in the American Middle West among white , native - born Protestants .
It also had a strong racist element to it .
Prohibition was a tool that the white South could use to keep down the black population .
In fact , they used Prohibition really to keep liquor away from black people but not from white people .
Does anyone see an echo in that in the recently reduced but still unjust disparities in drug sentencing between rock and powdered cocaine ?
The parallels continue … medicinal marijuana liquor :
[ W ] ithin two or three years of the enactment of the Volstead Act , you could go into virtually any city in the country and buy a prescription for $ 3 from your local physician and then take it your local pharmacy and have it filled and go home with a pint of liquor every 10 days .
And this is really how many of the large distilleries in Kentucky and elsewhere in the middle of the country stayed in business throughout the Prohibition years .
A fun fact : medicinal liquor sales helped Walgreens go from 20 stores in Chicago in 1920 to a chain of 525 stores nationwide by the end of the decade .
Okrent calls himself an economic determinist and , speaking from that perspective , says he expects “ the need for tax revenue … will lead to legalization of marijuana . ”
He points out that , ironically , “ it became harder to get a drink after Prohibition than it had been during Prohibition . ”
Legalization brought regulation and a decline in drinking .
( Alcohol consumption in the U.S. peaked again in the 1970s and is today somewhere between there and the post - Prohibition low . )
Some of us suspect legalization and regulation would work the same with pot .
Obama , in this policy shift , is moving us in the right direction .
Ron Paul Wants to go far further .
He submitted a statement to the Congressional Record recognizing next week as Hemp History Week and urging his colleagues to pass legislation legalizing hemp farming .
For all that , the book sounds relevant and fascinating .
Here ’s more …
The Daily Beast excerpts the section calling the long - held beliefs about Joe Kennedy ’s bootlegging business bunk !
Tyler Cowen says the book is very good , noting that the introduction of the income tax made Prohibition fiscally feasible .
His review ran in Business Week .

When developers at Valve make a game , from the moment a single room has been crafted in their Hammer editor , they playtest it .
Outsiders come in once a week , with no previous experience of the game , and play with whatever 's been created .
The developers must watch without comment , and observe how the player encounters the game .
This is not how Another World was developed .
Released in 1991 , Another World was the one - man project from Eric Chahi , a visually striking 2D platform game about a man transported to an alien world after a disaster with his particle acceleration experiment .
( Which oddly enough is the very same premise as Outcast . )
It 's minimalist in many senses - you have two action buttons ( run and fire on one , jump on the other ) , and movement .
With this , you and a friendly alien must escape an enemy complex , a series of caves , and a tower .
Valve 's process is designed to ensure that its games are as intuitive , as user - friendly , as is possible .
If someone gets stuck at a certain point , and is unsure where to go next , Valve redesigns that area so that subtle , ambient clues give suggestions to the player almost unconsciously .
I must have restarted at this point over a hundred billion times .
The reason you thought to look up and spot a potential route in Half - Life 2 : Episode 2 ?
That 's because the broken fizzing wires that caught your eye were put there after someone else never thought to look up .
Another World does not provide broken ladders .
Possible to finish in under an hour - although it 's impossible to do so on your first playthrough - Another World only lasts longer because for the most part you really do n't know what to do , nor how to do it .
Mostly your goal is to reach the right side of the screen , but just how or why that can't be done is not flagged up to you .
What is blocking your buddy 's progress through a tunnel ?
Why , it 's the dangling lampshade five screens away that in no visible way changes anything above it when you shoot it down .
Games have unquestionably changed .
From first - person shooters to point - and - click adventures , third - person action to platform , what is understood as " difficulty " has changed .
Difficulty is a setting , a lever we pull to decide how many bullets the enemies should be able to absorb , the density of monsters , or the rarity of med packs and ammo .
Back then , difficulty was how incredibly bloody hard it was to play something successfully .
Sexy alien babes ' bottoms !
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Another World is that it will quite happily let you charge off in completely the wrong direction to your absolutely certain death , because you had n't completed a task that would have been found if you 'd chosen a different , equally unmarked exit than the one that initially appealed to you .
But your death seems to be your fault , so you attempt that route again .
And again .
And again .
Trial and error could not be more out of fashion .
In fact , the necessity of trial and error can now be considered a failing in a game .
Were I reviewing an FPS that repeatedly required me to make blind guesses about which of three corridors would render me helpless to an instant death , I would criticise it for this .
Dead ends are one thing , death ends are another .
We want a game , more than anything , to be fair .
Another World certainly is n't fair .
One screen sums this up perfectly .
You 're in a series of tunnels , but you can only see about a metre either side of your character , the rest of the screen enveloped in darkness .
You can roll left or right , dropping into blank spaces .
Some of them have spikes at the bottom !
So the only way to get through the level is to fail until you do n't .
A restart at the top of the screen prevents this from becoming too infuriating , but it very much removes any element of skill from the process .
It 's a process of elimination .
While that stands as a good , simple example of what I 'm discussing , it 's not true of the game as a whole .
You 're still forced to use trial and error , but mostly during long distances across complex screens of tough fights and tricky jumps .
Failing means going back to the previous checkpoint and starting the whole process over again .
Australian Labor MP
David Campbell resigned today after being filmed leaving a gay sauna , the Herald Sun reports :
" Campbell is accused of using a ministerial car to go to a gay club in Anzac Parade , Kensington , in Sydney 's Eastern Suburbs , on Tuesday evening , Channel 7 reported tonight .
It is alleged he stayed for two hours at Ken's , also known as KKK , which is a popular gay sauna .
The club lies in Ms Keneally 's electorate of Heffron .
The club has a $ 22 entry fee and assures clients discretion as they offer services for men who prefer men .
TimeOut Sydney described Ken's as ' today 's most popular gay sauna …
The iconic sauna has been servicing queer Sydney 's sexual appetites for more than 25 years .
Between the dimly lit steam room , sizzling sauna , glory hole maze , dark room and porn theatre , Kens caters for every taste … Butt Naked nights are towel - free so patrons get to size up their prey before they commit to getting a room , while weekday Lunchtime Specials pull in a crowd who take the concept of Happy Meal to a whole new level . ' "
Campbell is married with two children .
Said Campbell in a statement : " I have resigned as Minister for Transport and Roads for personal reasons , not for any reasons relating to my Ministerial duties .
I apologise to my wife , family , colleagues , staff and the community for letting them down .
This will be a very difficult time for my family and friends and I ask for their privacy to be respected . "
Same Same reports : " Channel 7 allege that Mr Campbell spent two hours at Kens .
Campbell has been member the Wollongong seat of Keira since 1999 , and has campaigned strongly as a family man .
He is the former NSW police minister . "
SOME time in the not - too - distant future , three ships will circle the Sun .
Inside their holds , they will each carry a cube of gold platinum , floating in zero gravity .
At some point , the ships will arm their lasers and fire upon each other - across five million kilometres of space .
Result ?
If the world 's most famous scientist is right , the cubes will wobble a bit and the last piece of Einstein 's theory of relativity will be proven correct .
And if it all sounds a bit fantastical , it is n't .
The mission - dubbed the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna , or LISA - is a frighteningly expensive collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency aimed at discovering gravitational waves .
According to the theory , gravitational waves form when black holes are pulled ever faster through space by larger black holes .
If scientists can find a way to detect these waves - which are too weak to detect from anywhere near the Earth with regular instruments - then they might have found a way to study them .
Because the problem with studying black holes , if you 're a scientist who looks for such things , is that they are so dense they can't be seen .
" No light or radiation escapes from inside them , " Glasgow University professor Sheila Rown told The Telegraph .
" Gravitational waves from the warped spacetime around black holes could give us new ways of looking at them .
" We could also learn about the state of matter inside collapsed stars . "
Just how important the state of matter inside collapsed stars is to everyday life on Earth is anyone 's guess - as it has n't been discovered yet - but NASA and ESA believe it 's a worthwhile project .
They 're particularly interested in the " galactic song " emitted from dying stars that resounds through the universe for millions of years , and even " the faint whispers of waves generated shortly after the Big Bang " .
When LISA 's finished , it will be the biggest scientific machine ever built .
It wo n't be launched until around 2020 , but doubters will get their first confirmation of the project sometime next year , when the two agencies launch LISA Pathfinder , an experimental mission purely to test whether the technology is on track .
If that works , it 's all systems go for the full lasers , gold cubes and sun-orbiting spaceship treatment .
And more than 100 years after publishing his theories , Einstein may finally get his perfect marks .
Every morning at 8 am , four men with toolboxes set off for work , potter about a bit , and toddle off home again .
They slope off for coffee at ten , cigarettes at twelve and a long lunch at two .
When they get back to work , there 's just time to have a break for coffee and cigarettes before wrapping up for the day , job done .
Mostly , they sit about scratching , reading the paper and playing cards , keeping an ear open in case anyone drops by – when they try to look busy .
A bit of sweeping here , some " arranging " there , before returning to what they were doing .
Nothing in particular .
It could be any workplace anywhere , but this time their boss knows all about their antics .
In fact , it 's his idea .
It is a cunning ruse , the embodiment of Valencia 's modus operandi over the last year : pretend everything 's OK , perfectly normal , and in a funny sort of way it will be .
Ignore it and it really will go away .
A poll in the Valencian paper Super Deporte this morning asks fans to rate the year .
The options are " good " , " very good " and " excellent " .
It 's quite a turnaround .
Twelve months ago , they would have expected to choose between " bad " , " very bad " and " after you with the noose " .
Better still , there 's a chance they 'll be able to carry on regardless next year too .
For over a year now , the four workers have " worked " on the second greatest white elephant in Spanish football after Dmytro Chygrynskiy : Valencia 's € 320 m ( £ 278 m ) , 75,000 - seater new Mestalla stadium .
Alongside , a spattering of new bars opened with imaginative names like " Stadium Bar " .
But , four workmen apart , there 's no one to drink there , or in the " New Mestalla " or the " The Corner Flag " .
They 're still drinking at Manolo 's with its ropey sausages and football memorabilia – and its prime location .
Right outside the old Mestalla .
Where Valencia still play .
Valencia 's new stadium should have opened by now ; instead , it 's a 12 - storey , 89,000 square metre building site .
With no building going on .
Work began in August 2007 ; with Valencia € 547 m in debt , owing more than € 50 m to construction companies Bertolín and FCC , it stopped again over a year ago .
The only people who turn up now are the four workmen and they only pretend .
Their job is to make sure Valencia do n't get punished for abandonment of a building site .
After all , they can hardly afford a massive fine on top of everything else .
Nou Mestalla was a symbol of Valencia 's failure , the millstone that was going to drag them under .
Useless former president Juan Soler had lumbered the club with a colossal debt and two stadiums – one they could n't sell and one they could n't afford to build .
When Vicente Soriano took over , he said he had a buyer , an investor and cash but he did n't .
His investor , a company called Delporte , took their logo from a colouring - in book and did n't pay for their shares .
Valencia would have to sell all their players .
They were heading for the Second Division B . Or out of business .
They did n't .
In fact , the symbol of their failure became the symbol splashed on the back of their shirts .
And although that might have been pretty bloody cheeky , and the stadium remains unsold , Valencia are still standing .
David Villa , David Silva and Juan Mata are still there , and far from ending up in the eight - team , four - group Second Division B they now find themselves in very different league : the Champions League after defeating Espanyol 2 - 0 on Saturday night with two from Nikola Zigic , virtually securing third place , their best position in four years .
With three games left , they have a six - point lead over Mallorca and an eight - point lead over Sevilla , plus better head - to - head goal difference .
A solitary point in three matches – against Xérez , Tenerife and Villarreal – will guarantee them a return to the Champions League .
With the money it brings , it may even guarantee their future .
The question is how did they do it ?
The answer is those workers .
And a little help from friends in very high places .
Sometimes even a rubbish hand can be a winning hand if you know how to ride it out – and when it comes to poker faces and playing hardball , few beat Valencia president Manolo Llorente .
When he took over in the summer , invited in by the club 's creditors , Bancaja – which is owed over € 200 m by Valencia and had obliged the club to let it on to the board – Llorente decided that the worst thing Valencia could do was bang on about being doomed and fret over the stadium : it would only bring fatalism upon them and prices tumbling .
Few things excite other clubs and weaken your hand like a fire sale , so he pretended there was n't a fire at all .
Besides , he reasoned , what 's the point of selling a € 40 m footballer to cover a € 547 m debt ?
You might as well fix the Titanic with a puncture repair kit .
So , he cancelled the sales of Villa , Silva and Mata , insisting that he would only accept a " scandalously scandalous " offer , quietly downscaled stadium plans , refused to be rushed back into constructing it , handed the job of silently selling Mestalla to an Englishman called Richard Ellis , and , with sleight of hand and a tug on the heart , kept the club 's creditors and its other " owners " at bay .
First came the share issue , with € 92 m worth of shares new shares created .
3,981 fans were persuaded to buy shares at € 720 each share , raising € 18.7 m .
Essentially they bought a blank piece of paper , a certificate of how much they loved Valencia with no real , tangible value .
But it had a huge symbolic value , the perfect leverage for a spot of emotional blackmail – enough to allow Llorente to show the Valencian government , the Generalitat , the strength of support and lay bare the risk implicit in allowing Valencia to go to the wall .
Bancaja , owned by the Generalitat , was persuaded not to call in its debt and the Valencia Fundación , also a governmental concern , stumped up the remaining € 73.3 m to complete the share issue .
Suddenly , Soriano and Delporte 's shares were diluted to irrelevance , reduced to just 4.6 % .
Llorente and the Generalitat were in control .
All Valencia had to do was raise € 44 m a season in cuts , sales or income to cover their annual deficit .
The € 547 m could wait until the stadium was sold ; work at the new stadium could too .
The fundamental problem remains but the desperation had dissipated ; psychologically , this is a different club now .
The assumption has been that next summer Valencia will sell – this week , there have been reports of Villa joining Barcelona and , unlike last year , he'd be prepared to move abroad too – but Valencia believe they can withstand bids for him and Silva .
Unless they are scandalously scandalous .
With the Champions League money , they might be able to stay on budget with a solitary , and smaller , sale , such as Mata .
Llorente 's gamble has , in the short term at least , paid off .
He has also changed the terms of the debate .
This has n't been an easy season .
Unai Emery has clashed with Joaquín Sánchez , Miguel Brito , Banega and Chori Domínguez and may not continue as coach , the cup exits stung , and many think Valencia have been too conservative and worryingly weak against the bigger sides .
Valladolid , Almería , Osasuna , Athletic and Espanyol account for more than half their points , while they were beaten in Madrid , Barcelona , Sevilla and Mallorca , and lie 24 points off second place .
Some think they should have achieved more with the players they 've got .
The point , though , is that they have those players at all , and may even have them next season too .
Last summer , that was unthinkable .
Now at least the complaints are all about the football .
No one cares about the empty stadium on the other side of town any more .
Except the four men whose job it is to pretend they do .
Talking points
• Speaking of Mallorca , they beat Athletic in Bilbao to keep hold of the final Champions League place after Sevilla had – inevitably – beaten Atlético 3 - 1 in Seville .
It seems that not only do the media , the players and the fans think that Atléti no longer care about the league , so do the refs .
As the phrase goes , it 's seemed very easy to give penalties against Atléti yesterday .
After all , the ref probably reasoned , they do n't mind …
• It 's getting very tight at the bottom .
( Yes , yes , you can insert your own cheap gag here ) .
Tenerife 's victory was not enough to get them out of the bottom three but only four points separate them in 18th from Osasuna in 12th .
In total , nine teams are separated by nine points but the bottom three has n't changed .
Not yet , anyway .
Osasuna , Almería , Sporting , Zaragoza , Racing , and Málaga could all conceivably be dragged into relegation places .
Time is running out but Valladolid and Xérez , who got a 90th - minute winner in an offside position , could still get out of it .
Just .
Sporting and Almería in particular have collapsed .
So have Racing , who sold their soul the day they sold Sergio Canales .
They have won just two in 16 .
• This week 's spat was in Valladolid , where Getafe coach Míchel and Valladolid coach Javier Clemente are n't talking to each other and refused to shake hands .
Their rivalry goes all the way back to when Clemente was the Spain manager and was reckoned to have brought a premature end to Míchel 's playing career but this particular problem comes from an article Míchel wrote for Marca a while back in which he described Clemente as an ex-coach , a man who still clings to his only ever success – over 25 years ago .
" Clemente , " Míchel wrote , " is still on the gabarra [ the barge the Athletic players and staff took down the river to celebrate the title in 1984 ] " .
Results Tenerife 2 - 1 Racing , Malaga 1 - 1 Sporting , Valladolid 0- 0 Getafe , Xérez 2 - 1 Almería , Deportivo 0 - 1 Zaragoza , Espanyol 0 - 2 Valencia , Villarreal 1 - 4 Barcelona , Sevilla 3 - 1 Atlético , Madrid 3 - 2 Osasuna , Athletic 1 - 3 Mallorca .

Groupon.com is a website that promotes a “ deal of the day ” where businesses can offer their product or service for at least 50 percent off .
Groupon makes its money by taking a significant percentage of the price .
The Creation Museum had signed a contract to advertise to the Cincinnati area , offering our Individual Annual Pass and Family Annual Pass on Groupon.com for one day at 50 percent off .
On the week the advertisement was to appear , Groupon called to inform us that the marketing department of Groupon had decided that the Creation Museum was “ too controversial , ” and they canceled our contract .
Some of the businesses they feature for our area are attractions such as laser tag , spas , lawn care , etc .
However , in other markets ( such as Atlanta ) they have featured the local natural history museum — which of course is totally evolutionary and teaches children that man is an evolved animal — but I guess that is not controversial !
Apparently , because the Creation Museum is a Christian facility with a walk through the Bible , that is “ controversial ! ”
A lot of homeschoolers have used Groupon to get good deals — but maybe they will think twice about using a company that considers the Creation Museum ( and by implication , the Bible and the Christian faith ) “ too controversial ” to allow us to advertise .
We certainly do n’t need Groupon — and apparently they do n’t need our business .
Maybe they do n’t want any Christian ’s business ?

Have an end ( Luke 22:37 )
For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
Our Master , the Lord Jesus Christ , set a pattern for us : when all looks bad , we remember that it will all come to an end and fulfillment when we go to Heaven .

US scientists say they have discovered enormous plumes of oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico , suggesting that the leak from the blown - out well operated by BP could be far worse than previously estimated .
They are quoted in the New York Times as saying one of the plumes is 16 kilometres long , nearly five - kilometres wide and 91 metres thick .
The scientists say the plumes are depleting the oxygen in the gulf , prompting fears that the process could eventually kill much of the nearby sea life .
The Interior Secretary Ken Salazar says the public has a right to know that the leak will be capped soon .
" That cancer has got be stopped and so we have been working relentlessly in ... [ assembling ] the best group of scientists around the world , working with Secretary Chu and myself , that are providing an oversight to BP and making sure that everything that can be done that holds the well down is being done , " he said .
But BP earlier said it was confident it would soon be able to stop the flow of oil .
The US government has now approved the use of dispersants under water near the source of the leak and BP says they are starting to work .
Engineers are also using underwater robots in an attempt to reinsert a tube surrounded by a stopper into the broken pipe .
They hope this will help them siphon the oil to the surface .
Doug Suttles from BP says the operation is continuing and he is confident it will start working in the next few hours .
" We 're in the process of setting up the riser insertion tube , " he said .
" This is the method to contain the flow .
This does n't stop the flow but it contains the flow .
" We hope to have that tool inserted by some time late tonight ( local time ) .
It 's back on the seabed . "
The White House is calling for immediate clarification that BP will pay for the whole clean - up operation .
In a letter to BP , the interior secretary Ken Salazar and the homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano say the public has a right to know the company 's true intentions .
The letter from the Obama administration effectively asks BP to make clear how much it will pay for the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Last week the chair of BP's American operations said he believed that statutory $ 75 million cap on a company 's liability for oil spills was irrelevant .
He added that BP will pay for all clean - up costs and legitimate damages claims .
Meanwhile , BP 's chief executive appears to have dismissed the massive oil slick caused by the gusher as being blown out of proportion .
In an interview in Britain 's Guardian newspaper , Tony Hayward described the Gulf of Mexico is " a very big ocean " , saying the volume of oil and dispersant going into it is " tiny " compared to the total volume of water .

Special By By Carol Forsloff May 8 , 2010 in Politics Racial profiling is the concern of many folk about the new Arizona immigration bill .
In other parts of the world , race is used as an excuse for crimes and the reason for denial of certain benefits .
Is race a good card in the deck ?
For Bolton , a real estate agent in Natchitoches , the issue is responsibility .
She is a successful business woman on a main street in a small town with decided opinions .
Her embrace of folks regardless of race is seen in who she hires and promotes and who she consorts with in after work hours .
Representatives of both African Americans , Creoles and folks of predominantly European ancestry people work in her office , all eagerly talk about Bolton .
Fair ?
Yes , they say .
Good at her work ?
Yes indeed .
Biased at work ?
Not at all .
So why does Bolton maintain race not a good card in the deck ?
" Race is an excuse , sometimes used to avoid taking responsibility , " Bolton declares .
" The people I hire are the kind of people who are n't afraid to work hard .
Each person is treated fairly and treats the other person exactly the same way .
No one says if he or she can't sell a house , that it 's because of their color . "
" Is there a race problem in Natchitoches ? " she was asked .
" Of course , there is , " Bolton said .
" Who would n't admit that ?
But the problem cuts both ways these days .
Do I deny some people have it harder than others ?
No , lots of people have had to work twice as hard to get where they are .
But know what ?
They do , and they teach us something by doing that .
They become people we all admire .
They set examples for others . "
Natchitoches , Louisiana is deep South , just about as deep as one gets .
It is acknowledged by everyone , including Mayor Wayne McCullen that race is the white and black elephant in almost every room .
McCullen often says , " I wish people could just get on with it .
Not everything everybody does is targeted towards race .
Sometimes folks do n't get what they want for an event or an idea just because it 's been looked at as not being worthwhile .
But race is the reason in spite of even good intentions . "
Miss Presley receives plaque as Natchitoches Treasure in 2008 from Mayor Wayne McCullen Carol Forsloff Jane Kiley in Yuma , Arizona , hires Mexican Americans to work in front offices , parties with them and buddies with some of these same people after work .
She lived in Hawaii for approximately 30 years , owned companies with diverse groups of people , and has often stood up against injustice and gone out of her way to do it .
In an event where one of her African American employees had been stopped by a policeman on a main street in Honolulu , Jane intervened fast when she saw it .
She immediately went over to check to see that her employee had not been treated unfairly .
Kiley said , when asked about the Arizona immigration bill , much the same thing McCullen , Bolten and even Bill Cosby have said .
" I get angry when people are treated unfairly .
But a very high percentage of our law enforcement people in Arizona are Mexican Americans .
They are sensitive as well about how people are treated .
Are they going to pick up people of their same nationality just because they are brown ?
I do n't think so ? "
" Will other people do that and does n't the law create problems for that ? "
Kiley responded , echoing Bolten as well , " Yes , there will be problems .
Some people almost immediately use race as the factor without knowing anything else .
That 's a problem , I think , preventing us all from just forging ahead . "
Jane Kiley is the owner of Hunter Employment Company that hires legal Mexican American immigrants .
Carol Forsloff
Enter a room in Natchitoches , Louisiana as a stranger ; and in very little time you will hear people say something about race , that begins with the word " they , " highlighting what some folks think of others as different .
Still some of these same people have close friends of every race , go to church , out for dinner and are involved with social and political groups across racial lines .
Those are issues as well , that Mayor McCullen and other politicians have noticed .
Many hope for some answer about the race issue but struggle with it as they try to make decisions in either running government or in their daily lives , according to those who believe race is n't a good card in the deck .
So what are the answers ?
Responsibility within communities is underlined by key leaders and those who want to be .
In a discussion about what that means , a group of black leaders gathered to talk about Bill Cosby 's attitude of taking responsibility one to another , as parents , as neighbors and as support within black communities .
Bill Cosby espouses taking responsibility as a way to end racial problems and difficulties between and among communities .

The clock is ticking , when are we going to realize that we are not presently competitive in today 's global market , when are going to realize that the days of industrial blue collar employment are gone .
When are we going to realize that it takes a village to raise a child ?
When are we going to realize that investing in , and guiding our youth , is the way to break the cycle which holds us back from making forward progress ?
When are we going to realize that we 've had ENOUGH tribal strife in our black communities ?

Janice Bolton in Natchitoches , Louisiana does n't think so .
Jane Kiley in Yuma , Arizona does n't think so .
Even celebrities like Bill Cosby do n't think so .
There are others , as well .
Now what do people say about that race card that might give clues about whether it should be the first card that 's played in the game ?
For Bolton , a real estate agent in Natchitoches , the issue is responsibility .
She is a successful business woman on a main street in a small town with decided opinions .
Her embrace of folks regardless of race is seen in who she hires and promotes and who she consorts with in after work hours .
Representatives of both African Americans , Creoles and folks of predominantly European ancestry people work in her office , all eagerly talk about Bolton .
Fair ?
Yes , they say .
Good at her work ?
Yes indeed .
Biased at work ?
Not at all .
So why does Bolton maintain race not a good card in the deck ?
" Race is an excuse , sometimes used to avoid taking responsibility , " Bolton declares .
" The people I hire are the kind of people who are n't afraid to work hard .
Each person is treated fairly and treats the other person exactly the same way .
No one says if he or she can't sell a house , that it 's because of their color . "
" Is there a race problem in Natchitoches ? " she was asked .
" Of course , there is , " Bolton said .
" Who would n't admit that ?
But the problem cuts both ways these days .
Do I deny some people have it harder than others ?
No , lots of people have had to work twice as hard to get where they are .
But know what ?
They do , and they teach us something by doing that .
They become people we all admire .
They set examples for others .
" Natchitoches , Louisiana is deep South , just about as deep as one gets .
It is acknowledged by everyone , including Mayor Wayne McCullen that race is the white and black elephant in almost every room .
McCullen often says , " I wish people could just get on with it .
Not everything everybody does is targeted towards race .
Sometimes folks do n't get what they want for an event or an idea just because it 's been looked at as not being worthwhile .
But race is the reason in spite of even good intentions .
" Jane Kiley in Yuma , Arizona , hires Mexican Americans to work in front offices , parties with them and buddies with some of these same people after work .
She lived in Hawaii for approximately 30 years , owned companies with diverse groups of people , and has often stood up against injustice and gone out of her way to do it .
In an event where one of her African American employees had been stopped by a policeman on a main street in Honolulu , Jane intervened fast when she saw it .
She immediately went over to check to see that her employee had not been treated unfairly .
Kiley said , when asked about the Arizona immigration bill , much the same thing McCullen , Bolten and even Bill Cosby have said .
" I get angry when people are treated unfairly .
But a very high percentage of our law enforcement people in Arizona are Mexican Americans .
They are sensitive as well about how people are treated .
Are they going to pick up people of their same nationality just because they are brown ?
I do n't think so ?
" " Will other people do that and does n't the law create problems for that ? "
Kiley responded , echoing Bolten as well , " Yes , there will be problems .
Some people almost immediately use race as the factor without knowing anything else .
That 's a problem , I think , preventing us all from just forging ahead .
" Enter a room in Natchitoches , Louisiana as a stranger ; and in very little time you will hear people say something about race , that begins with the word " they , " highlighting what some folks think of others as different .
Still some of these same people have close friends of every race , go to church , out for dinner and are involved with social and political groups across racial lines .
Those are issues as well , that Mayor McCullen and other politicians have noticed .
Many hope for some answer about the race issue but struggle with it as they try to make decisions in either running government or in their daily lives , according to those who believe race is n't a good card in the deck .

Brown or black versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person ’s problem .

We have to start holding each other to a higher standard .
We cannot blame the white people any longer . "
Folks criticize Cosby for not understanding the black community , for not standing up for it .
Some call him a " race traitor , " and there are discussions about whether or not the middle class community is out of touch with the needs of African Americans .
Still there are others who echo Cosby 's words and wonder about having a different direction that could impact how people deal with each other so that the race card is n't the first one pulled out for the game .
D. Ruffian , a moderator of discussion surrounding Bill Cosby 's statements about the need to do better in black communities in parenting and taking responsibility .

" Chris Moerdyk in News 24 looks at this issue beyond the United States into countries such as South Africa where the race card is also played in order to excuse crimes and very bad dealings .
He speaks strongly about using culture and race as excuses for doing harm to society as a whole and for hiding behind these issues instead of taking responsibility for one 's individual behavior .
He writes , " It seems you can get away with anything these days by using culture as an excuse .
And I 'm getting sick of it .
" Moerdyk finds support from Kevin Powell , a young politician , community organizer and writer of eight books underlined the same thesis during the election of Barack Obama in the discussion of race and what youth now believe should be done in an article written in the Huffington Post in 2008 .
" I certainly acknowledge and appreciate what the Civil Righters have done , but we younger African Americans are saying now , loudly , the jig is up and it is time for you to go , especially if you have not created hope and plans of action for our communities .

WASHINGTON —
The federal government has a large rainy day fund on hand to help mitigate the expanding damage on the Gulf Coast , generated by a tax on oil for use in cases like the Deepwater Horizon spill .
Up to $ 1 billion of the $ 1.6 billion reserve could be used to compensate for losses from the accident , as much as half of it for what is sometimes a major category of costs : damage to natural resources like fisheries and other wildlife habitats .
Under the law that established the reserve , called the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , the operators of the offshore rig face no more than $ 75 million in liability for the damages that might be claimed by individuals , companies or the government .
The fund was set up by Congress in 1986 but not financed until after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska in 1989 .
In exchange for the limits on liability , the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 imposed a tax on oil companies , currently 8 cents for every barrel they produce in this country or import .
Bangkok 's tourist heartland a ' no go ' zone as clashes leave 21 dead and over 800 wounded
Britons yesterday joined a mass exodus of tourists from Bangkok after at least 21 people were killed in bloody anti-government demonstrations .
Soldiers shot dead 16 ' Red shirt ' protesters demanding that the Thai parliament should be dissolved and elections called .
Four soldiers , including a colonel , died during pitched battles on Saturday night as protesters seized army personnel carriers .
A Japanese cameraman with Reuters was also killed .
[ caption ]
Bullet casings , pools of blood and shattered military vehicles littered the streets near Khaosan Road , an area in the Thai capital popular with backpackers .
Among Britons who fled were teachers Lorraine McKenzie and Kim Shilton , who were hoping to get to the island of Koh Samui .
Miss Shilton , 34 , from Sutton Coldfield , West Midlands , said : ' We were in our room in the Buddy Hotel when we heard what seemed like fireworks .
We rushed out to look but security guards barricaded us inside .
[ caption ]
' There was a huge melee outside .
Then after a while there was a big bang .
Bombs were going off , people were shooting , and the Thai hotel staff members were trying to keep all their guests inside all along the road . '
The Foreign Office stopped short of advising travellers not to visit the country , but said they should take ' extreme caution ' .
Protesters have rejected talk of negotiations after a month - long stand - off escalated into what has become Thailand 's worst political violence in nearly two decades .
Red Shirts showed off a pile of weapons they had captured from army troops during Saturday 's fighting , including rifles and heavy caliber machine - gun rounds .
Some wore confiscated army riot gear as they posed for photographs on the ruined military vehicles that lay abandoned .

Thai troops fired rubber bullets at demonstrators as they moved in to clear a protest site in the biggest confrontation in the month - long campaign for new elections
Violence erupted on Saturday when troops tried to clear one of the protest sites and ended when they retreated .
At least 874 people were injured in what some are calling the ' Battle for Bangkok ' .
But protesters continued to occupy their two main bases yesterday - one in the capital 's historic district and another on its main upscale shopping boulevard .
Protesters yesterday held a procession for the dead near their rally site in historic Bangkok .
Marching with Buddhist monks , they held aloft red coffins and carried photos of the victims .
One mother called her son ' a hero ' before breaking down in tears .
Protesters also broke into a satellite communications complex in a northern Bangkok suburb , forcing the operators to restore their People Channel television station , which the government has twice shut down .
Spokesman Panithan Wattanayakorn said the government 's objective was to avoid more violence and ' to return the city to normal ' , but indicated there was no clear solution .

But red shirt leader Weng Tokirakarn said : ' The time for negotiation is up .
We do n't negotiate with murderers .
' We have to keep fighting , ' he said , adding the protesters had not planned any action in Bangkok yesterday ' out of respect for the dead ' .
Among those killed was Japanese cameraman father - of - two Hiro Muramoto , 43 , who worked for the Thomson Reuters news agency .

Reuters said he was shot in the chest after Thai soldiers fired rubber bullets into crowds and live ammunition in the air to dislodge protesters from encampments in the capital .
During the violence , two demonstrators and a Buddhist monk were badly beaten while a Japanese tourist wearing a red shirt was also clubbed by soldiers until he was rescued by bystanders .
Khao San Road resembled a war zone , a Reuters photographer said .
Shop windows were shattered , cars were smashed and many people lay wounded on the street .

He said soldiers had been asked to retreat and urged the demonstrators to do the same .
However , the continuous sound of gunfire and explosions filled the streets on Saturday night .

The Red Shirts , members of the United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorships , are demanding that Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve Parliament and call an election .
On Friday , Mr Vejjajiva was forced to declare a state of emergency in Bangkok following outbreaks of violence .
Mr Vejjajiva said the move – which gave the security forces sweeping powers to tackle the anti-government unrest – would help restore order .
It came hours after thousands of protesters had marched on parliament forcing MPs to flee the building .
Barricaded shopping district
Tens of thousands also remained in Bangkok 's main shopping district , a stretch of upscale department stores and five - star hotels held for a week by the mostly rural and working - class red shirts who say they have been marginalised in a country with one of Asia 's widest disparities between rich and poor .
The red shirts used taxis and pick - up trucks to barricade themselves in that area , and expanded their control to include several more blocks .
Hundreds of riot police who massed at one end retreated after being surrounding by red shirts .
Protesters sleep outside a shopping mall in Bangkok after the government blocked an opposition TV station and dozens of websites as they tried to control the rallies
Into evening , many people lined the main street cheering as protesters waving red flags packed pick - up trucks which streamed into the area .
Some climbed up electricity poles to cover closed - circuit cameras with flags to stop police surveillance .
The violence comes exactly a year after about 10,000 of the supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra brought traffic in Bangkok to a standstill for several days , occupying major intersections and sparking Thailand 's worst political violence in 18 years .
In those protests , red shirts hijacked petrol tankers , torched dozens of public buses and hurled petrol bombs at troops until the army imposed order .
Two people were killed and 123 wounded .
The latest protests , however , involve more than five times as many protesters spread across several areas of the city .
The protesters say Abhisit lacks a popular mandate after coming to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote following a court ruling that dissolved a pro-Thaksin ruling party .

They want immediate elections that Thaksin 's allies would be well placed to win .
The red shirts have won new support from Bangkok 's urban poor but have angered middle classes , many of whom regard them as misguided slaves to Thaksin , a wily telecoms tycoon who fled into exile to avoid a jail term for graft .
Hundreds also forced their way into the governor 's office compound in the northern city of Chiang Mai and hundreds more broke into a town hall in Udon Thani in the northeast .
The government declared a state of emergency in Bangkok on Wednesday to control the protests after red shirts broke into the grounds of parliament , forcing some officials including the deputy prime minister to flee by helicopter .
10 Things You Ought To Know : Final Fantasy XIII
by Brian Bentley [ Tuesday , 11th of May 2010 - 06:18 PM ]
The voice acting is not movie quality .
Yes , the Japanese voice track was not included on your PS3 disc .
Get over it .
While it may not be the best voice over I ’ve ever heard , it certainly is n’t the worst .
The story is ludicrous .
For anyone who has played a Final Fantasy game before , this does not come as a shock to you .
The undeniably emo story and characters of each game become endearing in a patronizing “ pat on the head ” sort of way .
The game is fairly linear .
Final Fantasy XIII steps off the beaten path to explore a more guided experience .
Part of the game opens up after 30 or so hours , but even then – after exploring – you are eventually strongly encouraged to move on with the story .
Whether the choice was a rousing success still remains to be seen , but there were not many times I felt like I was chained down to a path with no means of escape .
There are no towns .
I suppose there is a part of me deep down that misses having towns .
I mean , who did n't love traipsing all over town to go from one vendor to the next or waiting for an animation of your party sleeping in the inn or having to visit a church to resurrect your party ( and save ) or having to talk to every towns person just to learn tiny plot points or trivial information ?
No wait , I do n’t miss that at all .
Shopping , upgrading and saving your game is a breeze , and after a certain point in the game , there is even fast travel .
You will do some grinding in this game , but not as much as you think .
First off , grinding in a Japanese role playing game – such as Final Fantasy – is to be expected .
Deep down , lovers of this genre somewhat get off on the grinding – it makes us feel the huge time sink was worth it because we suffered for it .
Secondly , just short of running past many of the enemies , you will have garnered enough Crystarium Points ( CP ) to have maxed out the main roles of each character up through Level 9 .
Once you have completed the main storyline , the tenth and final Crystarium level will open .
Upgrading weapons is confusing and time consuming .
The long and the short of it is : there are three types of “ components ” ( battle drops ) : mineral , organic and mechanical .
Minerals simply upgrade one weapon into another weapon .
Using Organic materials increases a hidden counter that positively affects the multiplier .
Using Mechanical materials does the opposite but gives lots of weapon / accessory experience .
So , use Organic material to attain a three times multiplier , then unleash your mechanical materials in one go .
They do n’t let you change your party until far into the game .
While it may feel constricting that the game dictates who is in your party when , it is imperative they do so .
Learning the roles and how to effectively create synergy amongst them is tantamount to successfully navigate the game .
Depending on the situation , I will set my party accordingly and custom generate all six active paradigms to achieve the best result .
The battle system is complex and challenging .
No doubt about it ; the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII is not cheap and easy .
It is not something you pick up in the first hour , which is why you ’re still receiving tutorials for it 9 hours into the game .
Once you have finished the tutorials , the real complexities open up and you begin your quest to master possibly the most challenging battle system ever in the series .
Before stepping into a battle , you must take into account the members of your party , what roles they have , what paradigms you have active , which paradigm will begin the battle , the weapons and accessories equipped , how many Technical Points you have , the number of enemies , the strength of the enemies and what skills those enemies have .
Once you ’re in the battle , many of those variables above are set , but that does not equal automatic win .
You take command as a general would and effectively coordinate your attacks using the proper paradigm shifts .
Paradigm shifts are the key to a successful battle .
You cannot just zerg - rush ( i.e. Paradigm = Relentless Assault ) every battle .
I ’m sorry for all those who think you should be able to always keep the same three characters and then get into battle and press A or X to win .
Paradigms are the execution plans to enact your overall strategy .
As with any battle , you must be able to adapt , change strategies and take advantage when you can .
That may mean dropping into a defensive stance to heal or a more offensive stance with physical attacks and debuffs .
Yes , you may change in and out of them a lot , but that is what makes the strategic execution of paradigms so satisfying .
You are going to die .
And not just during Boss fights , sometimes , simple encounters can get the better of you .
I ’m 75 + hours into the game and there are still certain monsters that absolutely destroy me .
When you do perish , you respawn directly in front of the fight just as you were prior without penalty .
You are n't sent back to your last save point or need to find a church , just a simple immediate respawn giving you an opportunity to attack again or run like hell .
All - in - all , this game will not be for everyone , but if you are going to give Final Fantasy XIII a chance , you would do well to remember these 10 things you ought to know .
And if you do n't care for it , just wait ... another Final Fantasy game is right around the corner .
Obama heckled again over ' do n't ask '
By Ed O'Keefe
For the second time in as many months , President Obama was heckled about the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy at a California fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer .
But this time , the president shot back .
Speaking Tuesday evening about the economy at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event in San Francisco , the president was interrupted by a man who yelled out , " Move faster on ' do n't ask , do n't tell . ' "
" It 's good to see ya , " Obama told the man as the crowd booed .
The man continued shouting as the president said , " I have to say , you know what ?
I saw this guy down in LA . "
Obama said .
Gay rights protesters interrupted the president during an April fundraiser for Boxer in Los Angeles , and the president apparently recognized Tuesday 's heckler as the same individual .
Obama popped off about the heckler : " He really should like , buy a ticket to , if he wants to demonstrate , buy a ticket to a guy who does n't support his point of view . "
He added later that " maybe he did n't read the newspapers because we are working with congress as we speak to roll back ' do n't ask , do n't tell . ' "
And finally : " I actually think he does read the newspapers because he was n't as -- his heart was n't in it -- he said ' Do it faster . '
C'mon man ... "
The full House and Senate Armed Services Committees are set to vote Thursday to repeal the military 's ban on gays and lesbians openly serving in the military once the Pentagon completes a study of how to integrate them .
Though House members say they have enough support , the Senate panel is believed to still be a few votes short .

The man who will soon be proven to have been right all along , Ron Paul , was interviewed on CNBC earlier discussing topics such as the Greek contagion , Goldman Sachs , surging gold and , of course , the Fed .
Asked if this is just the beginning , the response is " Yes , this should n't surprise anybody , how long should we have been anticipating this ?
I have anticipated it since 1971 , because the system that replaced Bretton Woods was an unviable system and this is proving the point , so this is the unwinding of the system and until we replace it with something you are going to continue to see this ...
You can't correct the problem of debt with creating more debt , expecting the Fed to endlessly create more money and credit .
We are in for a lot more trouble as far as I can see . "
Can we grow our way out of this debt ?
" You 'd have to cut taxes drastically and cut spending drastically .
Politically you can't do that .
People will resort to more spending , more deficits and more inflation of the money supply .
If you see a GDP number go up , it is about equivalent to the money we have created - you do n't have any more growth than the artificial stimulus of the money that we put in .
We have not allowed the liquidation of debt , we have not allowed the elimination of the malinvestment still in the system . "
Ron also says anger at Goldman should be focused at the Fed : " When the history of this time is written people will say - how in the world did they believe that a few people in a secret room can decide what interest rates should be , how much the money supply should be , who should fail , what worthless assets taxpayers have to buy .
It is absolutely bizarre . "
Lastly , Ron has a word of caution against those politicians who time after time vote to retain the Fed 's secrecy : " The Fed is a big issue and those individuals in the Senate who votes against auditing the Fed , there will be a political price to pay for that just as much as those who voted for the bail out .
Right now those who vote to enhance the Fed will get punished politically because the people are waking up and they realize that the Fed is the culprit . "
Not surprisingly , Ron Paul is not too happy with the handling of the Vitter amendment .
Yet Paul 's conclusion is most insightful : " The markets are more powerful than governments , the markets are even more powerful than the Fed .
We fixed the price of gold at $ 35 for years , but we knew the market could n't sustain it .
We knew the Bretton Woods agreement would break down .
This is why we knew in 2000 that the dollar would crash in measurement toward gold . "
Paul shuts up Becky Quick who makes fun of his bearishness on the market by saying he bought gold at $ 35 , using the system against itself .
" I am on a reserve gold standard , and I do n't feel that badly about that , because my reserves are in pretty good shape , because I knew in 1971 that paper would lose its value .
Now the gold surge recently as people are discovering that they are really printing money .
You can expect a lot more price inflation . "

Edmonton Oilers radio play - by - play hall of famer Rod Phillips will highlight the 2010 - 2011 Edmonton Oilers season by calling radio play by play for 10 ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ games .
The ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’
Series will mark the end of Rod ’s illustrious career as ‘ Voice ’ of the Oilers , a career that spanned 37 years .
The ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ games will be carefully selected to highlight the biggest games , the biggest playoff series , Stanley Cup victories , and the storied connection the Oilers radio games have established between listeners and the team .
The ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ series will be announced when the NHL Schedule is officially published .
The ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ series will also mark the conclusion of a career spent bringing Oilers hockey to the lives and living rooms of Edmonton Oilers hockey fans for nearly four decades .
The ‘ Battle of Alberta ’ , the Stanley Cups , the Greatest NHL players in living memory including Wayne Gretzky , Gordie Howe , Bobby Hull , Mario Lemieux and Guy LaFleur have all been described by Rod Phillips as he called Oilers hockey from fall through winter and into spring every year .
He verbally painted Oilers pictures with his radio description of the Oilers in action from inception in the WHA , and every moment since .

The Oilers have never had another radio voice and while the announcement of next years ’
‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ series of games will provide Oilers fans the chance to enjoy his ‘ call , ’ it also signifies the end of an era in Edmonton .
“ I think today ’s announcement is remarkable .
The series of games Rod will call next year is the perfect way to properly let our fans appreciate everything that Rod has brought the team and the city .
This is the ultimate tribute to our Hall Of Fame broadcaster , " stated Oilers President and CEO Patrick LaForge .
“ Generations grew up listening to Rod , and it ’s only fitting he is allowed this kind of tribute . ”
Oilers President of Hockey Operations Kevin Lowe commented : “ It ’s hard to imagine that Rod is hanging up the mic .
There is only one Rod Phillips , and there will never be another like him in our city .
He ’s been the voice of this franchise and has called every single significant moment in Oilers History .
He also left nothing on the table and cared as deeply about this team and this city as anyone ever has .
To me , he ’s an Oiler icon , a great Edmontonian and has left his mark on NHL hockey and Canadian hockey .
I hope the entire city gets a chance to listen to these games next season and appreciate what we have been able to enjoy . ”

The 68 - year - old Calmar , Alberta native called over 3,500 Oiler games in a 37 - year career .
Phillips started calling professional games in 1973 in the World Hockey Association ( WHA ) with the Oilers and then continued with the team in 1979 , the Oilers ’ inaugural season in the National Hockey League .
Over the next 29 years Phillips would miss just two games ; one due to illness and one when he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003 .
Phillips ’ first career WHA game called was on October 12 , 1973 versus the Winnipeg Jets .
The Oilers won 6 - 4 .
His first career NHL game was called on October 10 , 1979 at Chicago Stadium where the Blackhawks beat the Oilers 4 - 2 .
Phillips called all seven Oilers ’ Stanley Cup Finals appearances including their five Stanley Cup wins against the New York Islanders ( 1984 ) , the Philadelphia Flyers ( 1985 , 1987 ) , and the Boston Bruins ( 1988 , 1990 ) .
Phillips was the 2003 recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award , an award named after Foster Hewitt and presented by the Hockey Hall of Fame to members of the radio and television industry who make outstanding contributions to their profession and the game of ice hockey during their broadcasting career .
The award winners are selected by the NHL Broadcasters ' Association .
Prior to working in the WHA and NHL , Phillips worked at CFRN where he co-hosted Edmonton ’s first ever late - night weeknight sportscast .
The 1964 graduate of the National Institute of Broadcasting started working in Lethbridge , Alberta at CHEC Radio before moving back to Edmonton to join CFRN .
Phillips , who was born September 9 , 1941 in Calmar , Alberta , is married to wife , Debbie .
They have two children , Quinn ( 28 ) and Devan ( 25 ) .
Phillips will be making “ the 53 steps from the media lounge to the broadcast booth ” a few more times during the 2010 - 11 season as part of his ‘ Rod ’s Classics ’ series farewell .

The financial crisis has exploded plenty of long - held beliefs , including the idea that mortgage debt is a risk - free investment .
But nothing has shaken the articles of faith that underpin another massive debt market : municipal bonds .
Investors in municipal bonds do n’t have to worry about a thing , the thinking goes , because the states and cities that issue them will do anything to avoid reneging on their obligations — and even if they fail , surely Washington will step in and save investors from big losses .
These are dangerous assumptions .
Just as with mortgages , the very fact that investors place unlimited faith in a market could eventually destroy that market .
If investors believe that they take no risk , they will lend states and cities far too much — so much that these borrowers wo n’t be able to repay their obligations while maintaining a reasonable level of public services .
The investors , then , could help bankrupt state and local governments — and take massive losses in the process .
To avoid that scenario , investors must take a long , hard look at what they ’re doing .
Where state and local finances are untenable , they should stop throwing good money after bad .
You might think that municipal bonds would have lost their low - risk reputation .
In the past two tumultuous years , tax revenues have plummeted by double - digit percentages , and state and local governments have struggled to close historic deficits .
Nationwide , they face cash operating gaps of $ 200 billion , or 15 percent of their budgets , through 2011 .
Big spenders have shown no sign of cutting costs in line with a new reality .
Ordinarily , if a borrower is in such straits , lenders start thinking twice about lending it yet more money :
Who ’s to say that the borrower wo n’t declare bankruptcy and default on its obligations ?
Yet the industry ’s gatekeepers still consider municipal bonds low - risk .
“ We do not expect that states will default on general - obligation debt , even under the most stressed economic conditions , ” analysts at Moody ’s , one of the three major credit ratings agencies , wrote in a February 2010 report .
As for cities and towns , “ we expect very few defaults in this sector given the tools that local governments have at their disposal . ”
The firm ’s chief competitor , Standard and Poor ’s , agrees .
Why are the ratings analysts so sanguine ?
First , they assume that states and cities will do anything to avoid default .
As John V. Miller of Nuveen Asset Management told clients in 2009 , “ State and local governments have strong incentives to maintain access to the credit markets . ”
The main incentive , of course , is their desire to borrow more tomorrow , which depends on demonstrating that they would never renege on their obligations today .
The analysts also think that lending to state and local governments is n’t risky because they — unlike private firms — have a captive source of endless funds .
If a company misjudges its product line or its prices , its customers and investors can flee , depriving it of money ; such a company will have a hard time persuading anyone to give it one dollar more .
State and local governments , by contrast , can always tax their residents and businesses to pay the bills , even as they gut services .
The ratings analysts find further reassurance in the law .
State governments can’t legally declare bankruptcy to escape debt : the federal bankruptcy code does n’t cover them , and they ca n’t write their own bankruptcy laws because the Constitution reserves that power for the federal government .
Cities , towns , and counties , meanwhile , can file for bankruptcy only if their state governments allow it , and more than half of the states do n’t .
Moreover , federal law requires eligible cities and towns to meet a strict standard for insolvency .
A private firm can file a “ strategic bankruptcy , ” looking ahead a few years and determining that bankruptcy now will avoid bigger problems later , but cities and towns must prove that they are already unable to pay their bills .
In the early 1990s , a judge threw out the bankruptcy petition of Bridgeport , Connecticut , finding evidence that someone , somewhere was still willing to lend the city money .
The analysts take comfort in financial engineering , too .
Over the past two decades , the underwriters who help state and local governments raise money have found ever more creative ways to dodge obstacles that theoretically constrain borrowing — but the underwriters have simultaneously built in conditions that reassure bondholders .
New York State , for example , currently owes just $ 3.3 billion in “ general - obligation bonds ” because these bonds require voter approval .
Yet the state has racked up $ 59.3 billion in total debt , often by setting up special “ trusts , ” legally separate from the state government , that issue bonds of their own .
The state pledges to direct tens of billions of dollars automatically to the trusts , enough to pay the debt costs many times over ; the trusts use that infusion of cash to pay the debt and then give the leftovers back to the state .
Even though investors in trust - issued bonds do n’t have a direct state guarantee , they do n’t mind because the trust provisions make the debt seem so safe .
To assuage investors further , the state explicitly outlaws bankruptcy for big issuers , such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) .
Another line of defense for analysts , advisors , and investors is the theory that the federal government regards the biggest municipal debtors — such as New York , California , and the borrowers that they in turn oversee , like the MTA — as “ too big to fail . ”
After all , back in 1975 , when New York City stood on the brink of default , Washington helped Albany bail it out .
In 2008 , Washington , fearing a global meltdown , went to extraordinary lengths to rescue creditors to AIG .
This spring , the European Union made it clear that it would not let Greece default on its government debt .
If necessary , observers figure , New York would bail out the MTA , and Washington would bail out New York .
Finally , ratings agencies and investors point to the past .
In the Great Depression , municipal - bond investors lost a tiny one - half of 1 percentage point of their money .
And between 1970 and 2000 , according to a Moody ’s study , of the nearly 376,000 cases when rated municipal - bond issuers could have defaulted , only 18 actually did , compared with 819 corporate defaults out of the more than 61,000 possible .
Losses , and even the threat of losses , have confined themselves almost exclusively to the relatively riskier side of this nearly risk - free market .
It ’s not states and cities themselves that have defaulted on debt , but special entities that they set up to fund projects like hospital and dormitory construction .
Between 1970 and 2000 , no investor took a loss on a state ’s or a city ’s general - obligation debt .
Even Orange County , California , which declared insolvency in 1994 to protect its pension assets from seizure after a rogue employee bet the money on derivatives , repaid its lenders every dime , with interest .
If the analysts ’ confidence sounds familiar , that ’s because we ’ve heard it before .
Before 2006 , conventional wisdom held that if you wanted a risk - free investment , you could n’t do better than buy mortgage - backed securities .
Homeowners were willing and able to repay what they owed you .
Even if a homeowner could n’t make his monthly nut , he could always raise cash to repay the mortgage by selling his house at a higher price .
In addition , federal law protected lenders .
Struggling homeowners could n’t turn to bankruptcy to escape their mortgage debt ; they could escape it only by returning the house to the lender , and the house almost never lost value .
Financial engineering provided another layer of security : underwriters and ratings analysts had designed such airtight structures that losses would have to reach truly unfathomable levels before most investors had anything to worry about .
History , too , justified confidence .
Yet in the end , investors pumped so much money into that supposedly airtight market that they blew it apart .
In being so free with their money , investors in mortgage - backed securities and other mortgage debt ignored the obvious : homeowners would never be able to repay everything they were borrowing .
Only while house prices were soaring could homeowners afford their mortgages and other living expenses by refinancing .
But this vacation from reality could n’t last forever because home prices could n’t — and did n’t — maintain their torrid growth forever .
All those protections that lenders enjoyed did n’t matter a bit if borrowers could n’t and would n’t repay what they owed .
Like homeowners , state and local governments spent the boom years using illusory gains to justify ever - higher spending and borrowing .
Between 2000 and 2008 , state tax revenues , buoyed by the housing and financial industries , outpaced inflation by 15 percent , according to the Census Bureau .
Local tax collections mushroomed , too .
But instead of using all this money to reduce their debt , state and local governments spent it on rising public - education costs and expanding Medicaid for poor and working - class residents .
The biggest partners in profligacy — California , Illinois , New Jersey , and New York among them — also piled on public - sector labor costs .
Just to pay the generous pensions and health benefits of their workers , many of whom can retire in their mid-fifties , state governments face a trillion - dollar shortfall over the coming decades , the Pew Center on the States recently reported .
Even during the boom , money fell short .
By 2008 , state and local debt rose to $ 2.2 trillion outstanding — 49 percent higher , after inflation , than in 2000 .
Add the health and pension benefits for government workers , and you ’re up to a staggering $ 3.2 trillion .
Once the recession ’s severity became apparent , state and local officials should have realized that hard fiscal times were coming and begun cutting back on the unsustainable costs .
Instead , they have kept on spending , and borrowed to do it : states alone have already borrowed another $ 15 billion for operating costs over the past two years .
Municipal bond buyers are partly to blame for state and local governments ’ failure to face reality .
True , there are other culprits , such as President Obama ’s 2009 stimulus package , which poured more than $ 200 billion of reality - distorting funds into municipalities ’ coffers so that they could keep hiking their spending .
By 2011 , stimulus money will have filled about 6 percent of states ’ revenue shortfalls , obscuring the need for fiscal reform .
But now that stimulus cash is running out , states are falling even more passionately into the arms of all - too - willing debt markets .
In New York , for instance , Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch has proposed an intricately detailed $ 6 billion borrowing plan to help close $ 60 billion in operating deficits over five years but has n’t said a word about how exactly to cut spending .
The ratings analysts remain calm , with Moody ’s observing in early March that New York has a “ long track record of closing annual budget gaps ” and Standard and Poor ’s reminding investors of the state ’s rosy “ history of what we consider conservative budgeting . ”
Washington has made things even worse with “ Build America Bonds , ” part of the stimulus package .
Usually , municipal bonds offer comparatively low interest rates because lenders do n’t have to pay taxes on their interest income .
But investor demand is limited to people who need this benefit .
Build America Bonds , by contrast , are taxable , so they offer higher interest rates ; state and city governments issue them to a bigger market , but the feds cover the higher interest costs .
Big borrowers have ably exploited this invitation to borrow still more .
California , New York , and Illinois have already issued $ 31 billion in such bonds , or 40 percent of the year - old program .
Thanks to Build America — and also to the Federal Reserve ’s 0 percent interest - rate policy , which lets borrowers access cash cheaply — 2010 may be a record year for municipal - debt issuance and a lost year for fixing state and local budgets .
The average state owes 2.1 percent of its citizens ’ annual personal income .
California owes 4.4 percent , New York 5.4 percent , and New Jersey 6.7 percent .
New York ’s Citizens Budget Commission recently added future retiree obligations to that statistic and found that six American states — New York and New Jersey among them — are on the verge of a “ danger zone . ”
What will they do if they enter that danger zone in the coming years ?
Perhaps what overindebted homeowners did in tearing up the conventional wisdom about their ability and willingness to repay their mortgages .
Once state and local governments have borrowed too much , they may well find a way not to pay their lenders back .
To get a glimpse of the future , look to Vallejo , California , about 30 miles north of San Francisco .
Like many municipalities , this city of 117,000 residents found itself hard hit by the housing bust , with property - tax revenues falling by more than a quarter in two years .
Vallejo first tried to address the crisis the way other cities have : cutting staffing sharply and slashing everything from public safety to road maintenance .
But crime shot up , and citizens got angry ( see “ Vallejo Goes for Broke ” ) .
Instead of firing workers , Vallejo might have cut their wages and benefits — but its agreements with public - sector unions prohibited that .
The city was stuck paying the average police officer and firefighter more than $ 80,000 , including annual raises of 19 to 21 percent between 2006 and 2009 .
Work rules , too , prevented Vallejo from streamlining .
For example , it had to maintain minimum staffing at some locations , even as ever - scarcer resources were needed elsewhere .
So Vallejo did something unprecedented : in spring 2008 , it filed for bankruptcy to fix its long - term problems .
Seeing that the real problem was that “ collective bargaining agreements control the city ’s labor costs , ” as Vallejo wrote in its court documents , it petitioned a bankruptcy judge to throw out those agreements so that it could restructure its long - term obligations .
In court , Vallejo pointed to “ hundreds of millions of dollars in debt that the city shoulders now for services rendered in the past , such as bonds , pensions , and retiree health benefits that consume a large and growing portion of the City ’s annual budget . ”
For instance , city workers could still retire in their fifties with fat pensions , and current and future retirees still had promises of full health benefits for life .
In filing for bankruptcy , Vallejo violated the first principle of municipal - finance conventional wisdom : that cities and towns will do anything to avoid default .
Vallejo was insolvent , true , but its managers could have emulated many of their counterparts around the nation in trying , through structured finance , to borrow more somehow and hope for the best .
Vallejo , after all , is no more insolvent than California , which last year was reduced to hoarding its citizens ’ tax refunds for months for extra cash .
Vallejo owes bondholders 5.5 percent of its citizens ’ personal income — little more than New York ’s 5.4 .
( True , the financial situations diverge by several percentage points when you consider projections of pension and health benefits , but the unreliability of such estimates renders that gap meaningless . )
Vallejo chose not to pursue short - term heroics .
The benefits of paring down contractual obligations , it decided , outweighed the costs of declaring bankruptcy — and it has already reaped rewards .
A year ago , federal bankruptcy judge Michael McManus handed down a precedent - setting ruling that a bankrupt municipality has the right to cancel current collective bargaining contracts , even if doing so contradicts state labor law , as it does in California .
In reaching his decision , McManus employed the long - standing principle that when laws conflict , federal law is supreme .
McManus later agreed that Vallejo ’s labor contracts were too onerous and sent unions and the city to arbitration and mediation .
Since it filed for bankruptcy , Vallejo has renegotiated contracts with three of its four unions ( the fourth is still appealing ) .
Employees have given up constricting work rules and even taken hefty salary reductions .
Vallejo has won some long - term freedom , too .
The city normally renews current retirees ’ health - care benefits with each new collective bargaining agreement .
This time around , with the old agreement thrown out , instead of paying 100 percent of its retirees ’ health - care costs — which can reach a maximum of $ 2,250 a month per person — Vallejo will pay a maximum of $ 750 a month to some retirees .
If the court approves Vallejo ’s bankruptcy - exit plan this summer , the city will emerge from bankruptcy with $ 34 million in health - care obligations to retirees , down 75 percent from $ 135 million .
Throughout its bankruptcy , Vallejo has not paid the full amount it owes on its municipal bonds .
( The city has just one big municipal bondholder , the Union Bank of California . )
What ’s more , it has proposed , in its exit plan , to defer payments on its bonds for three years , saving up cash and investing in infrastructure before paying lenders in full .
Yet the municipal - bond world has treated Vallejo ’s bankruptcy as a minor annoyance , telling investors : move along , please , nothing to see here .
Analysts have found much comfort in the fact that Vallejo did n’t file its bankruptcy to repudiate its bond debt .
They take heart , too , in Vallejo ’s seeming desire to repay that debt .
A March report from Municipal Market Advisors was typical , criticizing a more pessimistic article from the financial - news outlet Barron ’s as “ ignoring , of course , the city ’s own plan to repay all bondholders at 100 percent . ”
But the muni - bond market may be so intent on ignoring Vallejo for fear that if it looks too closely , it might not like what it sees .
Vallejo ’s bondholders may get off relatively easily precisely because Vallejo stopped piling up obligations on its own , rather than trying one mad dash to borrow more .
Vallejo did n’t follow , say , Illinois ’ example : borrowing in the bond markets to fund future obligations to retirees .
Vallejo knew that it had to cut future retiree obligations — and even so , it could n’t do it without affecting bondholders , too .
Bondholders should realize , then , that they are vulnerable to real losses as cities , towns , and states move to escape massive health - care obligations to their retirees .
At best , they ’ll suffer the Vallejo bondholders ’ fate — though a three - year deferral of payment is no small matter to an investor .
At worst , they ’ll take bigger losses as obligations pile up .
It ’s easy to imagine some future mayor convincing a bankruptcy judge that it ’s only fair for bondholders , along with union members , to take big cuts in a restructuring .
Indeed , heavily indebted governments ’ willingness to repay crippling municipal debt will depend on what ’s politically expedient .
Today , politicians still see the advantages of borrowing more .
Ten years from now , it may be more practical for a governor to tell the public : we ’ve borrowed too much , we did so because clever Wall Street investors convinced our predecessors that it was a good idea , and we should n’t have to pay those investors back .
Investors continue to assume that financial calculations would trump political calculations in such a case — that is , that no state or city would default , even if the public supported it , because it would cut off the borrower ’s access to credit markets .
But that would be true only if the state or city in question considered immediate access to bond markets more important than cutting the amount it already owed .
Furthermore , a state or city that did cut down its obligations might , strangely enough , have an easier time getting financing afterward , since new bondholders would know that its finances were finally sustainable .
The uncomfortable truth is that as municipal debt grows , the risk mounts that someday it will be politically , economically , and financially worthwhile for borrowers to escape it .
When that happens , the protections that lenders supposedly enjoy will be meaningless .
Lenders should n’t take solace in states ’ inability to access federal bankruptcy codes : a state could certainly stop making payments on its debt without formally going into bankruptcy .
As for complex financial engineering , a future elected official could convince the public that the “ trust ” structure that New York uses to issue bonds is a fraud perpetuated by corrupt former officeholders — a deliberate attempt to nullify voters ’ right to limit indebtedness — and withhold payments to the trusts and hence to their bondholders .
This would mean years in court , and , in the meantime , the bondholders would go unpaid .
But there ’s always Uncle Sam , right ?
Maybe not .
In relying on future bailouts , investors are taking a gamble .
Consider how thoroughly the public remains fed up with the bailouts of AIG ’s creditors , who should have known better than to lend so imprudently .
Furthermore , in bailouts where the federal government ’s aim has been not to save the financial system but to force a borrower to restructure its obligations , bondholders have fared poorly .
When the White House rescued Chrysler and General Motors , it forced bondholders to take bigger losses than union members did , despite bondholders ’ higher claim .
A practical limitation on federal bailouts exists , too , and investors would do better not to reach it .
Washington cannot guarantee all debt .
In March , Moody ’s questioned the resilience of America ’s AAA credit rating , noting that “ preserving debt affordability ” at the federal level “ will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a magnitude that . . . will test social cohesion . ”
To get its finances in line , in other words , the United States must already slash spending to such an extent that it will risk the wrath of the targets , likely including public - employee unions and Medicaid recipients .
Shouldering the debt burdens of bankrupt states and cities would make the situation even graver .
Faced with a choice between preserving “ social cohesion ” and saving municipal or corporate bondholders , the feds would be likely to pick social cohesion , throwing some creditors out of the bailout boat .
That ’s the better scenario , in fact .
The worse one is massive inflation , effectively a wholesale repudiation of all government debt .
Disaster is n’t inevitable .
But to avoid it , states and cities badly need the financial discipline that sober markets can provide .
Municipal investors should ask themselves a few simple questions .
Is it not daft to lend New York and California one dime more ?
Are certain states ’ and cities ’ finances sustainable , absent a bubble or a miracle ?
If not , are n’t today ’s investors just hoping that they ’re not the last ones left holding bad paper ?
Asking and answering these questions could save bondholders money — and could also force state and local politicians to address reality before it ’s too late .

Crestwood , Illinois , is a small far southwestern suburb of Chicago that I suspect remains unseen by an overwhelming majority of Chicagoans .
To the extent most people know anything about the town , it 's not positive : A couple of years ago it came to light that , starting in 1986 , the then - mayor , his son ( the current mayor ) , and a key water department official covered up the fact that 20 % of town 's water supply came from a contaminated well .
But I did n't make the 36 - mile drive to Crestwood because a few morons have been added to the depressingly long list of corrupt public officials in my beloved state .
I went to return to Louisa 's Pizza & Pasta , home of some of the best deep dish pizza on the planet .
Louisa DeGenero , whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Italy in 1918 , spent a couple of decades working as a cook at Pizzeria Due ( review of Uno 's here ) before opening her own place in 1981 with the help of her adult daughter .
Today , Louisa 's is serving pies that are better than anything her former employer puts out .
Every component of this pizza was delicious and the whole was even better than the parts .
The chunky sauce was neither tangy nor sweet , but was simply chunks of juicy tomatoes seasoned with herbs that are grown in back of the restaurant .
In fact , Louisa 's uses its own herbs year - round , freezing enough each summer to keep customers happy all winter .
The cheese is not fresh mozzarella , but it 's good quality and has a nice tug to it without being close to overly chewy .
My only complaint about the cheese and sauce was that there is not enough of either .
The pie is not unbalanced at all , but the crust could have handled a little more of each and extra cheese and extra sauce are both listed on the menu as possible toppings .
The sausage on the other hand was plentiful and appreciated .
While lacking in my beloved fennel , these large chunks of fresh porky deliciousness were irresistible .
The crust is where Louisa 's really stands out in a metropolitan area filled with delicious deep dish pizzas .
The crisp , buttery crust manages to seem light while holding up a healthy amount of meat along with cheese and sauce without showing the slightest bit of strain - there is no crumbling and certainly no tip sag here .
More important than the structure is that this crust is one delicious piece of bread .
Simply put , if Louisa 's were to run out of cheese , sauce and toppings , I 'd still order a pizza just to eat more of this crust .
For those who do not live on the far southwest side , Crestwood is a bit of a hike and / or not the easiest place in the world to get to without a car .
But if you like deep dish pizza at all , you owe it to yourself to make the trek to Louisa 's Pizza & Pasta at least once .

Dubbed the " memory of the future , " a new type of integrated circuit combining resistors with memory capabilities was recently shown off by HP and touted as a possible alternative to transistors in both computation and storage devices .
Today , these functions are handled by separate chips , meaning data must be transferred between them , slowing down the computation and wasting energy .
Could this new tech mean the unification of memory and CPU ?
In simplest terms , transistors are the on / off mechanisms which allow CPUs to compute and memory to store data .
CPUs are often made with tens or even hundreds of millions of transistors .
As the performance and capacity of devices increase , so do the number of transistors .
Memristors have the potential to fundamentally change circuitry by performing the same duties as the transistor , but more efficiently and occupying far less space .
They also provide some unique properties such as three - dimensional stacking , faster switching , retention of off / on states without power and a proven durability which exceeds hundreds of thousands of reads / writes .
Little more than theory in 1971 , the development of actual memristors did n't become reality until 2008 by an HP Labs research team led by Professor Stan Williams .
The idea may have been floating around for some time , but finding the processes and materials to physically engineer memristors have remained elusive .
A detailed article on the subject can be found here , explaining some of the principles behind how memristors work .
If the technology proves viable , it will no doubt become a hugely important breakthrough for our increasingly digital lives -- perhaps in as little as three years .

Go Hawks Go .
Leaf fans may be conflicted about who to cheer for during this Stanley Cup Final .
There are factors that could make seeing either Mike Richards or Jonathan Toews lift the Stanley Cup unsettling for Leafs Nation .
The Leafs and Flyers have a pretty heated rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when both teams took gooning to a whole new level .
The rivalry was rekindled in the late 90s and early 2000s with a couple hard - fought playoff series .
It ’s because of the Flyers that instead of remembering this about the 2004 playoffs , I remember this While Leaf and Flyer fans do not like each other there is the complicating matter of Chicago ’s last Stanley Cup victory – which happened a long time ago .
Their last Stanley Cup happened so long ago that they actually own the longest drought in all of hockey .
The team with the inglorious distinction of owning the second longest drought is the Toronto Maple Leafs .
My math skills are lacking , but even I know that if Chicago wins the Stanley Cup then the Leafs will have the longest Stanley Cup drought in the NHL .
This factor is so compelling that one Leafs fan ( who shall remain nameless for his safety ) said he would cheer for the Canadiens against the Blackhawks if that was the Stanley Cup Final .
That ’s obscene , but I think it shows how strongly some fans feel about this disgraceful record .
Even though it means that Chicago will erase their Stanley Cup famine , I am firmly cheering for them to win the Stanley Cup .
I ’m also the guy who once gave the finger to a couple little kids on the side of the road holding signs saying “ Honk for the Flyers ” , so I ’m not exactly impartial .
In fact , I hate the Flyers .
Probably not Montreal , Ottawa , Buffalo levels of hate , but I hate them .
They definitely make the top - 5 .
But despite my hatred for the Flyers I ’m not rooting for the Hawks solely because I ’m cheeringthe Flyers .
This is n’t 2006 all over again where I was firmly rooting for the Ducks for the sole purpose of destroying Ottawa ’s hopes and dreams ( although looking back that Ducks team was extremely likeable ) .
Here are some reasons why you should cheer for the Chicago Blackhawks to win the Stanley Cup .
I ’m mainly talking to you Leafs Nation , but many of the reasons extend to the rest of the league .
And just for good measure I threw in a lot of Philadelphia pot shots .
No one will argue that sitting on the Senate floor during session can get a little boring , but looking at porn is probably not the best way to pass the time .
On Thursday morning , Sunshine State News captured exclusive video of Sen. Mike Bennett , R - Bradenton , looking at pornographic material on his state - issued computer on the Senate floor .
Ironically , as Bennett is viewing the material , you can hear a Senator Dan Gelber 's voice in the background debating a controversial abortion bill .
" I 'm against this bill , " said Gelber , " because it disrespects too many women in the state of Florida . "
Bennett defended his actions , telling Sunshine State News it was an email sent to him by a woman " who happens to be a former court administrator . "
" I was just sitting there , bored as they were debating the abortion bill , " Bennett said .
" I opened it up and said holy [ expletive ] !
What 's on my screen ?
and clicked away from it right away . "
Sunshine State News could not verify how long the image of four bikini - clad women with their tops exposed was open before our cameras started rolling on it , but it was up for at least three seconds before it disappeared from the screen .
Senate spokesperson Jaryn Emhof explained further on Bennett 's behalf .
" There was some confusion about an email he received , " said Emhof .
" He thought it was an email about an item being debated on the Senate floor .
As soon as he realized it was n't he closed the page . "
But the one image we caught on camera was n't the only thing Bennett had viewed .
It appears other files , including at least two videos , may have been downloaded , too .
He was also caught on camera watching a video of a dog running out of the water and shaking itself off .
It is unclear if he also thought that was an email about a bill being debated on the floor .
We offered Bennett an opportunity to prove his statements to Sunshine State News by showing the executive editor and videographer the email record with a government - related subject line , but after talking to the Senate 's top lawyer , he declined to let us see those records .
This revealing video comes just weeks after an investigation found a number of federal Securities and Exchange Commission employees had been spending several hours visiting pornographic websites on government - issued computers when they should have been working .
When asked if he ever looks at pornography while on the Senate floor , Bennett responded , " You 'd have to be insane to do that .
It all goes through a server .
I do n't think anybody would be doing that . "

Sacco and Vanzetti in Ottawa : How Media and Police are Politicizing the RBC Arson Case
Blog posts reflect the views of their authors .

A .50 cal cartridge is the furthest to the left , while the 7.62 mm cartridge is the third from the right .
On August 23rd , 1927 , Ferdinando Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed in Massachusetts .
The two were convicted of a double - murder committed during an armed robbery .
The trial and media coverage focused on the political ideology of the two men , treating as secondary the material evidence related to the crime itself .
The two men were members of the Galleanist Anarchist movement , and the trial was a watershed moment in the campaign to delegitimize the global anarchist movement as a whole .
The politicization of the trial extended to Judge Webster Thayer , who allegedly referred to the defendants as " anarchist bastards . "
This is one example of the many ways that the pair ’s political activities and beliefs were invoked in a way that prohibited a fair trial from proceeding .
Some of the most renowned thinkers of the day spoke out against the prejudice surrounding the trial , such as Upton Sinclair and Walter Lippmann .
Fifty years later , a Massachusetts government commission confirmed the trial had been unfair and Governor Michael Dukakis declared a " Sacco and Vanzetti Memorial Day . "
Sacco and Vanzetti come to Ottawa
On Saturday , Ottawa police announced the charging of three well - known Ottawa activists in connection with the May 18th arson of a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada .
What follows is not a comment on the event in question , nor the guilt or innocence of the accused , but a condemnation of the treatment of the accused by the media and Ottawa police .
Much like Sacco and Vanzetti before them , these three are already receiving prejudicial media coverage .
An inordinate amount of time and column inches are being dedicated to the activism that the three were known for .
The CBC , for example , reported on Claude Haridge ’s participation in a Palestinian rights march , and his attendance at the so - called ' Activism Course ' hosted by former University of Ottawa professor Denis Rancourt .
Rancourt has accused the CBC of insinuating this is evidence against the three .
The RBC arson was clearly a political act , as evidenced by the video that was released with it .
Therefore , the politics of any suspect are a relevant discussion .
But that discussion should not replace discussion about the material evidence , much less be presented as evidence in and of itself .
Nor should it come at the cost of media oversight of the police investigation .
Ottawa Police fan the flames
The Ottawa Police have added to the show - trial appearance of the case .
The original statement from the Ottawa Police , during a Saturday morning press conference , was that .50 caliber " sniper - style " ammunition was recovered during a raid of Haridge 's home .
The police sent out a release later in the day to say that the ammunition was actually 7.62 mm .
Both kinds of bullets are legal , but 7.62 mm ammo is not used in sniper rifles .
It ’s difficult to believe that trained firearm users , like police detectives , could confuse the drastically different looking bullets ( see picture ) .
Less believable still that such an error could make it into an important press conference .
Const .
Katherine Larouche , spokesperson for the Ottawa Police , told me that the bullets were found in a case marked “ .50 cal , ” which led to the erroneous press release .
When asked if that meant the police did n't open the case before reporting their findings to the media , she declined to comment .
Many media outlets did correct the error , many did n't .
Regardless , the damage has been done .
Haridge will be thought of as a potential sniper and few will read the corrections .
During the press conference , the police also made a point of calling the bullets " military - grade " .
The ammunition expert I spoke to was surprised by the use of this term .
Under international law , military ammunition must be ' jacketed ' to stop bullets from exploding inside the victim .
Thus they are less dangerous than other forms of ammo , such as hunting ammo that is designed to kill an animal as fast as possible .
It is unclear why the police would use such a misleading term , but the media ate it up nonetheless .
Adding to the police 's influence on the public 's perception of the accused -- keep in mind that it's the Ottawa public that will eventually form the sitting jury -- are statements by Ottawa Police Chief Vern White .
White has publicly called for the RCMP to file terrorism charges against the three , referring to the accused as " domestic terrorists . "
Lawrence Greenspon , lawyer for one of the accused , believes the police chief is acting irresponsibly , given that civilian life was not the target of the attack .
Direct or indirect targetting of civilians is a necessary factor in most definitions of terrorism .
However , Canada 's controversial post -9/11 anti-terrorism law is much more ambiguous on this point .
" The charges are essentially damage - to - property - related charges , " Greenspon told the Ottawa Citizen .
" There 's no talk of terrorism by anybody except our chief of police . "
Greenspon also scolded federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews .
Toews held a news conference on Saturday in which he said :
" The dedication and tireless work of police has once again succeeded in making our communities safer . "
Greenspon accused Toews of violating the accused 's right to the presumption of innocence .
Police and media endangering G - 20 protesters
The treatment of the case by media and authorities has not only jeopardized the right to due process , but also the safety of protesters descending on Toronto this week for the G20 .
In their Saturday evening report on the ammunition discovery , CTV News -- Canada 's most watched national newscast -- reported that " police say ( the ammunition discovery ) could indicate the kind of violence to expect at next week 's summits . "
The Globe and Mail -- Canada 's most - read daily newspaper - - ran an article by Colin Freeze which reported that , “ the seizure ( of ammunition ) is stoking police fears about what they could be up against when protesters amass during the G8 / G20 summits next week . ”
Some are viewing these statements as pre-justification for repression by the Toronto Police .
This becomes very worrisome when viewed alongside the force 's recent history of brutality , including accusations of murder in the death of Junior Manon on May 5th .
Let 's put this into context : thousands of justifiably angry marchers , artists , journalists , parents , children , and others with grievances surrounding the G - 8/ G - 20 summits are being targeted because legal ammunition was found on one man who should be presumed innocent until proven guilty .
This narrative was seeded by Ottawa Police Chief White .
“ I ask Ottawa residents to remain vigilant , before and during the G8 - G - 20 , and continue to report any suspicious activity to police , ” reads the lone quote attributed to White in the force 's first press release on the arrests .
At the police 's Saturday press conference , representatives of the Toronto Police were present .
A five - hour drive from their jurisdiction , no reason was given for their participation , but the effect was to reinforce the connection between the Ottawa arrests and the activists in the streets of Toronto .
A connection that appears in every single report on the arrests that I have encountered .
The irresponsibility of the media lies not in reporting these police statements , but in doing so without a hint of analysis on either the logic or the consequences these statements can have .
Anyone remember Montebello ?
While the media and police give credence to an irrational fear of protesters , they ignore the very real security concerns of those in the street .
Worries that are founded in recent history .
In 2007 , the Sûreté du Québec ( Quebec ’s provincial police force ) were discovered mobilizing rock - wielding agents provocateurs at the Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting in Montebello ( see video here , and police admission here .
That same day , thousands of peaceful protesters were tear - gassed , shot with rubber bullets , and beaten by hundreds of police officers .
No government inquiry was ever opened to determine the source of the order to send rock - carrying officers into the crowd .
No member of government or police was ever disciplined .
Numerous social justice and civil liberties groups screamed about the precedent the lack of accountability would set for future convergences .
Enter the G - 8/G - 20 , the first conference of international heads of state in Canada since Montebello .
Sid Ryan , president of the Ontario Federation of Labour , suggested provocateurs might be used again to incite violence .
Violence that might be interpreted by the media as justification for the conference 's controversial $ 1 billion security budget .
The head of the Toronto Police Association , Mike McCormack , responded by calling for Ryan 's resignation , adding that " ( Ryan ) should be writing fiction because obviously he is n’t dealing with reality . "
The Harper administration has ignored requests for a pledge that provocateurs wo n't be used this week like they were in 2007 .
For those opposing the G - 20 , silence at a moment like this is a return to the age of Sacco and Vanzetti .
Will we have to wait another 50 years for an admission of misconduct ?

This summer , like each one before it , will feature the years heavy hitters for the movie industry , and 2010 is shaping up to be a great one .
I am going to list the big films , my box office predictions , the ones that I think will fail , and the sleeper hits .
Top Ten
1. Iron Man 2 – Who does n’t want to see Tony Stark back in action ?
Add Mickey Rourke , Scarlett Johannson , and Don Cheadle to the mix–and you have a sure fire blockbuster .
$ 340 m
2. Toy Story 3 -
The anticipation for this one is through the roof since it ’s been so long since the last one .
Buzz ( get it ! ) around the screening circuit is that this is incredible and actually pulls at the heartstrings a bit .
$ 278 m
3. Twilight Saga : Eclipse - New Moon grossed more than Twilight , and now that the Jacob vs Edward story is in full swing , expect the lines to be even longer for this one .
Let ’s hope the action increases , because without it , it may start to get dull .
$ 237 m
4. Sex and the City 2 - Women will flock to this one , and even manage to drag along a few guys .
Admittedly , I will probably be one of them .
The trailer does n’t look as interesting as the first one , but it really does n’t matter .
Can you say critic proof ?
$ 180 m
5 . The Karate Kid-
There probably is no film that is getting better buzz right now that this remake of the 80 ’s blockbuster .
Will Smith ’s son , Jaden , is destined to be a star , and Jackie Chan is just right as Mr. Han .
Word of mouth will help this film hold up well through the summer .
$ 167 m
6. Shrek Forever After - I did n’t particularly enjoy Shrek the Third , but I still think part 2 is one of the best animated films …ever .
Hopefully , this one can regain some of the spark from earlier on in this series .
I still see a drop off though , because it ’s just not what it once was , but will still end up having a respectable box office .
$ 162 m
7 . The A - Team - trailer looks great , and the cast looks even better .
Has to be better than GI Joe in order to hold audiences for a few weeks .
Marketing in the weeks close to release is key to this being big out of the gate .
$ 160 m
8. Inception - this is the film that pretty much everyone knows the least about .
What we do know - DiCaprio , Christopher Nolan ’s follow up to the Dark Knight , and some cool visual effects .
Nolan knows how to tell a story , and keep the attention of the audience .
I ’ll be there opening night .
$ 153 m
9. Eat Pray Love - go ahead and give Julia Roberts at least an Oscar nomination for this role .
The film will be huge , especially for the ladies , and it comes out in August , which means it will pretty much own that month .
The trailer is promising , and I ’m sure the next one will be even better .
$ 144 m
10 . Grown Ups - this spot was a tough one for me , but combine Adam Sandler , David Spade , Chris Rock , and Kevin James ?
This has to be funny , and has to be better than Chuck and Larry .
I see an audience for this one .
Should make a decent amount of money .
$ 138 m
Other hits …
11 . Prince of Persia - Based on the popular video game , this film looks heavy on the action , and Jake Gyllenhall looks fit for the role .
Opening weekend should be really good , providing a good alternate choice for the men who are n’t dragged to Sex and the City 2 .
12 . Robin Hood -
I never like to underestimate Russell Crowe , especially when he ’s working with director Ridley Scott ( Gladiator ) , but this film seems all too familiar for audiences , and even though the trailer looks promising , this may be a case of been there , done that one too many times .
Could be wrong about this one .
If the film is really good , then word of mouth might propel it to the top 10 .
13 . The Last Airbender - Mr. hit and miss ( several misses lately ) , M. Night Shyamalan takes on an ambitious task in bring this to the big screen .
It is based on the animated television series , Avatar : Last Airbender .
The action has to be cool , and the pacing of the film is key .
People expect a lot from M. Night , and it is time that he delivers .
Dev Patel ( Slumdog Millionaire ) stars .
14 . Knight and Day - Let ’s face it , Tom Cruise needs a hit .
This is the type of film that just might do the trick .
He has good chemistry with Cameron Diaz , and the film looks cool , slick , and funny .
Anything Cruise does is going to rely heavily on word of mouth .
He appears to be kind of back in Jerry Maguire type mode here , and that ’s a good thing .
15 . Despicable Me- this animated film looks funny , but coming out after Toy Story 3 and Shrek 4 , it will suffer from being the third major animated film in 2 months .
Should still do ok , due to the response to the trailer .
16 . Salt - Angelina Jolie is made for these roles .
This looks interesting , and is not light on the action .
The problem I see here is that it does n’t look as exciting as Wanted , and people may be getting a bit tired of Jolie in these roles .
She does still have drawing power though , and this should be a modest hit .
17 . The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice - Nic Cage is back with Jerry Bruckheimer in what , to me , looks a bit boring .
However , this combination has made mega bucks before with the National Treasure series , and the new trailers closer to release should build up enough buzz to make a mediocre hit .
18 . The Other Guys - there is usually one breakout comedy released during the summer , and my pick this year is this one starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg .
Just the idea of the two of them in a comedy is enough to make me want to see it .
19 . Cats and Dogs 2 - the sequel to the suprise hit from 2001 .
Kids are going to want to see this one , and being in 3 - d , families may make this a 3 - d family day out , meaning more money for the studio .
20 . Predators - I have really high hopes for this one .
A new vision from producer Robert Rodriguez , with a decent cast - Adrien Brody , Topher Grace and Laurence Fishburne .
Looks to be going retro , and has a feel similar to the original .
Misses -
The following films are the ones I think will have a hard time finding an audience this summer .
1. Jonah Hex - no buzz at all .
Megan
Fox will pull in a few , but the lead is portrayed by Josh Brolin , who is not a big box office draw .
2. Marmaduke - a bad trailer , this film seems destined to get lost in the mix of all of the other films in May and June .
3. Get Him to the Greek - Russell Brand … you either love him , or hate him …and I just do n’t thinnk there is enough love here .
Plus , being a follow up to the hilarious Forgetting Sarah Marshall , the trailer looks just ok , and lacks the laughs .
4. Dinner for Schmucks - so so trailer , do n’t think this comedy will find much love .
Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd are funny actors , but something is missing here .
Ca n’t put my finger on it .
5. Step Up 3D - seriously , just do n’t understand this one .
Should be without 3D and straight to dvd .
Possible sleeper hits
1. The Expendables - Stallone , Jet Li , Statham , Stone Cold , Eric Roberts , Lungren , Terry Crews , Couture , Rourke , Willis , and Schwarzenneger .
Need I say more .
Old school actors , old school action .
I ’m there .
2. Letters to Juliet - Amanda Seyfried has been hit and miss this year , but the trailer for this film looks sweet enough to pull a few people in .
If the chemistry is good between the leads , this one could surprise .
A lot of good films to be released this summer , although 2011 is going to be one of the biggest years ever !!
Wait til’ you see that list .
Anyway , Iron Man will rule the summer !
I love it !
probably one of the greatest applications for the up and coming photographer .
I will be pushing my students to sign up and use this for their portfolios .
Ease of use .
It has a nice scrolling system with options for how you want to organize .
Best of all it ’s linked to all your photos and groups in Flickr , allowing easy additions of your copyrighted photos .
Three American cities on the brink of broke
Shuttered businesses line a downtown street November 20 , 2008 in Detroit , Michigan .
FORTUNE --
Several downtrodden cities are on the verge of defaulting on their debt , putting financially encumbered states and taxpayers on the hook to pick up the tab .
The National League of Cities says municipal governments will probably come up $ 56 billion to $ 83 billion short between now and 2012 .
That 's the tab for decades of binge spending ; municipal defaults could be our collective hangover .
Municipal bonds , issued to fund public projects such as roads and public buildings , have historically been seen as one of the safest places to invest , which is why 80 % of municipal bond holders are individual households and mutual fund investors , explains Jeffrey Cleveland , municipal bond analyst at Payden & Rygel Investment Management .
The average five - year cumulative default rate for investment - grade municipal bonds is less than half a percent , according to Moody 's data .
That 's about one - third the amount of corporate debt defaults .
But municipal defaults are on the rise , and the trend is expected to continue .
Last year 183 borrowers -- mostly " risky " municipal issuers , such as suburban developers in Florida -- were unable to make $ 6.4 billion of payments .
That 's way up from 31 defaults on $ 348 million just two years earlier , according to Distressed Debt Securities .
In the past year only one city has actually defaulted : Menasha , Wis . ( Warrens , Wis. narrowly averted a default by agreeing to forbearance on a state loan . )
But that could increase , says Matt Fabian , managing director at Municipal Market Advisors .
Rampant unemployment , tepid consumer spending , and deeply underfunded public pensions are the leading causes of the balance sheet issues cities are having today .
But years of political chicanery and poor financial decision - making by city officials are what led to this problem .
These three municipalities have perhaps the most tenuous grips on staying in the black , thanks to all the above factors :
Jefferson County , Ala .
Jefferson County , Alabama 's most populous county , with some 665,000 residents , is shouldering about $ 5 billion of debt , most of which was issued to overhaul its sewer system in the mid-1990s .
But the county 's real troubles stem from a 2003 refinancing of the original fixed - rate bonds and a corrupt local government that accepted kickbacks in exchange for mangling the county 's portfolio .
In an effort to benefit from lower interest rates , the county switched to floating - rate bonds , much like the variable - rate mortgages that clobbered the housing industry .
It also bought billions in interest rate swaps , complex financial vehicles intended to hedge against changing interest rates .
Needless to say , those instruments did n't perform as advertised and actually ended up costing the county more in fees .
Most of Jefferson County 's bonds are guaranteed by insurers Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp. and Syncora .
But those insurers also overextended themselves during the boom .
Syncora was unable to pony up its share of a $ 71 million payment due last year , and now without a net , Jefferson County has warned that a Chapter 9 bankruptcy may be in the cards .
Harrisburg , Penn .
Pennsylvania 's capital owes $ 68 million in bond interest payments this year -- $ 3 million or so more than its entire annual budget .
The Harrisburg Authority , the governing body that issued the bonds to construct a state - of - the - art trash incinerator , has already been unable to make several payments , and now the county government , which footed the bill last year for a $ 775,000 swap fee , is suing for the funds .
The authority is also indebted to the owner of the trash - burning facility , Coventa Energy , to the tune of $ 20 million .
In April the authority also missed a $ 637,500 payment to Coventa , and is now in the process of negotiating a forbearance .
The mayor has said the city wo n't declare bankruptcy , but the governor has vowed not to bail Harrisburg out , leaving everyone wondering what options are left .
In the meantime , the city is sifting through its assets , some of which include arcane Western artifacts purchased by the previous mayor with public funds , to see whether there 's anything they can put on eBay before the next payment comes due .
Detroit
To make up for a 2010 budget shortfall of $ 280 million , Detroit issued $ 250 million of 20 - year municipal notes in March .
The issuance followed on the heels of a warning from city officials that if its financial state did n't improve , it could be forced to declare bankruptcy .
Nonetheless , demand for the bonds was high , thanks in large part to a guarantee that the state would make the payments if the city became insolvent .
Michigan has already proved that it has few qualms about stepping in .
In early 2009 the state took over the Detroit Public School System , which was facing a budget deficit of more than $ 300 million .
Now a governor - appointed " emergency financial manager " oversees every penny spent .
Bankruptcy and contagion risk
There 's no standard operating procedure for a city or county default .
In some cases the state steps in with a loan , and in others the city or county will declare bankruptcy , though that is rare .
" There is n't the legal obligation , " says Carl Dincesen , an independent tax - exempt - bond risk consultant .
Bankruptcy may not even be the best option , or the most efficient .
The city of Vallejo , Calif . has been in Chapter 9 bankruptcy for two years .
" Chapter 9 should be a final step , not a first option , " Cleveland says .
It opens a city up to seizure of public and perhaps even of private property , judicial oversight of city spending , state assumption of the debt , and a lien tax revenues .
Because of the rarity of such bankruptcy filings , experts seem to agree that a Greek - like contagion threat , in which exposure to bondholders is so great that a large - scale default or bankruptcy would cause a massive financial seizure , is n't likely in the U.S .
Still , a major default or bankruptcy would be a shock , just as Orange County 's bankruptcy shook investor confidence in 1994 .
" Because economic growth prospects are bleak , [ a bankruptcy would ] drain resources away from service divisions and infrastructure finance , " says Fabian .
" It 's going to be a drag on economic growth . "
One of the reasons I love documenting my online business ventures is that I have the ability to go back in time and re-live some of my experiences running a business .
And this came in handy the other day when a reader asked me the following question .
Steve , it seems like you always know what you are doing .
Do you ever get impatient with the progress of your business ?
Do you ever compare yourself to other entrepreneurs and get frustrated with yourself ?
Now my first reaction was to respond with something trite like “ Do n’t give up .
It ’s completely normal to feel this way .
Do n’t compare yourself to others blah blah blah … ” .
But instead , I dug deep into the archives of my blog to find this gem of a post .
Here ’s the thing …
Whenever you read about an entrepreneur who has a made a large sum of money in a short period of time , there is always a misconception that their path to success was quick and smooth .
Take my Stanford tree loving buddy Pat Flynn for example .
If you read his blog and his tips , it seems as though he can make tens of thousands of dollars per day by barely lifting a finger .
What you do n’t hear about enough though is the pain and hardship he went through to get to this point .
I ’m guilty of this as well .
The fact is that once your online business is up and running , life does get easier and we tend to forget about the early stage pain .
Looking back at our online wedding linens business , there were several times when I was a neurotic mess and I did a lot of stupid things .
( Notice the use of the word “ I ” .
My wife was usually more level headed and patient ) .
Some of the most common questions I get asked are , “ Was business slow early on ? ” , “ Was there any point in which you did n’t think things would work ? ” , “ Was there any point that you got frustrated and wanted to quit ? ” .
If you were planning on asking me any of these questions , I ’ll just save you the time right now and say “ YES !! ” as loudly as I can type .
In fact , there were many stupid things I did early on which I will share below .

My Mood Was Dictated By Sales
After the many weekends and late nights spent launching our business , I wanted to see results right away .
In fact , I wanted sales so badly that I became obsessed with every customer that visited our site .
One of the coolest and biggest time sucking features of our shopping cart is that you can follow a customer as they browse your store .
What product are they looking at ?
Are they in checkout ?
What do they have in their shopping cart ?
You have all of this information at the click of your finger .
Editor ’s Note : Today , you can watch videos of your customers and track their mouse movements which brings stalking to a whole different level : )
Early on when things were slow , I used to stalk our customers and my mood would be dictated by their actions .
Me : Come on baby !
That ’s right …
Put something in your shopping cart .
You want those linen napkins .
I know you do .
They ’ll look great on your dining room table .
Wife :
Will you stop stalking our customers already ?
It ’s just going to get you all worked up .
Me : Nonsense !
Oh !!!
They put something in their cart !!!
I think they might buy something !
C’mon baby .
Buy it !!
Buy it !!
Wife : ** Sigh ** Me : Sweet !
They are entering in their information !!!!
Just a little further …
C’mon , click on ‘ submit ’ .
you can do it .
It ’s the big purple button on the lower right .
Wait …. what ’s going on ?
They ’ve been stuck on the payment page now for over 5 minutes …
What ’s wrong ?!?
Mayday !!
Mayday !!
Why would they leave without paying for their merchandise .
Crap !!!
Is it something we did ?….
Is their something wrong with our store ?
It ’s game over man …Game over !!( I would go on like this for several minutes )
Wife : I think you need to get a life … .
Me :
You are my life dear …. and we just lost another customer .
Whenever we did successfully sell something , I would be on Cloud 9 for the entire day .
But when customers abandoned their cart , I ’d be left with this empty feeling of despair .
This roller coaster of emotions was n’t healthy for my psyche .
Taking Things A Step Further
It ’s one thing to passively observe the behavior of your customers online , but I desperately wanted and needed feedback in order to improve our store .
Why did customers not complete checkout ?
Why did customers leave the store so quickly ?
I wanted to know .
Unfortunately , when you just launch your business and people are n’t buying , feedback can be hard to obtain .
Which brings me to neurotic action number 2 …
Sometimes after a customer had abandoned their shopping cart , I would call them directly and ask why .
As you can imagine , some customers were shocked by the call and some of these conversations were downright uncomfortable .
Me : Our records indicate that you attempted checkout and your order did n’t go through properly .
Do you require any assistance to complete your order ?
Customer : Huh ?
Who is this ?
Me : I ’m sorry .
You were trying to purchase some wedding handkerchiefs from our online store about 15 minutes ago .
Customer :
That ’s strange , I do n’t remember buying anything .
I was just looking around .
How did you did get my number ?
Me : ( You entered it when you left your unpurchased items littered all over our online store !*** This is I wanted to say ***)
Oh okay .
Was there a particular reason that you did not complete your purchase ?
Customer : ** pause **.
No reason … I was just looking around .
What is it you want again ?
Please do n’t call again .
In my defense , even though I drove away some customers early on , I actually did get some quality feedback .
For example , one time a customer told me that there was a bug with our credit card processor and his debit card would n’t work .
Another customer I called told me that our pictures were too small to make out the product details .
I also discovered that many customers went through checkout just to find out the shipping costs because it was n’t obvious what the final total was .
I was even commended once for good customer service !
Even still , getting called by a store right after you decide not to buy is not necessarily a wise thing to do …
Editor ’s Note :
Even though my wife still makes fun of me for doing this , I ’ve talked to many entrepreneurs over the years and calling abandoned cart customers is actually a common practice !
In fact , an entrepreneur I just hung out with at Ecommerce Fuel Live told me that he has a full on team dedicated towards calling back abandoned cart customers !
Looking back , this was one of the best things I ever did for our business early on .
Heck , if you are sending a customer an abandoned cart email , you may as well call them too !
The conversion rate is super high .
Changing Too Fast
Whenever I did receive any sort of feedback , I acted on it fast .
And as a result , our online store was in a constant state of flux .
I never gave any of my changes anytime to digest .
Instead , it was like “ Customer X could n’t find the Checkout button very easily .
Perhaps I should make it twice the size and move it to the left ” .
“ Customer Y thought she needed an account to buy something .
Perhaps I should re-implement the checkout process ” .
What ended up happening was that I was constantly making tweaks without observing the impacts of each change .
It was counter productive and stressful as well because I worked at such a quick pace that I often made mistakes .
Probably the most egregious mistake I made was when a syntax error caused a picture to not load properly on one of our checkout pages .
Customers trying to make a purchase were greeted with a big red X where one of the photos should have been .
We All Have To Go Through It
The next time you read about someone making it big or making lots of money in a short period of time , realize that they had to work hard to get where they are today .
We all have our neurotic moments that we ’d rather not share .
Do n’t even get me started on email marketing .
There was a time when I had a very small email list and I used to stalk everyone ’s open / click rates .
Stella432@gmail.com , why are n’t you opening my mail ?
Do n’t you know I ’m just here to help ?
C’mon Stella … what ’s going on woman ?
Would you like me to email you again with a different subject line ?
Stella , stay with me baby !!!
Stella !!!!!
Here ’s a little secret .
We are all not as confident as we appear to be .
The scary thing is that I ’ve barely scratched the surface with my mistakes .
The fact is that there are n’t any true shortcuts .
Things will come along gradually as long as you constantly try to improve .
If you find yourself getting impatient with your progress and you want to know how long it SHOULD take to be successful with your business , then read this post next .

Judging by history , an MIT - student startup company called C - Crete Technologies , which won this week ’s finals of the annual student - run MIT $ 100 K Business Plan Competition , stands a good chance of beating the odds to become a successful business .
But history also suggests that some of the other finalists who did n’t win the big prize might end up doing just as well , or even better .
C - Crete , started by MIT doctoral student in Civil and Environmental Engineering Rouzbeh Shahsavari and MIT Sloan School of Management MBA candidate Natanel Barookhian , is based on discoveries made last year at MIT about the molecular structure of cement .
The production of cement accounts for more than 10 percent of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions , the team members say , and the new nano - engineered type of cement they developed could reduce that by half , could ultimately save as much energy as would be produced by 100 large nuclear power plants — and would be stronger as well .
“ We believe our technology will make a significant impact on the world , and we look forward to growing a viable , sustainable business to meet these ends , ” Barookhian said .
This year , the competition received about 200 submissions , which were winnowed down to 28 semifinalists and then six finalists , one in each of six separate tracks .
In addition to $ 20,000 prizes for each finalist team , this year there was also a $ 10,000 “ audience choice ” award , selected by the crowd assembled for the competition finale on Wednesday evening at Kresge Auditorium .
That award went to a venture called Aukera , which aims to develop a treatment for the disease ALS , based on recent research at Harvard .
The contest started off in 1989 as a way to promote interest in MIT ’s then newly formed Entrepreneurs Club , which collaborated with the Sloan School ’s New Ventures Association to organize the first contest .
Initially planned for a $ 1,000 prize , the inaugural competition was quickly expanded to $ 10,000 , and over the ensuing years grew to $ 50,000 and finally in 2004 to $ 100,000 .
Although it is still called the $ 100 K — the amount of the top prize — this year ’s contest awarded a total of $ 350,000 in prizes .
As the prize amounts have grown , so , too , has the competition ’s reputation .
The San Francisco Chronicle years ago referred to the MIT $ 100 K as “ the granddaddy ” of business - plan contests , and Inc. magazine said that even as such contests have proliferated nationally and globally , MIT ’s remains “ more equal than all the others . ”
20 years later : ‘ Quite a success ’
In its two decades of existence , the competition has spawned more than 130 companies , which have raised more than $ 770 million in financing and had a cumulative market value of over $ 15 billion .
Among its biggest success stories are Akamai Technologies , a company that provides speedy Internet connections for a significant fraction of the Web ’s worldwide traffic and had revenues of more than $ 850 million last year , and Silicon Spice , a semiconductor company that was sold for $ 1.2 billion just five years after entering the competition .
( Interestingly , neither of these won the top prize : Akamai was a runner - up in 1998 , and Silicon Spice was a finalist that year ) .
Peter Mui ’ 82 , one of the founders of both the competition and the Entrepreneurs Club , said that the idea originated from the realization that at MIT back in the 1980s , there were lots of people with interesting ideas , but few opportunities for people to meet to discuss them or to learn how to turn the ideas into companies , and there was little interaction between the people developing technologies in the School of Engineering and those with expertise in business at the Sloan School .
The club was conceived as a way to meet that need , and soon club co-founder Richard Shyduroff , who has taught an MIT seminar on technology startups for the last 20 years , suggested holding a contest .
The initial prize was going to be $ 1,000 , but staff at the Technology Licensing Office suggested boosting that to $ 10,000 , and Shyduroff spent months pounding on doors to raise the prize money .
“ From there , things just snowballed , ” Shyduroff said .
“ We never thought the competition would take on a life of its own , ” Mui said .
He left MIT after the first year ( and is now a consultant working with small startup companies ) , but Shyduroff and the club ’s other co-founder , Douglas Ling SM ’ 87 , kept the contest going .
Joost Bonsen ’90 SM ’ 02 , who is now the co-director of the MIT Media Lab ’s new Entrepreneurship Program , submitted eight entries in that first year ’s competition — a record number of entries that still stands .
Bonsen took over the management of the competition in 1993 and 1994 .
Every year the competition has continued , he said , its student leaders have continued to build and expand on its scope and reach .
“ Alums from the competition have started business - plan competitions around the world , including Germany , Russia , Ghana and the Philippines , ” he said .
MIT Professor of Applied Mathematics Tom Leighton , one of the co-founders of Akamai Technologies and now its chief scientist , said the competition made all the difference : “ If there had n’t been a $ 50 K competition , there would n’t have been an Akamai , ” he said .
“ We were a research project , and we had no intention of starting a company , ” but the competition provided him and his colleagues with some experience and with introductions to a network of people who helped make the company possible — even though they were not even among the top three finishers in their year .
This year , he said , the company expects to exceed $ 1 billion in revenues .
Over the 20 years of the contest , organizers estimate that some 5,000 students have competed .
“ I never imagined it would be as large a vehicle as it turned out to be , ” Mui said .
“ It ’s been quite a success . ”
Image caption Steven Monjeza ( L ) and Tiwonge Chimbalanga ( R ) face 14 years in jail
A court in Malawi has convicted a gay couple of gross indecency and unnatural acts .
Steven Monjeza , 26 , and Tiwonge Chimbalanga , 20 , were arrested in December 2009 after celebrating their engagement ahead of a wedding planned for 2010 .
They have been in jail ever since and now face 14 years in prison .
Their arrest had sparked international condemnation and a debate about homosexuality in the country .
Judge Nyakwawa Usiwa - Usiwa convicted both men of engaging in gay sex , which he said was " against the order of nature " .
They are to be sentenced on 20 May .
' No victims '
In calling for a lighter sentence , the couple 's lawyer argued that the pair 's actions had not victimised anyone .
AT THE SCENE : RAPHAEL TENTHANI , BBC NEWS , BLANTYRE
Outside the courtroom , hundreds of curious people blocked roads to peek at the couple as they were driven back to the cell at Chichiri Prison amid heavy security .
Dressed in a black suit , white shirt , and blue - and - white tie , Monjeza looked expressionless , evidently resigned to his fate .
In earlier court appearances , he looked downcast and could sometimes be seen shedding tears .
His partner , Chimbalanga - always the more jovial of the couple - turned up in a grey jacket over a black shirt , slacks and slip - ons .
He acknowledged the curious people with high fives as he was driven away .
" Unlike in a rape case , there was no complainant or victim in this case , " he said .
" Here are two consenting adults doing their thing in private .
Nobody will be threatened or offended if they are released into society . "
But the chief prosecutor welcomed the judge 's decision .
" In Malawi , we do n't allow men to marry men or women to marry women , " said Dickens Mwambazi .
" I think 90 % of the crowd here agree with the ruling . "
Same - sex liaisons are frowned upon in Malawi , where homosexual acts are outlawed .
The men had denied the charges and their lawyers said their constitutional rights had been violated .
But the Centre for the Development of People ( Cedep ) and the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation ( CHRR ) have been urging authorities to relax the country 's stance on homosexuals .
The BBC's Raphael Tenthani in Blantyre , Malawi 's commerical capital , says the government is also coming under pressure from Western donors over the issue .
For a poor country , 40 % of whose development budget depends on donors , such concerns must be taken seriously , he adds .
In Wednesdays Page Six , the New York Post will reportedly expose an embarrassing secret about MacGruber .
They ’ll say that , before becoming a spy , he wanted to be a naked model .
He ’s a very sensual man and his chemistry with the camera is electrifying , but he did n’t make it because his penis was only average size .
And then they ’ll mention these pictures .
But since “ waiting for Wednesday ” sounds like some faggity Oprah book about kids with cancer , here are the pictures they ’ll be talking about .
As a powerful Hollywood insider , I was able to get them from a secret source .
I ’m so happy !
Everything is going exactly as planned !
My goal is to make
Tyler the internets premiere destination for full frontal naked pictures of men .
Sources said several large media companies , including Time Warner and NBC Universal , told Apple they wo n't retool their extensive video libraries to accommodate the iPad , arguing that such a reformatting would be expensive and not worth it because Flash dominates the Web .
When the iPad bandwagon was launched in late January , ABC and Netflix quickly jumped onboard with tailor - made apps , while CBS and others started transitioning their content to HTML5 - compliant formats , all in the name of not being left behind by the revolution .
As it turns out , however , some content providers will be letting this ride pass them by , at least for the moment .
The New York Post today reports that big media heavyweights Time Warner and NBC Universal have turned their noses up at the iPad 's high entry demands and will be sticking to what works :
According to the NYP article , these conglomerates have been emboldened by the forthcoming arrival of competing tablets from the likes of Dell and HP , and will be seeking their fortunes in the mobile space atop Adobe 's winged stallion of web domination that we commonly know as Flash .
This is a decision sure to end in tears -- we just do n't know who 'll be doing the crying when it all shakes out .
AFTER a brief blip caused by the global economic slowdown , the electricity business in China is back to normal : in other words , it is buzzing .
On April 26th Huaneng Power , the country 's biggest utility , began work on a nuclear reactor on the island of Hainan .
The week before , the firm had announced that its power output had risen by 40 % during the first quarter .
The day before that , Datang International Power , the second - largest utility , had said its output was up by 33 % .
Surges of this magnitude , unimaginable in most countries , are commonplace in China .
China 's endless power - plant construction boom has accounted for 80 % of the world 's new generating capacity in recent years and will continue to do so for many years to come , says Edwin Chen of Credit Suisse , an investment bank .
Capacity added this year alone will exceed the installed total of Brazil , Italy and Britain , and come close to that of Germany and France .
By 2012 China should produce more power annually than America , the current leader .
Behind the transformation are myriad forms of government intervention .
Although no country has a purely private market for electricity generation , in China the meddling is especially pervasive .
Five big state - controlled utilities , including Huaneng and Datang , control 45 % of the market and smaller state - controlled entities control another 50 % .
Most lost money in 2008 , made fairly low returns in 2009 , and , thanks to a government policy of holding down tariffs , are unlikely to be particularly profitable in the future .
Nonetheless , again because of government directives , the utilities invest spectacular amounts in capital equipment , financed largely by cheap loans from state - controlled banks .
This not only allows utilities in China to produce power more cheaply than those in other developing countries , but also does away with the uncertainty and delay of negotiating guarantees with international development outfits or bilateral export - credit agencies .
The huge expansion of generating capacity serves many purposes , not least of which is bolstering national pride , especially in rural areas that , not long ago , were consigned to darkness after sundown .
Officials are also aware that China 's abundant power helps attract investors who are leery of the flickering industrialisation of other emerging markets .
Cheap , reliable electricity is one reason why China remains the preferred destination for manufacturing even as its wages rise above those in such countries as Bangladesh , Indonesia , the Philippines and Vietnam .
This success has come at a cost .
Cheap power has fuelled the expansion of energy - intensive heavy industries , such as steelmaking and aluminium smelting , which have made China more dependent on electricity than any other big economy ( see chart ) .
That , in turn , has left the Chinese economy ever more exposed to shifts in the prices of coal , oil and natural gas .
It also turns China into an international environmental villain , thanks to its billowing emissions of greenhouse gases .
Chinese officials , all too aware of these problems , have long been pushing expensive measures to develop alternative forms of generation and cut back on profligate power consumption .
The use of power derived from coal will continue to grow in absolute terms ( although new coal - fired plants are to be more efficient and cleaner ) , but its share of total Chinese output will fall from 75 % to 65 % , estimates Credit Suisse 's Mr Chen .
Hydropower will expand by more than half , but its share of the total will drop a bit , from 21 % to 20 % .
Wind power will see a big expansion , taking its share from 3 % to 7 % , as will nuclear , up from 1 % to 5 % .
The rest will come from such niches as solar panels and incinerators .
As with the provision of power in general , the government hopes to capitalise on this transition to spur economic development .
Three more state - controlled firms — Shanghai Electric , Harbin Power Equipment and Dongfang Electric — already receive an inordinate number of contracts for electrical equipment from the state - owned generators .
The huge volume of orders produces economies of scale which have allowed Dongfang , in particular , to earn spectacular returns .
Suzlon Energy , an Indian wind - turbine manufacturer , is largely blocked from selling into China 's booming market .
But it makes its turbines in China regardless because similar gains in efficiency , off the back of huge orders won by local firms , have led to very low component prices .
Hong Kong - based CLP , one of the few non-local generators allowed to operate in China , says the cost of building power plants has dropped by half in the past decade , thanks mainly to falling equipment costs .
When foreign suppliers are permitted to sell in China , they are usually required to transfer technology to local firms .
China 's massive expansion of nuclear power provides a good example .
Over the next ten years the authorities plan to spend a trillion - odd yuan ( $ 150 billion or so ) to increase its capacity ninefold .
The country has 21 nuclear reactors under construction — far more than any other country .
Naturally , China hopes to acquire lots of nuclear know - how along the way .
Half the content of a unit of the Lingao plant , in Guangdong , where construction began in 2005 and is due to be completed at the end of this year , will be made at home ; in the next unit , to be completed next year , the share of local content will be 70 % .
By 2020 , China 's goal is to build advanced reactors entirely by itself , and to export its prowess abroad .
Chinese firms have already built one reactor in Pakistan , are working on another and plan two more .
China is harnessing its hunger for electricity , in other words , to increase its economic power .
Noam Chomsky criticized Israeli and U.S. policies toward Palestine while speaking in Salomon 101 Tuesday night .
Noam Chomsky , the internationally renowned linguist and outspoken political activist , offered an analysis of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , criticism of Israeli and U.S. policy and advice on student activism to a rowdy Salomon 101 audience that spilled over into Sayles Hall Tuesday evening .
“ Thank you .
Now we can go home , ” said the Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguistics professor as he stepped on stage before the clamoring crowd .
Though most often cited in academia for his work on linguistic theory , cognitive science and philosophy , it was Chomsky the political activist who spoke last night .
He began his lecture by recommending a column in Tuesday ’s New York Times — a piece on public opinion of Israel by the Times ’ Jerusalem correspondent , “ someone I rarely praise , ” he said — and segued into a discussion of the relationship between Israel , the U.S. and the United Nations .
Israel ’s policies in Palestine are against international law , but “ as long as the master agrees , it does n’t matter what the law says , ” he said .
And by “ the master , ” Chomsky largely meant the U.S. government , which continuously fails to utilize its persuasive power in the U.N. and international trade to end injustice , he said .
Chomsky compared the Obama administration ’s support of the Israeli government to Ronald Reagan ’s continued trade with South Africa under apartheid in the 1980s .
“ As long as they had that one vote , the world could be disregarded , ” he said of the U.S. ’s vote against sanctions on South Africa .
As long as the U.S. government backs Israel ’s violations of the Geneva Convention , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict will not be resolved , he said .
Chomsky said the U.S. backs not only Israel , but also India and Pakistan — the two other countries that refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
“ The U.S. is not supported by the world on this , ” he added .
If the U.S. overestimates the world ’s approval of its foreign policy , it is because the phrase “ international community ” in American press often “ refers to Washington and whoever else agrees , ” he said — a category which excludes most Americans , who “ agree with the world outside the international community . ”
One way the U.S. could exert positive influence on the real international community , he said , is to support Egypt ’s goal of creating a weapons - free zone in the Middle East , as discussed at a recent meeting in Tehran .
Chomsky also called for a termination of arms shipments to Israel .
During the question - and - answer session , Chomsky addressed foreign policy issues across the board .
The misperceptions held by American politicians , press and public are all culprits of the ignorance surrounding oppressive policies in the Middle East and elsewhere , he said .
“ They do n’t hate us because they hate our freedoms .
They hate us because they want their freedoms , ” he said of Middle Eastern populations under U.S. “ neocolonialism , ” addressing George W. Bush ’s confusion over their objections to the U.S. government .
But Chomsky did not let Obama off the hook either .
He criticized the president ’s opinion on Egypt ’s authoritarian government : that he does n’t want to label “ folks . ”
When a politician uses the word “ folks , ” Chomsky said , “ get ready for the next series of lies . ”
Chomsky added that a country requires awareness to examine its own mistakes .
“ It ’s pretty hard to look in the mirror , but it ’s crucial if you want to understand the world , ” he said .
He also emphasized that ending American support of corrupt regimes begins with groups like the students he spoke to .
“ Every step forward in history comes the same way , ” he said .
“ People like you do something about it . ”
He suggested protesting , gathering information and spreading awareness .
“ The task of those of us who care , ” he said , is to “ let people know . ”
When asked what he would change if he could go back to his own early years of activism during the Vietnam War , Chomsky said , “ My main regret is I was much too mild , ” adding that his opponents would say just the opposite .
The student group Common Ground : Justice and Equality in Palestine / Israel sponsored Chomsky ’s visit .
Member Lucas Mason - Brown ’ 13 came up with the idea , he said , because Chomsky “ voices an opinion , which is absent from mainstream discourse . ”
But this was not Chomsky ’s only recent interaction with the Brown community .
On April 18 , he wrote a letter to Brown Students for Justice in Palestine endorsing its campaign for the University ’s divestment from corporations benefitting “ criminal and brutal actions . ”
“ It is hard to imagine a more defensible stance , ” he wrote .
Lindsay Goss GS , a member of Brown Students for Justice in Palestine , said she valued Chomsky ’s take on “ some of the ways the conflict gets talked about ” that “ do n’t reflect the reality of the situation . ”
Ruhan Nagra ’ 10 said she appreciated “ Chomsky ’s support for student activism throughout the country . ”
Associate Dean of the College for Science Education David Targan , who posed a question at the lecture about student involvement , said he hopes Chomsky helped Brown students recognize their influence in the political process .
“ You have access to people that can really effect change , ” he said , referring to state representatives .
“ You can see them from the Rock . ”
From an anonymous female
My daughter ( aged over 40 ) has been with her husband for more than 15 years .
He is a heavy drinker and while drunk often beats her up .
She has fled to my home on several occasions but always returns to him .
Lately he has lost his job and his drinking is now daily , with my daughter suffering frequent beatings in front of the three children .
He 's always insisted she should n't work and now he has no income either so I find myself sending them money and food regularly .
Carole , when I suggest she should leave him , she just laughs .
What 's up with that ?
Carole replies :
For your daughter simply to pack and go seems , on the surface , like the obvious choice , but what has he threatened to do to her if she attempts this ?
If she leaves will she have to change the children 's schools , and where will she go ?
Back to her mum ?
It has been theorised that some women who live with domestic violence do so because they learned how to when they themselves were growing up .
1
If so , this would mean that your three grandchildren are , at this very moment , adapting to abnormal patterns of attachment that could well give them pain throughout their lives .
Other research has suggested that while battered mothers can provide the maternal warmth their children need , they are unable to supply maternal authority due to low self - esteem .
2
According to some surveys , approximately a quarter of all heterosexual women experience physical or sexual abuse , or both , by an intimate partner at some time during their lives .
3
This damage radiates outwards from the victim , scarring her children and others emotionally close to her .
4
Women habituated to battery are frequently unable to step back and take stock of the bigger picture .
The trauma impacts upon cognition and they tend to employ short - term coping strategies , such as fleeing when violence erupts , only to return during a hiatus when things are quiet and he has said sorry .
5
Frequently men who batter their partners justify the violence by saying she provoked them and should have realised they would become angry or jealous .
Jealousy of the perpetrator is a universally cited reason given by victims for why their male partner battered them .
Incidentally , male jealousy is theorised to have evolved as a way to dominate females and assure paternity .
6
Victims are often blamed and frequently blame themselves .
They may feel guilt or shame .
In addition , a woman 's uncertainty over finances or inability to manage the situation will result in anxiety and feelings of helplessness .
Unfortunately , if a victim empathises with her abuser 's psychological weaknesses she may forgive and even pity him .
Women like this need external intervention to help them to objectify their relationship and see it for what it is , so they can start to prioritise their own needs without feeling guilt or pity .
7
You say your son - in - law has just lost his job and he has always forbidden your daughter from working .
The tighter money becomes the more your daughter will be punished .
8,9
He sounds like a socially inflexible , jealous , controlling man , who suffers low self - esteem , has intentionally isolated your daughter and stamps on her to raise his own status .
His uncontrollable anger is never far from the surface and soon your grandchildren will not just be witnesses , they will become physical victims of battery too .
What can you do to put a stop to this ?
There is no single , universally effective strategy for ending abuse .
10
You want to help your daughter , but you also feel frustrated by her .
Do n't tell her she has brought this on herself and that you tried to warn her but she would n't listen to you .
She needs help to self - assess so try not to judge her .
The money and food parcels that you send are only perpetuating the problem .
You 've got to get her professional help .
I would suggest you go with your daughter to her GP and ask for a referral to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services ( CAMHS ) department .
Insist that your daughter and grandchildren are assessed by a clinical psychologist / psychiatrist with expertise in this domain .
An application for sheltered accommodation and re-housing may be justified .
The multidisciplinary staff found at a CAMHS department can help negotiate this and also offer other therapies .
Change will , in the short term , cause stress , but eventually if your daughter and her children stick together and make a break from this man they will not remain as victims of violence .
Instead , over time and with help , the children will develop into the people they should have been had they lived in a stable and harmonious environment from birth .
Once re-settled your daughter should get a part - time job , or volunteer at her children 's school , or re-train , so long as the hours suit her children 's needs .
11 This will help raise her self - esteem and stop her from remaining isolated at home .
It 's not too late for any of these changes to be successfully implemented , but the time is now .
You can contact the excellent charity Women 's Aid for further advice .

Many people are shy .
Shy folks are not only easily embarrassed , they are also embarrassed by the fact that they are easily embarrassed .
They tend to assume that shyness is unattractive , and that it mainly indicates lack of courage or strength .
They wish they were n’t shy .
If you are shy and this is how you think , I have good news for you : shyness has important positive aspects .
In particular : shyness promotes intimacy .
Intimacy is a feeling of closeness , based in part on mutual vulnerability .
A person who is comfortable around most folks , talking or doing most anything , finds it harder to create mutual vulnerability .
How can you tell such a person is comfortable with you , as opposed to conformable with everything ?
In contrast , a shy person who is awkward and embarrassed around most folks , or when talking about many topics , can more easily show that they treat you differently .
If they are less awkward around you , and are willing to talk to you less awkwardly about usually - awkward topics , you can take that as a good sign that you have achieved some level of intimacy .
They treat you with less caution , presumably because they are less afraid you will hurt them .
In this way , a shy person can more easily show you that you are special to them .
To better bond , be shy .
Reserve some topics as ones you will not talk with just anyone about , and some activities as ones you will not do with just anyone .
Then by selectively talking and doing , you can signal your intimacy with some relative to others .

New migration data from the Census bureau show that migration increased in 2008 - 2009 but the rise was almost entirely due to intracounty moves — a reflection of foreclosures and the poor job market last year .
The mover rate , which is the percentage of people who report a move , increased to 12.5 % last year from 11.9 % in 2008 ( that was the lowest mover rate since at least 1945 , when the Census started keeping track of the data ) .
That would seem to be a positive increase since jobs are one of the biggest reasons people move , but a look below the numbers shows that ’s not the case .
The mover rate within counties increased to 8.4 % last year , the highest since 2003 .
But the mover rate across county lines and between states is still mired in levels unseen since at least the 40s , and probably since the Great Depression , according to an analysis of Census data by William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution .
Simply put :
The data are showing that millions of people who have lost their homes are moving nearby to rent , but that jobs were still scarce enough that few people made the state - to - state move .
“ Since labor migration is the often seen as the grease that spurs the flow of goods , capital and job creation , these new numbers are not encouraging , ” says Mr. Frey .
Of course , given the marked improvement in the job market through 2010 , it ’s likely that the state - to - state migration rate will show an increase through 2010 .
Moving has long been seen as a sign of economic health .
Today ’s data show that , given the historic distortions to the housing market , in this recovery it is just as important to look at where people are going .
לוחמי הקומנדו הימי נפלו כפרי בשל לידיהם של אנשי המשט לעזה .
כמה דקות לפני שהחלה לפנות בוקר ( יום ב ' ) ההשתלטות על ה " מרמרה " , קיבל מפקד הכוח מידע שחבורה של כ - 20 אנשים נמצאת על גג הסיפון העליון שעליו היה המסוק צריך להנחית את הצוות הראשון של שייטת 13 .
התוכנית המקורית היתה לרדת על הסיפון העליון ומשם לרוץ לגשר הספינה , כדי להורות לקברניט הספינה הטורקית הגדולה לעצור את ההפלגה , לאחר שכל הניסיונות לקרוא לספינות המשט לעצור נענו בשלילה .
מפקד חיל הים נתן את ההוראה סמוך ל-22:00 , ומבצע ההשתלטות יצא לדרך ב-4:00 לפנות בוקר , אחרי ניסיונות חוזרים ונשנים של אנשי חיל הים לכרוז לספינה לשנות את נתיבה .
המבצע התקיים 60 מייל מחופי ישראל , מול חופי העיר חיפה .
בשלב הראשון עלו כוחות חיל הים על ספינת הנוסעים מרמרה , על הספינה צ'ל נג'ר ועל הספינה 8000 .
בשתי הספינות הקטנות יותר היתה התנגדות לא אלימה , שדעכה תוך זמן קצר .
עם זאת , על המרמרה התכוננו היטב למפגש אלים .
דם בלב ים - כותרות אחרונות ב- ynet :
ברק : הלוחמים היו בסכנה ; אשכנזי : לא היה די ציו ד
ההערכה היתה שהאנשים יגלו התנגדות קלה , אולי קצת אלימות נוסח בלעין , ולכן קיבל מפקד הכוח החלטה להביא את מסוק ה " ינשוף " מעל לאותו גג.
החבל הראשון שבו היו אמורים לוחמי שייטת 13 להשתלשל לספינה נתפס על ידי פעילי המרמרה , טורקים ברובם , ונקשר לאחת האנטנות , בתקווה שכך יפילו את המסוק .
לוחמי שייטת 13 החליטו להמשיך בפעולה .
נציגי משרד הפנים ועצורה באשדוד ( צילום : עמוס בן - גרשום , לע " מ )
בזה אחר זה החלו אנשי הקומנדו הימי לגלוש בחבל - אך אז קרה הבלתי צפוי : הנוסעים על המרמרה שחיכו להם על הגג שלפו אלות , מוטות ברזל , " קלע-דוד " עם גולות זכוכית - והחלו להלום בכל לוחם שירד בגלישה על החבל מהמסוק .
הלוחמים שנאלצו לרדת בזה אחר זה נתפסו כל אחד בפני עצמו , הוכו קשות אבל ניסו להשיב מאבק .
לרוע מזלם , הם היו מצויידים רק ברובי צבע שמשמשים לפיזור הפגנות קלות .
מובן שכדורי הצבע לא עשו רושם על הפעילים שהלמו בהם שוב ושוב , ואף ניסו לחטוף את נשקם .
אחד הלוחמים שנחלץ לעזרת חברו לצוות - נפל בידי המתפרעים וספג חבטות קשות .
ללוחמי השייטת היה אקדח שנאמר להם שעליהם להשתמש בו רק במקרים שנשקפת סכנה לחייהם .
כאשר גלשו בכבל מהמסוק הם הקפידו לצעוק " לא לירות , לא לירות " , למרות שספגו מכות רבות .
פעיל שהיה על אחת הספינות , בנמל אשדוד ( צילום : עמוס בן - גרשום , לע " מ )
אנשי הקומנדו הימי הוכנו מראש להיתקלות בעיקר עם פעילים פוליטיים שמבקשים לקיים הפגנה , ולא עם לוחמי רחוב מאומנים .
נאמר להם כי עליהם לשכנע בדברים את מי שיתנגד להם ואם לא ישתכנע - להשתמש בכדורי צבע .
רק במקרים קיצוניים ביותר הותר להם לעשות שימוש באקדחים .
מפקד השייטת הורה : " תזרקו רימוני הל ם "
הריצה המתוכננת לעבר גשר הפיקוד הפכה בלתי אפשרית .
גם כשהוכנס מסוק נוסף ועליו עוד צוות לוחמים .
" תזרקו רימוני הלם " , צעק מפקד השייטת שפיקד עליהם .
מפקד חיל הים היה לא רחוק ממנו , על סירה מהירה של שייטת 13 , יחד עם הכוח שניסה לטפס מהירכתיים אל תוך הספינה .
הכוח השליך רימוני הלם אבל המתפרעים על הגג , שבינתיים גדל מספרם ל- 30 .
הם הפליאו את מכותיהם בכ - 30 לוחמי השייטת שהמשיכו " לזלוג " לכיוונם בגלישה מכבל המסוק .
ברגע מסוים לקחו הפורעים את אחד מאנשי השייטת , חטפו את אקדחו והשליכו אותו מגג הסיפון העליון אל הסיפון התחתון , מגובה של 10 מטרים .
האיש נפצע קשה בראשו ואיבד את הכרתו .
" זה נראה כמו הלינץ ' ברמאללה " , סיפר אחד הלוחמים .
רק אחרי אותה פציעה ביקשו אנשי השייטת רשות ממפקד הכוח להשתמש בירי חי .
המפקד אישר : אתם יכולים לירות אש חיה .
" הכינו אותנו לזה שנדבר איתם , ואם לא יילך בדיבורים אז נשתמש בפיינט בול " , סיפר לוחם .
" אם לא יעזרו כדורי הצבע , אז אם נשקפת סכנת חיים - יכולים להשתמש באקדח " .
ואכן , בשלב זה שלפו הלוחמים את אקדחיהם והחלו לירות לעבר רגלי המתפרעים , שנוטרלו בסופו של דבר .
בינתיים , החלו המתפרעים גם לירות בחזרה אל לוחמי השייטת .
" ראית י קצה קנה של רובה מבצבץ מתוך גרם המדרגות " , סיפר לוחם שייטת , " הוא ירה לעברנו ואנחנו גם ירינו לעברו .
לא ראינו אם פגענו , חיפשנו אותו אבל אחר כך לא מצאנו אותו " .
מיריות המתפרעים שכנראה השתמשו באקדחים שחטפו מלוחמי השייטת , נפצעו בינתיים שני לוחמים , האחד בברכו ובירכו והשני בבטנו .
הרופא : " 20 שוכבים כאן בלי תזוזה כבר חצי שע ה "
במהלך המהומה , נדקר לוחם שייטת אחר בסכין .
בחיפוש מאוחר יותר שערכו על המרמרה מצאו לוחמי השייטת מצבורים של נשק קר , אלות , מוטות ברזל , סכינים ומקלעי אבנים שבהם התחמשו המתפרעים לקראת השתלטות כוחות צה " ל. נראה שהם היו ערוכים היטב .
חלק מנוסעי הספינה עמדו בירכתיים ובמכות אלה על אצבעות הלוחמים ניסו למנוע מהם השתלטות על הספינה .
רק כעבור חצי שעה של ירי משני הצדדים ושימוש אכזרי במוטות ברזל וסכינים הצליחו לוחמי השייטת להגיע לגשר ולהשתלט על המרמרה .
כעבור שעה הכריז מפקד השייטת , א' , כי המרמרה בידו , אף כי לא נסרקה כולה .
הוא ביקש את התערבותם של שני מסוקי " יסעור " ואת יחידת החילוץ של חיל האויר , 669 , להוציא את לוחמיו .
קולו של הרופא שהיה עם הכוח נשמע לחוץ ברשת הקשר .
" כמה הרוגים יש בין הנוסעים ? " שאל מפקד בכיר .
" אני לא יודע , אבל כ - 20 שוכבים כאן בלי תזוזה כבר כמעט שעה " , אמר מפקד הכוח .
לאורך כל זמן ההשתלטות עמד מפקד חיל הים בקשר עם הרמטכ " ל גבי אשכנזי , ודיווח לו על מהלך הפעולה .
חשבו בלעין - קיבלו בנגקו ק
אז מה השתבש בלב ים ?
נראה שהטעות הייתה שבתכנון המבצע העריכו כי אכן מדובר באמת בפעילי ם
פוליטיים , אנשי ארגונים הומניטריים שמבקשים לעשות פרובוקציה פוליטית , אבל לא יגלו אלימות ברוטלית .
חשבו שייתקלו בבלעין - וקיבלו בנגקוק .
הכוח שהשתלשל ממסוקים היה קטן , קומץ של כמה עשרות אנשים , קטן מדי מכדי להתמודד עם הקבוצה הגדולה שהמתינה לו .
הטעות השנייה היתה שמפקדי הכוח לא התייחסו מספיק ברצינות לעובדה שחבורה של גברים מחכה ללוחמים על הגג .
אילו היו מתייחסים לעניין זה יותר ברצינות , יתכן שהיו זורקים מהמסוקים רימוני גז מדמיע ורימוני עשן למיסוך שהיו מאפשרים להם לבצע את משימתם מבלי שהלוחמים ייפלו אחד אחד כפרי בשל לידי המתפרעים , שהפליאו בהם את מכותיהם .
WWE ’s Thursday offering , Superstars , is back on WGN - America .
This week there was no nonsense .
Three matches filled the entire broadcast with no backstage BS .
Here ’s what went down :
JTG vs. Cody Rhodes
WINNER : Rhodes via pin fall after hitting Cross Rhodes
Yoshi Tatsu vs. Primo
WINNER : Tatsu via pin fall after hitting a spinning heel kick off the top rope
Evan Bourne vs. Zack Ryder
WINNER : Ryder via pin fall after avoiding the Air Bourne and following it up with a Zack Attack
QUICK THOUGHTS :
I love episodes of Superstars like this .
I do n’t have to worry about story line being thrown in there with backstage segments .
I just get to focus on the matches , and I actually get to see wrestlers who take pride in their craft and can actually get out there and put on a decent match .
JTG / Rhodes was a good match till a really awkward looking neck breaker near the finish .
Tatsu / Primo was okay , but I ’m just not overly into their styles .
They ’re good at what they do , but it ’s just not my cup of tea .
Bourne / Ryder was a good match too .
I loved how they let Bourne get back into it , only to rip the heart out of the crowd when he missed Air Bourne and lost !
That was brilliant !
I 've written about why Persian / Farsi is not only not a difficult language as a lot of people seem to think , and why it 's actually easier than the languages most people study in university , such as German , French , Spanish , Latin , and so on .
Today I think I 'll try to write up a more complete overview that can put the matter to rest and act as a good reference point for the next time you notice a discussion on which language is easier / harder than others .
First , a general overview of what kind of language Persian is : Persian is an easy language cloaked in an air of seeming difficulty .
It 's not easy to learn for two reasons : 1 ) it uses the Arabic alphabet ; 2 ) it 's just not as easy to find places to use it as with languages like Spanish , French , German , and so on .
The language itself is quite easy to learn though , and because of reason 1 ) above I would recommend that anybody seriously learning or teaching the language over a long period of time ( say over a 4 - year period in university ) should spend the first six months or so without learning the alphabet .
It 's much easier to get an idea of what the language is like when you do n't have to up and learn a whole new alphabet at the same time .
Lastly , before beginning a detailed explanation of where Persian is easier to learn than a lot of other languages , I 'd like to make clear the distinction between passive and active understanding .
German is a perfect example of a language with relatively high passive understanding but with a complex grammar .
Something like this for example :
Die deutschsprachige Wikipedia gratuliert der chinesischsprachigen Wikipedia zu 200.000 Artikeln .
Persian verbs are ridiculously easy .
Every single verb is regular in the past tense .
The only verb irregularity ever seen is in verbs that have an irregular present stem .
Once you have learned this stem , however , it conjugates regularly like any other .
All verbs end in - tan or - dan in the infinitive .
or in the infinitive .
Take off the - an from this to get the past stem .
from this to get the past stem .
Now we add a suffix to this .
Suffixes are : - am for I , -îd for you , - îm for we , - nd for they , and no ending for he / she / it .
for I , for you , for we , for they , and no ending for he / she / it .
All done !
Close your book , there 's no more learning the past tense anymore .

Persian has no articles .
mard - e- khûb
Ich bin ein Berliner
Ich bin Berliner
Persian has no cases .
( Note : this depends a bit on what you consider to be a case , but the main point here is that there 's much less to learn )
man
be ,
be-man
shomâ
beshomâ
âb
âb-e-man
daftar ,
daftar - e- shomâ .
Persian adjectives can be used as adverbs .
khûb
Persian words are intuitive and easy to build .
Kaghaz ( paper ) + khosk ( dry ) + kon ( present stem of ' to do ' ) = Kaghaz - e - khosk - kon ( blotting paper , literally paper of dry make ) .
( paper ) + ( dry ) + ( present stem of ' to do ' ) = ( blotting paper , literally ) .
Shahr ( city ) + dâr ( present stem of ' to have ' ) = shahrdâr , municipality .
Adding an î to the end of this makes it into an adjective , giving shahrdârî , municipal .
Persian has quite a few cognates with English and other Indo - European languages .
bad
mâdar
barâdar
pâ
ast
nist
to
And some other random notes :
Ordinal numbers except 1st are all regular .
Just put - om on the end of the number .
on the end of the number .
Plurals are regular , ending in - hâ or - ân for living things .
There are Arabic plurals for some words but there is nothing wrong with not using them ( like Latin plurals of words like octopi for octopus ) .
Relative clauses are easy , just using ke to join two clauses .
" The coffee that he drank " for example is literally " Coffee ke he drank it " .
" The boy that went to school " is " Boy ke he went to school " .
Conclusion
Persian grammar is similar to many other Indo - European languages , especially those in the Indo - Iranian family .
Since Middle Persian it has had a relatively simple grammar , having no grammatical gender and few case markings .
Plurals : Persian plurals are regular ; Arabic , like Latin , pluralizes words depending on what kind they are ( gender for example ) .
In Persian you can pluralize a few Arabic loanwords in the Arabic way if you want , but it 's not necessary .
Here are a few examples ( note that the Arabic pronunciation is probably a bit different ) : hêivân ( animal ) becomes hêivân ât , mîvé ( fruit ) becomes mîvé jât , manzel ( house ) becomes man â zel , khatar ( danger ) becomes a kht â r , zarf ( bowl ) becomes z o r û f , mosâfer ( traveler ) becomes mosâfer în .
In Persian the basic rule is just that - hâ is suffixed to non-living things , and - ân to the living .
mîvé ( fruit ) becomes mîvé , manzel ( house ) becomes man zel , khatar ( danger ) becomes kht r , zarf ( bowl ) becomes z r f , mosâfer ( traveler ) becomes mosâfer .
In Persian the basic rule is just that is suffixed to non-living things , and to the living .
Arabic also has dual number in addition to the singular and plural .
Arabic has 28 consonant phonemes , Persian 23 .
Arabic nouns and adjectives are marked for case , number , gender and state .
Arabic verb conjugation is more complex , and depends on gender , number ( including dual ) , etc .
Here 's a good example of how Arabic conjugation works .
Being a Semitic language , there are almost no cognates like the Persian bad ( bad ) , mâdar ( mother ) , barâdar ( brother ) etc. given above .
They certainly are n't the majority in Persian , but at least there are some .
There are quite a few French loanwords as well ; here is a list of some of them .
is quite easy for anyone with an elementary knowledge of German : it says " The German language Wikipedia congratulates the Chinese language Wikipedia on ( to ) 200,000 articles " .
Writing this is on your own is a different level of difficulty however , because you need to know that Wikipedia is feminine ( die ) , that deutschsprachig ( German speaking ) becomes deutschsprachige after die , and so on .
It 's certainly not the world 's hardest language but there 's a lot to remember when writing things by yourself .
Persian is the opposite - it has much lower passive understanding for the English speaker but it 's much , much easier to use .
Now , let 's get into the details : Verbs in Persian are extremely easy .
Like most Indo - European languages , they conjugate by using suffixes after the stem of the verb .
Unlike most Indo - European languages , they are extremely regular .
This regularity is seen in the following :
Here is how it works : Some examples : To be isTake off theand we get .
Now put on the suffixes , giving ( I was ) , ( you were ) , ( we were ) , ( they were ) , ( it / he / she was ) .
Another example is , to go .
The present tense is like this except it takes off the wholeorwhereupon you add aprefix , and some verbs have the irregular stem that you will need to learn once .
Some examples : To read is khândan .
Take off the - dan and you have khân .
Put the mî- prefix in the front , then put the same endings on the end ( add an extrain the 3rd person ) .
Now you have ( I read ) , ( you read ) , ( we read ) , ( they read ) , ( he / she / it reads ) .
That 's easy .
For verbs with the irregular stem you just remember that along with the regular stem when you learn it , and you 're done .
One example : The verb to go , , has an irregular - present stem .
When learning , remember that its present stem is , and you 're done .
Now it conjugates as regularly as the rest : ( I go ) , ( you go ) , ( we go ) , ( they go ) , ( he / she / it goes ) .
This may seem complicated at first glance , but remember that I 've just explained just about everything you need to know to form the past and present tense in Persian .
Let 's compare this to a Western European language .
We 'll go with French être , to be : Hmm , all irregular .
How about : aller , to go : Irregular again !
Hm , thinks the French student , maybe French verbs in the first person all end in -s.
Nope : donner , to give : Up to six irregular forms for each verb in French .
In Persian you 'll find maybe one , and after you know that both past and present tense conjugate using the same suffixes .
Persian has no words for the English the / a .
That means thatfor example means good man , a good man , or the good man .
But since English has articles too , not having them would n't be such an advantage , would it ?
Admittedly this is a bigger advantage for people that have a mother tongue that has no articles , but note that articles are n't used in the same way between languages , which is why you 'll see the definite article for general terms like philosophy in French ( " the " philosophy ) and place names ( " the " Canada ) , whereas German is the opposite in that you do n't use the indefinite article when talking about professions ( Ich bin Portier - I am doorman ) .
That 's where thebit comes from , that Kennedy would have been better off saying .
With Persian you do n't even have to think about that in the first place .
Cases almost do n't exist in English except in pronouns , which is why you have to say " she gives it to me " as opposed to " she gives it to I " , and " for them " instead of " for they " .
Cases are bad enough when they apply to all nouns like in German , but even in languages where they do n't you have to learn extra words with I , me , my , his , him , her , hers , their , them , and so on .
Persian does n't have this .
I isin Persian .
To isso " to me " is .
You is , so to you isGenitive case ( her , my , his , their , etc. ) is the same thing .
You take a noun , put an - e- in between , and then put the pronoun on the end .
Water is , so my water is .
Office isso your office is For the most part adjectives can be used as adverbs .
This means that , good , can also mean well , just like how English often says " you did good " instead of " you did well " .
In Persian this is grammatically correct , however .
Here are a few examples :
Given the large amount of Arabic and Turkish loanwords these are n't as frequent as the student might like , but a lot of words are the same or almost the same : ( bad ) , ( mother ) , ( brother ) , ( foot , think pedestrian ) , ( there is , think German ist ) , ( there is n't , think German nicht ) , pedar ( father ) , ( informal ' you ' , think thou ) , etc .
This post was written not with the intent of convincing anyone to drop German / French / what have you for Persian , because in spite of its grammatical simplicity Persian remains difficult to use in terms of finding places to use it , and economically it does n't have that much clout .
However , due to the script there seems to be a lot of grouping it in with Arabic as one of those insanely hard languages capable of breaking even the most dedicated of minds .
Arabic is certainly up there in terms of difficulty .
Persian is not .
If for example you are entering university and thinking of a career to do with the Middle East / intelligence gathering / international diplomacy and fluency in languages such as Persian / Arabic / Turkish is a plus , you might want to give Persian a closer look .
Avoid the Perso - Arabic script for the first six months , focus on sentence structure and grammar , and then you 'll realize that this language you 've chosen to study is not the grammatical demon it 's made out to be .
And then after you learn it you can pretend that it was insanely difficult .
See , even Wikipedia agrees with me : Anything else to add on or any corrections ?
Feel free to leave comments below and I 'll add them to the article if necessary .---- Edit August 2nd : A member on reddit.com has made the point that I did n't really address how Persian is easier to learn than Arabic , which is a valid point because the title I used there was in reference to how much easier Persian is to learn , and that people interested in the Middle East / intelligence gathering / foreign relations and the like that do n't like the thought of trying to learn Arabic might be interested in learning Persian instead .
Since the two are unrelated ( Arabic is a Semitic language whereas Persian is Indo- European ) besides a lot of foreign loanword borrowing and using the same script ( much in the same way that Japanese is unrelated to Chinese but has borrowed a lot of vocabulary ) there are many ways in which Persian is easier for your average English speaker to learn than Arabic .
I wo n't go over them all but here are a few good examples :
Those are just a few examples of how Arabic takes more time to learn than Persian , but suffice to say that Persian is basically just an Indo - European language in disguise whereas Arabic requires a lot more effort before being able to use it with confidence .
In addition , Arabic varies from region to region much more than Persian does .
In this installment of Dress Code , we 're going to address the biggest sartorial challenge of the warm - weather months : wedding season !
Cuz , among many other stresses , that mean dress codes .
Festive , formal , semi - formal , black - tie - optional ... we 'll sort it out together .
Advertisement
First of all , do n't panic .
You know your friends .
If you wear something slightly too glitzy or a bit too casual , are you going to get kicked out ?
No .
I have been to daytime weddings where half the church was for some reason wearing satin ballgowns and the other half was in garden - party frocks and really , it did not effect anyone 's good time - certainly not the wedded couple's .
Advertisement
That said : yes , this is one of the few remaining occasions where we are given a " dress code , " and so the pressure 's on to meet it .
And let 's face it : weddings mean interacting with a lot of people .
Sometimes it 's all your partner 's friends .
Sometimes exes are there .
Or someone 's parents .
In general , there 's a lot of scope for stress .
So let 's , at least , sort out our terminology .
For practicality 's sake , we 've organized specific types of weddings — beach , evening , etc. — according to what we feel would be their dress code if said dress codes were n't explicitly stated on the invite .
And if they were , this guide will be even easier for you to sift through .
If you 're not sure what you 're dealing with in terms of the scene , keep in mind the time of the wedding , the venue , and , if you can , the personalities of the happy couple and the kind of crowd with whom you 'll be cavorting .
There 's a plenty of nuance to go around !
As always , these are just suggestions ; keep in mind that there are , as always , regional variations : the south , for instance , is a little more traditional .
When in doubt , do n't wear black — but in , say , New York , black 's usually not going to be a problem .
That said , wherever you are , I do think the no-white ( unless you 're the bride ) rule is always safe to follow .
I tried to give a range of ideas , but just use these formality notions as loose guidelines and go to town : after all , rules are made to be broken and shoes to dance in .

White Tie :
The uber - formal rarity !
You wo n't , honestly , have to go to that many white - tie weddings .
Unless you 're the sort of person who does , in which case you probably have a lot of gowns already .
White - tie is Oscars .
It 's balls .
It 's can 't - be- overdressed .
Wear a long gown , or a tux with white tie , or maybe even a tail - coat .
Once I went to a white - tie event that had a " hunt " theme but I ignored that and it was really not a problem .
Advertisement
Black Tie :
This just means " formalwear . "
A long dress or a short , fancy dress .
Heels .
A tux .
Evening pants and a jazzy top .
Think , " too fancy for most of my life , " keeping in mind that dudes need to wear tuxes .
This could be a fancy evening wedding at a hotel , for instance - but if they want you to dress up this much , they 'll say so .
Formal means the same thing .
Occasionally , one runs across " Texas Black Tie " or some other such abomination .
This means same as above ... with a stetson .
Or a tartan sporran .
You get the idea .
Advertisement

Creative Black Tie :
This is where things get dicey / sadistic .
What does this even mean ?
What it means for those of us who have to do it is , very similar to normal black tie , but maybe involving more color .
Or a wacky tie .
Or a fetching fascinator !
Think whimsy !
Formal whimsy .
This is the sort of unspoken code that will , like I mentioned above , have much to do with the wedding location , etc .
Advertisement
Black Tie Optional : This , I guess , is designed to let those guys who do n't own tuxes off the hook .
For women , it basically means the same as the above : formalwear .
Advertisement
Semi-Formal / Dressy - Casual : I know : what ?
This basically means tuxes are n't required .
But keep it dressy .
Hippie .
Advertisement
Cocktail Attire :
Whereas " black tie " can mean a long dress , cocktail is shorter .
It 's dressy , but not formal .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Formal Daytime :
Dress up , but avoid " evening " touches like sequins .
When in doubt , just do n't wear all - black and you 'll feel more daytime .
Or do color , but avoid casual fabrics like cotton .
You can also generally get away with a snazzy pattern !
Advertisement
Festive :
Really , all bets are off here : poll your friends , ask the bride or look up the venue online .
But all this really means is " party clothes " - dress , skirt , pants , whatever , as long as they 're smart and you 're making an effort .
I have seen variations on all of the following fall under this heading .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Informal / Casual :
This one 's all about dressing for the occasion .
Beach wedding ?
Linen 's nice !
Rustic cabin ?
Low heels should be just fine .
Make an effort , because it 's nice , but obviously this couple 's not standing on ceremony .

The number is probably around 1,700 , but Cheryl Whitfield has never counted .
She does n't know the number of times over the past couple of years she 's donned her uniform of black vest and slacks , crossed her heart with a white - gloved hand as the flag - draped casket passed , or bent to squeeze the palm of an old soldier 's widow , whispering a few words of consolation and gratitude for his service .
The Champions - area grandmother just knows , like many of the other 28 women who make up the “ National Memorial Ladies , ” what she does at the Houston National Cemetery is her mission , her calling .
“ I want people to know these guys are not forgotten , ” Whitfield says .
Whitfield , inspired by the Arlington Ladies who attend military funerals in the Washington , D.C. , area , started her own version in Houston in September 2008 .
She began alone , recruiting volunteers through newspaper ads .
Now , the group , with two ladies on call each day , covers all 60 or so funerals each week at the Houston National Cemetery .
On behalf of “ the American people , ” they offer condolences to next of kin , complete with handwritten cards .
“ When I drive through the gates in the morning , and there 's dew covering everything , it 's like I step into a different world , ” Whitfield says .
“ There 's nothing behind me .
It 's a peacefulness I feel . ”
On a recent morning , two members of the VFW District 4 Honor Guard carefully slid the flag off the simple black casket of 57 - year - old Vietnam veteran Thomas Stanford II .
They folded it into a starry wedge and presented it to his sister , Linda Shafer .
Whitfield held the Channelview woman's hand , assuring her that her brother was in a better place and his service was n't forgotten .
‘ They made it special '
After the ceremony , Shafer said her brother , a proud veteran of the Army , Marines , and the Merchant Marines who flew a POW banner outside his home next to the American flag , would have appreciated the gesture .
“ It was awesome , ” she said .
“ They made it special .
I think he would have loved it . ”
At times , Whitfield has attended eight services in a single day .
Like the other ladies , she shows up in the rain , on the coldest winter days , and all summer when the rising mercury melts her makeup and leaves her feet swelling in her shoes .
At times , Whitfield has attended eight services in a single day .
Like the other ladies , she shows up in the rain , on the coldest winter days , and all summer when the rising mercury melts her makeup and leaves her feet swelling in her shoes .
She says her group serves as the “ calm in the storm , ” offering a warm touch , a kind word to soothe families ' grief .
Sometimes , their words are met only with blank stares , sometimes with grateful tears .
“ Some of them will have that desperate look in their eyes .
It 's like they want me to tell them something they can hang on to , ” Whitfield says .
Whitfield says she considers her role in the service as an honor , one that 's given her more appreciation for life .
“ I do n't leave here depressed .
I leave here thinking we 've got to cherish all the time we have . ”
Most of the ladies are from military families .
Whitfield 's 89 - year - old father flew a B - 17 during World War II .
The ladies range from retirees to real estate agents to 33 - year - old Gina Moretto of Spring , who finds a baby sitter for her 20 - week - old so she can attend funerals once a month .
The hardest services , the ones that Whitfield and her fellow volunteers can't shake from their minds , are the services for 20 - somethings who leave behind young spouses and sometimes children .
“ I did Petty Officer ( Zarian ) Wood last week , ” Whitfield says , referring to the Navy hospital corpsman from Houston killed in Afghanistan .
“ It stays with you .
I mean , I 'm still thinking about it .
Those are the ones that you walk away , and you feel drained .
And you feel like we are in a war and people do n't realize it .
And he 's 29 . ”
Difficult memories
One service Marilyn Koepp attended last fall haunts her .
The 62 - year - old retired teacher from Spring presented her condolence card to the 3 - year - old son of a soldier killed in action .
The boy sat on his mother 's lap , near an urn with his father 's ashes .
“ He looked at me with his big , giant , brown eyes and said , ‘ Where 's my daddy ? ' ”
Koepp recalled .
She said she told him his daddy was in his heart , that he 'd always be there , watching after him .
One of the ladies ' most important duties is attending the services of veterans who have no one else .
A few times each week , the Memorial Lady is the only person in attendance .
If Harris County makes the funeral arrangements , the veteran 's body is typically driven to the service in a cream - colored 1989 Cadillac hearse , accompanied by social workers , who accept the folded flag and the condolence card .
“ It 's sad because , you know , I 'm there , and they play taps just like there 's 100 people there , ” Whitfield says .
“ This man fought in a war , but he was also a kid , and he was also a teenager and a young man , and then he dies , and nothing . ”
The only ones there
Once last year , Koepp said , she watched three funerals conducted within about five minutes , none with family present .
The third soldier 's name was James , whose grave she still visits and adorned with a wreath at Christmas .
“ Why we all do it is for that soldier , ” she says .
“ To be buried alone , after all they did for us , I have a very difficult time understanding that . ”
Koepp , whose father fought in D - Day and the Battle of the Bulge , and whose husband was a naval officer in Vietnam , said she understands much of what the veterans and their families went though because her own family has lived it .
Her service in Memorial Ladies is the best way she can think of to honor the memories of those who fought and sacrificed for her freedom .
“ I 've told the escorts , ‘ I 'm just telling you right now , at some point , you 'll be bringing me in a wheelchair , ” she says .
“ Because I 'll never stop doing this . ' ”

I am surprised that some of you do n't understand what is at stake in McChrystal 's offense .
It is really quite simple .
The principle has always been in this country that the federal military is an instrument of state policy .
Our tradition is designed to prevent the emergence of " Caesarism " as a method of picking leaders or determining basic national policy .
To maintain that principle Macarthur was fired on the advice of George Marshall .
What McChrystal has done is to challenge President Obama .
Everyone in the armed forces knows that .
The notion has emerged in the COIN community that Obama is weak and can be bullied into removing the time restriction that he has placed on the Afghanistan COIN campaign plan that he adopted at their urging last year .
Macarthur implicitly threatened both Roosevelt and Truman with the possibility that he would mobilize Republican politicos against them .
The COIN crowd think that the same method can be used against this president .
They have been willing to bet that he is no Truman and that Gates and Clinton do not have Marshall 's strength .
The effrontery of the deed in feeding this reporter all this material without placing it off the record is clearly a challenge to civilian control of policy .
McChrystal must be fired .
Then he should be put on the retired list in his permanent grade with no end of career award .
Then some thought should be given to the clear violation here of Article 88 of UCMJ .
Active duty military people are free to express their opinions to their superiors .
They are not and should not be free to use the press against the civilian government .
Admiral Byng comes to mind .

The BBC pundit picks his team of the tournament
The other day , Rep. Ed Markey made the following mundane but true observation :
For years , the Bush administration 's oil strategy placed the granting of drilling leases ahead of safety review .
This irked Neil Cavuto no end :
Ipso - facto —
Bush to blame for the big leak - o .
Just like he 's apparently behind that big thousand - point swing - o.
Just like he's to blame for the unemployment rate that 's higher than when he left office , and the deficits that are much higher than any year he was in office .
All problems , all Bush , all the time — probably until the end of time .
Cavuto wants a " statute of limitations " on blaming Bush .
" Just give it a break , " he pleaded .
Nuh-uh .
It 's true that the miseries we 're currently enduring are not merely the fault of the sole personage of George W. Bush , the man now widely viewed by conservatives as The Man Who Betrayed Conservative Values .
He had lots and lots of help .
In fact , he had millions of little helpers -- all those movement conservatives who now want to pretend that he was n't a real conservative .
This is because , in reality , Bush is The Man Who Nearly Destroyed the American Economy .
It was n't Bush 's " betrayal " of the " conservative values " they believe are so time - honored and proven that caused his abysmal failure -- it was those values themselves , and Bush 's steady adherence to them throughout his tenure .
Right - wingers like Cavuto and everyone else at Fox , however , simply cannot accept this cold reality ; the resulting cognitive dissonance has now driven them pretty much insane .
The conservative approach to mis-governance comes up at every turn today for the liberals and centrists now dealing with repairing the damage , from managing the economy back onto its feet to fighting the two wars Bush got us into to coping with environmental disasters produced by his safety regulations .
And it would be stupid to pretend that it 's not what we 're dealing with .
Because you see , if we do n't constantly remind people of the disastrous consequences of conservative rule , they start listening to people like the talking heads at Fox News .
They start forgetting just who got them into this big damned mess in the first place .
Some of them even start blaming liberals for it ( especially the hard - core insane conservative defenders ) .
We can't let that happen .
Conservatives need to be slapped with the Bush legacy on a daily basis .
Sure , they 'll whine .
But they have it coming .
In the world of home brewing , ingenuity saves time and money .
Homebrew gadgets come in all shapes and sizes , and not all are strictly necessary , but most of them make the brewing process a little easier .
Here we will outline the benefits of ten homebrew gadgets that have helped brewing operations , as well as a few others we have heard about .
Gadget # 1 : Racking Cane
Most new brewers brew on bare bones systems for many months , and then finally invest in a racking cane , it really saves a lot of time and hassle .
Most brewers never know why they did n't get one when they started - do n't scrimp on this item , it is really useful .
Gadget # 2 : Wort Chiller
Beginning brewers sometime think that if they have the patience , they do n't need to spend money on a wort chiller .
Just leave the wort out overnight to cool naturally , right ?
Wrong .
This practice leds to contamination .
Better to chill the beer as quickly as possible and minimize the risk of bacterial contamination .
Gadget # 3 : Cornelius Keg System
" When I first started brewing , I was cheap . " said the new brewer .
" I bottled my beer for many months before looking into Cornelius kegs .
Now , I almost exclusively keg my beer , and save bottling for special brews only , my private reserve . "
Kegging your beer will save you a lot of time , as bottling is so labor intensive .
Gadget # 4 : Homebrew Draft System [ External Link ]
Kegerators come in many sizes and shapes .
A kegerator conversion kit is one of the best investments a home brewer can make to ensure that your home brew has the chance to be the best it can be .
The kit allows you to transform a regular old refrigerator into a multi-tap home draft system .
This will also spice up the party scene in your home .
Gadget # 5 : Hydrometer
It is important to know how strong your beer is .
A hydrometer is the tool that allows any home brewer to calculate this .
With this knowledge , a home brewer can perfect and hone the craft and make beer with exacting accuracy .
Gadget # 6 : Hop Filter
If you are like most , you like to put a lot of loose leaf hops into your beer during the boil .
This makes for a difficult time straining the beer as you put it into the carboy .
A hop filter helps greatly with this , but you must understand that you should get the big chunks out with a strainer first .
By using the hop filter in the racking process , you can ensure that your beer is clear and beautiful in the finished product .
Gadget # 7 : Homebrewing Software
For the beginning brewer , the services of programs like homebrew tools or beer tools can give a great starting point .
For example , if you want to know how to make a wheat beer with 5.6 % alcohol and fruity undertones , these programs can help you do it .
Gadget # 8 : Keg- meter [ External Link ]
This little invention keeps track of how much beer is left in your keg , your beer temperature , and even has a lockout function .
Ideal for home made kegerators or for factory made kegerators .
See www.keg-meter.com for further information .
Gadget # 9 : Beer Keg Brew Kettle
Getting a hold on a five or six gallon stainless steel brew kettle can be difficult , but making a 15 gallon brew kettle out of a stainless steel beer keg takes only an hour !
See our keg conversion project on how this can be done by those proficient in metal fabrication .
Gadget # 10 : Kegerator Beer Line Cleaners
If you own a kegerator , you will absolutely need a beer line cleaning kit .
These kits have everything you need to ensure that your home draft beer system stays in tip top shape and never suffers from bacterial contamination .

KNOXVILLE , Tennessee ( Reuters ) - A college student who hacked into former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin ’s e-mail account and posted some of its contents on the Internet was found guilty Friday .

After four days of deliberations , a federal jury found David Kernell , the 22 - year - old son of a Democratic Tennessee state legislator , guilty of obstruction of justice , a felony , and unauthorized access of a computer , a misdemeanor .
Kernell was cleared of a wire fraud charge , and the jury could not agree on a verdict on a charge of identity theft .
Judge Thomas Phillips declared a mistrial on the identity theft charge but did not set a date for sentencing .
The obstruction charge alone carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years , while the misdemeanor count is punishable by up to one year in jail .
Palin issued a statement on her Facebook page , thanking the jury and prosecutors and explaining the case ’s importance .
“ Besides the obvious invasion of privacy and security concerns surrounding this issue , many of us are concerned about the integrity of our country ’s political elections .
America ’s elections depend upon fair competition , ” the statement said .
“ Violating the law , or simply invading someone ’s privacy for political gain , has long been repugnant to Americans ’ sense of fair play .
As Watergate taught us , we rightfully reject illegally breaking into candidates ’ private communications for political intrigue in an attempt to derail an election . ”
A subdued Kernell had no comment , and he was released on bond while barred from using a computer except for school assignments and e-mail .
Kernell ’s attorney had argued during the weeklong trial the hacking of Palin ’s e-mail account amounted to nothing more than a college prank , but prosecutors said Kernell had hoped to derail the Republican ’s campaign .
Palin and her daughter Bristol each testified about the disruption the break - in had caused to both their personal lives and the campaign .
“ If there ’s any unauthorized access to computers , the Department of Justice takes that very seriously , ” said prosecutor Mark Krotoski after the verdict was announced in U.S. District Court .
In September 2008 , Kernell did a little research and some guesswork to answer security questions and gain access to Palin ’s personal e-mail account .
At the time , published reports had questioned whether the then - Alaska governor had improperly used her personal e-mail to conduct official business .
Kernell said he found nothing incriminating , but posted some of the account ’s contents online , along with a new password he assigned it .
“ The conduct was serious , ” Krotoski said .
“ He had every opportunity to pull out and not proceed . ”

David Lazarus ’s Los Angeles
Times column today lays out what everyone who ’s studied the problem knows needs to be done .
Since we ca n’t afford subways everywhere we need them , create “ virtual subways , ” i.e. exclusive bus lanes on all the major boulevards , by eliminating car lanes .
( The Metro Rapid bus network , compromised as it is , was in many ways designed to help people discover this for themselves .
When the Rapid was being invented in the 1990s , the LA city council was n’t willing to consider bus or HOV lanes on arterials .
So Metro took the view , “ let ’s do everything we can to make an attractive fast rail - transit - like bus service , so that more people will care about buses getting through . ”
That ’s pretty much what the Metro Rapid is , and did . )
Since we ca n’t afford subways everywhere we need them , create “ virtual subways , ” i.e. exclusive bus lanes on all the major boulevards , by eliminating car lanes .
( The Metro Rapid bus network , compromised as it is , was in many ways designed to help people discover this for themselves .
When the Rapid was being invented in the 1990s , the LA city council was n’t willing to consider bus or HOV lanes on arterials .
So Metro took the view , “ let ’s do everything we can to make an attractive fast rail - transit - like bus service , so that more people will care about buses getting through . ”
That ’s pretty much what the Metro Rapid is , and did . )
Fund transit expansion by hitting up motorists , via gas taxes or congestion pricing .
He also mentions one idea that may be a bit more divisive among transit advocates :
Longer term , although I believe subways are best for
metropolitan areas , L.A. would probably be best served by an elevated
rail system — maybe a monorail , maybe something else .
Elevated lines and
stations are significantly cheaper to build than subways , and it would
be relatively easy to begin with existing freeway routes .
For
example , an elevated track could run down the center of the 405 to the
10 , make its way downtown and then loop up the 101 back to the 405 .
Once
that ’s running , we build out from there .
Getting a line to Los Angeles
International Airport would be very high on my to - do list .
I wonder if that bit was influenced by Steve Hymon ’s recent survey of past monorail visions in LA .
Apparently there was a plan in 1960 for monorails along all the major freeways , and also on Wilshire Blvd .
It looked like this :
( From Dorothy Peyton Gray Library at Metro , via The Source )
Rail transit in freeway medians still presents major challenges for both land - use and customer experience , as explored here .
If the line is elevated over the freeway , as a monorail would be , you would have problems with siting stations , as they would need to be high above freeway interchanges , possibly quite a long way , both horizontally and vertically , from anywhere anyone might be going .
Still , it ’s interesting to see this kind of thinking — especially the practical notions about bus lanes and funding — coming from a mainstream columnist .
None of it is his idea , but when you ’re a columnist , anything can be your idea .
A few months ago , the American Family Association ’s Bryan Fischer declared that the time had come to throw all Muslims out of the US military and prevent any others from every serving again .
So I guess it should not come as a surprise that Fisher is now calling for the deportation of all Muslims in the US along with a blanket ban on the immigration of Muslims into this country :
[ T ]he most compassionate thing we can do for Americans is to bring a halt to the immigration of Muslims into the U.S .
This will protect our national security and preserve our national identity , culture , ideals and values .
Muslims , by custom and religion , are simply unwilling to integrate into cultures with Western values and it is folly to pretend otherwise .
In fact , they remain dedicated to subjecting all of America to sharia law and are working ceaselessly until that day of Islamic imposition comes .
The most compassionate thing we can do for Muslims who have already immigrated here is to help repatriate them back to Muslim countries , where they can live in a culture which shares their values , a place where they can once again be at home , surrounded by people who cherish their deeply held ideals .
Why force them to chafe against the freedom , liberty and civil rights we cherish in the West ?
In other words , simple Judeo - Christian compassion dictates a restriction and repatriation policy with regard to Muslim immigration into the U.S .
I guess that I should point out that Fischer is listed as a confirmed speaker [ PDF ] at next week ’s “ Awakening 2010 ” Freedom Federation summit where VA Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a keynote address .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Children exposed to pesticides known as organophosphates could have a higher risk of attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , according to a U.S. study that urges parents to always wash produce thoroughly .

Researchers tracked the pesticides ’ breakdown products in children ’ urine and found those with high levels were almost twice as likely to develop ADHD as those with undetectable levels .
The findings are based on data from the general U.S. population , meaning that exposure to the pesticides could be harmful even at levels commonly found in children ’s environment .
“ There is growing concern that these pesticides may be related to ADHD , ” said researcher Marc Weisskopf of the Harvard School of Public Health , who worked on the study .
“ What this paper specifically highlights is that this may be true even at low concentrations . ”
Organophosphates were originally developed for chemical warfare , and they are known to be toxic to the nervous system .
There are about 40 organophosphate pesticides such as malathion registered in the United States , the researchers wrote in the journal Pediatrics .
Weisskopf said the compounds have been linked to behavioral symptoms common to ADHD -- for instance , impulsivity and attention problems -- but exactly how is not fully understood .
Although the researchers had no way to determine the source of the breakdown products they found , Weisskopf said the most likely culprits were pesticides and insecticides used on produce and indoors .
Garry Hamlin of Dow AgroSciences , which manufactures an organophosphate known as chlorpyrifos , said he had not had time to read the report closely .
But , he added ” “ the results reported in the paper do n’t establish any association specific to our product chlorpyrifos . ”
Weisskopf and colleagues ’ sample included 1,139 children between 8 and 15 years .
They interviewed the children ’s mothers , or another caretaker , and found that about one in 10 met the criteria for ADHD , which jibes with estimates for the general population .
After accounting for factors such as gender , age and race , they found the odds of having ADHD rose with the level of pesticide breakdown products .
For a 10 - fold increase in one class of those compounds , the odds of ADHD increased by more than half .
And for the most common breakdown product , called dimethyl triophosphate , the odds of ADHD almost doubled in kids with above - average levels compared to those without detectable levels .
“ That ’s a very strong association that , if true , is of very serious concern , ” said Weisskopf .
“ These are widely used pesticides . ”
He emphasized that more studies are needed , especially following exposure levels over time , before contemplating a ban on the pesticides .
Still , he urged parents to be aware of what insecticides they were using around the house and to wash produce .
“ A good washing of fruits and vegetables before one eats them would definitely help a lot , ” he said .
This last weekend , my business partners and I were at Big Omaha ( one of the best business networking experiences of my life ) .
Before we got to the Slowdown , we were eating dinner and discussing expectations and our excitement for the conference .
Corey made a comment on how he does n’t like our business cards ; I then said that I think business cards in general are a waste .
You see , I ’ve been on this kick for striving towards minimalism and the reduction of stuff …
I ’ve never kept a business card .
I transcribe the information and then throw them away .
“ I think we should just tell people to keep their business cards .
Let ’s connect with them on Twitter , as Twitter is a more personal and intimate way to connect than a piece of paper . ” I said .
Brian expressed some hesitancy , as he feared that some would be offended .
I conceded that that may be an issue .
Our general consensus was to just do it anyway and gauge people ’s reaction .
We arrived at the Slowdown .
We started networking immediately .
The inevitable came .
“ Hey man , it was great to meet you … let me give you my card . ”
Me : “ Ya… ugghhh… umm .. OK . ” I did n’t have the balls to do it .
As I kept ingesting the liquid courage , I was finally able to say to tell people my new found revelation of business card wastefulness .
“ No dude , keep your business card .
I ’ll end up throwing it away anyways .
Let ’s connect on Twitter . ”
Them : “ ummm … OK , sure I guess . ”
I got the sense that most people were offended by that statement .
I realized that my delivery was insensitive .
I figured that if I tuned it to a more diplomatic approach then I might get a different reaction .
The next night at the Nomad as the inevitable statement came out “ Let me give you … ” I then presented my grand metaphor on how business cards are like the horse & buggy and Twitter was like the car , as if I was some business networking pioneer .
Some people saw my point of view , most did n’t .
Worse , people were still offended .
I ’m sure some thought I was full of shit or even a bit arrogant .
I bombed it bad .
I was trying to transition our great conversations onto an internet medium .
It was tougher than I expected .
I reflected upon this .
I could n’t quite figure out why people did n’t quite see my point of view .
Ya , there was a bit of friction when you have to open up your Twitter client and type in someone ’s Twitter name right in front of them when they could have easily handed you a card .
Coincidentally , Today I read the article Sometimes Five Seconds Is All It Takes .
Todd Smith Quotes Mark Jeffries :
In this interview Mark said , “ You have to make the other person feel great about their communication with you .
Do n’t put someone ’s business card in your pocket .
They are handing you a little life story .
If you do n’t take a moment to look at the card , acknowledge it and say something about it , you are missing a huge opportunity to tilt the scales in your favor .
This is one differentiator point , but it could be all you need to get into positive territory . ”
It hit me .
It did n’t matter how I said it .
I rejected people ’s life story .

Although commonly referred to as the eohippus , which means the dawn horse , it is more appropriately called the Hyracotherium .
Othniel Marsh , an American paleontologist , discovered the fossils of this creature and named it eohippus due to its similarities to the horse .
Although the eohippus was very similar if not identical to a creature British paleontologist Richard Own discovered that he named hyracotherium .
After many years , it was found to be the same species , and they went with the earlier name .
The eohippus only stood 10 - 20 inches tall , which is near the same height as a house cat .
Their legs were higher in the back and shorter in the front , so when they ran , they bounced like pigs .
Their legs caused them not to be very fast , so instead of running when they were scared , they would hide behind trees in the dense forests where they lived .
They did this to get away from large birds and crocodiles that would try to eat them .
They had padded paws with toes rather than hooves .
Their only similarity to a horse is rather than having claws ; they had little “ hooflets ” on each toe — four toes on their front paws , and three toes on each of their back paws .
The body was round with a short neck and a tail like a donkey .
They had a small head with small eyes that could not see very far ahead of them .
It ’s doubtful they were very intelligent since they had tiny brains .
Implementing fonts with @font - face 18 May Tweet
This is probably one of the coolest CSS3 features , along with box - shadow and border - radius .
@font - face was introduced in CSS2 by IE and it has been around since IE 5 .
Most browsers have the ability to use .ttf or .otf fonts , however IE has to be difficult – it only supports .eot fonts .
Luckily it is very easy to implement all of these file types .
How you say ?
Well I used to find a .ttf or .otf file and then try and find a converter in order to convert it to an .eot – I never managed to get this to work though .
Thankfully , fontsquirrel.com exists .
Not only can you find font files to download , but you can download entire @font - face kits , which does absolutely everything for you by giving you the @font - face CSS code , as well as all of the font files you will be needing .
The CSS
@font - face { font - family : ' Chunkfive ' ; src : url ( '../ fonts/Chunkfive-webfont.eot#' ) format ( ' eot ' ) , url ( '../ fonts/Chunkfive-webfont.woff ' ) format ( ' woff ' ) , url ( '../ fonts/Chunkfive-webfont.ttf ' ) format ( ' truetype ' ) , url ( '../ fonts/Chunkfive-webfont.svg#webfontM8M0EYs2 ') format ( ' svg ' ) ; font - weight : normal ; font - style : normal ; } /* Applying it to some text */ p { font - family : Chunkfive , Arial , Helvetica , Sans - Serif ; }
It is as simple as that !
The HTML would simple be a < p > tag containing some text .
The other fonts that have been called for the < p > element are added as a backup in case our newly - added - font does n’t load for some reason .
What is actually going on ?
Line 2 – A CSS name for the font has been declared – “ Chunk - five ”
Line 3 – The first source file , .eot , solves IE ’s problems .
, solves IE ’s problems .
Line 4 – This searches for a local version of the font file and uses it instead of downloading it again .
Line 5 – . woff files are supported by Firefox 3.6+.
This file font type has the ability to be a compressed version of .otf and .ttf fonts and unlike the latter , . woff fonts can contain meta data .

This file font type has the ability to be a compressed version of and fonts and unlike the latter , . woff fonts can contain meta data .
Line 6 – The standard .otf file is loaded .

Line 7 – .svg fonts are supported by most modern browsers except Internet Explorer .
These files are small and a single .svg font file can contain multiple types of fonts .
fonts are supported by most modern browsers except Internet Explorer .
These files are small and a single font file can contain multiple types of fonts .
Line 8 & 9 – This makes sure that the website knows Chunkfive is the regular text and that when you add font - weight : bold or font - style : italic , it should change shape .
Why are all these fonts included in the CSS you say ?
They are a backup .
They do n’t hurt anyone or anything by being included in the CSS , but if one of the files gets deleted or becomes corrupt , the font - file will be swapped out and the website will carry on as usual .
I have tested these @font - face fonts with :
Chrome 4.0 +
Firefox 3.5 +
Internet Explorer 5 +
Opera 10.5 +
Safari 3.1 +
If you find that this works on an earlier browser version than I have above , let me know and I ’ll update the list .
!important ;
Make sure you are legally allowed to use the fonts you wish to use on your website !
fontsquirrel.com is a great free - font resource , but be sure to read the license agreement attached .
Conclusion
The CSS code does n’t feel wonderful to type out , but it works in ALL major browsers which is what counts .
I noticed the font looked a tiny bit jagged in IE 8 ( IE 7 seemed fine ) .
I solved this by creating an IE8 only stylesheet and I changed the font ’s opacity to 90 %
p { filter:alpha( opacity=90 ) ; }
In short , I think this is very awesome .
Still , Butler is a No. 5 seed .
And in a tournament turned upside down , the Blue Devils ( 34 - 5 ) were the only No. 1 seed to make it to the Final Four .
Their trip , however , was n't totally predictable or expected .
Duke had gone six long years since its last appearance and has n't been to the final since winning it all nine years ago -- a veritable century by Tobacco Road standards .
Now , this group of Blue Devils has a chance to give Coach K his fourth national championship .
" It 's everything , " senior center Brian Zoubek said .
" This is the culmination of four years for me .
To have a shot at the championship my senior year , after everything we 've been through , is a dream come true . "
This was a wire - to - wire pullaway against the West Virginia team coached by alum Bob Huggins , who led the Mountaineers ( 31 - 7 ) on a 10 - game winning streak that included the Big East tournament title and ended with a trip to the Final Four .
It was an inspiring journey , the first for West Virginia in 51 years , back when Jerry West wore the old gold and blue .
Huggins returned to West Virginia to bring an elusive title back home to a state that loves its flagship school like few others .
But any chance of that ended with 8:59 left , when the Mountaineers ' star , Da'Sean Butler , twisted his left knee and , to add insult to injury , got called for a charge as he crumpled to the ground .
The sequence left him writhing in pain under the basket and his coach , the Huggy Bear , came out to the floor , first to yell at the refs , then to kneel down and tenderly cup the head of his star -- the player who , more than anyone , made this run possible .
" He just told me not to worry about it , that I 'll be fine , " Butler said .
" And I told him that it hurts right now , but if I can get back out there , then I 'll get back out there . "
He did n't .
The 17 - point - per - game scorer finished with 10 , and was held to a mere basket in the first half while the Blue Devils were building their lead to as many as 13 .
Wellington Smith led the Mountaineers with 12 points .
Meanwhile , Duke stayed on a road that could lead to the school 's fourth championship despite the lack of a true superstar or an NBA lottery pick -- no Christian Laettners or Shane Battiers or Grant Hills on this squad .
Instead , this is a group of players who do what they do well and fill their roles perfectly .
" We won this game as a team , " forward Kyle Singler said .
" It was n't just put on my shoulders , or Jon 's or Nolan's .
We won this game from all sides contributing . "
Singler scored 21 points for the Blue Devils and Nolan Smith added 19 points and six assists , a pair of performances that , added to Scheyer 's , showed exactly how good Duke can be when all of the " Big 3 " are playing well on the same night .
Zoubek , all 7 - foot - 1 of him , clogged up the middle , along with 6 - 10 brothers Mason and Miles Plumlee .
Zoubek finished with 10 rebounds , five on the offensive glass .
The Blue Devils won a lot of games this season on defense and rebounding , not that un -Duke - like 44 percent shooting , good for eighth in the 12 - team Atlantic Coast Conference .
On Saturday , Duke showed what it can be like when the shots are dropping .
Shredding West Virginia 's ballyhooed 1 - 3 - 1 zone trap , the Blue Devils made 52.7 percent .
Singler , coming off an 0 - for - 10 performance in the regional victory over Baylor , went 8 for 16 .
Scheyer , who was 1 for 11 in a win over Cal the first weekend , went 7 for 13 .
" We felt comfortable no matter what they did , " Scheyer said .
Not surprisingly , West Virginia had few answers .
Joe Mazzulla , who scored a career - high 17 points to lift the Mountaineers to their upset over Kentucky in the East Regional , finished with only four in this one and had to wear a new uniform after Zoubek drew blood while conking him on the head early in the game .
Mazzulla was starting in place of injured point guard Darryl " Truck " Bryant , who broke his right foot earlier in the tournament and had held out slim hope of playing in Indy .
Hard to imagine his presence would have changed much .
The final 10 minutes were played in front of a quickly thinning crowd at Lucas Oil Stadium , the majority of whom had come to see Butler 's 52 - 50 win over Michigan State earlier in the night .
Those who stayed might not have liked what 's coming next in Monday night 's final .
And those who think Duke has been humbled by its championship drought will certainly look at the replays of Miles Plumlee hanging on the rim way too long after a dunk that drew a technical foul , but also put his team up by 14 .
A bit of showmanship for a program that routinely has been dissed across America as being too arrogant , too this , too that .
The theme came up again , predictably , this week , on several fronts -- including the retraction of an illustration of Krzyzewski on the front of the Indianapolis Star sports section with horns and a target scribbled onto his head .
Coach K's response to all that :
If you want to hate us because we have kids who go to school , graduate , play solid , team ball and win a lot , go ahead .
They do all that , but they 're winning in a different way this year .
They 're without a single superstar , but with an emotional center in Smith , who finds himself back in the city where his father , Derek , led Louisville to a championship back in 1980 .
Derek Smith died of a heart attack at age 34 , when Nolan was 8 , and the guard is just coming around to talking about it .
" It crossed my mind a little bit , " Smith said .
" But I 'm playing for myself and my Duke team and I 'll let my mom do all the thinking about my father 's footsteps . "
His mother might argue that , given Smith 's history , a title in Indianapolis would only be fitting .
There 's another team , the hometown Butler Bulldogs , who will argue the very same thing .
May the best team win .
Today , President Obama announced the launch of Opening Doors , which will , ideally , help prevent homelessness by using a San Francisco - based model .
Not so simply put , Opening Doors is " a more targeted approach by the federal government in leveraging local and regional strategies to end homelessness and building upon momentum that has been generated in cities such as San Francisco through its Project Homeless Connect program . "
In a written statement released by the mayor 's office , Newsom responded :
The recent passage of the health care reform bill was a huge accomplishment for Congress .
But there are other critical issues still to be addressed , such as reforming the regulations governing our financial system .
Congress is now in the process of debating this issue with legislative action expected in the near future .
As the debate proceeds , policymakers should note that the public is strongly supportive of moving forward in this area , and they are likely to view those who try to delay or derail action quite unfavorably .
Consider these results from an early March survey conducted by Pew ’s Financial Reform Project .
The poll asked how important it is to take action now to reform big Wall Street banks .
The public was overwhelmingly convinced ( 79 percent ) that it was very ( 47 percent ) or somewhat ( 32 percent ) important to take action , compared to just 18 percent who thought it was not too ( 9 percent ) or not at all ( 10 percent ) important .
The same poll gave the public a short description of the financial reform plan being discussed in Congress .
They favored by the plan by a lopsided 69 - 25 margin .
The public also said that if their member of Congress voted for the financial reform plan , they ’d be far more likely ( 50 percent ) to be more favorable toward their representative than less favorable ( 18 percent ) .
These data should encourage those in Congress seeking to move forward swiftly on sending a financial reform bill to the president ’s desk .

At the beginning of the campaign a vote for Clegg was disparaged as a vote for Labour ; then it was condemned as a vote for the Tories ; now it 's returned to being a vote for Labour again .
One way or another the Lib - Dems are going to be condemned for infidelity after the election , which is why it is essential they remain true to their beliefs during and after the campaign .
What is worrying is the chill that has descended on civil liberties , as though freedom was some minority issue for eccentrics , rather than the oxygen of democracy .
The failure of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to raise the attack on liberties by the Labour party and so signal its vital importance to the electorate is one of the more depressing aspects of the last few weeks .
Thinking about my single non-transferable vote has become much harder as a result .
Labour is obviously beyond the pale .
The party has created a country where half a million people come under some kind of official surveillance every year ; where emergency terror laws have become part of the normal policing arsenal ; and where jury trial is under attack , total surveillance of communications and movement is proposed and secret courts meet to decide house arrest , without subjects ever being told what the evidence against them is .
This is not some Orwellian fantasy but the astonishing truth about Britain today , which , by the way , has foreigners open - mouthed with disbelief .
What is the most disturbing aspect is this sense that civil liberties are , if not exactly taboo , a kind of special interest that broadcasters and some of the grander commentators ignore as if to delineate the political establishment 's agenda by proxy .
The fear in the event of a hung parliament must be that when the grownups close the doors and do a deal away from the children , all that has happened under Labour in the last 13 years will be forgotten and we will be left with the ID card , 28 days of detention without charge , the database state and all the rest of it .
The Liberal Democrat manifesto is pretty good on liberties , but what I do n't hear is Nick Clegg or Vince Cable speaking about them with the passion that is inspired by an urgent and historic mission .
With the whole campaign resting on these two men's shoulders , but mostly Clegg 's , it is perhaps understandable that stuff gets left out and they lose sight of one or two important themes .
But that does n't stop me waking in the morning with the fear that Labour might just survive , with the Lib Dems under one of the Milibands or the authoritarian home secretary , Alan Johnson , and be permitted to continue its campaign against liberty simply because the Lib Dems are focusing exclusively on the matter of proportional representation .
Reform of the electoral system is obviously urgent – one Ciffer pointed out in response to Edward McMillan - Scott 's article yesterday that if you use the excellent BBC seat calculator and give each of the main parties and a group of minor parties 25 % of the vote , Labour ends up with three times as many seats as the Lib Dems and a third more than the Tories ( the figures are : Labour 315 , Tory 206 Lib Dems 100 , others 29 ) .
But we should not be lulled by the vague sense that proportional representation will guarantee liberty any better than the first - past - the - post system has .
It wo n't .
What will restore liberty is political leadership and publicly articulated conditions in front of the electorate before negotiations take place .
Otherwise voters who know this issue is paramount may seek refuge in a party that may well gain the largest number of seats and is at least committed to certain key reforms on the database state , albeit out of economic expediency rather than heartfelt principle .
The possibility of change is enthralling , but only if politicians are better able to guarantee liberty , control the state and roll back what Labour has done .
Clegg needs to express this clearly during the next week .

It ’s hard to believe but all these beautiful pictures are not photos but pencil drawings .
The author of such unbelievable art is 38 - year - old graphic artist from Hong Kong Paul Lung .
0.5 mm technical pencil and A2 paper are the only attributes of these masterpieces .
He does n’t use eraser and spends up to 60 hours sketching out his pictures .
As he often admits people do not believe him and he has to make videos of his work to prove that these art works are not photographs .
Check these beautiful artworks by yourself .
UPDATE : Due to the increasing number of comments from our readers who doubt in real belonging of these images to the works of Paul Lung – we ’ve contacted with author of these art works .
Rather Paul Loong himself contacted us and explained that not all of art works were placed in its portfolio on devianart were really his work .

Nobody won .
That is the basic definition of a hung parliament .
The newly elected members might not see it that way .
The leaders of the three main parties might couch the results of last week 's election in historical and statistical terms that make them feel better .
But the fact remains : nobody won .
The Conservatives have the most plausible claim to some kind of victory .
They took the highest national share of the vote and gained 97 seats .
But Mr Cameron was battling to restore majority Conservative rule .
He campaigned vigorously against a hung parliament , all but demanding unchecked power .
He was rebuffed : 10.7 million people voted for Tory government ; more than 15 million people did not .
But the non-Tory vote was divided , largely between Labour and Liberal Democrats .
Despite many local skirmishes , there is a strain of cousinly feeling in both parties that sees the Tories as a common enemy .
From that impulse now springs the idea that Labour and the Lib Dems could join forces to prevent Mr Cameron from taking power .
The parliamentary arithmetic just about makes it possible .
But the ambition relies on the belief that voters who endorsed the Liberal Democrats would prefer Labour to continue in government if the alternative is a switch to the Tories .
That might be true for some , the majority even .
But there is no way of discerning what psychological motive impels people to vote .
Meanwhile , millions of people deserted Labour .
The party lost 91 MPs .
Despite a disappointing haul of seats , Nick Clegg won more votes than any leader in his party 's recent history .
This ballot was not an endorsement of the status quo .
Who , then , should govern ?
The circumstances are unique , not in terms of the electoral outcome – Parliament has been hung before – but in terms of the cultural background .
Britain has just held the most presidential campaign in its history and emerged with the result that most demands recognition of Parliament 's primacy in our constitution .
The televised leaders ' debates put almost exclusive emphasis on the question of who should be prime minister .
If the election is construed as a referendum on that point , David Cameron won .
The Tories also have the strongest parliamentary mandate of any single party .
For that reason , Nick Clegg did the honourable thing by quickly restating his belief that Mr Cameron should have the first opportunity to try to form a government .
But the fact remains that victory , under the electoral system we have , means securing a Commons majority .
Constitutionally , no other metric matters .
If the Conservatives believe that share of vote and lead over the nearest rival should have some moral weight in deciding a winner , they have already conceded a vital point about the need for electoral reform : the proportion of overall support in the country as a whole matters .
At the start of the campaign , this newspaper argued it should be the last fought under the first past the post system .
The result clearly vindicates that view .
Labour won 8.6 m votes and 258 seats ; the Lib Dems got 6.8 m votes and 57 seats .
It takes nearly four times as many people to deliver a seat for the Lib Dems as it does for Labour or the Tories .
A profound injustice is committed when the system that is supposed to amplify the voice of the electorate distorts it instead .
Mr Clegg is right to insist on a substantial commitment to reform as a condition of participation in government with either of the two bigger parties .
Mr Brown has shrewdly acknowledged that imperative and offered a referendum on proportional representation – a system that would fairly allocate seats in Parliament according to votes cast .
There has long been support for PR in the Labour ranks , but it would be naive to assume that Mr Brown 's readiness to embrace the idea is driven by anything other than a cynical attempt to woo Mr Clegg away from Mr Cameron and thereby stay on as prime minister .
None the less , the commitment cannot be unmade .
This is a significant milestone on the road to fairer politics .
The Tories by contrast are confused about electoral reform .
It cannot have escaped their notice that they have suffered as a result of the system they are determined to keep .
It is Labour whose results are most inflated by systemic bias .
The Tories insist that first past the post delivers clear results , when it has just failed to do exactly that .
Conservatives have always grumbled that coalition politics means shadowy deals between parties cobbled together in dingy corridors .
The opposite is now proven .
Mr Clegg has made explicit his priorities and Mr Cameron has voiced with decent candour the areas where he imagines collaboration is possible .
The process is already more transparent than the one that usually turns back - of - envelope doodles into policy .
The Tories might generally disapprove of coalitions , but they have also said they will seek to govern in the national interest and the nation has instructed that power be shared .
What Mr Cameron means when he talks about the national interest is that Britain 's economic situation is too critical to allow for any delay in forming a government .
In particular , the Conservatives are fixated on deficit reduction as a moral imperative to avert catastrophe .
The spectacle of Greece , now erupting in civil unrest as its parliament inflicts brutal austerity measures , is cited in evidence .
That is a perverse reading of the situation .
The Greek riots were triggered by over - aggressive budget cuts inflicted by a government with insufficient moral authority .
If anything , the lesson is that painful measures can only be implemented by a government that is trusted by the communities that will be affected .
That is a problem for the Tories .
They have only one seat in Scotland .
They failed to break through in the north of England and made fewer inroads in Wales than they hoped .
London was also sceptical of Mr Cameron .
Even if they could survive in the Commons as a minority administration , the Tories have not advanced enough from their bases in the southern shires to claim a national mandate for their divisive economic agenda .
They need a coalition for moral authority , not just parliamentary votes .
The power to confer that authority rests with Nick Clegg .
He should withhold it .
The Tories have no greater claim to economic competence than any other party , nor any greater credibility on the deficit .
They have simply shouted louder about it .
Their manifesto was full of unfunded pledges ; their priorities , as indicated by capricious tax breaks for the rich , suggest a flimsy grasp of what counts as fairness in austerity .
Meanwhile , there are vast gaps between Lib Dems and Tories on nearly every other aspect of policy .
The Lib Dems seek sensible co-operation with the rest of Europe , for example , while the Tories prefer obstruction .
Mr Cameron 's party is allied in the European parliament with fringe nationalists , described by Mr Clegg crudely , but not inaccurately , as " nutters " .
The Observer today publishes an extraordinarily obdurate memo prepared for William Hague 's first encounter with his European counterparts that indicates how their policies would guarantee confrontation .
That is not in the national interest .
But surely the greatest obstacle is electoral reform ?
Many
Tories feel existential hostility to the kind of radically realigned politics that might emerge in a new , more representative democracy .
Mr Cameron 's entire political career and his bearing during the campaign express an underlying confidence that , by virtue of historical entitlement , the Tories get regular turns at the levers of power .
Electoral reform might end that guarantee .
By contrast , electoral reform is Labour policy .
So is a more judicious and fair deficit reduction strategy much more in tune with Lib Dem ideas .
There is much ideological overlap between the two parties and no constitutional obstacle to a coalition between them .
The Conservatives would howl that they have been deprived their victor 's spoils .
But they won only the right to try to form a government , which Nick Clegg has given them .
If Mr Clegg then finds it easier to deal with Labour he is free to do so .
A Lib -Lab coalition could claim to have marshalled an overall majority of votes casts .
That , together with their combined parliamentary weight , would grant a genuine mandate to govern .
The problem is Mr Brown .
Whatever convention says about his right to continue as prime minister , the campaign has flayed his authority .
The Lib Dems could not plausibly enter a coalition with Labour if the administration that emerged were seen as a rickety continuation of the one that has just been punished by voters .
Any ensuing referendum on electoral reform might be construed as a plea to rubber - stamp Gordon Brown 's prolonged hold on power – and be rejected .
If a Lib - Lab pact is to have any chance of survival , Mr Brown must signal unequivocally that he seeks to continue only for as long as it takes to get a new constitutional order in place .
He must give clear advance notice of his resignation , stating that he will continue as prime minister in a caretaker capacity only .
He must accept a timetable , no longer than two years , for a referendum on electoral reform and a new general election , in which Labour will be led by someone else .
Combined , the Liberal Democrats and Labour have the affinity on policy , the electoral mandate and the unique historic opportunity to usher in a new era of fairer , better governance for Britain .
Mr Brown must offer Mr Clegg partnership in an administration of real national renewal and make the vital concession needed to secure it – a guarantee of his own departure .
Mr Clegg should accept those terms .
That is how the national interest is best served after the election that nobody won .

£ 420,000 eyesore is off the road : Premier League footballer with fleet of sports cars banned from driving
Sports car - loving footballer El - Hadji Diouf will have to do without his beloved vehicles for six - months after being banned from driving .
The Blackburn Rovers player , who is as famous for his ball skills as he is for an outrageous fleet of over - the - top cars , was convicted of a string of driving offences including speeding , having no valid license and failing to produce his documents today .
The multi-millionaire Premier League star , 29 , was also fined a total of £ 920 at Tameside Magistrates .
The incidents occurring in July , September and November 2009 .
Souped - up : El - Hadji Diouf 's gold Cadillac Escalade is perhaps the most outrageous of his fleet
Big bucks : A Mercedes SLR worth £ 420,000 has given the special chrome - plated treatment
Pedestrian : Diouf must get used to walking places now
Among his famous fleet is a souped - up super shiny Cadillac Escalade that would have cost in the region of £ 53,000 to buy , before the raft of customised fittings tipped the value closer to six - figures .
Complete with a 6.2 litre engine , six - speed gear system , and four - wheel drive , the Escalade gold paint job is without doubt the standout feature .
The Senegalese international also boasts a show - stopping chrome Mercedes - Benz SLR McLaren - a pinch at £ 420,000 - a white BMW X6 and a £ 100,000 Porsche Cayenne .
Today Diouf was fined £ 60 and ordered to pay £ 35 costs for speeding , doing 38 mph in a 30 zone on Chorley New Road on 25th July 2009 .
In relation to an incident on 14 Sept 2009 Diouf was charged with having no license , failing to provide his license and for failing to produce his insurance certificate for which he was given no separate penalty but ordered to pay £ 35 costs .
A charge of no insurance was withdrawn .
He was also fined £ 750 and ordered to pay £ 35 costs for failing to give information relating to the identity of a driver on the 4th November 2009 , plus pay a victim surcharge of £ 15 .
Since arriving in the UK eight years ago Diouf has played for Liverpool , Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland .
He has also represented his country on 43 occasions , scoring 16 goals .
All white on the night :
The Blackburn star has ofter been caught parking in places that he should n't
Mambo Italiano : Diouf also boasts a classic red Ferrari
For me , the most exciting moment in the last few days was the news that thousands of young people have rushed to register to vote before it was too late .
Thousands of young people who otherwise would have been disenfranchised have asserted their right to be heard , asserted their right to shape their futures .
The frustration and boredom at the stale old choices have given way to an enthusiasm and excitement that this time things could be different .
An election campaign that was poised to become a sterile trench battle between Labour and Conservative campaign managers has instead turned into something more inspiring : an election driven by people , not politicians .
As it dawns on them that the British people wo n't simply do what they 're told , the Conservatives have made the huge error of choosing fear over hope .
Ludicrous threats are being made by David Cameron and his team about market and political turmoil if people do n't vote Conservative .
It wo n't work because people do n't want to be told to fall into line by Cameron .
People have sensed that there is a greater choice , greater freedom , this time – they wo n't be bullied back into the politics of the past .
But if this turn of events appears sudden , the reasons stretch back years .
The cracks in the duopoly of British politics have been growing over a long period of time .
Back in the 1950s , rigid two - choice politics was complete .
In the 1951 general election only 2 % of voters opted for anyone other than Labour and Conservative .
It was a world of two halves : communism v capitalism ; north v south ; left v right ; working class v the wealthy ; trade unions v employers ; Labour v Conservative .
Social and class identities were relatively stable , and class - based political affiliations were part of the glue that cemented those identities .
We now inhabit a more fluid , unpredictable world .
The cold war has evaporated .
Old industries have disappeared .
Information technology has transformed our everyday lives .
Class identity has weakened .
Diffidence and hierarchy have collapsed .
And consumers now have a dizzying array of choices , from the mobile phones we use to the television we watch .
The only part of public life that has remained stuck in the past is our politics .
As Britain has hurtled into the 21st century , the political establishment remains beached in the last .
The expenses scandal was more than a series of revelations about personal greed – it was an exposure of a political class stuck in a culture of deference , a political class caught living in a parallel universe spectacularly out of touch with the modern Britain it was supposed to represent .
No wonder , then , that an increasing number of people turned their backs on their politicians .
Millions decided simply to opt out altogether .
At the last two elections , more people did n't vote at all than opted for the winning party .
Mass abstention was a logical response to a political system in crisis .
The legitimacy of governments steadily weakened as Labour and Conservatives competed for a diminishing number of swing votes in swing seats , ignoring everyone else .
At the last general election fewer than one in four eligible voters actually voted for the Labour government .
Up and down the country the old patterns simply broke down .
Perhaps the most dramatic expression of this has been the transformation of urban Britain from Labour to the Liberal Democrats .
City after city , previously synonymous with the old Labour party , turned instead to the Liberal Democrats : Liverpool , Newcastle , Hull , Sheffield , Bristol , Edinburgh , the list goes on .
Yet at each step the Labour and Conservative parties continued as if nothing had changed .
Both refused to examine an electoral system designed to perpetuate duopoly just as millions of people were demanding pluralism .
At the local elections last year , almost 40 % of people voted for parties other than Labour and the Conservatives .
At the last general election , 6 million people voted for the Liberal Democrats , more than any liberal party in Europe at the time .
Yet still the Labour and Conservative parties insisted that nothing needed to change .
And in the most spectacular rejection of public opinion of recent times , both parties grimly decided to proceed with an unjustified war in Iraq even as the country was in a state of near revolt .
Something had to give .
A political system so out of step with the country it is supposed to serve cannot last for long , and it now feels like its time is truly up .
Whatever happens in the remainder of this campaign , the clock can't be turned back .
Whoever wins the next election no longer has a choice : we must reform our clapped out political system urgently , or it will simply wither on the vine .
There is a big choice for progressives of all parties : do we seek to maintain and conserve an old order on its last legs ?
Or do we seek to shape the future by delivering real change , real reform for good ?
I believe there is now a unique opportunity for progressives to rally round a new agenda for change : political reform ; fair taxes ; social mobility ; sustainable economic growth .
This is not a pick - and - choose menu of reform .
It is a template for change .
Progress in one area does not make sense without progress in another .
Delivering fairer and lower taxes to millions of families who are struggling to make ends meet only makes sense if we deliver the best education , with smaller class sizes and more one - to - one tuition , to children who need the most help .
Devolving our hopelessly overcentralised political system only makes sense if we decentralise our economy , too , so that it is never again taken hostage by a small clique of irresponsible financiers in the City at the cost of the rest of the country .
Labour and the Conservatives have pledged to put Liberal Democrat policy under the microscope – I welcome that scrutiny .
And I look forward to another chance tomorrow night to make the case for real change .
For we face a once - in - a - generation opportunity for lasting fairness and fundamental reform .
Ask yourself : who do you trust to make that really happen ?
Labour seems to have given up trying .
The Conservatives offer merely the illusion of change .
We have to do something different this time , and the only party that is different is the Liberal Democrats .
If you share my ambition , join us .

Berufsverbot für Heavy - Metal - Musiker ?
Peter Nowak
Baden - Württemberg : Behörden verlangen von einem Lehramtsanwärter , dass er sich nachweislich von seiner Musikrichtung distanziert
Die Metal - Band Debauchery macht zurzeit auf ungewöhnliche Weise Schlagzeilen .
Der Sänger und Gitarrist der Band , Thomas Gurrath , darf wegen seiner musikalischen Nebentätigkeit in Baden - Württemberg nicht als Ethiklehrer unterrichten .
Der Student für Politik , Ethik und Geschichte auf Lehramt hat am 1 .
Januar 2010 im Stuttgarter Hegelgymnasium sein Referendariat begonnen .
Doch als Gurraths Seminarleiter , bei dem er auch seine musikalischen Auftritte anmeldet , im Zuge einer Internetrecherche auf das Plattencover der Band stößt , ist es mit dem Schulfrieden vorbei .
Die Schulrektorin wird verständigt , die Gurrath zum Gespräch vorlädt .
Gurrath berichtet , er sei von der Rektorin im Laufe des Gesprächs als psychisch krank bezeichnet worden .
" Sie kündigte eine Attestpflicht für mich an und sagte , sie werde die Lehrerschaft über mich informieren , damit sie wissen , mit wem sie es zu tun hätten .
Zusätzlich wurden alle Fachleiter informiert " , beschreibt der Referendar das Gespräch .
Gurrath wird schließlich vor die Alternative gestellt , entweder sein Engagement als Musiker aufzugeben oder als Lehrer zu kündigen .
Er entscheidet sich für Letzteres .
Doch damit gibt sich das Stuttgarter Regierungspräsidium nicht zufrieden .
Es will Gurrath erst dann wieder als Lehrer einstellen , wenn er " (... ) den Nachweis erbringt , dass er sich von seiner bisherigen Musikrichtung (... ) über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren distanziert hat (... ) " .
Der Hamburger Rechtsanwaltes Niels Bialeck sieht speziell für diese Distanzierungsaufforderung keine juristische Grundlage .
" Allein von einer Nebentätigkeit als Musiker auf die persönliche Nichteignung zu schließen , überspannt in meinen Augen eklatant den Spielraum , den ein staatlicher Dienstherr bei der Beurteilung seiner Anwärter hat " , so der Jurist .
Mit dieser Auflage , die ein faktisches Berufsverbot zumindest für staatliche Schulen darstellt , werden sich demnächst die Gerichte befassen .
Denn Gurrath will dagegen klagen .
Im Internet wird schon gegen das " Berufsverbot " für Gurrath mobilisiert .
Ein längerer Beitrag im Feuilleton der
Welt hat aus der Provinzposse endgültig einen Fall gemacht , der bundesweit auf Aufmerksamkeit stößt .
Led by Brazil , Latin America is expected to reach 46 GW of total installed wind capacity by 2025 with an annual growth rate of 12.6 % according to a new market study , Latin America Wind Power Markets and Strategies : 2010 - 2025 , from IHS Emerging Energy Research .
Brazil will lead the region with 31.6 GW installed by 2025 , trailed by Mexico with 6.6 GW .
Chile will also add significant wind power , boosted by the country ’s Renewable Portfolio Standard , according to the study .
“ Brazil ’s market scale and proactive renewable energy policies are moving Latin America toward a key tipping point , from sporadic project activations to more steady wind power market growth , ” said IHS analyst Vincent Gautier , one of the study ’s authors .
“ Improving government incentives from tenders to financing conditions are encouraging local developers such as Dobreve Energia , Renova Energia , and CPFL to lead the market . ”
Brazil ’s market size , expected to represent 69 % of the total installed capacity in 2025 in Latin America , positions the country as a leader in the region and a relevant supply hub .
Demand and local content requirements are encouraging operation equipment manufacturers to invest primarily in Brazil - based manufacturing of turbines 1.5 MW and larger .
According to the study , beyond turbine assembly , an even larger opportunity is opening up to develop Brazil ’s wind turbine component supply chain , with annual demand for more than 300 turbine units expected by 2011 .
Total investment in Latin America wind turbine markets will scale from just under U.S. $ 1 billion in 2009 to more than U.S. $ 2.2 billion by 2015 .
Mexico has the potential to challenge Brazil ’s market leadership , but reduced political support suggests the overall market will stagnate until 2020 , according to the study .
“ Mexico ’s tenders , requiring established development and operational track records from developers , as well as significant financial requirements , makes the market attractive to larger players , ” says Gautier .
Chile will peak at 280 MW installed in 2024 , before dropping 55 % due to the achievement of its 10 % renewable portfolio standard target .
European wind players are poised to dominate wind power development and ownership in Latin America in the near term , leveraging their experience and financial resources .
Iberdrola Renovables was the first player to develop a significant presence regionally , with operational projects in Brazil and Mexico .
Other international developers such as Acciona Energia are now following suit .
IMPSA
Wind is currently the only Latin America developer with regional ambition , but local industrial players and independent power producers are moving to challenge these foreign entrants by the latter half of the decade , according to the study .
Scientifically speaking , lightning is an abrupt electric discharge from cloud to cloud or from cloud to earth accompanied by the emission of light .
But for photographers it is a beautiful creation from Mother Nature .
Lightning occurs during a storm resulting from strong rising air currents ; heavy rain or hail along with thunder and sometimes during volcanic eruptions or dust storms .
Mother Nature pigments an galvanic blue sky with a steep contrast of lightning .
Lightning is a mystifying and breathtaking sight to observeiew .
For taking a perfect shot , you must focus on Shutter Speed , Second Aperture and Focal Length .
Today we have come up with some dazzling examples of lightning .

My first day at Valve working with the Team Fortress 2 team .
Pretty excited !
TF2 is my all - time favorite game , and I just know I 'm due for big things here .
Robin Walker showed me around the office and explained that Valve has a " flat management " style , meaning that nobody 's in charge of anybody .
" And I 'm the MOST not in charge of everybody , " he said , cocking a thumb at himself .
" I fired everybody at the company once .
I could fire you and not even break a sweat . "
I laughed at this , then looked around and saw everybody else not laughing .
I trailed off .
" He really did fire everybody , " Corey Peters said .
" Then he bought a horse , " Dario Casali added .
Robin laughed warmly at these memories as he fed sugar cubes to his horse .
" This is your desk , " he added .
He did n't point anywhere or look at anything besides the horse .
" The horse is my desk , " I said for clarification .
Robin looked at me like I was some kind of idiot , then pointed to a tiny desk under the horse .
All in a all , a big first day .
Pretty sure I 'll fit in fine around here .
Robin 's already given me a nickname : Big Face .
Was n't sure what that meant .
Robin explained that I had a big face , in his estimation .
Also , note to self : buy a hat .
I seem to be the only person not wearing one .
TUESDAY , APRIL 6th , 2010
Noticed that everyone 's wearing different hats than they were yesterday .
Robin asked where my hat was .
I said I did n't have one yet .
Got really quiet in the office all of a sudden .
I added that I 'd probably buy one this weekend .
Could be wrong , but I swear I heard someone whisper " terrorist . "
Big team meeting today .
I came prepared .
I 've been programming a playable demo version of TF2 with an entirely new tenth class .
I had to teach myself programming , modeling , level design , character design and about twenty other skills , but I think the results speak for themselves .
Everybody took a crack at playing it .
" This is pretty balanced gameplay , " admitted Robin .
" I like how we have n't found any hats yet , " said Brandon Reinhart .
" It sets up the suspense better .
I 'm all , ' When am I going to find a hat already ? ' "
Everyone laughed .
" I hope it 's soon , I can't wait much longer , " said Corey Peters .
" Look how stupid this tenth class 's bare head looks ! "
More big laughs .
" Actually , there are n't any hats in this demo , " I said , chuckling .
Deathly silence .
Then everybody got up at once and stopped playing .
Eric
Smith got really mad and threw his keyboard through a wall , then stormed out and went home .
Robin asked to speak to me privately .
" I do n't think you 're applying yourself enough , " he said .
" But I invented an entirely new class from scratch , " I said , feeling my face get hot .
" Yeah , that 's really , really ... " he trailed off , so bored with the sentence he did n't bother to finish it .
" Look , maybe you should read this .
You know -- help you get into the ' Team Fortress ' mindset . "
He slid over a well - worn game design manual .
I leafed through it .
It was n't a game design manual , it was a coffee table - sized book of women wearing hats .
Mistaking my confusion for interest , Robin excitedly pulled his chair over to me , and looked over my shoulder .
" Would you look at that hat , " he whispered , pointing to a lady in a wide - brimmed hat .
" Gorgeous . "
" Are you crying ? " I asked , because that 's sure what it looked like he was doing .
" What ?
No . I just had something in my eye . "
" Okay , " I said .
It was pretty easy to see what he had in his eye , though .
Tears .
Robin suddenly jumped up and took everybody hat shopping .
I tried working in the empty office for a while , then decided to just go home .
WEDNESDAY , APRIL 7th , 2010
All work suspended so the TF2 team could spend the morning modeling their hats .
Brandon Reinhart won Best in Show for his calfskin sombrero .
( I thought it looked ridiculous . )
After lunch it was back to work , and Robin outlined the next six months of objectives for the team .
I noticed the word " hat " coming up a lot .
Like in all the objectives , for instance .
And a couple of times , it looked like he got distracted and just wrote " hat " .
" Question in the back ? " said Robin , pointing to my outstretched arm .
" Yeah , " I said .
" What the hell is wrong with you people ? "
Twenty - odd faces turned to me .
" You could be designing anything you want !
You could be coming up with new levels and game modes and weapons and -- and -- and all you do is sit around making hats ! "
A hushed silence .
I started to think I might have gotten through to some of them .
Brandon Reinhart , especially , looked at me with a newfound sense of wonder .
" You know , guys , " said Brandon , " the new guy would make a great hat if we hollowed him out . "
Nods of agreement .
Then , as one , they leapt up and advanced on me .
I woke up in a janitorial closet .
I guess this is some hazing ritual on the new guy .
I want to believe that , anyway .
But now I 'm starting to wonder if Brandon 's sombrero was calfskin after all .
Mostly about games , but with occasional detours into other nerdy territories .
Five years ago , Houston attorney / theologian Daniel Shea watched the results of the papal conclave at home .
Intellectually , he knew what the dirty - gray smoke puffing out of the Sistine Chapel 's chimney signaled : that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger would soon be announced as the new Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church .
Now , as the white - haired Pope battles a seemingly endless series of priestly sex scandals , Shea says he is still trying to get his head around his belief that he and his co-counsel Tahira Khan Merritt set the coronation in motion when they filed a Houston - based sex abuse lawsuit against Ratzinger .
According to Shea , the cardinals elected Ratzinger Pope to give him the immunity that would enable him to avoid answering any questions concerning his knowledge about and handling of sex abuse cases in Houston 's St. Francis De Sales church in the mid-1990s .
In fact , Shea believes that what he started with the lawsuit may eventually result in the destruction of the entire Roman Catholic Church .
Dan Shea , a former Catholic deacon , has come a long way from the seminary .
Whether that 's a long way up or a long way down depends on where today 's Catholic Church stands in your eyes .
In the last five years , Shea has cracked wise about the Pope being gay and a drag queen in front of the Italian Parliament .
He got a bishop to declare in open court that it was the church 's position that minor children were accomplices in their own molestation .
He looked another bishop dead in the eye and told him to kiss his ass .
So it 's safe to say , he evokes strong emotions while expressing his beliefs .
In Doe et al v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Galveston - Houston et al , Shea and Khan Merritt allege that a letter then - Cardinal Ratzinger sent to every Catholic bishop on May 18 , 2001 , constituted an international conspiracy to obstruct justice .
This official Vatican document Ratzinger penned in his role as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith dealt with official church procedure in dealing with clerical sex abuse cases .
Not only did this letter contain the cardinal 's current thinking on the subject , it also cited in a footnote a top - secret 1962 Vatican document Shea would eventually flush out .
This 48 - year - old document , informally known as Crimen Sollicitationis , considered a smoking gun in some quarters , contains written orders from the Vatican laying bare a system for protecting child molesters .
To Shea , Crimen is more than a smoking gun , it is " a nuclear bomb . "
Many churchmen disagree as to the true meaning of Crimen .
Still , it 's easy to interpret that , taken together , Crimen and Ratzinger 's letter of May 18 make it plain that Ratzinger wanted these cases handled by the Vatican and only the Vatican .
According to Ratzinger 's letter , the roles " of judge , promoter of justice , notary and legal representative can validly be performed for these cases only by priests . "
Furthermore , the letter was co-signed by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who later went on the record as follows : " In my opinion , the demand that a bishop be obligated to contact the police in order to denounce a priest who has admitted the offense of pedophilia is unfounded . "
The letter ordered everyone involved in these cases to keep the evidence confidential for ten years after the victims reached adulthood .
The entire proceedings were to be held under " pontifical secret , " meaning those who broke the silence to outside authorities could be excommunicated .
" Every Cardinal in that conclave had been a recipient of the May 18 cover - up letter , " Shea says .
And because they were all recipients , he says , they were all complicit .
In response to Ratzinger 's sending that letter , Shea and the Texas Secretary of State had already served his Vatican office with papers .
The cardinal was scheduled to appear in federal Judge Lee Rosenthal 's Houston courtroom .
What 's more , the Pope would be giving his deposition to Shea , who is not just a tough plaintiff 's lawyer , but also a former Catholic deacon with three postgraduate theological degrees — one of them pontifical — from the University of Louvain , one of the oldest Catholic universities in Europe .
" I do n't think they were too pleased by that prospect , " Shea says .
But now that he had been made Pope , it would be a cold day in hell before Joseph Ratzinger would darken the Rusk Street doorway of Rosenthal 's court .
As a newly minted head of state , Pope Benedict XVI was now diplomatically immune to American lawsuits .
Again , Shea believes that was the whole point behind Ratzinger 's election .

Along with its Sharpstown surroundings , St. Francis De Sales was rapidly becoming Hispanicized in the 1990s .
That was when Colombian native Juan Carlos Patiño - Arango was brought in to minister to the growing Spanish - speaking portion of the flock , and he conducted most of the Spanish masses at the church .
His accusers later swore that he was presented to them as a priest , not a mere seminarian .
According to court documents in Shea 's lawsuit , Patiño - Arango would offer to help counsel the boys about sex and masturbation — topics some mothers do n't want to broach with their sons .
The suit alleges that these rectory " talks " escalated into Patiño - Arango masturbating some of the boys and performing fellatio on one of them while masturbating himself .
Some of the boys said he later threatened them after the fact by telling them that nobody would believe their stories over his , and also claimed that many of the other boys in the class had submitted to his " counseling , " so they should n't feel too bad or abnormal .
After one of the boys reported the abuse to his parents , who in turn complained to the diocese , Patiño - Arango was dismissed .
Though the family of the first victim was told the seminarian had returned to Colombia , it was later alleged that he had instead been dispatched to Florida .
( Eventually , Patiño - Arango did return to Colombia on a flight paid for in large part by the diocese . )
The suit alleges that at no time did the diocese or St. Francis publicly broach the topic of Patiño - Arango 's abrupt dismissal , nor did they reach out to any of the alleged victims .
The suit also contends that despite the claims to the contrary from the diocese , neither the Houston Police Department nor Child Protective Services were ever notified of Patiño - Arango 's alleged crimes .
CPS files are purged every three years , so that part of the diocese 's claim could not be proven ; HPD had no record of a report alleging abuse against Patiño - Arango from 1995 , though a warrant was issued years later , and he is currently a fugitive .
The suit went on to cite a 2004 research study conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the behest of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
The study estimated that between 1960 and 2004 , there had been 4,392 American pedophile priests with a total of 10,667 victims .
A report that accompanied the study stated that there had been a " significant surge " in abuse starting in the 1960s and continuing into the mid-1980s , the fallout of which was still then - continuing .
" The bishops acknowledged that ' in the past secrecy has created an atmosphere that has inhibited the healing process and , in some cases , enabled sexually abusive behavior to be repeated . ' "
The report went on to say that " time and again church leaders failed to report incidents of possible criminal activity to the civil authorities . "
It was and is Shea 's belief that this secrecy was an official Vatican policy , and that Ratzinger 's own writings as well as earlier official Vatican documents prove it .
Specifically , in the latter category , there is Crimen .
Much but not all of Crimen deals specifically with how to proceed in cases in which a priest solicits sex while conducting the sacrament of confession .
Which would seem to be enough luridness for any one document , but the last third of Crimen continues on to discuss something translatable from the Latin as " the worst crime " : priestly sex with minors or " brute animals . "
In those cases , the Vatican instructed that proceedings were to be conducted " in the most secretive way ... restrained by a perpetual silence ... and everyone [ including the victim ] ... is to observe the strictest secret , which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy Office ... under the penalty of excommunication . "
It also states that all investigations are to be conducted within the Church and that such jurisdiction ends ten years after the victim turns 18 years old .
Crimen did not mention anything about turning priests over to the law , nor did it mention any method of care for the victims of these cases .
Shea knew nothing of this document until 2001 , when it was footnoted in Ratzinger 's May 18 letter .
" They put everything on the Web site in five languages , except this letter [ of May 18 ] that was only in Latin , " Shea says .
" They think they are the only people who can still read Latin , but they forgot that there were people out there like me with pontifical degrees . "
Not only does Shea , a former Roman Catholic deacon , have that degree , but he is also the kind of guy who assiduously reads and investigates footnotes .
And appendices .
He says the devil in Vatican documents is so often hidden in the footnotes and appendices .
And it was in a footnote that he first saw mention of Crimen .
He had an idea what would be in it from its title , but it would be two years before a full copy would be sent to him anonymously in the summer of 2003 in a plain brown envelope with no return address .
Tones of sickened wonder still creep into Shea 's voice when he talks about Crimen .
" There is literally a liturgical ­ceremony that a bishop uses to forgive a priest who has been indicted , and sends him on a pious pilgrimage , " he says , lapsing into some of the language in the original document .
" As long as the priest in his confession of guilt makes an acknowledgment that no one can be saved unless he believes what the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church believes , teaches , professes and practices ... So they use it to promulgate that bullshit idea that there 's no salvation outside the Roman Catholic Church .
So as long as the priest is willing to do that , he gets a get - out - of - jail - free card . "
To Shea , it gives the lie to the notion that the waves upon waves of cover-ups have been the work of a few bad apples .
On the contrary , he says , Crimen proves that the rot came from inside the apple tree .
The scandal was no longer an indictment of a seemingly endless procession of grievously flawed men , but of an organization that was involved in an international conspiracy to obstruct justice .
Shea stands by that assessment today , and as you might expect , several plaintiff 's attorneys agree with him .
One such is Khan Merritt .
" Crimen shows that [ the " cover - up " ] has been going on a long time , that there 's a pattern and that the church has a procedure in place , " she says .
Boston 's Carmen Durso wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan claiming that Crimen " may provide the link in the thinking of all of those who hid the truth for so many years .
The constant admonitions that information regarding accusations against priests are to be deemed ' a secret of the Holy Office ' may explain , but most certainly do not justify , their actions . "
The faithful saw it differently .
A Canadian oblate — Father Francis Morrisey of Saint Paul University in Ottawa — told the National Catholic Reporter in 2003 that there was nothing in it that prevented a crime against a minor being reported to the police .
" Of course , a bishop could n't use this document to cover up denunciation of an act of sexual abuse , " Morrisey said .
" The document simply was n't made for that purpose . "
The Reverend Ladislas Orsy S.J. , a professor of canon law at Georgetown , had what some would term a typically nuanced , Jesuitical spin on the document .
" This document reflects a mentality and a policy .
I do not think [ Crimen ] initiated it . "
You would expect the faithful to spin the document one way and plaintiff 's attorneys another .
One of the closest approximations to an honest broker in the Crimen affair has been Father Thomas Doyle , a dissident priest , canon lawyer and dogged pursuer of pedophiles in the church .
Doyle , who has been an expert witness for dozens of victims , was something of a voice crying in the wilderness on the subject long before the scandal broke .
He has since often stated what he thinks the Church should do now : Defrock the priests , turn them over to the cops and stop trying to sweep the scandals under the rug .
Doyle 's interpretation of Crimen has been maddeningly inconsistent .
In 2006 , he was featured in a BBC documentary that is still online and uncorrected saying that Crimen was " an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy [ and ] to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by the churchmen . "
He also said that Crimen was " clear written evidence of the fact that all they are concerned about is containing and controlling the problem . "
In March of this year , he published a paper that seemed to indicate that he had changed his mind .
" [ Crimen ] and its predecessor from 1922 are not proof of an explicit world - wide conspiracy to cover up clergy sex crimes , " he wrote .
" It seems more accurate to assess both statements as indications of an official policy of secrecy rather than a conspiracy of cover - up . "
" An official policy of secrecy , once you 're keeping secret a criminal act , is called obstruction of justice , " Shea retorts .
" Tom does n't understand that .
He is not a civil lawyer .
He only understands the common term ' cover - up . '
Legally , it is known as obstruction of justice . ' "
Doyle imputes some of this policy of secrecy to more or less noble motives , such as the protection of the sacrament of confession and the prevention of false accusations , but also grants that much of the desire for secrecy came from a desire to avoid scandal and damage to the reputation of the clergy .
Crimen " did not create the obsession with secrecy , " he writes , but is a result of a centuries - old policy of silence .
Does n't matter , says Shea .
It 's still obstruction of justice .
He even says an FBI agent agreed with him seven years ago .
Shea recalls mailing an agent — who now works for another agency and did not want to be identified — Crimen and other documents .
At first , the agent told him that his case might not fly , as John Ashcroft 's Talibanesque Justice Department was not all that interested in pursuing cases against religious organizations .
Nevertheless ,
Shea says the agent called him back the next day and left him a message saying that after reviewing the documents , she believed they constituted " nothing less than an international conspiracy to obstruct justice . "
The agent told him she was " gonna run it up the flagpole . "
Shea says he called the agent back the very next day , only to find that she had been transferred .
" They yanked that flagpole right out from under her , " Shea says .
( For her part , the agent says that her transfer had nothing to do with Shea , and that she does n't recall if she told him he had a conspiracy on his hands . )
All this is important because of what happens when you let these people off the hook , Shea says .
Take Patiño - Arango , for example ...
Let 's just say that were it not for the fact that Colombia has no extradition treaty with the United States , perhaps he might not be so bold as to have a Facebook page under his own name .
But since the United States does not , he does .
And very many of the thirtysomething 's latest new Facebook friends look to be about the same age as the three John Does in the lawsuit .

Ask Dan Shea to answer a simple direct question and prepare to end up getting a discourse on everything from , just for example , Pope Leo XIII , the French Revolution and the Council of Trent .
( A gifted mimic , Shea delivers these screeds in accents ranging from Polish to French to Italian wiseguy to exaggerations of his own fading Family Guy - like Rhode Island bray . )
And save for the mimicry , when he takes up a sex abuse case , he marshals all that intellectual weight in order to put the entire last 1,700 years of Catholic tradition on trial .
In a suit active in Corpus Christi right now , he does that pretty much explicitly , with pleadings harking back to the Emperor Constantine in 313 AD .
There 's a method to it :
He believes it 's necessary to show that the church 's ancient traditional culture has bred an ongoing criminal conspiracy to obstruct justice .
Not that his knowledge of church workings is confined to ancient history .
" Dan 's a smart and relentless advocate for the victims he represents , " says David Clohessy , the national director of the Survivors ' Network of those Abused by Priests .
" He 's got an advantage over many attorneys because he clearly understands the arcane workings and obscure lingo of the church hierarchy .
He is n't ever intimidated by all the legal maneuvers that Catholic defense lawyers exploit to try and keep bishops out of the witness box . "
Tahira Khan Merritt , the Dallas lawyer with whom Shea had served as co-counsel on the Houston case , says that she appreciates both his knowledge of the workings of the Vatican and his historical perspective .
In a sworn affidavit in another of Shea 's famous cases — when he helped sue Harris County District Judge John Devine in order to get Devine to take down the Ten Commandments he had hanging on his court 's walls — former South Texas College of Law president and dean William Wilks said that Shea was " among the first rank of lawyers with interdisciplinary competence in the field of church - state relations . "
It 's an old obsession of Shea's , one he picked up from his father back in Providence .
Shea says that in the south Providence , Rhode Island of his Irish Catholic youth , he would n't have known a Protestant or a Republican if he fell over one .
His dad was a no- bullshit quality control engineer , and nothing irked him more than politicians who advertised their faith .
( Shea says that seeing the Ten Commandments on the walls of Judge Devine 's courtroom made him feel like his father 's son for the very first time . )
Not that his father was antichurch .
Shea was an altar boy at St. Michael 's and the lead singer in the children 's choir .
At 17 , he was at loggerheads with his dad — " Like most Irish families , by the time I was a teenager , he wanted to kill me and I wanted to kill him " — so he ran away to the Navy , where he drew submarine duty .
He quickly became one of the youngest nuclear - reactor operators in the Navy , and now says that sub duty was the formative experience of his life .
Pictures of two submarines are hung proudly on the walls of his River Oaks - area office .
" You ca n't engage in self - deception in a submarine , " he said .
" You can't look at a meter and tell yourself , ' This is n't happening . '
It 's about facts .
You 've gotta say , ' This is what 's happening , I have to go do this — now ! ' "
That training has guided him ever since , he says .
Along with his hardwiring from his dad in the Devine case , it guided him then .
And it was there when he ended his formal involvement with the Catholic Church in the mid-'70s .
After mustering out of the Navy in the early ' 60s , Shea was at something of a loose end .
He says that the Catholic Church was an exciting institution in those days , full of intellectual ferment in the run-up to Vatican II .
Two bishops of his acquaintance told him that the church needed men of his brainpower and drive to help guide the church into its new frontier , so off he went to seminary in Louvain .
Not long after his studies were completed , he says , the conservatives in the Vatican had undone much of what Vatican II had set in motion .
A priest told him flat - out that the church needed " parish priests , not smart guys " like Shea , who served as a deacon for about a year before quitting .
" The church I was trained to work in no longer existed , " he says .
Nevertheless , he still regularly attended Mass , but fell back on his Navy nuclear training to find work .
For much of the ' 70s , he had very good jobs working for companies that built nuclear plants , but that industry started to die with Three Mile Island and then croaked completely after Chernobyl , but not before the East Coast company Shea was working for was bought by Brown & Root , who transferred Shea to Texas .
In Houston , he was the organist at Midtown 's Holy Rosary Church for many years .
In 1990 , Shea got his law degree .
Roughly ten years later he won a big case .
He bought a yacht , decorated its prow with a shamrock and named it Seriatim , but he also wanted to give back to his faith .
St. Michael's , his old parish church back in Providence , had fallen on hard times .
The Irish had moved out , their place taken by waves of impoverished immigrants from Latin America and Africa , and Shea responded to a plea to restore the church 's organ .
He donated $ 125,000 , and Daniel Reilly , a former St. Michael 's parishioner who had gone on to become the Bishop of Worcester , Massachusetts , came to the dedication along with the bishop of Providence .
" We got a private concert , " Shea remembers .
" It was just beautiful . "
Less than a year later , Reilly would be calling Shea a traitor , and Shea would be suing Reilly on behalf of several victims of a particularly nasty case of priestly abuse , in which the priest in question was allegedly anally raping altar boys on the altar .
" They made the mistake of leaving me alone with him in the conference room , and I looked at him and said , ' Dan Reilly , what the fuck have you been doing ? "
Shea remembers .
" You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
If Henry Shelley " — a much - beloved long - dead priest and coach at St. Michael 's — " were in this room today , he would kick your ass . ' "
Shea says that Reilly looked at him as if nobody had ever spoken to him — a bishop ! — like that before .
Shea did n't care , and pressed on : ' Well , kiss my royal Irish ass , Dan Reilly , because you 're a piece of shit . ' "
_____________________
That wicked irreverence has come more to the fore as his traditional faith has lapsed .
A few years ago , an Italian political party asked him to address that country 's parliament in Rome .
His topic was the separation of church and state , but he soon moved on to other , lighter fare .
" After my formal presentation , I started talking about Ratzinger and I said , ' Who the hell is he trying to kid ?
This guy wears enough gold lamé in all of his vestments to suit up three New York drag queens .
And furthermore , he 's given drag queens a bad name .
I mean , look at his Palm Sunday vestments .
They 're supposed to be red , but his are so gold - encrusted you can barely see the red .
He 's got Gucci shoes and Prada glasses , and have you seen the boyfriend ?
He 's a hunk — a German tennis player and a jet fighter pilot , Gorgeous Georg .
I 've never seen a bishop who did n't have an extraordinarily handsome private secretary . "
Today , he says he wo n't set foot in a Catholic church and has left instructions that no priest is to get anywhere near his body after his death .
" You have to go that far .
You have to get so angry ... I had to get so goddamn angry ... Really , it 's only been in the last year that I have come to peace with the fact that I am never gonna darken the doorstep of another Catholic church again , " he says .
Churchgoing Catholics are part of the problem , he says .
" They 're shelling out the money , going , ' Oh fa - ther , fa - ther . ' "
Meanwhile , he is one of those rare people whose life is their work .
Several of his obsessions — the conservative counterrevolution in the post - Vatican II Catholic Church and the separation of church and state — are bound up in the Catholic Church 's sex scandals , and as an attorney , he has the power to fight to effect change .
( As an out and proud gay man , he also has issues with some of the church 's teachings on homosexuality . )
And perhaps his fondest wish is to see the current Pope put on a witness stand or even arrested .
It saddens him that this country — the proud home of the First Amendment — probably wo n't be the one to do it , nor will he be the lawyer to grill the man he loves to call plain old Joseph Ratzinger .
Shea says one of the first questions he wanted to ask Ratzinger was if he would be willing to clarify the words of one of his underlings , auxiliary Bishop George Rueger , with whom Shea once had the following courtroom exchange :
Daniel Shea : I 'm trying to get a sense of this idea that if a cleric becomes involved in sexual conduct with a minor , that somehow this is a sin committed obviously by the cleric , but with the minor , that the minor is sinning along with the priest .
I think you 've indicated that frankly you believe that that may or may not be true , but it 's possible that that could be correct ; is that right ?
Rueger : " He is sinning with a minor , the minor is his accomplice .
What the gravity of the minor 's culpability is is hard to say . "
" They truly believe these children are accomplices , " Shea says in wonder .
" That 's the sworn testimony of a bishop , and he says it without hesitation . "
And he came so close ...
Even after Ratzinger became Benedict XVI , Shea 's case was still grinding along in Judge Lee Rosenthal 's federal courtroom on Rusk Street .
After his election , Shea and co-counsel Khan Merritt knew that the jig was up , and not long after the conclave , a Vatican diplomat sent word to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking her to invoke Ratzinger 's immunity .
Rosenthal was evidently unimpressed by the stature of the man in her case .
In a remarkable order of hers signed on June 23 ( more than ten weeks after he became Pope Benedict XVI ) , Rosenthal referred to Ratzinger by the name his mother gave him and told his Holiness in no uncertain terms exactly what she expected of him .
" Defendant Joseph Ratzinger must file a memorandum in support of his motion seeking dismissal based on head - of - state immunity no later than 30 days after the United States Department of State 's suggestion of immunity is submitted to the court , " the order read in part .
Later , Rosenthal went on to decree that " Defendant Joseph Ratzinger " was to " file a report by July 29 , 2005 and every 30 days thereafter informing the court of the status " of his request for immunity .
" For the first time in Western history , you 've got a Pope who 's been under the jurisdiction of the United States , and a female Jewish federal judge telling Joseph Ratzinger , who also happens to be Pope , that he 's gotta do this and that before he 's let out of her lawsuit , " marvels Shea .
" That 's a watermark in United States history and in the history of the United States Constitution . "
( Rosenthal 's court did not return a phone call from the Houston Press asking her to clarify her thought processes in its crafting . )
In August of 2005 , Rice 's office sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General Peter Keisler informing Keisler that the Department of State recognized and allowed Benedict 's immunity .
The letter went on to stress the " particular importance attached by the United States to obtaining the prompt dismissal of the present proceedings ... in view of the significant foreign policy implications of such an action against the Head of a foreign state . "
And that was that .
Until very recently , when the sex scandals — in Germany , Wisconsin and California — flared anew .
While Shea 's case is n't being reopened , there are others in places like Germany .
He thinks that the Germans might just have the nerve American officials lack .
" They are more secular and less tolerant of this bullshit , " he says .
" I have forwarded the German Justice minister my documents , and the feedback I 've been getting makes me believe that they see them the way that [ FBI agent ] did . "
He rails against the Vatican 's diplomatic immunity .
Why stop with the Vatican , he wonders .
" If you recognize the papacy , why not go out to Salt Lake City and draw a map around the Mormon temple square , and we 'll call it Temple City , and we 'll make the Head Brouhaha of the Mormon Church a head of state , and the same thing with the Southern Baptists .
Maybe we could draw a circle around Baylor University .
" It 's patently contrary to the spirit of the Constitution . "
He still believes that his old lawsuit could bring down the Pope by other means .
He is still hoping that someone will come along and find that the conclave was tainted .
He wishes that the Vatican would operate with some semblance of what he would call justice .
" There 's a difference between what we would call actual impropriety and the appearance of impropriety , " he says .
" In a case involving judges , should anything appear that causes the appearance of impropriety , a judge is supposed to recuse himself .
And that recusal is not seen as an admission of any actual impropriety . "
Shea believes that Ratzinger 's invocation of Crimen and authorship of the May 18 , 2001 , letter constitutes more than enough evidence for the man in the street to wonder if maybe there was some chance of impropriety in the papal conclave .
" The appearance of a tainted conclave is there , " Shea says .
" That 's why the person who is the product of a tainted conclave could well decide to resign the papacy and say with a straight face , ' There was no impropriety .
There exists an appearance of impropriety , and out of my concern for the integrity of the papacy and the integrity of the College of Cardinals , I feel it appropriate to step aside . ' "
The Church requires the confidence of its faithful in its institutions , he says , and adds that both the integrity of the papacy and the moral integrity of the Church have been shattered .
Nevertheless , he thinks that the Pope will keep digging in .
Recent events — the Pope 's personal preacher comparing the plight of today 's church to that of Jews in the Holocaust , the reference to sex abuse scandals as " petty gossip " — seem to bear him out .
What 's more , he believes they are still hiding the devil in the details .
He believes that the so - called Essential Norms document of 2002 , which the Vatican has touted as a watershed in its dealing with sex abuse — i.e. , priests will be handed over to the police and not transferred any longer — is made voidable by the last few clauses in the last sentence of the seventh and last footnote , which read " the Church reaffirms her right to enact legislation binding on all her members concerning the ecclesiastical dimensions of the delict [ sin ] of sexual abuse of minors . "
" It 's always in the footnotes , " he says .
" The devil is always in the small print . "

Steve Yzerman 's name has stood out since last Wednesday night 's report that he was on the short - list for the Tampa Bay Lightning general manager vacancy .
I 've tried to play it down because team owner Jeff Vinik has made it a point ( and stressed it ) that a GM will not be hired by the club until a CEO is in place ( thus my obsession with the CEO rumors of late ) .
But it 's really impossible to play down a name like Steve Yzerman .
Not with his on - ice accomplishments in Hockeytown USA and for his country in international play .
But is he ready for Hockey Bay , USA ?
Is he willing ?
Chris Botta , renown for his work at NYI Point Blank and writing for NHL Fanhouse , reported today that Yzerman is candidate one for the Tampa Bay Lightning GM gig ...
Or at least an un-named source told him as much .
A source tells NHL FanHouse the job could be Yzerman 's if he is able to convince management of his commitment for the long haul .
Yzerman , the Detroit legend , currently holds a desk job with the Red Wings .
His departure from the city where he is beloved will not come easily .
With new owner Jeff Vinik dedicated to building a winner and spending , and Steven Stamkos on the verge of superstardom , the Tampa Bay job is an attractive opportunity .
We 're told that Vinik does not believe he has to go to the " old boys ' club " of NHL GMs .
Although Yzerman managed Team Canada to gold at the Olympics , this would be his first position as an NHL general manager .
The Lightning are said to have interviewed a handful of candidates also seeking their first shot behind the big desk .
We touched on the potential of someone outside " the old boy club " could be a candidate for a role with the Bolts ( either as CEO or GM ) .
Yzerman may not be a traditional GM entrenched in front office politics , but in different ways , he still is an Old Boy .
He 's got his connections in the hockey world and they could serve him in one fashion or another as GM .
But Damian Cristodero's story at Lightning Strikes from a few days ago , talking about Yzerman as a candidate , throws cold water on the idea Yzerman 's hiring is imminent .
That comes by way of former coach ( and Times Palace press box mainstay ) Scotty Bowman :
" I ’d be surprised if he leaves , " Bowman said Friday .
" He ’s like the son to the owner .
He ’s been there nearly 30 years , and I think he ’s in line to move up the chain . "
There are other points , not from the former coach , about why Yzerman may be hesitant to head south .
His family being the number one reason .
This would n't be the first time family has factored in on a move , of course .
Whatever the case , we likely wo n't have a clue what is going on with the Lightning and Yzerman until the Red Wings are eliminated from the playoffs .
The last thing Steve would want to be for his club is a distraction .
Over the years it has become excruciatingly evident that as Finns , we are expected to possess any and all information on every imaginable Finnish hard rock and metal band .
It is quite tiresome to answer people 's questions on bands who you 're supposed to be interested in and informed on just because they happen to be your fellow countrymen , so it makes more sense to write it down ONCE and tell these parties with inquiring minds to point their browsers in this direction .
The Internet is the appropriate storage space for this stuff - nobody in their minds would actually pay for this information .
This website is not trying to be an encyclopedia with detailed biographies and what not .
It is more like a starting point where music fans , record collectors and all the other interested parties can start familiarizing themselves with the childhood years of Finnish hard rock and heavy metal .
The pieces of writing that are enclosed with the discographies are just the kind of scribbles we might have written in a letter to someone asking information on the band in question so please do n't mistake them for something they are not .
This is not an attempt to boost the Finnish metal scene either .
We fully acknowledge that metal bands from countries like Poland , the Czech Republic or France for instance are vastly superior to their Finnish counterparts in both quantity and quality , volume and importance .
This is not to say that Finnish metal was n't absolutely stupendous at its best , however .
For a crash course , we 'd warmly recommend the following dirty dozen of tracks :
· Sarcofagus Black Contract
· Moottorilinnut Metallinen sateenkaari
· OZ Turn the Cross Upside Down
· Tarot Wings of Darkness
· Zero Nine Bangin ' on Drums
· Peer Günt Backseat
· O.S.S.Y Helsinki
· Stone Overtake
· Xysma On the Hill of Desecration
· Impaled Nazarene
In the Name of Satan
· Sentenced My Sky Is Darker Than Thine
· Unholy After God
The more comprehensive and error free this site is , the better it 'll be for everyone and therefore we encourage you to email either janne at isten dot net , or use this form if you spot mistakes or have any info we are still missing .
The discographies are most certainly deficient when it comes to pressings that have been released under license in Asia or America .
And a few bands are certainly completely missing for one reason or another .
Everyone who provides us with corrections or info we are missing will be mentioned on the thanks list below but that is really all we can offer you .
Therefore we wo n't mind if you choose to hold back your information - we are sure there are plenty of people who will be so full of admiration for anyone who can prove themselves to be wiser than the Internet like you genius you .
The good souls at Imperiumi . net have put together an extensive list of links to the websites of Finnish hard rock and metal bands .
Go check it out .
TIME : Included are all the Finnish bands that have released a record of their own or have appeared on a compilation album that has been released in 1999 or earlier .
Also all the re-releases that have come out in 1999 or earlier are included .
All the releases and re-releases that are released in 2000 or later are excluded !
This means that not all the discographies are complete from today 's point of view .
FORMAT : As records we consider vinyls of all size as well as professionally copied CD's .
Home burned CD - R's as well as cassette releases are excluded .
Of compilation albums we have included only the ones that contain previously unreleased material by the band .
STYLE : For us hard rock and heavy metal include everything from poser stuff a la Poison to grim black metal a la Blasphemy .
Over the decades various other music styles have crossed metal in a way or another and in these cases it is always difficult to draw the line .
We have decided to exclude all the bands that clearly fit better to another genre ( hardcore , gothic rock , progressive rock or whatever ) as well as bands we presume would not like to be associated with heavy metal although their music might be harder and rawer than that of some hard rock bands with make - up .
In addition we have ruthlessly excluded all the dark wave and chamber music ensembles that for one reason or another are making their career in the metal scene .
Feel free to tell us if you think we are missing some band that in your opinion should be included .
It 's downright possible we have accidentally forgotten the band from the list and not ruled them out on purpose .
And there are a few bands with only private releases out we have n't heard and therefore we have chosen not to include them on the list until we get verification on their music style .

Clash of the Titans
by flamewheel
No matter where you are in Greece , you can always look out and see a chain of mountains off in the distance , rising into the clouds .
No matter how far you travel toward those mountains , you will never get any closer .
As such , the mountains are protected from the prying eyes of mere mortals , and one can only wonder what transpires up at the peaks .
Every so often , lightning bolts originate from the mountains , striking at each other and searing the sky as if the gods were arguing with one another .
These mountains are the home of Mount Olympus , the resting place of the gods .
Normally , besides the occasional lightning bolt , Olympus is serene .
Recently though , more and more lightning storms have been emanating from the distant mountains — for some reason now , the gods seem to be constantly at odds with each other over something .
And when even the gods are distressed , bad times are inbound for mankind …
Ominous lightning strikes portend ill omens to come ...
These are dark days for Greece .
You can feel it , ca n’t you ?
Something , something is wrong in the air .
A palpable atmosphere of despair clouds the countryside , creating fear and dismay .
Seedy gambling rings and other places of illegal activity have sprung up everywhere as corruption seeps into our cities .
Even the natural disasters have become more prevalent and more dangerous , with terrifying earthquakes devastating the lands and monstrous tidal waves laying waste to the shores .
Even prayer , our familiar source of comfort , is becoming another source of despair .
As we look toward the nighttime skies to pray , we can see the stars disappearing , one by one — the constellations are fading .
Grecians sleep fitfully at night , worried that when they wake up in the morning their world would be gone .
Roving bands of mercenaries raid our towns and set fire to the fields .
Cities have trembled and fallen , as hundreds of years of foundations crumble beneath the mayhem and anarchy that has been sweeping through Greece .
One city in particular , Seoulinete , has been going through very hard times .
Once one of the most peaceful cities in Greece , over the past few years Seoulinete has been militarized , its once welcoming gates now shut to outsiders .
The local government could not be trusted — so many officials had given in to avarice , to their basic wanton needs .
There has been no law in this anarchic and chaotic Seoulinete but the rule of might : whoever has the strongest forces holds control of the city .
The townspeople initially cowered in fear and kept quiet , but finally now they have decided that they have had enough .
A message has been sent out all over the country , a summons calling for the strongest commanders of Greece to come to Seoulinete to bring order back to the lawless city .
Two such commanders have answered the call .
The first is Flashius , a young general from a small city in the South .
Over the past year , Flashius has used his highly trained and well - commanded armies to wrest control of several cities from ruthless and cruel rulers , bringing a semblance of order back to southern Greece .
Through his innate charisma and leadership Flashius is able to muster up large armies in very short amounts of time , and can thus refresh and resupply his army very quickly .
He can either overwhelm his opponents by mass , or he can use well - timed strikes to hit them while they are at their weakest .
Many Grecians considered this general a god , though saying so out loud is thought to be very controversial .
The other commander that has answered Seoulinete ’s call is a distant ruler , Jaedos , known more commonly as the Tyrant .
Like Flashius , he too has conquered and tamed large parts of Greece , and it is solely because Jaedos that the North had not yet fallen apart like Seoulinete .
Flashius is known for his impeccable control over his troops , and Jaedos ’ understanding of and command over his troops is on a level equal to or surpassing that of Flashius ’ .
While he is fully capable of summoning swarms of troops to overwhelm his opponent , Jaedos is known more for being able to defeat vastly superior armies with his positioning and micromanagement on the battlefield .
Jaedos ' keen understanding of the battlefield terrain makes even a small force a force to be reckoned with .
Because of Flashius and Jaedos , Greece has not yet fallen into absolute darkness .
They are a pair unparalleled in all of Greece , and both of them are now looking to rule Seoulinete .
However , neither of the two is willing to accept less than complete control , so to decide which one of them shall be the one to assume command , a battle is to take place at the Seoulinete Arena , the largest of its kind in all of Greece .
Tonight is the night before the fated showdown is scheduled to take place , and Greece is being pounded by the worst thunderstorm in two hundred years .
The rain falls relentlessly , and the floodwaters have washed away some of the smaller towns completely .
Lightning bolts race through the sky , scorching large patches of earth , and showers of hail devastate the forests .
Tonight is a night that the people of Seoulinete take shelter and stay inside their homes , praying for the best and hoping that tomorrow , finally , the long nightmare ends .
Those that are intrepid enough to peer outside of their windows on this dark and stormy night may have noticed the massive tornado touching down near the outskirts of the city , heading toward the Olympian mountains .
Those who are watching from behind their windows know that this tornado is an omen , but of what they only guess at as the swirling vortex draws closer to the mountains .
Could this be the harbinger of much , much more ?
As the wind howls and the hail pours , Flashius and Jaedos sit in their respective parts of the Arena , readying their troops and making last minute battle plan changes .
Both of them are alert and battle - ready , and come the following day only one of them can be declared the victor and the next ruler of Seoulinute .
The lightning flashes , the sky rumbles , and the awaited showdown is about to begin .
One way or the other , Greece will never be the same .
Fan Faceoff
by Atrioc and motbob
The 3 1/2 games of last year 's MSL Finals were some of the best TvZs of 2010 so far .
Is there any reason why this year 's finals wo n't deliver the same quality as last season ?
motbob :
The games are going to be even better this time around .
Triathlon is being played twice , and that alone should get fans excited for this final match .
Not only that , but the power wo n't go out , and Flash will have a heater in his booth .
Whether the games are long or short , we 'll see something great ; if either Flash or Jaedong end it early , it will be through brilliant timing attacks with impeccable unit control , since that 's the only way to win early against such solid a solid opponent .
If the game gets to late game , that automatically means it 's one of the best TvZs ever .
Atrioc :
That 's a pretty low bar : these games are n't going to be the same quality as last season - they are going to be even better .
There has only been one finals rematch in the history of Starcraft , and it was Boxer vs Yellow way back in the early days of OSL / MSL - and now , poetically , at the possible end of those two leagues ( if GOM / Blizzard has their way ) we have the modern day version of that epic rivalry with all the improvements in skill that comes from 10 years of evolution .
With both players getting absolutely everything accommodated and the chance of any power outage type shenanigans being close to 0 % , theres really nothing to expect but the best Starcraft we 've ever seen .
Psychologically , how well do you think Flash will handle the dual pressures of both being the challenger to the MSL throne and having just lost a TvZ finals ?
motbob :
The events of last week have been incredibly helpful to Flash because those events took away Jaedong 's challenger mentality .
Jaedong 's big BoX losses have almost all come from underdogs like fOrGG , free , and Calm .
Conversely , the best zerg ever is even more dominant than usual in the underdog role -- just ask Stork , Flash ( GOM Season 1 ) , or ... Flash again ( NATE MSL ) .
Flash gains the challenger mentality that Jaedong lost , which should help his mental state in the finals .
As for any loss of confidence that Flash suffered after the OSL finals , one week of bashing on Firefist and Hoejja will clear that right up !
Atrioc :
To players like Jaedong and Flash , losing is not a " pressure " its a catalyst for further success - nothing scares me more as a Jaedong fan than seeing Flash lose the OSL because its only going to make him evolve and fix his mistakes for when this finals rolls around .
Like motbob said , the " challenger / underdog " mentality is so much more powerful than the mentality of the " defending champion " attempting to hold on to his title .
Flash , psychologically , will be just fine - whether he takes this final , or loses to Jaedong , will come down entirely to skill at Starcraft .
Triathlon , a 4 - 1 TvZ map , is being played twice .
For the Flash fan : how can Flash exploit this map to his advantage ?
For the Jaedong fan : how can Jaedong survive it ?
motbob : Triathlon is a mech map , and Jaedong is notoriously bad at late game vs mech .
He stubbornly builds ultras to fight mines and tanks .
As long as Flash can get to the late game , he 'll have a decided advantage .
Atrioc : I 'm so much less worried about the maps this season than I was last time - Jaedong has proven that he 's fully capable of coming up with builds that can win a game on maps that seem impossible - his builds on Odd - Eye and Ultimatum last season were phenomenal - and unlike Flash he has n't had to show very much of his ZvT lately , so he has room to be unpredictable .
I 'm confident in Jaedong 's ability to find a solution for Triathlon , and consider him the favorite on both Match Point and Fighting Spirit .
Why is / is n't Flash 's loss to Eff Ort indicative of his future performance vs Jaedong ?
motbob : Jaedong does n't like to all - in in the early / mid game , and that 's what Flash is weakest against .
After games 4 of both this OSL and last MSL Finals , I think Flash is likely to stop his trend of going early rax at least once per series .
What I 'm trying to say is that the way Flash lost his OSL games wo n't happen again .
Flash will be able to easily get to the midgame , and if he 's learned to build turrets , he 'll be able to easily get to lategame .
Atrioc :
It 's just further reinforcement of a pretty obvious truth : Lee Young
Ho is a weak Bo5 player .
He wins plenty of them , sure , because hes so fucking good at Starcraft , but look through Flash 's history and you 'll find that in high pressure Bo5 's the kid does not elevate his game .
Hes out there playing with the exact same fire as a pro league match like some kind of machine .
Thats why this kid who can go on 90 % win streaks and break ELO records constantly still finds himself with only 2 gold medals after 2 years of proving hes fully capable of winning them .
The only time I 've ever seen Flash truly control a series psychologically and not just with the brute force of his mechanics was against Stork in Bacchus - and lets be honest , Stork is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Bo5 ability .
Against Effort , Flash showed razor sharp late game and timings ( even from a disadvantageous beginning in Game 2 ) and threw away a Golden mouse with amateurish attempts to throw Effort off - Jaedong will see tricks like that from a mile away and maintain complete control of the series ( even in games he loses - see Bisu / Jaedong GOM special match ) , as he has done in every other Bo5 they have played .
In short , who will win this series ?
Why ?
motbob : Flash will win .
He wo n't have the psychological disadvantages under which he suffered last MSL , and he wo n't have the playstyle disadvantage that he suffered in the OSL Finals .
I expect to see five standard games in this finals , unless Jaedong prepares like he did against Calm and changes up his playstyle to fit his opponent .
If we do get standard games , Flash absolutely has the advantage .
His macro and gamesense are the best in the business , and that 's enough to win him the series in five games .
Atrioc :
This series is Kasparov vs Deep Blue - a brilliant , passionate competitor vs a calculating machine .
Jaedong 's ability to improvise , adapt , and exploit on the fly , combined with his excellent series preparation and steel nerves under pressure , gives him the edge over any amount of practice on Flash 's part , and I expect him to ride those advantages to victory as he has done time and time again in the past .
With this win , Jaedong will match Nada for the player with the most titles - and , if you include events such as GOM or WCG , far exceed it .
Prepare to witness history .
Map Analysis
by Arrian and KwarK
Set 1 : Triathlon
Arrian 's take : Triathlon is our opener .
There have only been five TvZ's on the map , but Terran is decisively the victorious race here .
There has been only one victory by the Swarm in this matchup , which coincidentally is owned by Jaedong .
Triathlon has been favorable to a passive / expand style of play , especially with the protected expansion along with the traditional natural and the easy fourth gas .
This is a very mechable map , and Flash might favor that play in the opening set here ( or in the closer if it gets there ) not only because he scored his one win on this map against Action with mech , but also because Jaedong lost to Baby 's mech play here .
KwarK 's take : Triathlon is an interesting map and I think that 'll favour JD .
Last MSL finals we saw Flash practicing for two finals at the same time while JD was coming up with innovative builds designed to abuse Flash and the maps .
If there 's any map JD is going to do something cool on , it 's this map .
Plus if he just makes some speedlings he 'll probably win .
Yeah , I 'm bitter .
Seriously though , Flash has been playing under his best for about three weeks now and it's a testament to how good his fundamentals are that his current play is still worthy of a finalist .
Do n't count him out but I see JD taking this map .
Set 2 : Odd Eye 2
Arrian 's take : The series will continue with Odd Eye 2 .
You might remember Odd Eye as the scene of last MSL 's crime , the power outage .
Never forget that Jaedong likes to incorporate 4/5 pools into his series play , and the first 2 player map in the pool might be the most attractive site for any sort of early pool or zergling - heavy play .
On the flip side , a bunker rush is a constant threat when playing Flash , so there is the definite possibility of early aggression or cheese on this map .
By all accounts Odd Eye 2 and its predecessor are not disposed towards favoring either race to the extreme in this matchup , so if neither player opts for some early aggression or cheese this will likely play out like a standard TvZ , though the corner double gas expansions , like their game from the last finals , might prove too attractive for Jaedong to pass up .
KwarK 's take : This has always been a macro map that rewards Flash 's style .
The stats say it 's Z>T over a tiny sample but I 'm gonna go out on a limb with Flash here .
I think JD is playing overall better Starcraft but Flash 's weaknesses in the past few weeks have been strategic rather than macro based .
When it comes down to just making an awful lot of units I 'll still take Flash .
Set 3 : Match Point
Arrian 's take :
The next contest is set to take place on Match Point .
Flash and Jaedong have played twice on Match Point , splitting the games , though Jaedong won when it mattered .
Match Point is one of the more entertaining maps in terms of strategic diversity , so anything from 9 pool speedling pressure to 3 hatch lurker is possible from Zerg , though I doubt Flash will be disposed towards anything other than the extremely strong 1 rax FE or possibly mech as this is the other map in the pool that favors it .
The map owns a slight Terran bias in the matchup , probably because it is difficult to secure and hold the extremely important third gas as Zerg .
Still , Jaedong is an astonishing 12 - 2 on Match Point , and 3 - 1 in ZvT .
Of course , as it always seems to be with these two , his loss is to Flash .
KwarK 's take : On Match Point JD will have the distinct advantage of having seen Flash play three games on it last week .
It 's possible Flash used less than optimal builds against Effort ( man I hope so ) to keep something in reserve for some kind of crazy pride vendetta against JD but to be honest I doubt it .
Flash is n't going to completely reinvent his Match Point play and JD will probably just make some speedlings and win because apparently Flash can't defend against that .
Set 4 : Fighting Spirit
Arrian 's take : Both players own win percentages above 70 % on Fighting Spirit , and it is Flash 's strongest map in the pool .
As with the other maps , it has a slight favoring to the Terran , but Jaedong can usually be counted on to be the exception .
Flash plays almost exclusively bio on this map , so any mech would be highly unusual .
As for Jaedong , the close third gas ought to please him , but otherwise any muta opening will probably see a quick transition to lurkers to take advantage of the bridges and ramp at the third .
There is a high chance for a macro game here , something which both players are typically content to do .
If the series gets this far , the history of success on this map for both players along with the design of the map itself and the disposition of both players to go for the late game could lead to an epic fourth set .
Kwark 's take : Fighting Spirit will be interesting .
I said I favoured Flash 's macro and it's definitely a macro map .
However it's also a map with a lot of potential for strategic play ( unlike Odd Eye which is small and 2 player and simple ) .
I expect this to go to the late game and be the game of the series but I think JD will take it with some very standard , very high quality , lategame ZvT .
Four gas defiler into five gas defiler ultra orgasm style against Flash two base then four base camping another main with tanks .
Set 5 : Triathlon
Arrian 's take : Our reprise for the series .
For what it 's worth , I do n't expect too much to be different from the first time around .
I 'm guessing the series gets here , and I never , ever , bet against Jaedong in the clutch .
Flash , as superior a mental player as he can be , might fear both the reprise of the first set if he lost it and the reprise of the last final he played .
If we see mass speedlings here , expect Flash to walk out of that stadium and never come back .
KwarK 's take :
If it goes to a fifth game I 'm predicting JD to take it again because I still think his strategic play is simply stronger than Flash 's , especially recently .
If Flash plays at his best he'd be a contender but he's not playing at his best right now and his failings are in the area most important on Triathalon .
JD takes a fifth .
Predictions
We also asked the PL and OSL writers to give us their opinions , as well as a few other members of the staff .
+ Show Spoiler + Set 1 : Flash < Triathlon > Jaedong
This map is 4 - 1 TvZ , and Jaedong was able to win a game against Midas because his mind game worked .
Midas self - contained himself , preparing for heavy mutalisk harass , and Jaedong simply took the whole map .
Flash is not going to let that happen to him .
Jaedong probably prayed that this map would not be played twice when he decided to thumb down Odd - Eye
Set 2 : Flash < Odd- Eye 2 > Jaedong
This map is easier for Z than Odd - Eye , and Jaedong took down ( almost ) Flash in the last MSL finals on Odd - Eye .
He also had a very good game against Midas , and this is the game I 'm most confident in that Jaedong will win .
Set 3 : Flash < Match Point > Jaedong
Same reason as my OSL pick .
Flash has trouble TvZ on this map for some reason .
Set 4 : Flash < Fighting Spirit > Jaedong
Flash 's map .
If he takes another main base he will win , but otherwise , Jaedong should be able to take this map again .

flamewheel91 : Jaedong wins 3 - 2
+ Show Spoiler +
If it gets to late game , I think Flash has an advantage , though Jaedong has been brilliant with execution .
His multitasking is just as good as Flash's , and so at most I 'd give Flash a very slight endgame advantage due to Terran >
Zerg these days .
Set 1 : Flash < Triathlon > Jaedong
While Flash thumbing down Match Point is no surprise ( the 7:00 spawn curse got him in the fifth game of OSL ! ) , it piques my curiosity that Jaedong did n't thumbs - down Triathlon , which is 4 - 1 TvZ , with the lone 1 coming from Jaedong defeating Midas .
Earlier in the MSL , BaBy had solidly defeated Jaedong on Triathlon , since the extra gas on the map begs for mech .
However , against Midas , who also went mech , Jaedong simply contained Midas and expanded all over the place .
Given this map 's propensity for having nonstandard games ( HiyA vs Free anyone ? ) and the fact that it 's going to be played twice , Jaedong probably will have some sort of very tricky build for this first set , and a more standard game for the 5th set Ace , if it gets there .
Set 2 : Flash < Odd- Eye 2 > Jaedong
Surprisingly enough , this map is actually Z favoured , with a 4 - 5 TvZ , and Flash has never played a televised game on this map .
Combine that with the fact that Jaedong thumbed this map down , I think it 's likely we 'll be seeing the series tied 1 - 1 .
Set 3 : Flash < Match Point > Jaedong
Ah , Match Point .
You 're solidly TvZ favoured with a 75 - 60 TvZ record , but Flash ... you 're 4 - 5 against Zergs here .
If you spawn at 7 , it 's an instant Jaedong win ... and if you spawn at 1 , well I still think Jaedong has this .
Set 4 : Flash < Fighting Spirit > Jaedong
T - favoured .
Go figure .
Flash is 7 - 3 on this map , and last season against Calm he demonstrated just how damn hard it is to break a Terran that has split map .
Both Flash and Jaedong have good stats on this map , 7 - 3 and 7 - 2 , respectively , so it 's hard to call from this .
The victor of this map shall be decided on how long the game runs : an early to mid-game finish will favour Jaedong , but Flash is going to be looking to take this to the late game , where he can turtle tank it up .
Set 5 : Flash < Triathlon > Jaedong
I 'm not even going to bother making a power outage joke .
Simply put , if it gets down to this , Jaedong does n't lose Bo5s , and something 's lacking in Flash 's TvZ .
As I said earlier , the fact that Jaedong wants this map played twice means he definitely has something planned .
Jaedong for the win , back - to - back MSL gold , and a golden badge to go with his golden mouse , tying NaDa .
Flash 2 - 3 Jaedong Hmm Jaedong can also do early aggression though , even though we have n't seen it too much lately ?
If it gets to late game , I think Flash has an advantage , though Jaedong has been brilliant with execution .
His multitasking is just as good as Flash's , and so at most I 'd give Flash a very slight endgame advantage due to Terran >

Plexa : Flash wins 3 - 2
+ Show Spoiler +
Flash will win .
Effort defeating Flash was necessary to avoid the Brood War Gods from being angered at Flash winning both finals .
Random players like this who have screwed up past bonjwas have always existed - Bisu , July etc. who took out the super favored player and ended up winning the whole thing .
I 'm not overly concerned that losing to Effort shook Flash even an ounce .
He will have gone back , seen why he lost and will play a stronger series this weekend .
Jaedong was able to beat Flash last time because he out prepared Flash at every turn .
Do I expect Jaedong to be able to repeat this ?
No I do not .
These maps plain suck for Zerg and Jaedong 's builds last time were absolutely amazing .
Reproducing builds of similar standard for these maps ( knowing that Flash will probably be checking for different builds ) is going to be really tough .
Hell , agianst Midas Jaedong was going all out with awesome builds - how many more can he have tucked away ?
I expect 3 - 2 Flash , with Jaedong winning Match Point and Fighting Spirit .
Artosis : Flash wins
+ Show Spoiler +
This title is Flash's .
Yes , he just lost OSL to EffOrt , but he lost because Eff Ort played like a newbie .
The complete randomness of EffOrt 's play caused Flash to lose , not Flash slumping or burning out .
Flash has to be insanely upset at this loss to a much inferior player .
I believe he will bring everything he has to the MSL finals , and even Jaedong will be hard pressed to stand up to that .

Both versions play on the idea of women as materialistic , looking for the guy with the best car .
Vehicles become a stand - in for masculinity ; the bigger / faster the ride , the more attractive you are to women .
And what 's more manly than a tank , with a long , phallic - shaped barrel ?
Women are simply entranced and can't help running off after the biggest , strongest , manliest vehicle they can find …and , if we take the phallic imagery seriously , presumably the guy with the largest penis , too .

When you visit Mexico the first thing that comes into mind is beach and football , but a few people know about the underwater museum project , in the Caribbean Sea .
The museum is 400 ft below sea level near the Mexican city , Cancun ( one of the best tourist places in world ) .
The museum , which will have the capacity to entertain 750,000 tourists yearly , is still under construction and will open to public in 2011 .
The sculptures are made using neutral PH material to keep them Sea - Environment friendly and that they would n’t cause any damage to aquatic creatures .

Uchiha Sasuke features as a fictitious character in the famous animation series , Naruto .
He is one of the prominent and exciting characters in the series .
Following the writer of the series , Masashi Kishimoto , he depicts Sasuke as a sensitive and complicated character in the Naruto series .
In the movie series , he portrays him as a little boy who has a pure spirit power with no attachment to the emotional energy of his father .
Now , is Sasuke evil ?
To answer the question is Sasuke evil , we must note that Sasuke was a gentle and pure spirited little boy , as we saw in the early scenes of the series .
However , he turned into a villain as a result of his power - seeking ambition .
He considered everyone that got in his way of revenge an enemy , even if they were once friends .
Sasuke is a complicated character in the Naruto animation series .
He started as a good kid , missed his path while blinded by hatred , but made his way back on the good book just in time .
You can read further to get details regarding this topic !
The Character Of Sasuke
The role of Sakuke is that of a child who seeks the consent of his father from his early years , but as he grows in age , becomes resolute in his decision to fight against his brother , Uchiha Itachi , and restore his clan .
In the series , Sasuke displays a strong commitment to the laws of his family and clan .
He is gentle and quick to learn almost anything as a child , never hurting even a fly .
The tables turn for Sasuke as he turns out to be cold and hard - heartened towards everyone .
He sorts for the power to take revenge on his elder brother for killing everyone in their clan .
The decision controlled all his actions , making him join a vagrant group led by Orochimaru to become stronger .
Sasuke is a rival character to the main hero of the series , Uzumaki Naruto .
He plays the role of a significant villain when his quest for revenge makes him susceptible to the manipulations of Tobi .
The Story Of Uchiha Sasuke
Sasuke , born into the Uchiha clan , was the second son of the couple , Fagaku and Mikoto Uchiha .
As a child , Sasuke loved and considered his elder brother Itachi Uchiha his role model .
His family , especially his father , held his elder brother in high esteem .
Itachi had already set a perfect pace ahead , one that Sasuke was not likely to surpass in the eyes of their father .
Sasuke went further as a child and picked interest in the Ninja Academy .
He made visible progress in the noble art and was always a top place in the Academy .
All his achievements fell short of the expectations of his father .
As a little boy , this was disheartening .
It hurt Sasuke , but there was barely anything he could do about it .
A few years later , it looked like Itachi was slowly falling out of his glory days in the eyes of his father and the whole clan , as a result of the past event of the suicide committed by his close friend .
Fagaku gradually focused his attention on Sasuke but never considered him to better than Itachi .
Sasuke mastered one of the unique techniques taught by Fagaku and making perfect use of the skill for the very first time , made his father acknowledge him .
His father instructed him not to tread on the path of his elder brother Itachi and finally saw him as a son in his clan and this time , away from the shadow of Itachi .
The Battle Of Sasuke And Itachi
Seeing that Sasuke has better days , one would only wish it lasts long enough for him to remember .
Itachi puts an end to his happy days by killing all the members of their clan .
The actions of Itachi leave Sasuke with resentful memories leading to vengeful desires .
Itachi is a member of a villain group known as Akatsuki and poses a threat to Sasuke .
A bloody night it was , but the conversation between these two brothers stood out .
Sasuke confronted Itachi at the Uchiha hideout and battled him using ordinary taijutsu .
In the intense atmosphere , Itachi told Sasuke about the ability of the Mangekyo Sharingan .
The technique of Sharingan gives its possessor the ability to control the demon fox .
Itachi revealed to Sasuke that Madara Uchiha , one of the founders of the Konoha village , aided his killing of their clan .
During the fight , Itachi attacked first using a gengutsu called Tsukuyomi , but Sasuke overcame it .
The brother employed the use of the excellent fireball technique in their battle , giving Sasuke a better advantage .
They unleashed the Mangekyo technique consisting of Susanoo , Sword of Totsuka , and Giant Snakes during the fight .
Surprisingly , Sasuke and Itachi both used similar Mangekyo attacks on each other .
Itachi told Sasuke that Madara was the leader of the Akatsuki and his mentor .
He told Sasuke that the only way to stop the Mangekyo was to remove the eyes of the owner .
A New Purpose
After Sasuke recovered , he could only remember a few things that happened on the night of the massacre of his clan , especially his parents .
Sasuke was hurt and full of resentment for his brother .
It altered his relationship with other main characters like Naruto and Sakura .
Sasuke turns out to be a loner in the village , living for the desires of revenge .
He locked out everybody , but a few notable characters stood by him and made endless sacrifices for him till the end .
The principal character , Naruto , was an excellent friend to Sasuke , even though it took time to appreciate the bond both shared .
Sakura was also another character in the series that loved and fought for Sasuke countless times .
Sasuke abandoned Sakura despite his knowledge of their emotional attachment .
Sasuke later got married to her after so many reluctant actions , and they had a child .
What Makes Sasuke Appear Evil ?
His quest for more power led him into dark paths ; shedding blood was no new thing to him .
He became a well - known Assassin .
He had to join the villain group so that he could acquire more power in defeating his brother , Itachi .
Sasuke developed new skills such as the curse seal and the dragon fire technique .
The dragon fire gives him the ability to unleash fire during combat .
He could breathe it and control it correctly .
Sasuke has mastery in snake summoning techniques during a fight to aid him .
He improved his Sharingan to produce one of his ultimate skills called Susanoo .
Sasuke had emotions that fueled his passion for power and revenge .
Another reason to consider Sasuke as a villain is the horrible things he did when blinded by rage , and his inability to control his powers .
Sasuke made difficult decisions .
His decision to join a terrorist group and commit crimes was wrong .
He used a destructive tool for Orochimaru to accomplish his selfish plans .
Such decisions put the lives of his friends and village in harm ’s way .
Sasuke became powerful enough to battle his brother , but the price he paid for his power almost brought tragedy to the people important to him .
Another thing that made Sasuke appear evil was his mistake of repeating the cycle of parental negligence .
Sasuke deprived his daughter of a father ’s love .
He cared less for her ; on one occasion , she narrowly escaped death from her father after he mistook for an enemy .
Sasuke , at one time , broke the arms of an ordinary villager out of rage because he touched Sakura .
These are enough reasons to call him the devil himself .
Taking a flashback to how innocent and pure Sasuke was at the initial stage of the series , he was simply a pure soul stained with the desire to avenge his clan and grew up with all those emotions bottled up inside him .
He had the determination to do anything that will make him more powerful to take revenge .
Blinded by this mentality , he lost his good virtue on several occasions in the series .
Redemption
At some point , we also see that Sasuke chose a calm way of awakening his Sharingan when he had the option of killing his best friend , Naruto .
As the series would have it , Sasuke realizes his real friends and family , the curse of hatred got broken , and he gets to live a good life again as he returns to his gentle self once more .
Conclusion
We cannot say Sasuke is evil , knowing that it will sound as irrational .
Sasuke got caught up in an unplanned situation .
Blinded and used , failed , and refused to see humanity , he went through a wrong path .
People become evil when they are committed to a path of hatred with no intention of submitting to forgiveness .
Sasuke ’s personality took the description of a hero when he became remorseful , and his eyes opened to see and appreciate the sacrifices and love that some distinct persons had made for him .
Sasuke had the most sacrifice and gift of love from the other animated characters .
Sasuke turned back to his original personality of being pure and gentle , realizing what his friends could do for him , broken .
He saw no purpose for hatred and resentment .
In the light of all these , is Sasuke evil ?
No !

“ They just do n’t shock me anymore , ” said Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi at a rally last night against PG&E .
The company has already spent $ 35 million to pass Proposition 16 which would cement their monopoly , and has dumped another $ 9.5 million in the past five days .
Meanwhile , PG&E ( who paid its C.E.O. $ 9.4 million last year ) is requesting the California Public Utilities Commission to grant them a 30 % rate hike – which would generate $ 4 billion in profits .
The CPUC is holding public hearings on the rate hike across the state , with the first one last night in San Francisco .
Because Prop 16 requires a two - thirds majority of voters to pass a public alternative to PG&E , consumers will be trapped paying these ever - escalating rate hikes in the future .
And with “ No on 16 ” raising less than one - tenth of one percent of PG&E ’s money , activists must get creative to push their message .
“ What do Meg Whitman and PG&E have in common , ” asked John Rizzo , Chair of the Sierra Club ’s San Francisco Chapter at the rally .
“ They ’re both spending tens of millions of dollars to buy an election .
But the difference ?
Meg Whitman is using her own money .
PG&E is using our money to pass Prop 16 . ”
While PG&E has sent leaflets saying we are “ powerless ” that elected politicians spend taxpayer money , there is nothing ratepayers can do to stop PG&E from spending its money on Prop 16 – unless the legislature passes SB 1441 .
With the Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United , we can expect even more corporations from freely spending their treasuries to hi-jack our electoral process .
PG&E is doing it with Prop 16 , but the June ballot also has Proposition 17 – which is funded by Mercury Insurance to maximize its profits .
“ If Prop 16 passes , ” said Mirkarimi , “ every state with an initiative process will be vulnerable to this corporate predatory interest . ”
Last night ’s rally – which included a march from City Hall to the CPUC at 505 Van Ness – was timed for a public hearing at the CPUC to consider PG&E ’s request for a rate hike .
If the hike gets approved , PG&E customers will see their bills go up 30 % – a windfall of $ 4 billion for the utility company .
And if Prop 16 passes , local municipal efforts to give customers a competing alternative would require the daunting task of a two - thirds vote of the electorate .
In other words , PG&E could get away with more rate hikes in the future .
Yesterday , Capitol Weekly reported that PG&E put another $ 9.5 million into the Prop 16 campaign , upping its warchest to $ 44.2 million – entirely funded by the utility company .
TURN , which is leading the campaign against Prop 16 , has raised $ 35,000 .
But Mark Toney , Executive Director of TURN , pointed out that PG&E’s “ coalition ” to pass Prop 16 is starting to fragment .
The California Chamber of Commerce may have endorsed “ Yes on 16 ” – but its affiliates in Fresno , Riverside , Stockton , Fremont and other places ( sadly , not San Francisco ) have dissented .
The Republican Party in San Joaquin County actually flipped from “ yes ” to “ no ” ( despite the State Party taking a “ yes ” position ) , and yesterday the Los Angeles County GOP came out against Prop 16 .
Even the San Diego Taxpayers ’
Association has broken from its statewide organization and is “ no ” on Prop 16 .
When presented with facts , even conservatives are against it .
But with PG&E throwing so many millions , some opponents have taken a more creative route – using new media tactics to get their message out .
Ben Zolno of Sebastopol has run a YouTube campaign that prides on spending only “ one- millionth ” of what PG&E is spending to pass Prop 16 .
When news broke that PG&E has dumpted another $ 9 million , he announced on his blog that he will now spend an extra nine dollars – and asked readers how he should spend that money .
At last night ’s protest , activists even tried invoking pop culture in a similar way that Pride at Work pulled off recently .
By taking Gloria Gaynor ’s “ I Will Survive , ” they re-wrote the song with these lyrics ( complete with back - up dancers and some brass instruments as backup ) :
First I was afraid , I was petrified
When I saw my PG&E bill had gone sky high ,
I spent so many nights thinking how they did me wrong ,
Then I grew strong , I learned how to carry on
‘ Cause we ’ve got a choice , of who we pay
I wanna dump PG&E and get clean energy
I can change who sends me juice , we can break monopoly
16 takes away my choice , and that really bothers me
So just vote NO … on Prop 16
Let ’s turn it around now , ‘ cause PG&E ’s just playing mean
They ’re dropping 35 mill , just to trick me with their lies
And all the while , they ’re planning a 30 % rate hike
Oh no , not I … I will survive
I ’m fighting these PG&E bills that are burying me alive
So vote No on Prop 16 , to make our power clean
I will survive … I will survive .
Maybe this will be the next YouTube sensation …

The World from Berlin Merkel ' Only Now Realizes the Dimensions of Afghanistan '
The death of seven German soldiers in Afghanistan this month is likely to fuel public opposition to the Bundeswehr 's deployment in the Hindu Kush .
German papers take another look at what the country 's troops are doing in Afghanistan .
LOUISVILLE , Ky. —
On May 18 , the U.S. Senate primary elections took place in Kentucky .
There was a reported “ low turnout ” for both the Republican or Democratic parties .
Nevertheless , millions voted for who would represent the two parties in the upcoming November elections to replace Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) in the U.S. Senate .
Bunning , the Republican Senator serving as Mitch McConnell ’s junior since 1999 , decided to retire from his position , citing an apparent difficulty raising campaign funds , meaning that the Republican spot would be open to a fresh candidate .
Out of the Republican candidates , Trey Grayson , Rand Paul , Jon Scribner , John Stephenson , Gurley Martin , and Bill Johnson ( who dropped out of the race before the primary , but was still on the ballot ) , it had become a simple race between Rand Paul and Trey Grayson .
Rand Paul ( the son of Ron Paul , Republican Representative from the 14th Texas Congressional District ) supports the extreme capitalist values of the GOP , such as a “ free market ” solution to health care .
He also opposes government bailouts , is for trying suspected terrorists with military tribunals instead of civil courts , and would keep Guantanamo Bay open .
Paul believes that the healthcare system is over - regulated .
It ’s no surprise that he is backed by the tea party movement .
Trey Grayson ( Kentucky Secretary of State ) supports the more “ traditional ” values of the GOP .
He is “ pro-life , ” seeking to ban abortions under any circumstance .
Grayson wants more than 700 miles of border fencing equipped with the “ latest technologies ” , while deporting undocumented immigrants and taking away the birthright of children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants .
He has an A+ rating from the NRA .
The Democratic candidates , in similar fashion to the Republican race , had 5 candidates , with two of them having the best chance of winning .
Of Jack Conway , Daniel Mongiardo , James Buckmaster , Darlene Fitzgerald Price , and Maurice Sweeny , it had come down to Conway and Mongiardo .
Daniel Mongiardo , lieutenant governor of Kentucky and son of Italian immigrants , supports further healthcare reform .
Mongiardo sees the bill passed in March as merely the first step towards affordable healthcare for all .
Mongiardo actually has a medical degree .
Mongiardo wants to create jobs in Kentucky , and promotes the cleaner liquid coal fuel from America than the foreign petroleum currently being used in fuel .
He plans on cutting CO2 emissions even more than any of the proposed “ Cap & Trade ” bills currently in Congress .
Jack Conway , who is the current attorney general , has a plan to create jobs by proposing a 20 % tax credit to businesses who expand their payroll and hire more workers , but does n’t apply to government workers .
He also supports more lending to small businesses and “ cutting red tape ” in the paperwork for small business owners .
Jack Conway states that he will save the U.S. $ 430 billion in ten years , partly by closing corporate tax loopholes on overseas interest and shutting down offshore tax shelters .
He is opposed to privatizing Social Security and refused to sign on to Republican and tea party lawsuits against the healthcare reform bill .
He is against bailouts , will challenge McConnell to stop defending Wall Street , and is for Wall Street reform that puts consumers first .
For working class families , Mongiardo seemed to be the best candidate .
Most progressive groups supported him .
However , in 2004 Mongiardo made a campaign promise to vote in favor of the anti-LGBT Federal Marriage Amendment .
Kentucky Heartwood , an organization that preserves forests in the state , chose not to endorse any particular candidate .
In the end , Jack Conway won the Democratic Primary , beating Mongiardo by 1 % .
Conway got 44 % of the vote , to Mongiardo ’s 43 % .
It brings back memories of 2004 , where Mongiardo lost in the general election to Jim Bunning .
In 2004 , Mongiardo had 49.3 % , and Bunning had 50.7 % .
As for the Republican Party , the tea party backed candidate , Rand Paul , won by a wide margin to Trey Grayson , Paul ’s 59 % to Grayson ’s 35 % .
Paul ’s victory is being considered a “ tremendous mandate for the tea party . ”
Paul had never run for office , using his inexperience in a way that reflected a candidate who had not been “ corrupted by Washington , ” or in the Bluegrass State sense , Frankfort .

The next step in trying to plug the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well is to implement a Lower Marine Riser Package , which is basically a more advanced version of the containment dome that BP tried initially , which was a total failure .
BP explains it like this :
This would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the BOP , leaving a cleanly - cut pipe at the top of the BOP ’s LMRP .
The LMRP cap , an engineered containment device with a sealing grommet , would be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and then placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well and transporting it to the drillship on the surface .
The LMRP cap is already on site and it is anticipated that this option will be available for deployment by the end of May .
That was from May 25th , because BP planned for something like this simultaneously with Top Kill .
According to BP COO Doug Suttles , the process will take 4 - 7 days , according to MSNBC .
Here 's a diagram put out by BP , and here 's an open thread on LMRP at The Oil Drum , which should have a great comments thread on the process . :
I used to be a normal psycholinguistics graduate student .
I wanted to study how the mind parses improbable metaphors , unintelligible accents , and quirky syntax .
Sexy things .
Things that would play out well at parties .
I imagined myself magnanimously explaining how sentences like “ The bartender served the bourbon fell down the stairs ” were truly grammatical .
I imagined myself dropping newspaper headlines like “ Iraqi Head Seeks Arms ” into conversations with beautiful people .
I would defend Internet chatroom slang on local radio .
I would exchange holiday cards with Steven Pinker .
But something has happened .
I am in my third year of graduate school , and I have fallen in love .
I have fallen for pronouns .
It ’s hard to shut me up about them .
Before we can understand a word , we first have to retrieve its meaning from memory .
Most of the time , this happens quickly — so quickly we call it automatic — but sometimes it does n’t , sometimes the word is good and dusty .
Say my lab manager says , “ Sally saw Rosemary Clooney on the bus today ! ” I ’ll quickly retrieve some meaningful representation for Sally and saw and bus and today , but Rosemary Clooney might throw me .
I retrieve her a bit at a time , one piece leading to another .
She sounds familiar .
She ’s a singer , right ?
Is n’t she George Clooney ’s aunt ?
Then I remember Rosemary Clooney , George ’s aunt , died several years ago .
“ No way , ” I reply , that bit of idiomatic speech rolling off my tongue effortlessly .
“ She ’s been dead for years . ”
And here we ’ve come to a pronoun .
My lab manager delves into memory for representations of dead and years , and finds them , no problem .
Delving for she , my lab manager comes back up with a representation of Rosemary Clooney .
But she does n’t always mean Rosemary Clooney .
Sometimes she means Sally or Hillary Clinton or the girl I ate lunch with on the first day of seventh grade .
She could be anything that can be referenced as a single female — even a ship or a country .
But my lab manager knows , straight away , that she is Rosemary Clooney .
Pronouns involve that extra step , that discourse mining , that sensitivity to intent and likelihood : that matchmaking .
Right here , right now , who is she ?
Perhaps you are beginning to see why I am obsessed .
By definition , pronouns only contain vague information , like first - person or plural .
In order for something this vague to effectively retrieve a word ’s meaning , there has to be a whole lot of context .
Imagine all the words contained in your mind as a vast pool of fish .
Look carefully and you ’ll see that each fish is different from all the others .
If you had a hook selective enough , you ’d be able to control which fish you catch .
But pronouns are not selective hooks .
Pronouns are sweeping nets .
You have to cast your net shallowly in the hopes that you catch the one noun the pronoun refers to .
That ’s what context does : it pushes what ’s relevant to the surface of the mind .
There are plenty of psycholinguists out there trying to figure out what counts as context .
The real answer would be everything .
A more helpful answer would be a bit narrower : syntactic things like part of speech and parallel structure matter , as do pragmatic things , like how the world works and what message a speaker intends to convey .
Say my lab manager says , “ Sally invited Rosemary Clooney to a dinner party !
She said , ‘ Yes ! ’ ”
She references Rosemary Clooney and not Sally , since invitations lead to responses .
This is context at its most straightforward .
Most psycholinguistic work on pronouns has used third - person pronouns like he and she .
This is because psycholinguists prefer straight­forward problems that make it easy to design experiments ; the first - and second - person pronouns require context of a different sort .
A person must know the speaker , as well as the listener , for the referents of I or you to be retrievable .
Fortunately , language - acquisition researchers ( who often speak with psycho­linguists and occasionally even conference with them ) have looked at these problematic pronouns , and to interesting effect .
I and you are challenging for children to learn : some children go through a stage where , not understanding you ’s speaker - specific meaning , they hear their mothers say , “ Do you want a cookie ? ” and respond “ You want cookie !
You want cookie ! ”
How charming !
Interestingly , some deaf children learning American Sign Language make the same mistake .
Fluent speakers of ASL point to themselves to indicate I .
It ’s as iconic as a sign can get .
But that young ASL learner will point at his mother until she hands him a cookie .
It ’s hard not to envy the language - acquisition researchers the adorableness of their subjects .
And there are plenty of other types of pronouns , all with their own contextual obligations ( read : experimenter headaches ) .
Sometimes people use pronouns that are unheralded , meaning they do n’t refer to anything that has been mentioned previously in conversation .
These pronouns generally need the most context to be understood .
Often , as is the case with knowing the relationship between I and you , this context is nonlinguistic .
If I say “ He ’s on fire ! ” when my cat is on fire , it is pretty obvious that he refers to the cat .
I do n’t even have to point .
Anyone listening to my speech and witnessing the event will have enough context to know who I ’m saying is on fire .
The next day , the postdoc I share an office with listens to my story about buying a catnip candle so that I could watch my cat roll endearingly on the carpet while the scent wafted across the room , and how it did n’t quite turn out that way , how instead my cat pounced on top of the candle and the fur on his belly instantly broke into flame .
When I say all this and four hours later the postdoc sees me and shakes his head and says , “ They should be illegal , ” I know that by they he means catnip candles .
Unheralded , see ?
The source of that blazing belly has seared itself so prominently on both our minds that it does n’t even need to be mentioned to be there .
There are also pronouns that do n’t mean anything at all .
Dummy pronouns , they ’re called , and we come across them all the time ( you read one in the previous sentence ) .
They ’re those pronouns that exist only because the English language demands that each sentence contain a subject : the it in “ It ’s raining ” or the there in “ There is a shed in my back yard . ”
( Note : the there only works as an example of a dummy pronoun if I am not pointing to a shed , and am nowhere near my back yard . )
( Note : most linguistic examples have caveats like this , making the linguist ’s life frustrating : “ You ’re right , ” linguists will inevitably find themselves saying at some point .
“ If the bartender is also drinking bourbon while she mixes drinks for a patron wearing a yellow shirt and standing directly to her left , and if all of this is happening on a Tuesday , well yeah I can get that meaning . ” )
One thing we psycholinguists have learned is that using pronouns correctly is a lot of work .
A person has to strike a balance between referencing something and not beating other folks over the head with it .
Striking this balance requires quite a bit of attention .
And when attention goes , so does proper pronoun use .
I ask a professor how Corey ’s comprehensive exams went .
The professor says something like , “ Well , Corey ’s a bright guy .
I do n’t think he studied as much as he could have , but overall he did fine . ”
But if I ask a professor how Corey ’s comprehensive exams went while also asking the professor to rehearse a five - digit number in her head , she will say something like , “ Well , Corey ’s a bright guy .
. . . do n’t think Corey studied as much as Corey could have .
. . . but overall Corey did fine . ”
It takes work to keep track of when to use a pronoun ; work that we can do easily — automatically — when we ’re not keeping track of anything else , but work that becomes damn near impossible if we have to keep rehearsing 9 - 1 - 0 - 7 - 4 over and over again in our heads .
Try it on your friends .
Try it on your spouse .
Try it on your parents , but only if they ’re not too old , because once their memories are shot they ’ll be using a lot more pronouns .
Not because they ’ve become exceptional at keeping track of when the referent has last been named , but because they ’ve lost track of the referent altogether .
I ‘m lucky .
At a large research university , I have plenty of participants ( never “ subjects , ” at least in print ) at my disposal .
For at least a hundred hours each term I have other people ’s lives to exploit as shamelessly ( but ethically ) as I would like .
I try to run participants during the first few weeks of a term when they ’re plucky and ambitious , the sort of undergraduates who like to stay on top of things , who wo n’t try to fit all seven research hours in on the last possible day , who are n’t likely to rearrange the keyboard to spell [ F ] [ U ] [ C ] [ K ] [ ] [ T ] [ H ] [ I ] [ S ] or to accidentally “ lock ” themselves in the testing rooms by pulling at the doors instead of pushing .
I run group after group , sometimes several groups at once , then go back to my desk to make sure that the data are going where they ought and that no software bug needs last - minute eradication .
Then , once the numbers start looking funny , once the ceiling is judged by participants to be as likely to smile as the child and response times get painfully long — or impossibly short — I breathe a huge sigh and try to see what it is , exactly , that I ’ve collected .
If an experiment works , if the numbers look and smell and feel so gorgeously simple that I actually trust them , I ’ll sit at my desk long after my adviser has left for home , after the postdocs and other graduate students have called it a day and the lab manager has shut down her computer .
I ’ll sit staring at those numbers as if they ’re a message from somewhere so close I can feel its heat .
You see , psycholinguists have devised — and continue to devise — a number of different tasks to get at how pronouns work .
The one I use most often in my own research is the recognition - probe task .
Essentially , the task presupposes that what is most prominent in a person ’s memory while experiencing language is what the language is “ about ” at that time .
Participants enter a little testing room and sit down at a computer .
Short texts appear on the screen , and the participants are instructed to read them , presumably in preparation for a comprehension test .
Participants are given a secondary task : to decide as quickly as possible whether they recognize test words that appear unexpectedly on the screen as words they ’ve read in the text .
If a pronoun ’s referent is retrieved , participants should be better at responding “ yes ” to the referent if it appears as a test word in the recognition task .
Say you ’re a participant reading along and you come to this :
Rosemary threw the jellyfish that hit Anne in the chest .
While she laughed and laughed , Anne doubled over in pain .
If Rosemary is correctly recovered as the referent of she , then responses to Rosemary as a test word should be faster and more accurate immediately after the pronoun than they would be otherwise .
Other words , like jellyfish , should receive no such boost .
Other tasks involve reading - time measures like eye tracking , where an expensive machine actually records participants ’ pupils while they read .
From this video , researchers are able to reconstruct the eye ’s saccades ( eye movements ) from word to word , and to calculate the amount of time a reader spends on a precise word ( or even part of a word ) .
Reading - time tasks presuppose , of course , that where the eyes linger is what the language is “ about . ”
Yet another task just asks participants straight - out how acceptable they find a sentence , a task that assumes that people ’s judgments about the acceptability of a sentence presented in isolation will mirror how much difficulty they would have upon encountering the sentence in a more realistic setting .
Researchers using this task tend to be interested in pronouns as freaks of nature , as sneaky critters that do n’t play by the rules .
For instance , it seems as though , while pronouns can easily take the place of nouns in a sentence , the opposite is not always true .
Let ’s say a fellow grad student points out , “ The gardener who the agency which the neighbors recommended sent did a wonderful job around the pool . ”
I ’d have no idea what he was talking about , and not just because graduate students do not have pools .
Let ’s say , instead , he proclaims , “ The gardener who the agency which I recommended sent did a wonderful job around the pool . ”
With just the right inflections , I can almost hear him saying this :
It ’s bad , but it ’s not as bad .
Psycholinguists talk in terms like these .
“ Bad , but not as bad ” is a notable thing for a psycholinguist .
Recently , psycholinguists have started to act on the pictures - of - the - brain - are - sexy phenomenon that has hit all areas of cognitive science like cats on candles .
And at least one big pronoun study has come out of the madness .
A team of researchers at the University of South Carolina scanned participants ’ brains in an fMRI machine while reading them sentences that contained either proper nouns or their pronominal equivalents .
Patterns of activity across the brain ( as indicated by changes in blood flow ) showed a number of differences in the two cases .
Notably , when pronouns — but not proper names — were read , there was activity in areas of the brain associated with spatial processing .
The lead researcher has an interesting interpretation : listening to proper names , over and over again , can be disruptive .
Each proper name will bring with it a host of associations — not all of them particularly relevant .
Think about it .
When you hear the name Emily Dickinson , you may not just retrieve aspects of Emily Dickinson ’s life and work ; you may also think of every Emily you ’ve ever known , as well as the time you considered naming the family dog Emily .
Or you may access a beloved high school English teacher , or the embarrassment you felt when you read a Dickinson poem aloud to your seventh - grade class and pronounced all of the dashes .
Words , the researcher suggests , are loaded , and pronouns may be a way of accessing a representation of the proper name that avoids the pitfalls of the proper name itself .
It ’s a way to maneuver ( literally , it appears ) around some of the association - juggling that language processing involves , to head straight for a placeholder instead .
If his theory sounds crazy , consider this : speakers of ASL will sign a proper name the first time a person is brought up , and then point to a specific location in space , essentially assigning the proper name to that space .
The person can then be subsequently referenced with a simple point to that space .
In our brains , of course , the space is virtual , but its importance may be very real .
This brain stuff is relatively new to psycholinguists and hard to interpret .
The fMRI procedure presupposes that blood flow to the brain means what we hope it means and is n’t a byproduct of something we just have n’t thought of yet .
Still , results like this may eventually force psycholinguists to approach pronouns with a different metaphor .
Change does n’t come easily to psycholinguists .
After all , we ’re still weaning ourselves off the idea that sentences are represented in the mind as special trees that only branch to the right .
If pronouns themselves should be treated as occupying a virtual space , can I really talk about them as if they delve into memory to “ retrieve ” a referent ?
Will I have to start talking about them as if they are hooks of the coat - rack variety ?
One does n’t have to be a psycholinguist to obsess over pronouns .
Pronouns are talking trilobites , the last remnants of an Old English with a very different — and much richer — morphology .
English used to always mark case : words were pronounced differently depending on their part of speech .
Now the only words that still mark case are pronouns : I , we , he , she , and they when the pronoun appears as a subject ; me , us , him , her , and them when it appears as an object .
Second - person pronouns used to mark case , too , but ye , the pronoun marked for subject , is already obsolete .
After all , we do n’t really need case anymore .
Word order takes care of everything .
We know the relationship of a subject to a verb because of their respective places in a sentence .
Still , pronouns are a way of looking back , or , perhaps more interestingly , a way of experiencing languages that rely more on morphological markings and less on word order .
Which brings me to the obvious yet disarming truth that English pronouns could just as easily be something else .
In some languages , pronouns are optional ; context permitting , they can be dropped out of the sentence entirely .
In other languages , third - person pronouns — the words like he , she , and they that are psycholinguists ’ bread and butter — do n’t even exist .
Third persons are instead referenced with demonstratives like this or these .
And in yet other languages , pronouns can carry information about the formality of the conversation , and even the social positions of its speakers .
To think about how odd this is , consider how much one type of information carried by some English pronouns — gender — can affect the way we communicate .
Last year , arriving late to a departmental Christmas party , I was immediately greeted by a waifish 10 - year - old with pale skin , delicate features , neatly braided long brown hair , and a stuffed clown fish .
The girl solemnly informed me that her stuffed animal was dying of diphtheria .
“ Oh no ! ” I cried in mock horror .
“ Is your fish contagious ? ” Perhaps fearing I would launch into a speech about how young ladies should be careful around contagious fish , a fellow graduate student quickly interjected , “ He ’s sure the fish is n’t contagious .
I asked him that same question . ”
And that is how I learned that the strange girl with the delicate features and the long braid was in fact a boy .
How deftly pronominal information is delivered , and gleaned , by fluent speakers !
How different the entire situation would have been were I a speaker of Hawaiian or Persian , where gender is n’t marked at all !
There is even evidence that linguistic markers of gender can shape the way we think .
Not in big ways .
Not in the ways that had so much of social science drooling in the ’60s .
But in little ways , more like a nail file than a chain saw .
A Stanford researcher presented bilingual English - Spanish and English - German speakers with a picture of a bridge .
In Spanish and German , unlike English , even some inanimate objects are referenced with gendered pronouns .
In Spanish the word for bridge is marked masculine ( and thus referenced with a masculine pronoun ) ; in German the word is marked feminine .
The researcher instructed the participants to describe the photograph .
Then an independent group of participants rated all of the adjectives the bilinguals had written as either masculine or feminine .
German bilinguals consistently described the bridge with more feminine adjectives ( elegant , beautiful ) , and Spanish bilinguals described it with more masculine adjectives ( sturdy , dangerous ) .
Here ’s the kicker : instructions were given in English , descriptions were written in English , and the photograph of the bridge was just that — a photograph .
This suggests that pronouns might be important , not just to how we use language , but to how we experience the objects in our world ( although , as dear Steven Pinker points out , “ Just because a German thinks a bridge is feminine , does n’t mean he ’s going to ask one out on a date ” ) .
Lucky for me , there are plenty of pronouns in need of more study — the diectics ( here , there ) , the reflexives ( himself , themselves ) , the interrogatives ( who , what ) , the possessives ( his , mine ) , the indefinites ( somebody , anything ) — each with its own relatively unexamined life .
Or , for the freshest pronoun around , I could always coin one myself .
In Baltimore , some teenagers already have : their candidate , yo , is a new gender - neutral third - person personal pronoun .
As in Yo was tuckin ’ in his shirt or Yo sucks at magic tricks .
If yo sticks around — and if it spreads — maybe we can put the ever - awkward he or she to rest forever .
And what would that mean ?
What consequences could that have for how we think about our world ?
Empirical question .

GM headquarters stands tall behind ruins in Detroit – Click above for high - res image gallery
Once upon a time , Detroit was a city to be envied .
Its inhabitants were highly - skilled workers that earned solid wages and lived in nice homes that made up good neighborhoods .
So alluring was the promise of Detroit that the city grew sixfold throughout the first half of the previous century .
In fact , at its peak in 1950 , Detroit was the fourth largest city in the United States and looked to all the world as if its boundaries would do nothing but increase over the next few decades .
Suffice it to say , this did n't happen .
Nearly a million people in the last 60 years have left the city , meaning that Detroit has literally thousands of empty office buildings , theaters , houses and hotels .
In the once bustling Downtown area alone , there are more than 200 abandoned buildings on the National Register of Historic Places .
Some of them can be seen in our high - res image gallery below .
But how did it get this way , and is there no hope for The Motor City ?

Canadian beavers built the world 's longest dam -- so big it can be seen from space , The Sun reported Tuesday .
The incredible woodland construction is a staggering 2,790 feet in length -- more than half a mile long .
It is twice the size of what was the world 's largest , the Hoover dam , which borders Arizona and Nevada in the U.S. and spans 1,244 feet .
The furry critters use trees , mud and stone to make a type of moat where they can use their swimming skills to evade any predators .
The dam , located on the southern edge of Wood Buffalo National Park in Northern Alberta , central Canada , was spotted by experts monitoring the size and spread of beaver dams in North America .
Sharon Brown , a biologist from Beavers : Wetland and Wildlife , an educational organization in North America , said : " Beavers build dams to create a good habitat .
" They create a habitat with lots of water like a moat around their lodges so they can swim and drive , and keep one step ahead of predators such as coyotes and bears . "
It is thought that several beaver families joined forces to create the massive dam , containing thousands of trees , and took many months to complete it .

THE Pentagon considered developing a host of non-lethal chemical weapons that would disrupt discipline and morale among enemy troops , newly declassified documents reveal .
Most bizarre among the plans was one for the development of an “ aphrodisiac ” chemical weapon that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other .
Provoking widespread homosexual behaviour among troops would cause a “ distasteful but completely non-lethal ” blow to morale , the proposal says .
Other ideas included chemical weapons that attract swarms of enraged wasps or angry rats to troop positions , making them uninhabitable .
Another was to develop a chemical that caused “ severe and lasting halitosis ” , making …
Tuesday :
This coffee ai n’t bitter , but it ai n’t too good neither , but the odds of me downing another
cup of this bile ’s about one in six , and if anything ’s gonna get better , well I ’ll tell ya one thing , it ’s gonna be my lifeless fucking body laying headfirst in a pool of my own blood because right now this .357 magnum feels heavy , but its clink - clink to the floor ’s gonna be bout as silent as a church mouse because revolvers , if I learnt anything , well , they ’re damn loud .
And you know what , I was n’t born with no silver spoon jammed down my throat , but my family was n’t no scoundreling thieves neither .
My pop , he was a butcher for years and years and if I learnt one thing from him it was to work hard and keep your mouth shut because if you got a job you ’re lucky to have it , and if you do n’t that ai n’t necessarily your fault either because sometimes there ’s jobs and sometimes there ’s not .
But , he was a good man up till he got a little too drunk and thought it ’d be a grand idea to hop a train south .
Ain’t heard from him since and for all I know he ’s living a tip - top life in some other city with some other family .
Ca n’t blame him , though .
This city ’s a shit - hole rotting with the walking corpses posed as happy - go - lucky families who do n’t do nothing but bicker and fight and scream at one another .
And I know one things , and that ’s that my family was n’t no model for sticking together .
That ’s why I never married a soul , came close though , but put that to an end right quick ; did n’t want to deal with the grief and problems that came along right with it , and to this day that might a been a good idea , might a not , but if there ’s one thing not strickening a person with grief then its another and that other ranges from the IRS hounding a man over pocketing a little cash on the side for helping reroof a acquaintance ’s house to your health declining into some oblivion
that ai n’t no one come back from .
As for myself , well , neither of them quite fit my mood , but this pistol ’s getting heavier and now ’s good a time as any to roll the dice .
I flip the chamber open because this ’s a game and not no hundred percent verdict on my life — hell , she ’s not even a fifty or thirty percent verdict on my life , I ’d give it bout seventeen or eighteen percent verdict , but I ai n’t that hot at math — and yup , we got five empties and single round sitting here all pretty and glimmery mooning me with its metallic asshole .
I spin the chamber and flip that bad boy to the left and it clicks right in there , no way for me to know what ’s what or where ’s where .
I take another sip of the cooling coffee , sit it down back on the table and press the barrel on that sweat soaked flesh , squint my eyes at the clock tick - tocking right around the circle and squeeze the trigger .
Nothing but a click .
Well , ai n’t that my luck , but I guess you could say that either way it happened .
Wednesday : Figured I ’d take a shower for the first time a week or so when I got up , but my hair ’s
short and you can hardly tell when I ain’t had one .
Keep myself smelling decent , wash my hands and face with the hose on the broad side of the house if need be , but beside that I was never a fan of bathing , definitely not when I was a tike : mom had to tickle me to tears before I ’d get in the bath and even then I ’d just wash myself off with water and play with some Lego guys , conjuring up all sorts a stories involving ninjas and pirates and robots from futures long ago just like in Star Wars .
Figured too , might as well scramble up some eggs and nuke some bacon , which I swear to God I ai n’t done in about a year .
Breakfast ?
Nah , I just like my coffee and paper , but even the paper ’s been scarce lately .
Maybe its just that boredom of repeating my days every day and every week since I got my diploma and got myself a job .
So what ’s the point , my life ai n’t gonna change from here , ca n’t change , ca n’t do nothing about it .
Wake , work , drink , sleep , work and so on into infinity - lined jest of a life .
Eggs and bacon really hit the spot and if there is something better in the morning for a man to eat whose bout to crap it out with Death , well , I do n’t wanna know a thing about it .
Stick to the essentials .
That ’s what mom always said before my sis committed her to that Christian assisted - living center the next town over , but that ’s another story for another day .
If there ’s one piece of advice I can pass on to another single person living out and about on their own , it ’s this : buy some yellow , rubber gloves for doing dishes , because you can get that water scalding and there ai n’t no way you can feel the heat through them suckers , and once my plate and silverware ’s done and back in the drawers and cabinets I take that seat on that rickety old chair , sip my coffee and once again wrap my fingers round handle of my .357 , lift her to my temple and squeeze that bad boy .
And again we got a snap of the hammer hitting absolutely nothing .
Thursday : Mormoms came by later yesterday bout eleven a clock .
I do n’t know why they insist on
coming to my door in the morning , I mean , how they know I ai n’t sleeping still , that I do n’t have a night job and sleep during the day so I can bring in the bucks .
I do n’t , and I was n’t , and even so
yesterday was my day off , but shit , that stuff ’s Goddamn inconsiderate .
Course I told ‘em to get the hell off a my property and slammed the door before they could start up on any of that “ You been saved ? ” or “ You need Jesus ? ” nonsense .
But I guess there ’s something good that came outta them knocking at my door : I had n’t really noticed the day , but fuck me if was n’t beautiful , so what ’d I do ?
Took me a stroll , which I have n’t done in God knows how many years .
Five maybe ?
Six ?
Hell , I dunno , but it ’d been a while , I can say that for sure .
Anyway , took myself down to the watering hole and had myself a couple beers and played a game of pool gainst a few folks who been going there since I was crying for mom to let me stay out just a few hours later because the summer ’s great , and swimming ’s great and I can’t wait for it to get a bit warmer so I can get on down to the marina and take a dip off the end of the dock .
Eggs again this morning .
Bacon , too .
Added some toast and finished her off with some coffee because if you ai n’t drinking coffee then you do n’t know what you ’re missing because there ’s nothing quite like a cup a joe to get a man ready and rearing to laugh at God ’s plans , and right now there ’s a few things going through my mind , but keeping up this fatal game ’s the top a the list , so I snatch up that revolver without a second thought press the gun inches from my eye and squeeze that bad boy and would n’t you know it , I rolled a seven first throw again .
I top off my coffee , leave room for some Irish cream and sit back , staring at a couple birds circling each other in the sky , squawking back and forth like a couple kids playing a game a airborne tag .
Friday :
First thing ’s first and that ’s a Advil and extra strong coffee because this hangover ’s kicking my ass , and I do n’t even feel like going through the motions today so I get right to the point , spin that chamber , snap her closed , put the barrel against my skull and pull that trigger tight , and there you go , not a damn thing .
Lady
Luck ’s laughing at me every day this shit goes down without a hitch .
And if this coffee ’s not burnt I ’d be a liar , but that ’s fine because I ai n’t been down to Connie ’s ... in shit , probably a decade .
There ’s no way its been that long , but I ca n’t remember the last time I been there .
Probably bout that time I got in a scrap with that fella down the street over the roof I helped him nail back on after that in - land hurricane hit cause he said I intentionally left spots blank for spite ’s sake , and there ’s ten or so things I ’d do for spite ’s sake to that guy , but messing with his house ai n’t one of em .
So right after that scuffle I walked down to Connie ’s , got myself a cup a joe and some biscuits and gravy and enjoyed the rest of the day because there ’s nothing quite like Connie ’s biscuits and gravy .
So I jump in the ’ 64 Chevy pickup I got a steal on however many years ago ( 13 ? 14 ? ) , toss my magnum in the glove box and slam her in reverse then while rolling back shift her back into first and scurry on down the road toward Connie ’s which ’s probably two or three miles down the road from me near the town square , but not quite on it .
Connie slides my biscuits and gravy and home fires down the counter right to me and I dig in quick as a cedar bird snatching up a vole to take home to her babies and Jesus Christ if it ai n’t good .
After she ’s nice and done I down my coffee and mosey into the bathroom , pull the .357 outta the front of my pants , spin her on the trigger guard like Dirty Harry , spin the chamber , snap it closed and like I been doing it all my life raise the barrel to my temple , pull the trigger then just stand there , dumbfounded like a child seeing his first air show , looking into the mirror at the prematurely graying beard I got coming in now because shaving ’s a chore and I just do n’t feel like doing it no more .
Probably a good thing Lady Luck was n’t smiling on me again because I ’d feel awful if old Connie had to clean up that mess of brain and blood left on the dirt - stained ceramic tiles gracing the floor .
So back at the counter Connie ’s daughter pours me another cup a coffee and I sit there and peruse the local paper looking for anything interesting that might be going on tonight : any gigs , any shows , anything like that to keep me occupied in this blooming life I got going here until some jackass taps my shoulder and I turn around and would n’t you know it , Frankie Albers that fool with the roof ’s standing there eyeing me like a coon hound stalking some small game in O’Hannity ’s forest there south a town .
“ Well , Goddamn , look who it is , Frankie Albers ! ”
“ Just Frank , man . ”
“ How ’s the roof , Frankie Albers ?
Doing good ?
Keeping sealed ? ”
“ Would n’t know , moved outta that place years ago , you son of a bitch .
Now how about you reimburse me for the damages I had a fix because you ’re too dumb to fix a roof right . ”
“ Ya old fool .
I fixed that roof nice and good all them years ago , and I can tell you one thing that ’s true as anything , and that ’s that ai n’t no way am I giving you no money for something I did , quite Frankiely , a good job on . ”
“ Man , you gonna pay for that because I ’ll be damned if I let a thieving scoundrel like you and your ilk gip me outta that much cash . ”
“ You know I did just fine , now leave me be for I take your sis back down to the dugout and lay it to her again and embarrass your ass front of the whole town again . ”
Well , Frankie Albers do n’t like that ( and he definitely do n’t like the pun ) and he gives me one of them snarls that creep up when a man do n’t have anything to say anymore or ca n’t think a some good response and he stalks off to God knows where , but not before tossing me the finger as the door ’s slamming behind him .
I just smiled to myself because I ’ll be damned if I ’m gonna let some jerkoff like Frankie Albers bully me in to giving him money I sure as shit do n’t owe him .
Saturday :
Woke up to a brick through my front window , but not with a note attached to let me know
who or why though I have my suspicions , and that ai n’t even the whole of it because right now I got a puddle forming in my living room , and my carpet ’s soaking that water up real nice because a thunderstorm crept up on us outta right field .
Them meteorologists do n’t have a clue what they ’re doing , their job ’s no more skill than my game of chance is .
And son of a bitch , I do n’t like the rain , too depressing ; my life was looking pretty decent : gave a good telling off to that bastard Frankie Albers , had some damn good breakfasts , saw some good music , had some good beer , and the only thing that ai n’t been going the way I woulda liked it is my incorporeal dice game with God , whatever the fuck that means .
You know , I quit believing in that hocus pocus when I was about thirteen .
I ’d be sitting there in church and the preacher would be going on talking about how God is Love and he wants you to be in heaven but if you eat meat on a Friday during Lent then you ’re gonna spend the rest of eternity in some fiery old place where demons ’re gonna torture you .
I ’d wonder , if the devil fell from Heaven and was punished for challenging that God , then why ’s he get to rummage round earth and torture and maim people ?
Do n’t seem like much of a punishment to me .
What ’s more on that , is I ’ve read that book back and forth and can’t find no place where the Devil get thrown outta heaven .
Far as I know that whole thing ’s just made up by some poet hundred ’s a years ago .
All that nonsense just did n’t make sense to me so I left that place and never looked back , though there were times when I was damn near close , but now , right now I ’m putting my faith in this here handgun because that ’s the only thing that ’s remotely real to me .
So , after grabbing a spare window outta my shed and replacing the shattered one I drank my coffee , spun the chamber and once again pressed that mother against the side of my face and squeezed the trigger set the pistol on the kitchen table and read the paper while eating a round a french toast and a couple fried eggs just like my sis made for me when I was in sixth grade and she was about to graduate high school and pop already left and mom , well , her mind was going faster than the wheels on a stock car , smoking up the track making everything all blurry and incoherent with the sound a screeching .
Sunday : I need to get me some dimmers because flipping a light switch on from dead black causes a kinda blur that I can’t explain , but I ’m sure everyone ’s experienced , which ’s why pirates wore eye patches ( so they say ) , but the reason I ’m doing all this light switch flipping ’s cause there ’s something or someone rummaging round in my living room and I can hear em nice and good .
.357 magnum in hand , I stalk out the door into my hallway toward the kitchen cause I can round about whoever ’s creeping round in my living room from the side door .
You can never trust a person to not stalk in your house in these days and age cause there ’s murders out there and rapists and pedophiles just waiting to sneak in your house and kill you in your sleep just because , because people are crazy .
But no matter what people want you to think there ai n’t no more crazies now than there were twenty , thirty , fifty years ago , it ’s just the news and such report on it more ; ai n’t nothing on the news but murder , murder , murder , robbery , puppy riding a tricycle , murder , guns , protests , kidnapping , and that ’s it .
You ai n’t never gonna get nothing happy or real outta them folks and you best not to think about it .
Right when I step in my kitchen , the person who ’s snuck in there ’s walking in too and would n’t you know it , it ’s Frankie Albers , drunk as a baboon .
“ What ’re you doing here , Frankie Albers ? ” but Frankie Albers do n’t say anything , he just lifts his gun up , aimed right at my chest .
“ Frankie Albers , what ’re you doing there , bud . ”
“ Just Frank , and I ai n’t your bud , thief . ”
Frankie Albers walks forwards , gun still positioned right at me , so I grip mine , finger on the trigger ready to fire back at him .
“ Get a grip , Frankie Albers ; c’mon , y’old fool .
C’mon .
You ’re stinking drunk .
C’mon , lower your gun . ”
Frankie Albers mutters something that I can’t pick up , but that gun ’s still held on me so finally I lift mine up too , pointed right back at the old bastard .
“ Got ourself a standoff , do n’t we , Frankie Albers ? ” But Frankie
Albers do n’t say a thing and next thing I know there ’s a spark and I ’m gainst the wall bleeding like a fool .
I lift my gun to put that prick in his place , take him with me to the dirt and I aim best I can with my fading , blurry - ass vision and squeeze the trigger a couple times .
Click .
Click .
“ Fuck ! ” I pull the trigger again .
Click .
Frankie
Albers trains that mother on me again and squeezes the trigger and the hammer of the gun ’s going so slow that there ai n’t no way its gonna give off nough of a spark to get that bullet to lodge itself all snug in my head .
Ain’t no way .

The agreement will protect much of Canada 's wide open rangelands
Timber companies and environment groups have unveiled an agreement aimed at protecting two - thirds of Canada 's vast forests from unsustainable logging .
Over 72 million hectares are included in what will become the world 's largest commercial forest conservation deal .
Logging will be totally banned on some of the land , in the hope of sustaining endangered caribou populations .
Timber companies hope the deal will bring commercial gains , as timber buyers seek higher ethical standards .
The total protected area is about twice the size of Germany , and equals the area of forest lost globally between 1990 and 2005 .
" The importance of this agreement cannot be overstated , " said Avrim Lazar , president and CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada ( FPAC ) .
We 're thrilled that this effort has led to the largest commercial forest conservation plan in history Steve Kallick , Pew Environment Group
" Together we have identified a more intelligent , productive way to manage economic and environmental challenges in the Boreal [ Forest ] that will reassure global buyers of our products ' sustainability . "
The Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement ( CBFA ) brings together FPAC 's 21 member companies and nine environment groups , many of which have fought a bitter battle against what they have sometimes criticised as rapacious logging .
As part of the agreement , those groups have agreed to suspend criticism of the industry and calls for boycotts .
Green excitement
The Pew Environment Group , which has worked for about a decade on trying to " green " Canada 's forestry , said it was " excited " by the agreement .
" We 're thrilled that this effort has led to the largest commercial forest conservation plan in history , which could not have happened without both sides looking beyond their differences , " said Steve Kallick , director of Pew 's International Boreal Conservation Campaign .
Pew notes that the total area covered by the deal is larger than in some agreements currently feted as global leaders , such as the Brazilian Amazon Region Protected Areas project .
Throughout the protected lands - which run right across the country from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts - companies and environment groups are pledging to work together to implement " world - leading forest management and harvesting practices " .
The effects of forest protection on wildlife , particularly caribou , will be monitored ; and timber will be certified as coming from sustainable sources .
Pew believes the agreement could be a template for future forest agreements in other parts of the world , as industry leaders respond to an increasingly environmentally - aware public .
" There is a recognition that this is how forestry will be done in the 21st Century , and there 's a great interest in getting ahead of the rest of the industry , " Mr Kallick told BBC News .
The agreement at present covers companies and environment groups ; both parties are looking now for backing and re-inforcement from governments .
In the Canadian system , that means the national and provincial authorities , and " First Nation " governments of indigenous groups , some of which have already indicated their support .
The best performers had either died , decayed or fractured , leaving behind them a vocabulary of musical ideas , lyrical techniques and subject matter , styles and body languages which had never been given the opportunity to mature but had , instead , been aped by the very world of Showbiz against which they had originally revolted .
And everything else was just the same — a load of oily entrepreneurs with their hair a little longer , their clothes occasionally a little easier on the eyes , their language an eager combination of professional slang and adman quasi-technical .
Bert Christensen's Weird & Different Recipes
Cooking Rats and Mice
Calvin W. Schwabe in his book Unmentionable Cuisine ( Charlottesville , Virginia : University of Virginia Press , 1979 , available from Amazon Books ) , says that North Americans should be using many forms of protein which are routinely consumed in other parts of the world .
The following exerpts are from a section of the book giving recipes for cooking rats and mice .
" Brown rats and roof rats were eaten openly on a large scale in Paris when the city was under siege during the Franco - Prussian War .
Observers likened their taste to both partridges and pork .
And , according to the Larousse Gastronomique , rats are still eaten in some parts of France .
In fact , this recipe appears in that famous tome .
Grilled Rats Bordeaux Style ( Entrecote à la bordelaise ) ( See comment below Alcoholic rats inhabiting wine cellars are skinned and eviscerated , brushed with a thick sauce of olive oil and crushed shallots , and grilled over a fire of broken wine barrels .
What wo n't the French do next ?
In West Africa , however , rats are a major item of diet .
the giant rat ( Cricetomys ) , the cane rat ( Thryonomys ) , the common house mouse , and other species of rats and mice are all eaten .
According to a United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization report , they now comprise of over 50 percent of the locally produced meat eaten in some parts of Ghana .
Between December 1968 and June 1970 , 258,206 pounds of cane - rat meat alone were sold in one market in Accra !
This is a local recipe that shows the South American influence on West African cuisine .
Stewed Cane RatSkin and eviscerate the rat and split it lengthwise .
Fry until brown in a mixture of butter and peanut oil .
Cover with water , add tomatoes or tomato purée , hot red peppers , and salt .
Simmer the rat until tender and serve with rice .
Stuffed Dormice / Ancient RomePrepare a stuffing of dormouse meat or pork , pepper , pine nuts , broth , asafoetida , and some garum ( substitute anchovy paste . )
Stuff the mice and sew them up .
Bake them in an oven on a tile .
Roasted Field Mice ( Raton de campo asado ) / MexicoSkin and eviscerate field mice .
Skewer them and roast over an open fire or coals .
These are probably great as hors d'oeuvres with margaritas or " salty dogs . "
Farley Mowat also gives this innovative arctic explorer 's recipe for souris à la crème .
Mice in Cream ( Souris à la crème ) Skin , gut and wash some fat mice without removing their heads .
Cover them in a pot with ethyl alcohol and marinate 2 hours .
Cut a piece of salt pork or sowbelly into small dice and cook it slowly to extract the fat .
Drain the mice , dredge them thoroughly in a mixture of flour , pepper , and salt , and fry slowly in the rendered fat for about 5 minutes .
Add a cup of alcohol and 6 to 8 cloves , cover and simmer for 15 minutes .
Prepare a cream sauce , transfer the sautéed mice to it , and warm them in it for about 10 minutes before serving .
Sounds like a gourmet 's survival meal to me .
Collected by Bert ChristensenToronto , OntarioSarrois Pierre - Guillaume , Dear Bert Christensen , Interesting websiteNonetheless , after few searchs , I am compelled to respond to information u gave in ur website .
I did n't find any restaurant in Bordeaux or in the Parisian suburb who serve food such as rats .
Very curious about the taste , and the origin of ur information , I was wondering if this sentence was a kind of French baching or if u seriously believe all the things u write .
I sincerely doubt u will currently find any place in France with rats in the menu .
If by any chance I am wrong , I would appreciate that u share the information with me .

Scala vs. F# : Comparing Functional Programming Features
F# and Scala , two relatively recent programming languages , provide most .NET and Java software developers with new functional programming features that are worth understanding and evaluating .
( Read a Short Briefing on Functional Programming for a primer on how functional programming works . )
Scala is a Java - based , general - purpose language that is intended to appeal to both adherents of functional programming as well as devotees of more mainstream imperative and object - oriented programming .
It compiles into Java bytecode and runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) .
While Scala is fundamentally a functional language , it also embodies all the elements of imperative and object - oriented languages , which gives it the promise of introducing functional programming features to a broader programming community .
F# is a general - purpose programming language developed by Microsoft to run as part of .
NET 's Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) .
It is based on another , orthodox functional language , Ocaml .
Microsoft introduced
F# into the .NET platform because of , among other reasons , the increased interest in functional programming and functional programming 's suitability to high - performance computing and parallelism .
Although its syntax is distinctly functional , F# actually is a hybrid functional / imperative / object - oriented language .
Its object - oriented and imperative features are present mostly for compatibility with the .NET platform , but F# 's tripartite nature is also pragmatic -- it allows programmers who use any or all of the three programming paradigms to program exclusively in one or to combine all three .
In this article , I will compare and contrast the functional features and related syntax of F# and Scala .
F# vs. Scala : First Order Functions
Functions in F# and Scala are treated as first order types .
They can be passed in as arguments , returned from other functions , or assigned to a variable .
In this F# code snippet , I first define a function ( increment ) that adds 1 to a passed value , and then I define the function handler , which takes type myfunc and applies 2 to it as a parameter .
Finally , I invoke the function handler with a parameter incremented to it .
The function increment is passed as a regular value , hence the function is being treated as a first order type :
let increment x = x + 1 let handler myfunc = ( myfunc 2 ) printfn " %A " ( handler increment )
Notice the type inference in the example above .
F# will infer that x is an integer because I add 1 to it , and so x will be treated as an integer ( Int ) type .
Here is the same example in Scala :
def increment( x : Int ) = x + 1 def handler ( f: Int => Int ) = f( 2 ) println ( handler ( increment ) )
F# vs. Scala : Lazy Evaluation
F# supports lazy evaluation , but for performance reasons it is not enabled by default .
Instead , F# supports so - called eager evaluation : functions can be marked for lazy evaluation by explicitly labeling them with the keyword lazy and running the program with the Lazy . force option specified .
let lazyMultiply = lazy ( let multiply = 4 * 4 )
Like F# , Scala is not lazy by default , but unlike F# , values -- not functions -- have to be marked with the keyword lazy and therefore evaluated as call - by - need .
def lazyMultiply ( x : => y :) = { lazy val y = x * x }
F# vs. Scala : Lambda Expressions and Currying
Currying is an essential feature of functional programming that allows for the partial application of functions and functional composition .
F# supports currying .
Here is an example of the curried function add in F# :
Declaration :
val add : int -> int -> int
Implementation :
let add = ( fun x -> ( fun y -> x + y ) )
In Scala , the curried function add looks like this :
def add( x : Int ) (y : Int ) = x + y
F# vs. Scala : Lambda Expressions
F# also supports Lambda expressions ( anonymous functions ) .
In F# , lambda expressions are declared with the keyword fun .
In the example below ( adopted from F# documentation ) , an anonymous function is applied to a list of numbers to increment each number in the list and return a new , incremented list :
let list = List.map ( fun i -> i + 1 ) [ 1 ; 2;3 ] printfn " % A " list
Lambda expressions in Scala are defined in a very succinct fashion .
This is how you would increment a function with a Lambda expression ( x= > x+1 ) on a list of numbers ( 1,2,3 ) in Scala :
val list = List ( 1,2,3 ) .map ( x => x + 1 ) println ( list )
F# vs. Scala : Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is a powerful feature of functional programming languages that allows blocks of code within the function to be ' activated ' depending on the type of a value or an expression .
( Think of pattern matching as a more powerful variation of the case statement . )
In F# , the vertical line character ( | ) is used to denote a case selector for the function match specification .
Here is an F# version of a pattern - matched Fibonacci number function :
let rec fib n = match n with | 0 -> 0 | 1 -> 1 | 2 -> 1 | n -> fib ( n - 2 ) + fib ( n - 1 )
Like F# , Scala supports pattern matching on functions .
Here is the example of a Fibonacci number calculation in Scala .
Notice that Scala uses the keyword case :
def fib ( n : Int ) : Int = n match { case 0 => 0 case 1 => 1 case _ => fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) }

Jeff Krupman ( aka PizzaHacker ) is doing some very cool things in the pizza world .
His oven , dubbed the PizzaForge ( formerly called the FrankenWeber ) is a true wood - fired pizza cooker that is ingeniously built onto a ubiquitous Weber 22.5 ″ grill .
Even better than having designed a compact oven that can hang with the best of them , he ’s sharing his creation by hitting the streets and selling his pies all over San Francisco .
And , he ’s fine - tuning the design and will be selling it commercially very soon .
Totally awesome .
I first heard of Jeff in early 2010 when a few big blogs posted about his oven and pizzas ( Make blog ; Lifehacker ) .
After exchanging emails and a quick meetup in LA a couple months ago , I got the chance to test Jeff ’s pizza at an art event last Friday while visiting San Francisco .
My excitement compounded when he asked if I ’d like to be on oven duty for the night , as his regular helper was unavailable .
Three hours of pizza making in San Francisco ?
A dream !
I wish every Friday could be like that .
The pizzas cooked better than any I ’ve ever made before , besting the one I made in the temporary oven last year .
You just ca n’t beat the hot temperatures of burning wood and the convection of the shallow dome .
90 seconds per pizza , just like the best pizzerias do it .
Jeff only uses top - grade ingredients as well , and the art gallery patrons were all quick to purchase and devour as many pies as he could make .
The three hours passed by in a blink of an eye .
Jeff warned me that by the end of the night my mind would be swirling with thoughts , ideas , redesigns – he was right .
He ’s onto something phenomenal and his latest version of the oven shows some serious progress from the original version , and the next iteration should have some nice improvements that he described to me .
I ’ve got a list of ideas I ’d like to see him add to it too .
One of my other discoveries was the excellence of the perforated pizza peel that Jeff uses to place the pizzas in the oven .
Anodized aluminum construction , with slotted perforations that help the dough resist sticking ( a problem that all pizza makers fear ) and a knife - blade edge for ease of getting the dough on and off .
The peels are expensive , and worth it .
I ’m going to be drilling my standard - issue metal peel to attempt a DIY version and will report back with results .
Wow , naked + batman + tattoo / body painting = some pretty " out - there " art ...
Korean artist Kim Joon has been fascinated with tattoo culture ever since his days in the military as a young man .
Since , he has taken his obsession into the fine arts realm , treating the human body like a blank canvas .
Interestingly , his images are not created as one might expect .
No physical painting of the models is actually involved .
Joon 's process via Art Rad Asia :
" First he uses 3 - D animation software to create the body or bodies he wants , and he constructs them .
Then after building the 3 dimensional body , he works to get the image he really desires .
Then , he grafts on the type of skin he desires — it could be animal skin , artificial skin , human skin .
It could be skin of a leather bag or skin of a shoe .
Any kind of texture - it could be a hard baseball .
He uses this surface skin and grafts it onto the 3 dimensional image he created .
This computer program is called 3 - D Studio Max .
It is the program used to create Shrek and other 3D animation films . "
To learn more about his work , check out the rest of Art Rad Asia 's interview with the artist .

A worm named Schmidtea mediterranea has the unique ability to regenerate not just its body , but also its head and brain .
Now , scientists studying the worm have discovered one of the genes that allows it to accomplish this amazing feat .
The gene , called " smed- prep , " regulates the location and structure of the flatworm 's brain during regeneration .
When the gene is absent , the worm forms a stump with random junk from other parts of its body , but no brain .
When it 's expressed in other areas of the body , heads can be made to sprout from anywhere .
" One of the main goals in the lab was to understand the mechanisms that allowed this worm to regenerate its head , brain and sensory organs , " said molecular biologist Aziz Aboobaker of the University of Nottingham , lead author of the paper published in PLoS Genetics April 22 .
" It 's a big problem because you have to make this all from the old tissue .
The cells have to mobilize , migrate to the right place and differentiate . "
The S. med worm is small , but has complex organs and a primitive bilateral brain .
Not only can it regenerate its head and brain , but each piece you cut off ( down to about 1 millimeter ) can re-grow into a complete organism .
The worm can do this because about 25 percent of its cells are stem cells , which can differentiate into any cell type .
To find the gene , Aboobaker scanned the worm 's genome looking for developmental genes .
After testing several other genes , Aboobaker 's team stumbled upon smed - prep , whose expression was concentrated in the worm 's head region .
To see how the gene affected the worm 's ability to regenerate , they tricked the cell into destroying any messenger RNA or protein made from it , using interfering RNA .
The worms who had their gene expression cut down were unable to regenerate their brains after amputation , but other aspects of the regeneration process were unaffected .
" That 's the interesting thing , we have n't killed them off , they are still healthy , " Aboobaker said .
" They just ca n't navigate or find food . "
Humans have a gene that is similar in biochemical structure and genetic code to smed - prep , but its function in humans is unknown .
Related genes in other vertebrates , like mice and zebrafish , are expressed in the brain during embryo formation .
" The most interesting aspect of this paper is its evolutionary perspective , " said cell biologist Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado , of the University of Utah , because C. elegans ( a commonly studied worm ) and drosophila ( the fruitfly ) do not appear to have evolved a directly corresponding gene .
Alvarado previously discovered two other genes involved with S. med 's head regeneration process .
The worm and its properties can teach us more about human health , because it 's a good model system to learn about stem cells , regeneration and aging , said Aboobaker .
" You ca n't just make neurons from stem cells , then insert them into your brain , because you have no idea what would happen , " he said .
" If you ask someone to make you a brain from a ball of tissue , they wo n't be able to , because we do n't know how .
But the worm does . "
The team 's next step is to determine what other genes are regulated when smed - prep is turned on and off .
" Finding [ smed - prep ] means you can find which genes do n't turn on properly when it is knocked down , " Aboobaker said .
" Those are the genes that must be involved in this network that makes the brain . "

The jury in the Brisbane manslaughter trial for former Bundaberg - based surgeon Jayant Patel has retired to consider its verdict .
They have been sequestered for the night and will resume their deliberations tomorrow morning .
Patel , 60 , had pleaded not guilty to unlawfully killing Mervyn Morris , 75 , Gerry Kemps , 77 , and James Phillips , 46 , and to causing grievous bodily harm to Ian Rodney Vowles , 62 .
Prosecutors told the Supreme Court that Patel was criminally negligent when he performed two oesophagectomies and two bowel operations on four men at the Bundaberg Hospital in 2003 and 2004 .
Justice John Byrne reminded the jury of the Crown 's case that Patel was a bad surgeon motivated by ego and suffering from a lack of insight about his limitations .
The prosecution says Patel 's operations were well below the standard of a competent surgeon and Patel had ignored the hospital 's limitations to care for his patients .
Justice Byrne also said Patel 's lawyers had argued Patel possessed the necessary skills to operate and deal with post - operative complications .
He reminded the jury prosecutors say Patel ignored surgical restrictions imposed on him by US medical authorities and launched into major operations at Bundaberg seven weeks after he arrived in 2003 .
Justice Byrne also reminded the jury of the defence 's warning to ignore the adverse publicity that had swirled around Patel when deciding its verdicts .

{ March 8 , 2010} RDA : why it wo n’t work
With the release of RDA , people on every blog and listserv and Twitter feed are debating its merits .
But I ’ll tell you right now : RDA is not going to work .
Why ?
1 . It ’s not easy .
2 . It ’s not free .
You can debate it up , down and sideways , but honestly , it ’s as simple as that .
Clay Shirky ( in Here Comes Everybody ) says , “ When an activity becomes more expensive , either in direct costs or increased hassle , people do less of it . ”
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again : cataloging is hard .
When it ’s hard to do things right , people will get it wrong .
Through no fault of their own .
Who can blame the cataloger who applies subject headings incorrectly when there are literally 4 volumes of instructions , many of which have different rules and guidelines for each different subject ?
Who can blame someone for misremembering if a colon or a semi-colon precedes the 300b field ?
Who can blame a person for entering the title of a work in title case , rather than lower case ( except for the first word and proper nouns ) , especially when the former is a national community standard taught in elementary education .
And who can blame someone for not following these outdated standards because technology makes them no longer applicable or necessary ?
This needs to change .
It ’s impacting our ability to offer quality services and access to materials .
We need to make it easy to do things well .
I understand how complicated and complex some aspects of cataloging can be .
But I do n’t think “ complex ” necessarily has to equal “ difficult . ”
I think there are ways we can structure software and cataloging interfaces to work for us rather than against us .
When I first heard of RDA and it ’s requisite electronic interface , I had envisioned it to be something along the lines of a “ choose your own adventure , ” or an electronic flow chart , where answering questions about the resource in hand would lead to the complete , automated creation of a catalog record .
I understand the use of consistency and standards , and how previously this was achievable solely through human application .
But that ’s no longer the case–many of these outdated standards can be automated , and in turn , more consistent than applications prone to human error .
And if the profession values such standards , and truly wants everyone and every library to adhere to and meet those standards in order to create more interoperability , those standards not only ned to be easy to implement , they need to be freely accessible .
Many librarians are balking at the cost of implementing RDA , I think rightfully so , although not for the same reasons .
I ’m not bitching about it because it ’s unaffordable for smaller libraries , or because it ’s a subscription rather than a one - time printed book cost ( although I think those are valid points ) .
I ’m bitching because putting a dollar amount on something , now matter how low it is , will stop people from using something , especially if there ’s a free alternative .
In this case , I see the free alternative as ‘ ignoring rules altogether and / or making you your own standards . ’
Requiring a price makes adhering to standards–a key value - added service of libraries and librarians –inaccessible .
Which is pretty ironic , considering that libraries are supposed to be all about access .
We ’re all proactive about offering access to our patrons , but we ca n’t extend that same philosophy to ourselves , to help us do a better job ??
The more depth and complexity in cataloging standards , the more we need to make it as easy as possible for catalogers to apply these standards .
More work will get done ( and done correctly ! ) , more tasks delegated , turn - around times improved , access increased–all of which benefit not only the cataloger and other library staff , but in turn the patron , which is ultimately what it ’s all about .
Help us , ALA .
Give us better , faster , easier , more efficient ways to do our jobs so that we can , in turn , make our patron ’s information experiences better , faster , and more efficient .
If you ca n’t or wo n’t help us , who will ?
A witness in a murder case was beaten up after Hennepin County jailers mistakenly placed him in the same holding cell as the man he ’d implicated .
Murder suspect Jonathan Nicholas “ Thirsty ” Turner was charged Thursday with tampering with a witness , a first - degree felony .
That charge is atop first - degree murder charges he faces in two 2003 shootings .
Rondah Kinchlow , spokeswoman for the Hennepin County attorney ’s office , said prosecutors “ always ” notify the jail when two prisoners should n’t be put together .
But sheriff ’s office spokeswoman Lisa Kiava said that did n’t happen .
“ Jail staff had no information that these two inmates should have been kept separate , ” she said .
“ We do have policy and practice in place that when we receive information that inmates should be kept separately , we do so . ”
The criminal complaint against Turner , 24 , does not name the beaten man and does not say why he was in jail , how he wound up in the same cell as Turner or how bad his injuries were .
Jailers stopped the beating within minutes .
An affidavit by Hennepin County sheriff ’s Detective Bernie Bogenreif said the incident occurred March 4 when Turner was taken to a holding cell to await a morning court hearing .
He wrote that the two were mistakenly placed in the same cell after the witness had provided a taped statement implicating Turner in the killings .
The detective wrote that Turner had seen the state ’s evidence against him and knew of the taped statement .
Turner faces a June trial on two counts of first - degree murder in the August 2003 killing of Javon Spencer , 19 , of Minnetonka .
Prosecutors say Spencer was a casualty of a turf war to decide which gang could sell drugs in a corner of the Phillips neighborhood .
Turner was convicted of the murder in November and sentenced to life plus five years .
But in February , a judge threw out the conviction after both prosecutors and defense attorneys said one of the state ’s trial witnesses actually was in jail when he claimed to have seen Turner shoot Spencer .
Hennepin County prosecutors re-indicted Turner in the Spencer case .
He also faces charges of first - degree murder in the July 2003 shooting death of Marcus Julius Dortch , 24 , of Minneapolis .
Dortch was shot several times in the back as he fled two men with guns .
One witness told police that as the wounded Dortch lay on the ground , Turner stood over him and continued to pull the trigger of his pistol , even though the gun was empty .
Turner was scheduled for an 8 a.m. conference in the Spencer killing March 4 , and that ’s when he was placed in the cell with the witness .
Bogenreif wrote that a surveillance tape showed the attack .
The witness told Bogenreif that Turner had confronted him about “ jumping on his case ” as well as for his association with another witness who testified at Turner ’s trial .
That man , known by the nickname “ Lemon , ” did n’t tell deputies what had happened but told his attorney once he got to court .
Bogenreif wrote that the account was corroborated by several other prisoners in the holding cell at the time of the attack .
Investigators also seized documents from Turner ’s cell , and the detective wrote that “ in those documents , the defendant states : ‘ I just hit Lemon in his mouth for making a statement on me .
That ’s why I ’m in the hole right now .
I tried my best not to do it , but he betrayed me .
I just could n’t stand it .
He sat there and lied to me and tried to put it on his kids .
It was crazy . ’ ”
The detective said they found other documents Turner allegedly wrote in which he “ attempts to script testimony of other possible witnesses in advance of his murder trial . ”

Prediction : " You 'll be able to carry the wallet PC in your pocket or purse .
It will display messages and schedules and also let you read or send electronic mail and faxes , monitor weather and stock reports , play both simple and sophisticated games , browse information if you 're bored , or choose from among thousands of easy - to - call up photos of your kids . "
Verdict : Hit. Gates 's wallet PC is more or less today 's mobile smartphone with voice capability added .
Wireless Networks
Prediction : " The wireless networks of the future will be faster , but unless there is a major breakthrough , wired networks will have a far greater bandwidth .
Mobile devices will be able to send and receive messages , but it will be expensive and unusual to use them to receive an individual video stream . "
Verdict : Miss .
Today , receiving a wireless video stream is neither expensive nor unusual ; in fact , it 's so commonplace that most people do n't give it a second thought .
Gates failed to anticipate that wireless would become cheaper and faster , but his chief mistake was a common but flawed assumption among techno - futurists : that new technology is adopted chiefly on the basis of technological superiority rather than social factors .
Even though most wired networks still have greater bandwidth than wireless nets , that 's trumped by the tremendous social utility of wireless , allowing information to be accessed anytime , anyplace .
Social Networking
Prediction : " The ( information ) highway will not only make it easier to keep up with distant friends , it will also enable us to find new companions .
Friendships formed across the network will lead naturally to getting together in person . "
Verdict : Hit and Miss .
One of the killer apps of the information highway has turned out to be social networking .
Facebook has more than 400 million registered users worldwide and countless other social networks are creating new connections among people .
But friendships formed online do n't regularly lead to face - to - face meetings .
Far more common is the user with 250 Facebook friends , most of whom he rarely , if ever , sees in person .
Online Shopping
Prediction : " Because the information highway will carry video , you 'll often be able to see exactly what you 've ordered .
... you wo n't have to wonder whether the flowers you ordered for your mother by telephone were really as stunning as you 'd hoped .
You 'll be able to watch the florist arrange the bouquet , change your mind if you want , and replace wilting roses with fresh anemones . "
Verdict : Miss .
Gates was right that the information highway would carry video , but he completely misread the social and economic factors that would shape its use in online commerce .
How on earth would a harried florist find the time to hold a videoconference with every customer who orders flowers for Mother 's Day ?
What company would absorb the colossal expense of having orders changed at the last second according to customers ' shifting whims ?
Gates 's vision of online shopping has turned out to be a lot like past predictions about personal jet packs and moving sidewalks : a future that 's technologically possible but socially and economically impractical .
It 's not nearly as weird as some stuff we 've seen , but this particular sequence offers a rare glimpse into the heat - of - the - moment decision making that precedes an amusing Street View snapshot .
As Hemingway said , true courage is grace under pressure .

Most societies that practise circumcision of boys as a religious or customary rite also practice circumcision of girls or women , also known as female genital mutilation or female genital cutting .
Like its male counterpart , circumcision of females has two histories .
First it is a ritual or customary practice among tribal societies ( mostly in Africa ) and some Islamic communities .
Secondly it is a medical intervention , justified by Victorian ( and , in the USA , some twentieth century ) doctors in exactly the same way as they rationalised circumcision of boys : to deter masturbation , to treat obscure nervous disorders such as hysteria , neurasthenia and epilepsy , and thereby to promote health .
MGM and FGM
Given the similarities between the male and female genitals , the nature of the surgery and the justifications offered , it is surprising that male and female circumcision enjoy such strikingly different reputations , at least in Anglophone societies : the first , a mild and harmless adjustment which should be tolerated , if not actively promoted ; the second , a cruel abomination which must be stopped by law , no matter how culturally significant to its practitioners .
If you call circumcision of boys male genital mutilation , you are accused of emotionalism ; if you fail to call circumcision of women or girls female genital mutilation you are accused of trivialising the offence .
While the United Nations , Amnesty International and other international agencies spend millions on programs to eradicate FGM , they have never uttered a word against circumcision of boys .
It might be thought that the reason for this double standard lies in the greater physical severity of female circumcision , but this is to confuse cause with effect .
On the contrary , it is the tolerant or positive attitude towards male circumcision and the rarity of female circumcision in western societies which promote the illusion that the operation is necessarily more sexually disabling , and without benefit to health , when performed on girls or women .
It is , of course , also true that the term female circumcision is vague , referring to any one or more of a number of surgical procedures .
These have been defined by the World Health Organisation as follows :
Female Genital Mutilation comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of female external genitalia and / or injury to the female genital organs for cultural or any other non-therapeutic reason .
Classification
Excision of the prepuce with or without excision of part or all of the clitoris Type
Excision of the clitoris together with partial or total excision of the labia minora Type
Excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching / narrowing of the vaginal opening ( infibulation )
Unclassified ( but may include ) :
pricking , piercing or incision of the clitoris and / or labia ;
stretching of the clitoris and / or labia ;
cauterization by burning of the clitoris and surrounding tissue ;
introcision ; scraping ( angurya cuts ) or cutting ( gishri cuts ) of the vagina or surrounding tissue ;
introduction of corrosive substances or herbs into the vagina ;
any other procedure that falls under the definition of female genital mutilation given above .
Female Genital Mutilation : Report of a WHO Technical Working Group , Geneva , July 1995 .
( World Health Organization : Geneva , 1996 )
The severity of female circumcision depends on which of these operations are performed ( as well as how roughly ) , and it is true that the most extreme forms ( involving the amputation of the external genitalia , with or without infibulation ) are significantly worse than even the most radical foreskin amputation .
But it should be remembered that the most extreme forms of FGM are rare , and that male circumcision in general is far more common on a world scale than female : about 13 million boys , compared with two million girls annually . [ 1 ]
On top of this , it should be appreciated that the effects of male circumcision are also highly unpredictable , depending on how much penile tissue is removed , on the skill of the surgeon , on the precise configuration of penile blood vessels and nerve networks , and on the eventual size attained by the penis at puberty and maturity .
The more tissue excised , the greater the damage to the penis , the greater the effect on sexual functioning and capability ; the same quantity of tissue lost will be worse in cases where the penis is programmed to grow larger in maturity , or where the location of blood vessels and nerves ( always variable ) means that important connections are severed .
Because the slack tissue is needed to accommodate the enlarged penis when tumescent , a really severe circumcision will make erections painful or even impossible . [ 2 ]
Further discussion of classification of male and female genital mutilation
Further discusson of this issue at Hstory of Circumcision .
Given the respective numbers of victims involved and the fact that some circumcisions are worse than some instances of FGM , there is no justification for perpetuating the gender discrimination which has characterised discussion of these issues .
Indeed , a female victim of circumcision during a " holy war " by Islamic extremists in Indonesia recently commented afterwards that what was done to the men was worse than what the women suffered : " I know the men suffered more than us women .
The circumcision hurt them more that it did to us because their scars could not heal fast .
Several of the men I knew got serious infections after suffering from severe bleeding . "
( See Christina 's story . )
To compare female and male circumcision is not to trivialize the enormity of the first , as some feminists seem to fear , but to recognise that the physical and moral similarities between the two are very real .
( See the insightful analysis by R. Charli Carpenter . )
Since many of them come from countries where male circumcision is tolerated or even the norm , such as the USA , campaigners against FGM are inclined to stress how much worse it is than male circumcision , and in the process they tend to excuse or even affirm the latter .
Although they do not realise it , in this manoeuvre they are treading directly in the footsteps of the opponents of Isaac Baker Brown , the mid-Victorian exponent of clitoridectomy as a cure for masturbation and nervous complaints .
They could not disagree with Brown that masturbation was an evil that had to be stamped out ; indeed , the man who brought him down actually wrote : " If the habit [ masturbation ] could be overcome , if the mind could be restored to its purity by any mutilation of the person , one would feel that no penalty would be too great to pay for such a boon . "
Nor did they question the emerging consensus that circumcision of boys was desirable for reasons of health and morality .
They thus found it necessary to quarantine the case against clitoridectomy from the case for circumcision , playing up the harm of the former while minimising the impact of the latter ; the result was a double standard on genital alteration that has endured to this day .
( See the editorial , Clitoridectomy and medical ethics . )
Where does female circumcision occur ?
Various forms of female genital cutting are common in the Middle East , northern and western Africa , and among Muslim communities in Malayasia and Indonesia .
In Africa , the operations are usually performed as part of adult initiation rites among tribal groups that also practise circumcision of boys for the same reason .
There is some debate as to which came first , but one thing is pretty clear : there are some tribal and religious groups that practise male circumcision but not female , but none that practise female circumcision but not male .
All the groupings that practise female circumcision also practise male circumcision .
The following map shows the distribution of female genital cutting in Africa today - generally the parts of Arica closest to and most influenced by the Arab and Muslim cultures of the Middle East .
Anthropological explanations
Unlike male circumcision , which was familiar from Jewish practice , female circumcision was an exotic custom about which Europeans knew very little until the explorations of the eighteenth century .
Because the phenomenon was first studied by sceptical anthropologists and naturalists who had little regard for religion , there was no attempt to explain female circumcision in religious terms as a divine command or a ritual requirement ; on the contrary , from the very first , explanations for such a bizarre and horrific mutilation were sought in materialist terms , particularly in relation to some possible advantage to human health in peculiar physical environments .
The most popular explanation was that the hot climate of Egypt and Africa caused the labia and clitoris to grow to an inordinate length , thus necessitating their reduction or removal in order to permit intercourse .
While the French traveller C.S. Sonnini explained male circumcision in Egypt purely as an initiation into the Mahometan religion , he accounted for the female operation in terms of the hypertrophy of the parts allegedly common in hot regions , and the consequent need to avoid both reproductive difficulties and the disgust of the husband . [ 3 ]
The great French naturalist Georges - Louis de Buffon , in his Natural History , also offered the climatic explanation for male circumcision among the Jews and Arabs : in the heat of the desert the foreskin grew so long that it hindered procreation . [ 4 ]
Rumours about the " Hottentot apron " , the supposedly hypertrophic labia found among " Hottentot " women , fed these speculations , which were further stimulated by the public exhibition of one unfortunate native in London and Paris in 1810 . [ 5 ]
Variants of these stories filtered through the nineteenth century medical world and often turned up as " well known facts " in journal articles .
Other explanations for female circumcision stressed protection against disease or parasites , and one reported by John Davenport cited the necessity to prevent the accumulation of secretions and smegma :
Cleanliness has rendered it necessary .
In some climates the nymphae , from their great length , become inconvenient , for in the vicinity of the clitoris of women is collected an acrid and stimulating humour called smegma ( from its resemblance to soap ) , and this secretion is partly covered by the nymphae .
This white saponaceous and almost foetid substance is one of the most powerful stimuli of the sexual organ .
Thus , such persons as observe great cleanliness are generally less given to venery than those who are negligent in this respect .
In cold or even temperate regions this secretion becomes less abundant , and , as it is consequently less active in its effects , the sexual organs are more quiescent than in southern regions . [ 6 ]
Similar comments were made by Dr Kellogg in the 1880s .
In some countries females are also circumcised by removal of the nymphae [ i.e. the labia ] .
The object is the same as that of circumcision in the male .
The same evils result from inattention to personal cleanliness , and the same measure of prevention , daily cleansing , is necessitated by a similar secretion .
Local cleanliness is neglected by both sexes .
Daily washing should begin with infancy , and continue through life , and will prevent much disease . [ 7 ]
It is an interesting comment on changed attitude to both cleanliness and sexuality that in the late twentieth century the smell of smegma was regarded not as a stimulant , but as a sexual turn - off , at least by such luminaries as Morris Fishbein and David Reuben - who seem , however , to be so obsessed with imaginary male smells that they have completely forgotten that uncircumcised women also produce smegma .
Off course , the mere possibility of the existence of smegma in males has been the basis of most justifications for routine circumcision , from Lallemand and William Acton to Gerald Weiss and Brian Morris .
There is now a vast literature and constant controversy over the history and current practice of female genital cutting ( which now seems to be the preferred term ) .
What most anthropological sources agree on is that the cultural significance of female circumcision is usually the same as for male : it represents the transition from girlhood to womanhood , and the entry into a new set of adult rights and responsibilities , the most important of which relate to sexual relations , marriage and child - bearing .
There is also wide agreement that circumcision was introduced to males first and only later extended to females , often in an attenuated form . [ 8 ]
As the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics put in 1910 , female circumcision " evolved much later than male circumcision " , of which it was " but a pale shadow " ; Ernest Crawley ( in The mystic rose , p. 138 , 309 ) " is doubtless right in tracing it to the same origin as the analogous operation in the male " . [ 9 ]
It is a striking fact that while there are cultures which practise male but not female circumcision ( most notably the Jewish ) , there are no societies which practise female but not male circumcision .
The medical or health case
Although the health advantages of or medical justifications for clitoridectomy were similar to those offered for male circumcision ( cleanliness , deterrence of masturbation , control of nervous diseases ) the practice remained rare in Britain and never became a routine precaution .
Doctors generally held that women 's lower sex drive meant they were less given to self abuse than males , and thus that drastic surgery was rarely necessary .
There are occasional reports of masturbating girls being subjected to involuntary clitoridectomy , but it was only in the late 1850s that a few doctors started to apply to women the theories of nervous disease which already legitimised circumcision in boys .
Britain
The most famous of these was the prominent London obstetrician , Isaac Baker Brown , who specialised in the surgical treatment of disorders such as epilepsy , catalepsy and hysteria induced by " irritation of the pudic nerve " ( that is , masturbation ) .
Although he attracted considerable interest at first , his procedures fell rapidly into disfavour , and he was expelled from the London Obstetrical Society in 1867 .
While his critics condemned clitoridectomy as a " questionable , compromising , unpublishable mutilation " which would ruin the women 's sex lives , leave them permanently maimed and cast an indelible slur on their honour , Brown defended himself by claiming that masturbation caused hysteria , epilepsy , mania , insanity and death , and argued that clitoridectomy was no more mutilating than male circumcision , as proved by the subsequent pregnancy of several of his patients .
As he wrote in reply to his attackers :
Clitoridectomy is neither more nor less than circumcision of the female ; and as certainly as that no man who has been circumcised has been injured in his natural functions , so it is equally certain that no woman who has undergone the operation ... has lost one particle of the natural function of her organs . [ 10 ]
His critics did not dissent from the proposition that masturbation could provoke the ills he mentioned , but they insisted that the practice was so rare in women that radical interventions of this kind were not necessary .
Brown 's disgrace put a stop to clitoridectomy in Britain , and there are no reliable reports of its performance after the 1860s .
Looking back on the controversy , his principal antagonist , Charles West , commented that " all right - minded men " were compelled to reject both the operation and its leading proponent , but that " happily we need not now dwell further on the subject , for all practitioners are agreed that the only indication for removal of the clitoris is furnished by the disease of the organ itself " .
It was a long time before doctors reached the same conclusion about the foreskin .
Since the debate had been fought largely on the question as to whether the clitoris was the functional equivalent of the foreskin , and thus whether clitoridectomy was the female version of circumcision ( as Brown insisted and his opponents denied ) , the effect of the negative decision on these points was to clear the way for circumcision of boys at the same time as it protected the genitals of women .
The outcome has been the tenacious double standard on genital mutilation which still dominates discussion of this subject .
Female circumcision in the USA
Clitoridectomy and other circumcision - like operation on girls and women had a longer career in United States , where doctors deplored Baker Brown 's disgrace and The Medical Record defended him with the question " What now will be the chance for recovery for the poor epileptic female with a clitoris ? " [ 11 ]
There was also a vigorous attempt to apply the theories of Lewis Sayre - that many nervous diseases were caused by a tight or non-retractable foreskin - to women , and a number of doctors urged that girls also should have their clitoral hoods excised if there was any suspicion of adhesions of the accumulation of " secretions " .
In 1892 another defender of Brown ( he was " almost on the right track " ) , Dr Robert Morris , went so far as to suggest that , since 80 per cent of American women suffered from preputial adhesions , all schoolgirls should be inspected to ensure that proper separation between prepuce and clitoris had occurred .
He was apparently confident that most of the girls would require surgery , and added : " The separation of adhesive prepuces in young unmarried women should be done by female physicians anyway , and such physicians can be abundantly occupied with this sort of work " . [ 12 ]
It was a valiant effort to expand the market for medical services , and he must have been disappointed that his suggestions were not more widely taken up .
Even so , articles on the virtues of female circumcision continued to appear sporadically in American medical journals until the 1960s , and there are regular reports of girls or women being subjected to various procedures , particularly the shortening of their labia or clitoris when parents or a husband judged them " too long " [ 13 ] .
As with circumcision of boys , the medical case for female circumcision has always contained a strong element of cultural or aesthetic preference .

News about female circumcision ( Female Genital Mutilation )
Detroit , Michigan : United States law against FGM ruled to be unconstitutional
A Federal judge in Detroit , Michigan , has ruled that the Federal United States law criminalising any form of female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is unconstitutional .
The case arose when Federal law enforcement officials prosecuted members of an Islamic sect , the Dawoodi Bohra , for performing ritual cutting on the genitals of young girls .
The defendants did not deny that the cutting took place , but contended that it was allowable under the principle of religious freedom , and further that the law prohibiting it was not constitutionally valid .
It is significant that the judge did not make any ruling on the principal claims of the defendants , that the cutting was not mutilation but a harmless nick or scraping , and that it was required by their religion and permitted as an instance of religious freedom .
The judgement was strictly on the constitutional and jurisdictional grounds that the US Constitution did not give Congress the power to legislate on this matter ( essentially an instance of criminal assault ) and thus that the law was ultra vires .
The law was based on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce ; but as the judge remarked , " There is nothing economic or commercial about FGM , As despicable as this practice may be , it is essentially a criminal assault " - and thus a matter for State law .

FGM prosecution in USA risks accusations of hypocrisy and double standards
The prosecution of four members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam living in Michigan , USA , for performing female genital mutilation , raises ticklish questions of multiculturalism , religious freedom , the scope of individual rights , parental power over children and the concept of harm .
Analysing the issues involved in this , the first prosecution under US FGM legislation , Brian Earp warns that the case risks accusations of bias against both Muslims and boys .
This is because the mode of genital cutting employed by the Dawoodis is very slight , reportedly nothing more than a small nick to the genitals , causing little permanent harm .
This is in contrast to the mode of cutting ( i.e. circumcision ) employed by both Jewish people and many other American parents on boys is far more extensive , risky and damaging .
The inconsistency in the law - prohibiting female genital cutting while permitting and even encouraging circumcision of boys - is usually justified on the basis that FGM is always more damaging and , in contrast with circumcision , confers no health benefits .
Earp warns , however , that this would be dangerous line for the prosecution for three reasons : first because , in this case , the damage inflicted by the Dawoodi rite is far less damaging than routine circumcision of boys ; secondly because the health benefits of routine circumcision of boys are contested and increasingly viewed as insufficient to outweigh the risks and harms ; and thirdly because the argument is an invitation to those who support or practise FGM for cultural / religious reasons to discover health benefits - as some advocates of the operation are already doing .
But , he points out , most people who oppose FGM do so because they regard it as a violation of the human rights of the child , and would still oppose it even if it did confer health benefits .
If genital cutting is a violation of the human rights of girls , however , it must also be a violation of the human rights of boys : as Earp , discussing the best means to protect children from harm , concludes : “ My own preference is for debate and dialogue , not bans and vilification .
But whatever approach one takes , it is time to move beyond the tired ( and false ) dichotomies of male versus female , religion versus culture , and health benefits versus no health benefits .
The focus for critics of genital cutting going forward , I contend , should be on children versus adults — that is , on bodily autonomy and informed consent . ”
In Australia , two members of the same Islamic sect were convicted of FGM on two young girls in March 2016 and sentenced to gaol terms .
In this case the judge found no significant physical injury had been inflicted on either child but there were “ likely to be some adverse psychological effects ” .

Does Female Genital Mutilation Have Health Benefits ?
The Problem with Medicalizing Morality .

Female genital mutilation and male circumcision :
The real issues are
bodily integrity and personal autonomy
The June issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal includes a special feature on the ethics of female genital mutilation and male circumcision .
The lead or “ target ” article by Brian Earp is accompanied by commentaries from other leading scholars in the field , including anthropologist Richard Schweder .
Earp argues that the criteria conventionally used to distinguish female from male genital cutting - degree of harm , prospect of health benefit , sexism - cannot be maintained , and that there are many similarities between the rationale , procedure and outcomes of the two sorts of surgeries .
Earp argues that the real issues in this debate do not hinge on the sex of the subject , but are the human rights and best interests of the child , whether male or female .
Abstract
The spectrum of practices termed “ Female Genital Mutilation ” ( or FGM ) by the World Health Organization is sometimes held up as a counter example to moral relativism .
Those who advance this line of thought suggest the practices are so harmful in terms of their physical and emotional consequences , as well as so problematic in terms of their sexist or oppressive implications , that they provide sufﬁcient , rational grounds for the assertion of a universal moral claim — namely , that all forms of FGM are wrong , regardless of the cultural context .
However , others point to cultural bias and moral double standards on the part of those who espouse this argument , and have begun to question the received interpretation of the relevant empirical data on FGM as well .
In this article I assess the merits of these competing perspectives .
I argue that each of them involves valid moral concerns that should be taken seriously in order to move the discussion forward .
In doing so , I draw on the biomedical “ enhancement ” literature in order to develop a novel ethical framework for evaluating FGM ( and related interventions — such as female genital “ cosmetic ” surgery and non-therapeutic male circumcision ) that takes into account the genuine harms that are at stake in these procedures , but which does not suffer from being based on cultural or moral double standards .

Commentaries
In his commentary , Robert Darby emphasises that both FGM and male circumcision present a range of overlapping surgical outcomes and that condemning one while ignoring or promoting the other represents a glaring instance of discrimination against boys .
The first paragraph reads :
In his detailed and comprehensive analysis , Brian D. Earp shows clearly that prevailing discourses on female genital cutting ( FGC ) have sought to quarantine the practice from male genital cutting ( MGC ) , and further demonstrates that none of the various features that are supposed to fully distinguish one set of procedures from the other can logically hold water .
The fundamental problem seems to be that the voluntary and ofﬁcial bodies campaigning against FGC , and especially the United Nations and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , show unjustiﬁed discrimination and hence inconsistency with respect to gender and culture , but fail to make justiﬁed and morally relevant discriminations with respect to age and degrees of harm

Male and female circumcision debated in Daily Telegraph
The British Daily Telegraph recently ( July 2014 ) hosted two opinion pieces that raised the question of whether male and female genital cutting were comparable .
The first , by Neil Lyndon , expressed strong opposition to non-therapeutic circumcision of male infants and other minors , and showed many point of similarity between male circumcision and female genital cutting .
In response , Simon Hochhauser insisted rather aggressively that there must never be comparisons between cutting a boy ’s foreskin and “ the abominable act of FGM ” because the former is not harmful enough to pass beyond the bounds of the tolerable while the latter exceeds them .
Readers can judge the intellectual quality of these two contributions to the circumcision debate for themselves , but it is worth observing that Hochhauser ’s argument conforms to a general pattern in pro-circumcision propaganda that reserves particular spleen for the proposition that there are similarities between male genital cutting ( MGC ) and female genital cutting ( FGC ) - or as they prefer , circumcision and female genital mutilation ( FGM ) .
There are two reasons for this .
First , they know that since FGC is already discredited and often criminalised , it follows that if MGC is similar it should be treated in the same way .
Second , they genuinely hate FGC because they do n’t like the idea of doctors messing around with and damaging the genitals of potential sex partners , and ( like the feminists ) they are worried that comparisons with MGC will make FGC seem less abhorrent and more acceptable .
These positions go back to a letter by the old American guru to whom all the pro-cutters pay homage , Edgar Schoen , who warned in 1995 that there must never be comparisons between MGC and FGC because they would make MGC less acceptable .
As he wrote then :
“ Both the Special Article by Toubia and the accompanying editorial by Schroeder emphasize that female genital mutilation is a form of child abuse and has no redeeming features .
However , Toubia ’s use of the term “ female circumcision ” could have unforeseen political repercussions . …
The problem with describing female genital mutilation as female circumcision is that the latter can be confused with the circumcision of newborn boys , a low - risk procedure with medical benefits . ”
( Edgar Schoen .
Female circumcision ( letter ) .
New England Journal of Medicine 332 ( 3 ) , 19 January 1995 , 188 . )
The same issue of the JME has a letter from paediatrician Paul Fleiss pointing out that circumcision of boys is just as barbaric as female genital mutilation and should be opposed for the same medical and ethical reasons .
What is more , Nahid Toubia , the author of the NEJM article criticising FGM , has expressed equally strong opposition to circumcision of males ; the first of four principles that should govern attitudes to both male and female circumcision is :
“ Cutting any healthy part of a child ’s body , including the genitals , is wrong .
The female clitoris and the male foreskin should be guaranteed the same protections as the nose , the hand , or any other body part . ”
( Nahid Toubia , Evolutionary cultural ethics and the circumcision of children .
In : George C. Denniston , Frederick Hodges and Marilyn Milos ( eds ) .
Male and Female Circumcision : Medical , Legal and Ethical Considerations in Pediatric Practice .
New York : Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers , 1999 : 1 - 7 . )
What is particularly interesting about this exchange is the tone of the comments from readers , nearly all of them agreeing with Lyndon , and most of them disagreeing with Hochhauser .
That should really ring alarm bells in the pro-circumcision lobby .
Australia : Rising demand for female circumcision
An article in the February edition the Medical Journal of Australia warns against the rising demand for female circumcision .
The article , by law professor Dr Ben Mathews , calls for increased protection of girls and women from this danger .
The demand is generated by recent immigrants from Middle Eastern and African countries where circumcision of girls and boys is a common customary or cultural practice .
As more immigrants arrive from these places , the demand for circumcision of young girls is rising along with the demand for circumcision of young boys .
Female circumcision ( also known as Female Genital Mutilation ( FGM ) or female genital cutting ) refers to a wide range of procedures in which parts of the external female genitalia are cut off to satisfy culturally determined requirements of chastity , cleanliness , and aesthetics .
FGM is often practiced in poor sanitary conditions , leading to significant complications .
Dr. Mathews writes in response to last year ’s controversy over suggestions that the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( RANZCOG ) might consider the legalisation of so - called " ritual nicking . "
Considerably less harmful than male circumcision , " ritual nicking " is the practice of scratching the clitoris and extracting a drop of blood in order to satisfy cultural adherents of female circumcision .
In April 2010 the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) briefly adopted a policy endorsing the practice of " ritual nicking ” , and it was their policy change that led the RANZCOG to consider the issue .
The AAP policy recommendation was reversed and the old policy ( complete opposition to any form of FGM ) restored after widespread outrage from human rights organizations , including Equality Now and Intact America , an organization that also campaigns against male circumcision .
Legal Protection
FGM is legally prohibited in many countries worldwide , including some 16 African countries where it is customary , though in many cases the law makes no difference to local practice .
Current human rights statutes protecting girls and women from FGM include the Protocol of the Rights of Women in Africa , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights , and the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child .
The language of the second two of these documents are gender neutral : although the provisions relating to genital integrity have generally been interpreted as applying only to females , the actual words of the text give just as much protection to males .
Any form of FGM is specifically prohibited in most Australian states ( usually by provisions in the state crimes act ) , but in addition to this children in general are currently protected from genital cutting under Australian law :
It is illegal to infringe upon a person 's right to bodily integrity .
Courts have authority over parents who do not act in the child 's " best interests . "
Non-therapeutic operations on children require the consent of the family court .
Where parents disagree as to whether a boy should be circumcised , the consent of the family court is required .
Parents do not have the right to perform any treatments without a child 's consent once the child reaches " sufficient understanding and intelligence . "
Dr. Mathews stands behind the legal prohibition of all forms of FGM , which currently outlaw even consensual procedures on adults .
There are many justifications for these strict legal protections , he writes , based on the following findings :
Like male circumcision , FGM predates the Koran and the Bible , and is therefore a cultural more than a religious practice .
FGM is a form of direct social control on females ' bodies and sexuality .
Victims of FGM have a high risk of infection , haemorrhage , and even death .
FGM causes complications for intercourse , childbirth , menstruation , including recurrent infections , chronic pain , and perinatal death
Infibulation ( or FGM type III , the most severe form of FGM , around 10 % of all occurrences ) requires re-incision for intercourse and childbirth , and includes a higher risk of fatalities during childbirth .
FGM causes severe psychological consequences comparable to rape , including post - traumatic stress disorder and a sense of violation .
FGM has significant effects on longevity .
Some commentators are in favour of permitting " ritual nicking " in a medical setting , believing it preferable to the risk of girls and women being taken abroad or to underground operators to have FGM performed in non-sterile conditions .
Others believe that legalising " ritual nicking " is a shocking concession and the thin end of the proverbial wedge .
" To sanction medically performed FGM would leave undisturbed the damaging assumptions motivating it , and would endorse the unjust attitudes to girls ' and women 's rights embodied in the practice , " writes Dr. Mathews .
Recommendations
FGM presents practical challenges for medical practitioners , who must call upon relevant organizations in case they are asked to perform , treat , or give advice about FGM .
Current Australian law requires doctors , nurses , school principals , and police officers to report each suspected instance of FGM .
Dr. Mathews calls for more research on the incidence ( annual rate ) of FGM , and on evaluating strategies in Australia in response to the increasing cultural demand for FGM from communities of recent immigrants .

The Federal Government may have commissioned a root and branch review of the tax system , but there will not be root and branch reform .
The Government has ruled out more of the recommendations from the Henry tax review than it has ruled in .
Many of the highly anticipated and highly contentious proposals have been flatly rejected .
For example , the review recommends alcohol taxes be simplified to a single across - the - board volumetric tax .
But the Government has ruled that out - for now at least - saying it would be inappropriate while there is a wine glut .
The not - for - profit sector was worried it could lose its fringe benefit tax concessions and be forced to lay off staff .
The sector was right to be worried , with the review recommending the concessions be phased out .
But the Government has categorically ruled that out as well .
Charities will also be relieved to learn the Government has rejected a recommendation to lift the tax deductibility threshold for donations from $ 2 to $ 25 .
The review also had defence personnel in its sights , making several recommendations aimed at trimming tax concessions for defence force staff in return for higher remuneration .
But the Government has scuttled those proposals .
The review recommends integrating the Medicare levy into the personal income tax rates .
The Government was never going to accept that idea , having previously said it would stand by its plan to lower the personal income tax rates .
The Commonwealth has declined to wade into the thorny issue of changing negative gearing and capital gains tax provisions .
It has also avoided a fight over a recommendation to introduce land tax on the family home .
The Federal Government says it will not implement that recommendation because it is a state matter , not a Commonwealth one .
Other recommendations the Government has ruled out include :
Top Kill Fails – BP Abandons Effort

Bad news from the Gulf this afternoon : BP is calling off its “ top kill ” operation after it failed to plug the oil leak in several attempts over three days .
“ We have not been able to stop the flow , ” said chief operating officer Doug Suttles .
“ We have made the decision to move onto the next option . ”
That next option is expected to take four days to complete .
BP will use robot submarines to cut off the damaged riser from which the oil is leaking , and then try to cap it with a containment valve .
This time , it will be easier to follow progress on the live feed .
“ We ’re confident the job will work but obviously we ca n’t guarantee success , ” Suttles said .

Back in early 2009 , when guys like David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum warned that the American drone war in Pakistan could create more terrorists than they kill , they were pilloried by the national security establishment for their views .
Since the failed Times Square bombing — a terror attack allegedly in response to the drone strikes — Kilcullen and Exum ’s take is quickly becoming conventional wisdom in Washington .
“ Have the stepped - up attacks in Pakistan — notably the Predator drone strikes — actually made Americans less safe ? ” asks David Sanger in the New York Times .
“ Are they inspiring more attacks on America than they prevent ? ”
“ If you go into Pakistan and talk to college kids , which is what we did , these drone attacks are feeding this narrative : this is what we [ Americans ] are aiming to do .
We ’re aiming to kill Muslims , ” Leslie Stahl said today on MSNBC ’s Morning Joe .
“ Let ’s say China was launching drone attacks on Idaho , we would be pretty angry too .
We are launching attacking against a people were not at war with , officially , ” Joe Scarborough responded .
“ I would rather us go after the terrorists — individual terrorists — drag ’em out , interrogate ’em , get information — instead of dropping bombs that kill four year - old little girls .
That dismember grandmoms that happen to be in the family compound .
That seems immoral . ”
The decision to dramatically escalate the drone war was done behind closed doors , with no public debate about whether the strikes were the best way to smash the jihadist networks based in Pakistan ’s tribal wildlands .
Perhaps now , we ’ll have that discussion .
By the way , there was another reported drone strike in Pakistan over the weekend .
10 people were killed .

The network never gave your show a chance .
It was scheduled on a night no one watches TV , or put against a ratings powerhouse .
The episodes aired out of order , and the time slot got moved .
It was n't marketed properly … you never saw an ad for it , and no one you know saw an ad for it .
Plus , the show did n't have enough time to catch on , the network never understood it and wanted it to fail , the DVR numbers were great and the Nielsens are useless anyway .
Why do networks spend tens of millions of dollars on shows then treat them this way ?
I 'll do my best to give you insight into why these things happen , or at least seem to happen .
Be warned , you 'll disagree with some and quite possibly all of it .
Okay , so here 's why networks …
Schedule episodes of a show out of order
There are two main reasons this happens :
1 ) More people sample a show when it 's new , so networks try to run the best episodes first .
Sometimes this happens and viewers never know it , and sometimes it 's pretty obvious and might do more harm than good .
2 ) Some episodes originally slated to air earlier in a season might have a problem and need to go back to the shop for more work , so they get pulled , fixed and slotted later .
Move a show to different timeslots
There are a few different reasons this might happen :
1 ) If it 's a new show and it 's clearly not working in its timeslot , it gets moved somewhere where it might work better
2 ) If the show is doing badly but the network does n't want to just take it off the air , it gets put somewhere out of the way so it does n't hurt the shows around it .
For instance , a low - rated show wo n't funnel many viewers to the show that immediately follows , thus hurting that show 's ratings too .
3 ) If it 's the start of a new season and the old timeslot from last season became problematic ( like a ratings juggernaut aimed at the same viewers suddenly appears at the same time on a different network ) , or maybe a better one became available , the show gets moved .
4 ) If a show is doing well in a choice timeslot , it might get moved so a new show gets the choice slot in an effort to give the new show its best shot at succeeding .
Generally speaking audiences will follow good shows wherever they go .
Also , a good way to turn a bad slot into a good slot is to put a good show there .
5 ) If a show was doing well in its old slot but the network thinks it can do even better in the new slot , it might get moved to try and make it even more successful .
Do n't leave a show on long enough to build viewers
History has proven that most series doing badly wo n't gain more viewers if they 're kept running .
In fact , they 'll shed viewers .
Every once in a LONG while a poorly performing show starts doing well .
Those are the exceptions that prove the rule .
( Viewers who are upset with Syfy because they feel we did n't leave a show on long enough often raise the example of Cheers to me .
Citing one show in 28 years actually proves the point . )
Take a show off the air quickly
Leaving poorly performing shows on the air hurts the shows around them and hurts the overall ratings for the network .
Also , the show was probably sold to advertisers by guaranteeing them a minimum number of viewers , so replacing that show with something else that performs better will help fulfill at least part of that commitment .
If those aspects are factored against the very very very small chance the show might ( possibly maybe ) gain viewers , the obvious conclusion is reached .
Put a show on hiatus
There are a few ways hiatuses happen :
1 ) At Syfy we often take a hiatus between half seasons of our shows because airing all the episodes straight would mean a year - long break between seasons .
Two half seasons every six months has proven a better way to keep viewer awareness up than one full season followed by a really long break .
2 ) A hiatus might happen around special events like holidays or the Olympics , so networks are n't airing new episodes of a show when no one 's watching .
3 ) A hiatus might be a planned ( or unplanned ) break so a network can evaluate how a show is doing and make changes to improve it .
4. ) A hiatus might be planned to help the production process … shows take a long time to make and sometimes the writers , producers , cast and crew need some vacation time .
Schedule similar shows opposite one another
Often a network might think a certain time and date might be good for a certain kind of show .
Then someone else thinks that too , and neither is willing to give ( it 's a competitive business after all ) .
Sometimes it 's not ideal to leave a show where it is , but the network also can't rearrange its schedule to move the show .
Sometimes shows that seem competitive really are n't .
Do n't market a show well / at all
There is a finite amount of money and time available to market any given show , and within those restrictions shows are marketed the best they can be .
( Same for the marketing of anything else by the way . )
Often viewers wo n't think a show was marketed well because they either never saw an ad or do n't think they saw an ad .
Often they saw many ads and do n't realize it .
Or it might be the case that they were n't targeted with ads because the network knew they 'd find out about the show other ways .
As a rule , EVERYONE on the TV side wants to give show as much marketing as we can afford and we 're always trying to figure out ways to get more marketing , or get more efficient marketing .
Always .
Remake anything
A bunch of reasons here .
First , viewers love to watch remakes even though people say they 're sick of them .
Also , part of the job marketing the show is already done because people are familiar with it .
Creatively , shows might have a really great core premise that makes them timeless as long as they 're updated for a contemporary audience from time to time .
Possibly some REALLY BIG NAME loved the show as a kid and has an idea for a new twist , and viewers want to see things from the REALLY BIG NAME .
Sometimes rights to a property are split up so one company owns the movie rights and someone else owns the TV rights , and one of each gets made .
Of course , sometimes it 's just bad judgment to remake something .
Remake a recent remake
See above .
Listen to the Nielsen numbers / Not listen to the great DVR numbers
The industry standard right now is Nielsen ratings , which are the best measurement tool that 's proven workable at the scale needed ( i.e. not just theoretically possible but actually able to be implemented and to get everyone to agree to use them ) .
Ratings are the currency of the TV business at the moment , and they 're the only way to do business .
If a TV network did n't want to use Nielsens it'd be like saying they want to start an ice cream shop but they 'll only take gold bars as payment , not the standard cash or credit .
DVR numbers are a mixed bag .
On the one hand people are watching the show , on the other hand , if they 're fast forwarding through commercials , the network is n't making the money it needs from them to support the show .
Counting them is tricky .
Do n't understand a show
That thing you see in the show that you really love … the great characters , the charming premise , the new twist … someone somewhere at a network saw that before the show was a show , then made the show because of it .
Which is why you 're now seeing it .
Want a show to fail
If the network wanted a show to fail , they would n't put it on the air .
After reading this you might still think what networks do is crazy , or you might think , oh , okay , now I understand .
Both points of view are valid , and what works for one show might not work for another .
Networks use these tactics because they have proven to work in the long run , and as soon as they can figure out something better , they will .
That 's not much solace to a fan of a particular show I know , but at least you know there is some method to the ( seeming ) madness .
As always I 'll try to stick around and address your further questions and comments in the comments section .
UN report reveals deep social divide in Thailand
By John Braddock
23 June 2010
A report released last month by Thailand ’s Ministry of Social Development and Human Security and the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) points to the underlying social tensions that helped fuel recent protests in Bangkok against the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva .
The protests were called by the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD ) , which is aligned with former prime minister and telecom billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra .
While the UDD leaders limited their demands to early elections , the tens of thousands of rural and urban poor demonstrators saw an opportunity to vent their frustrations over declining living standards and the deepening divide between rich and poor .
At least 85 people died in the military crackdown that ended the protests on May 19 .
The Human Development Report 2009 , “ Human Security , Today and Tomorrow ” , is a cautious document , intended to present an “ optimistic perspective ” on the country ’s recent development under the guidance of “ His Majesty the King ’s initiatives ” .
Nevertheless it contains a number of findings that reveal the vast transformation of Thai society under the impact of globalisation , and sharp changes in social relations .
Foremost is the growth of inequality .
Rapid economic growth — an average of 7 percent a year — resulted in official poverty levels falling from 21 to 8.5 percent between 2000 and 2007 .
Despite this decline in absolute poverty , however , the gulf between rich and poor has widened .
Since the mid-1980s , real per capita income has roughly tripled , yet the main beneficiaries have been a narrow , privileged layer .
Over 5 million people are still below the austere official poverty line , while many more are struggling from day to day .
One measure of inequality cited in the report is the ratio between the average income of the top fifth of households and the bottom fifth .
In Japan and Scandinavia , the multiple is around 3 - 4 .
In the rest of Europe and North America , it is 5 - 8 . Among Thailand ’s South East Asian neighbours , the figure is 9 - 11 .
At 13 - 15 , Thailand is the most unequal society in South East Asia .
Further evidence of rising inequality is provided by country ’s Gini coefficient , which has risen from 0.4 to 0.5 since 1960 , while in countries like Malaysia and the Philippines the trend has been the reverse .
Over the past half century , Thailand ’s mainly agricultural economy has changed dramatically , with the rapidly developing industrial and service sectors highly integrated into the global economy .
The country has become a major cheap labour platform , heavily dependent on foreign investment and exports .
Tourism , which accounts for 6 to 8 percent of GDP , employs a significant layer of the total workforce .
These economic developments have accentuated social divisions .
Nearly 60 percent of the workforce is employed in the “ informal sector ” that includes most of those in agriculture and two - fifths of those outside it .
The latter is concentrated in transport , trade and construction , and also accounts for some 22 percent of manufacturing workers .
“ Informal ” workers are deprived of basic rights under the country ’s labour laws , excluded from social security , denied opportunities for training and advancement , and receive poverty level wages .
They include a high proportion of older workers , as younger workers often replace those employed in the “ formal sector ” once they get to 40 years of age .
The most exploited are the 3.5 million migrants from Myanmar , Cambodia , Laos and China — equivalent to 10 percent of the working population .
Many are so - called “ illegal ” and semi-legal migrants , stateless and displaced persons , and long - standing residents who do not have full citizenship .
They have few rights , are vulnerable to victimisation and violence , and work in menial , low - wage jobs .
Rural areas have suffered from longstanding neglect .
Investment in agriculture has been low and the rural economy is no longer insulated from world markets .
The small - scale family farms that prevail in Thailand are uneconomic .
Many farmers are older , with the average age of farmers now above 50 years .
The households have little or no land and the families have high dependency rates , with large numbers of children and elderly people .
The informal social safety net that has sustained rural life is rapidly breaking down .
Many of the rural poor are landless labourers whose income is described as “ right at the bottom of the scale ” .
Others are smallholders .
Of 5.8 million households with agricultural land , 1.4 million own less than 0.8 hectare .
Many do not produce enough food for themselves , either because the land is inadequate or because they cultivate non -food crops .
Rural households are forced to spend over 80 percent of their total income on food , and are thus highly vulnerable to price fluctuations .
Rural households , of which 1 - in - 10 are rated as officially “ poor , ” often rely on remittances from family members working in urban centres .
For the rural population as a whole , these amount to some 9 percent of total income .
Along with many urban workers who face intermittent or lengthy periods of poverty , large numbers of rural households are heavily indebted .
In 2007 , 63.3 percent of all households were in debt , with the average amount increasing from 82,485 baht in 2003 to 116 , 585 baht ( $ US3,600 ) .
For many poor families , this represents months of their income .
The disparities between urban and rural areas are reflected in a series of social and economic indices comparing the top five and bottom five provinces — the latter are inevitably in the country ’s rural north and north east , where many of the UDD protesters came from , or the south , where there is an Islamic separatist insurgency .
In the top five in 2007 , the poverty incidence ranged between zero and 0.1 percent of the population ; in the bottom five , it was between 20.0 and 65.2 percent .
Average monthly household income for the top five was 25,447 to 39,020 baht compared to 7,245 to 10,782 baht for the bottom five .
The number of children in distress per 100,000 people was 0.5 to 2.2 for the top five , compared to 129.4 to 308.1 for the bottom five .
And the list goes on .
The internationalisation of the economy has exposed Thailand to global instability .
In 1997 , it was the first country hit by the Asian financial crisis .
The government , also then led by Abhisit ’s Democrat Party , implemented the demands of the International Monetary Fund to impose austerity measures and further open up the economy to foreign investment .
Thaksin won power in 2001 by exploiting the widespread opposition to the Democrat - led government and promising to protect Thai businesses .
In office , he made limited handouts to rural areas as part of his stimulus measures , but , under pressure from the international markets , he continued to open up the Thai economy .
As a result , the country ’s external exposure deepened .
The recovery was fragile , depending on increasing exports , on the basis of the cheap currency , and attracting a flood of tourists .
Free trade agreements were signed with ASEAN , New Zealand , Australia , India and China , and tariffs were slashed .
The ratio of exports to GDP rose to 64 percent .
Dependence on foreign direct investment rose to 3 - 5 percent of GDP , triple the level prior to the crisis .
The UN report only briefly touches on the impact of the current world financial crisis , which hit the exported - orientated economy hard .
The government responded with stimulus measures amounting to nearly 2 trillion baht , but these “ could not prevent a large shrinkage of the economy ” .
The stimulus boost to consumption was “ puny ” in comparison to the loss of demand from exports — leading to large job losses and declining living standards .
The report obliquely refers to the effective disenfranchisement of the masses , noting with concern that wealthy business interests dominate all the political parties .
With one “ partial exception , ” all are “ little oligarchies , dominated by a single leader and controlled by a small coterie ” .
The report points out that there is more “ conflict and insecurity than at any time in the previous thirty years ” and warns that the situation could spiral out of control unless the “ failings ” of the country ’s political system are addressed .
Embroiled in their own factional conflicts , the Thai ruling elites are no more capable than their counterparts in other countries in addressing these “ failings ” .
The resort to bloody military force last month reflected the exhaustion of all the safety valves used to contain class tensions amid rising hostility to all the existing political institutions , which are deeply discredited .
The underlying social tensions and political issues remain and will inevitably erupt , sooner or later , in further upheavals and new forms of class struggle .
French President Georges Bidault greets
Ho Chi Minh in 1946 following the acknowledgement by France of the Democratic Republic of North Vietnam
Nobody could have imagined on September 2 , 1945 , that that slight - built man with the graying beard , known by various names , among them Ho Chi Minh – that man who remains inseparably linked to the history of the world – would become one of the exceptional figures of Asia in the 20th century .
That September day , from the Ba Dinh Plaza in the center of Hanoi , North of Vietnam and the country ’s capital , Ho Chi Minh proclaimed to the world the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam .
In a relatively short time from that date , people would learn of the exceptional gifts of the revolutionary as a strategist .
He was a renovator of his time – that fact was already known – at least in Paris , Moscow , China , and in his own country , although nobody grasped the extent of his vision , tenacity and power to unite an entire nation for a tremendous struggle against the strong redoubts of French colonialism , and later against powerful U.S. imperialism .
But that vision and capacity for strategy would amaze the world .
There is film footage of the period that attests to that image of Ba Dinh Plaza , filled to overflowing with people listening to Ho Chi Minh proclaim the Republic over a microphone in a circular frame .
World War II was ending .
The Allies had defeated the Nazis ; France , the metropolis of many overseas nations , was also liberated to a certain extent , General de Gaulle was the great hero of the Resistance .
That was the tactical moment for the revolutionary Ai Quog , or Ho Chi Minh , to assume all the power of his leadership among his people and proclaim the independence of his country from North to South .
It should be said that Vietnam had just suffered a cruel battle against the Japanese , emboldened as a central part of the Rome - Berlin - Tokyo axis determined to take over the world .
Millions of Vietnamese people perished .
Being occupied by Germany , France was unable to offer even crumbs to offset the famine , as the metropolis interested in its colonial territory strategically located in South East Asia and south of China .
That was the general situation in Vietnam when Ho Chi Minh and his comrades from the Communist Party of Indochina and subsequently of Vietnam , founded by him , proclaimed a sovereign and independent republic , which was willing to help liberate its sister colonies of Laos and Cambodia as soon as it was humanly possible .
One cannot talk responsibly of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam – today ’s the Socialist Republic of Vietnam – without highlighting the political wisdom and knowledge of the life in the colonies possessed by Ho Chi Minh .
Being still very young , while in Paris , he was one of the founding members of the French Communist Party and , from the heart of the organization , advocated the liberation of the French colonies overseas , to the shock of his comrades , although many of them finally understood him .
He was fully aware of the situation of the colonies , including those in Africa , since he traveled to those countries as a kitchen hand and simple sailor on board a cargo ship that docked in those ports ; he was 22 at that time .
He also suffered abuse on board a French warship that anchored in the Shameen inlet in the French territory of Canton .
As mentioned above he lived in Paris as a journalist and portrait painter .
He was an restless reader .
At that time he was the young Nguyen Ai Quoc , who traveled from Paris to Moscow in 1923 to attend the 5th International Communist Congress as a representative of the French Communist Party , which was already concerned over the revolutionary movement in the colonies .
Right there he committed himself to the mission of taking part in the Chinese revolution and stirring up the revolutionary movement in his own country .
His first step was to found the Association of Young Revolutionaries of Vietnam .
Later he was imprisoned and given up for dead in China , though he was not dead and returned to Vietnam .
This simple account of his revolutionary undertakings is directed at sustaining a great truth :
Ho Chi Minh was a man with highly advanced ideas , backed up by the experience of struggle and knowledge of his world in the times he lived and since his very early youth .
He was an educated person , the son of teachers , who knew the Vietnamese and the Chinese languages , as well as French and was able to make himself perfectly understood in Russian .
When we interviewed him in Hanoi a few months before his death , he spoke to us in perfect Spanish and explained that he had learnt some Spanish phrases during his stay at so many ports .
It was still a time of joy at the victory of the Allies when France on its on decision and encouraged by the United States , launched a war to retake its colonies ; Vietnam first .
And with that action , an impressive war began between a hungry and barely armed people and the colonial army supported by the victorious U.S. army .
The event was no surprise for Ho Chi Minh and his close collaborators , then legendary General Giap , Phan Van Dong , Le Duan and others .
A popular army of peasants , in its vast majority , stood up to the might of the forces of the re-conquest .
And that the way the story goes .
The fighting extended throughout the North and South of Vietnam , but it was in Dien Bien
Phu where the best trained colonial forces at that time suffered their total defeat in 1954 .
The Vietnamese combatants even entered the office of the general who led the French troops and arrested him .
Ho Chi Minh ( on the right ) , with Vo Nguyen Giap , who perhaps was the major military strategist of the 20th century
It appeared that after such a huge victory Vietnam could develop itself and live in peace as one united family – as it had always been the case – from North to South .
However , the prevailing alliance between the United States and France in that context and time , supported by a wealthy group of Vietnamese traitors , forced a change in the situation .
In virtue of the accords that put an end to war and with it , the end of French colonialism in Vietnam , the troops of the metropolis were expected to withdraw and gather south of Parallel 17 in order to leave for their country .
The accord set a period of time during which the withdrawal of those troops would take place , but wasting no time , the Americans supported the South Vietnamese " provisional " government with supplies of arms and showers of cash in order to strengthen it and thus keep Vietnam divided .
To the north , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , with its capital Hanoi , and to the south , the Republic of South Vietnam , with its capital Saigon .
The maneuver was not an easy one , given the immense power ranged against the North , which was still fighting hunger and training an army that could stand up to any threat .
And , in addition to that , the ideals of Ho Chi Minh and the vanguard of the Communist Party of Vietnam : education for the people , all possible kind of social improvement , unity of the people , whatever their religious associations or mountain ethnicities ; the strengthening of the administrative institutions , and the development of the incipient industry , starting with energy – coal – and ports , among other basic premises .
In parallel , Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party in the DRV took up those ideas for which they had fought .
They would soon discover that revolutionaries in the South were organizing into guerrilla groups .
These revolutionaries had support , while Ho Ch Minh in person met with Nguyen Thi Dinh , a woman from the Bentré area .
A bridge was established and set up at dizzying speed , along with a road that was unimaginable to the enemy , a real road , the famous Ho Chi Minh road , which crossed rivers , mountains , and the seemingly impenetrable forest .
The liberation war in the South was already a fact .
The motto of Ho Chi Minh was exactly the one standing from the very beginning : One Vietnam .
Artificially divided , Vietnam had to be reunited .
It was the most genocidal war of the 20th century , unleashed by a superpower with a sophisticated army of air , sea and land forces against a small country .
Chemical weapons , fragmentation bombs , Agent Orange , live phosphorus , napalm and even an electronic curtain – rapidly and ingeniously penetrated by the Vietnamese – were deployed for more than 10 years against South Vietnam and against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , in a merciless aerial bombardment .
A conservative counting of Vietnamese victims amounts to two million .
As for the U.S. forces , there were so many thousands casualties that the empire was shaken .
The Vietnam syndrome inspired movies .
The war on Vietnam produced the most brutal images that were seen up until then in such an unequal war .
In response to indiscriminate aerial bombings , the Vietnamese used elements that included bamboo traps in the jungle that terrified the well - armed U.S. soldiers , or tamed wasps – that is no joke – it is for real .
Ho Chi Minh called this , tactically and strategically speaking : " The war of all the people " for national salvation , freedom , sovereignty and reunification .
That concept gave birth to a military doctrine .
The civilian population : first victims of US strategic mass bombings during the whole war .
The Democratic Republic of Vietnam founded on September 2 , 1945 , not only became a theoretical reality but a firm and indestructible one .
One fine day , September 30 , 1975 , 30 yeas ago , TV channels across the world showed an unprecedented event : the elite troops of the United States running terrified across rooftops and anywhere that a helicopter could hover so as to hang onto its slides or any other part and flee Vietnam .
It was a stampede ; there was no order whatsoever in the retreat , although the Vietnamese had opened an office in Paris some years previously and established formal diplomatic contact between the U.S. government and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam , acknowledged as a political entity with all the prerogatives of a government .
Evacuation , by helicopter , of US citizens from a Saigon hotel roof in 1975
The talks were presided over by the well - known Madame Thi Binh by press reports .
Her name , Nguyen Thi Dinh was similar to that of a peasant woman who rose up in Bentré and who became a vice - commander in chief of the NLF .
It should be recorded that this revolutionary undertaking , whose author was Ho Chi Minh , encouraged the development of a solidarity movement throughout the world .
Cuba was the first country in the world to recognize South Vietnam ’s NLF and to found the first Solidarity Committee with South Vietnam , which also extended to Laos and Cambodia .
The most progressive forces of intellectuals , artists , scientists and professors worldwide joined forces in an International War Crimes Tribunal instigated by Nobel Prize Winner Bertrand Russell , which conducted sessions in Stockholm , Denmark , Paris and other cities .
Men and women of goodwill in the United States , including – as already mentioned – soldiers who fought in Vietnam , became a significant factor of solidarity with that little nation brutally attacked by the greatest power in the world .
The man who proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam on September 2 , 1945 , had already died September 3 , 1969 and thus he could not see the colossal victory of his people , but the political testament that he left , written shortly before his death , was a mandate : " Vietnam will be free , independent and sovereign , the enemy will be defeated , and the Vietnamese people will build a Vietnam 10 times more beautiful .
It must be united . ”
So certain of victory was he that he wrote in his testament : " Our country will have the outstanding honor of being a little nation that , through heroic struggle , would have defeated two great imperialist powers – the French and the American – and thus would have made a worthy contribution to the national liberation movement . "
And as his last will he proclaimed : " My only wish is that our Party and people , closely united in struggle , build a peaceful , unified , independent , democratic and prosperous Vietnam , and make a valuable contribution to world Revolution . "

That might be a good idea , as it seems that GM 's claims to have repaid its TARP loans in full and ahead of schedule are , well , bullshit .
Sen. Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) has sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner pointing out that GM has apparently paid back its TARP money with …more TARP money .
Here 's some of Grassley 's query :
During his testimony [ Inspector General for TARP Neil ]
Barofsky addressed GM 's recent debt repayment activity , and stated that the funds GM is using to repay its TARP debt are not coming from GM earnings .
Instead , GM seems to be using TARP funds from an escrow account at Treasury to make the debt repayments .
The most recent quarterly report from the Office of the Special Inspector General for TARP says " The source of funds for these quarterly [ debt ] payments will be other TARP funds currently held in an escrow account . " …
Therefore , it is unclear how GM and the Administration could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way .
In reality , it looks like GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another .
The taxpayers are still on the hook …
The bottom line seems to be that the TARP loans were " repaid " with other TARP funds in a Treasury escrow account .
The TARP loans were not repaid from money GM is earning selling cars , as GM and the Administration have claimed in their speeches , press releases and television commercials .
When these criticisms were put to GM's Vice Chairman Stephen Girsky in a television interview yesterday , he admitted that the criticisms were valid : Question :
Are you just paying the government back with government money ?
Mr. Girsky :
Well listen , that is in effect true , but a year ago nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back .
Girsky , you magnificent bastard !
If you managed to say that line without laughing , you deserve all the unsold Pontiacs in North America .
Whole thing here .
Via Real Clear Politics via Reason stalwart Manny Klausner .
And , needless to say , Grassley is n't even raising the massively important issue of whether the freaking bailout via TARP funds was legal .
Spoiler alert :
It was n't .
But do n't worry , GM loses money hand over fist and is poised to lose even more money when the market rebounds and they start selling more units .
That 's what happened in 2007 , a record - setting year for GM when it sold 9.4 million cars worldwide and lost $ 38 billion .
Check it out , why do n't you ? :
This post , incidentally , was written by a very satisfied owner of a used Buick .
Update : Fox News reports that TARP IG Barofsky told them on Wednesday : " I think the one thing that a lot of people overlook with this is where they got the money to pay back the loan .
And it is n't from earnings … .
It 's actually from another pool of TARP money that they 've already received … I do n't think we should exaggerate it too much .
Remember that the source of this money is just other TARP money . "
Fox News unconvincingly hypothesizes " the TV spot [ touting its early payback of loans ] may land GM in hot water with the Federal Trade Commission over its truth - in - advertising laws , which prohibit ads that are ' likely to mislead consumers . ' "

Waiting for a friend in a downtown skyscraper the other day , I pulled a corporate finance text off her shelf to refresh my memory about why companies borrow money rather than allowing individual shareholders , if they want a higher - risk investment , to borrow money on their own and purchase shares with leverage .
The book covered the Modigliani - Miller Theorem , a 1958 result showing that borrowing money does n’t help a company ’s managers or shareholders … in a world free of corporate taxes .
Given a corporate income tax and deductible interest , however , a company can significantly improve its performance by borrowing .
The U.S. has some of the world ’s highest corporate taxes ( source ) and we ’ve also had a lot of leverage ( Wikipedia says that private equity is more than twice as big in the U.S. than in Europe despite comparable economy sizes ) .
The leverage made the Collapse of 2008 -?
a lot more painful than it would have been without the leverage ( or maybe the collapse would n’t have happened at all ) .
Has anyone heard a public debate on this subject ?
I.e. , whether or not our tax code substantially increases the risk of corporate bankruptcies by encouraging leverage ?
Synopsis
A new paper by a leading group of scientists , engineers , and architects argues that the U.S. could eliminate CO 2 emissions from coal in 20 years .
The U.S. could end its global warming emissions from coal in two decades by embracing a collection of proven and promising technologies , according to a new ES&T paper ( Environ .
Sci. Technol . DOI 10.1021/es903884a ) .
Climate scientists James Hansen and Pushker Kharecha , together with Charles Kutscher of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) and noted architect Edward Mazria , say their paper targets coal because it is the energy source that is most responsible for accumulated fossil fuel CO 2 in today ’s atmosphere .
Kharecha and Hansen , both of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the Columbia University Earth Institute , and their coauthors argue that fast action is demanded by recent revelations in the field of climate science .
For example , a draft of the Fifth U.S. Climate Action Report released in mid-April says that current effects of climate change include water cycle disruptions , vanishing mountain glaciers , and extreme weather events .
In the new paper , the scientists write , “ The ‘ safe ’ long - term level of atmospheric greenhouse gases is much lower than has been supposed , [ and CO 2 concentrations are ] already into the dangerous zone . ”
The ES&T paper is both noteworthy and valuable for conveying the urgency of changing the mix of technologies used to produce U.S. electricity , says Robert N. Schock , the World Energy Council ’s director of studies .
Shock played a key role in developing the climate change mitigation technology recommendations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
He says that the collection of energy efficiency , renewable , and nuclear power technologies discussed in the new paper are consistent with the IPCC ’s recommendations .
The mix of technologies is also very similar to the assortment that the electric power industry is investigating to meet future generation needs based on expected regulatory drivers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , says Revis James , director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center run by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) .
He adds that the paper and EPRI ’s research agree that “ successful decarbonization will require a fairly diverse set of technologies . ”
That said , James says that he thinks it is unlikely that all of the technologies discussed in the article will be in place by 2030 .
He also points out that EPRI research indicates that coal , if teamed with carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) , could remain important in the future .
“ Obviously , coal is the number one technology that we have to decarbonize .
Fifty percent of [ U.S. ] electricity generation is from coal , and the bulk of electricity emissions are the result of coal , ” he says .
“ We believe our recommendations can be implemented fairly rapidly , ” says Kharecha , the paper ’s corresponding author .
“ The key missing ingredient is political will , not the technical potential of the various options ” discussed in the paper , he says .
Kharecha and his colleagues argue that the best way to move the U.S. toward the scenario they envision would be to end fossil fuel subsidies and levy a substantial fee on carbon emissions .
Kharecha stresses that the majority of the technologies discussed in the paper have been demonstrated to be capable of producing utility - scale power .
One that has not yet met this criterion is enhanced geothermal systems , which according to the paper , could vastly expand the already very large national geothermal resource base .
However , the Obama Administration recently announced $ 80 million in funding for the technology .
A major advantage of geothermal power over many other renewable sources is its ability to reliably produce the minimum “ base - load ” of power that utility customers require .
Biomass can also be used to produce base - load power .
Kharecha and colleagues estimate that by 2025 , biomass power from forestry , agriculture , and urban and industrial waste could produce approximately half of the power now generated by coal - fired plants .
“ Biomass power also offers an important option that other renewables do not : the potential to incorporate [ CCS ] , thereby making biomass power substantially carbon - negative , ” the paper points out .
The authors recommend using waste products such as agricultural residue to avoid indirectly producing what they term “ carbon - positive land use changes . ”
The paper recommends increasing the energy efficiency of homes and buildings because they consume almost 75 % of the electricity generated in the U.S.
It also foresees important roles for wind and solar , and advises that the national power grid be upgraded to enable much larger deployment of renewable power .
The nuclear power technologies that the report recommends as warranting development include two of the “ next - generation ” reactors based on closed fuel cycles that “ breed ” new fuel during their operation .
“ We believe climate change is a crisis of such great proportions that we can ill afford to take any potential energy supply contributor off the table , ” says coauthor Kutscher , principle engineer for NREL ’s Electricity , Resources and Building Systems Integration group .

Arizona 's new crackdown on illegal immigration will increase crime in U.S. cities , not reduce it , by driving a wedge between police and immigrant communities , police chiefs from several of the state 's and the nation 's largest cities said Tuesday .
The new Arizona law will intimidate crime victims and witnesses who are illegal immigrants and divert police from investigating more serious crimes , chiefs from Los Angeles , Houston and Philadelphia said .
They will join their counterparts from Montgomery County and a half - dozen other U.S. cities in meeting Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday morning to discuss the measure .
" This is not a law that increases public safety .
This is a bill that makes it much harder for us to do our jobs , " Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said .
" Crime will go up if this becomes law in Arizona or in any other state . "
The delegation was organized by the Police Executive Research Forum , a membership organization of police chiefs that functions as an independent think tank in Washington .
The group 's meeting with Holder comes as 15 states are considering their own versions of the Arizona law , which defines illegal immigration as criminal trespassing and requires police to request documents of anyone they stop and have a " reasonable suspicion " is in the country illegally .
Several recent public opinion polls indicate that as many as 70 percent of Americans surveyed support such a police requirement .
The American Civil Liberties Union , Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other civil rights groups have filed lawsuits to block the Arizona law , arguing that the Constitution preempts states from enforcing federal law and that the measure will lead to racial profiling .
The U.S. Justice Department , which Holder heads , is also weighing whether to file suit or intervene .
Although the ranks of chiefs appealing to Holder included Arizonans Jack Harris of Phoenix , Roberto Villasenor of Tucson and John Harris of Sahuarita , president of the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police , law enforcement opinion in the state is deeply split .
One of the new law 's most prominent backers is Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
His suburban Phoenix county has caught 120,000 illegal immigrants under a separate federal program that deputizes state and local law enforcement agents to catch illegal immigrants under limited circumstances , mostly after they have been booked into local jails .
Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu , head of the Arizona Sheriff 's Association , is another backer .
Babeu called the police chiefs ' argument " flawed from the beginning . "
Cooperation from illegal immigrants , particularly those coming from Mexico , is already low , he said , because they are in the United States illegally and because of law enforcement corruption in their native countries .
" Somehow when they appear in the U.S. , magically their perception of law enforcement improves overnight ? "
Babeu said .
" The people of Arizona believe the overall majority of Americans are not only supportive of this law , but that our measure of generosity has been crossed , a line has been crossed , " Babeu added .
Unlike most police chiefs , almost all sheriffs are elected officials .
However , only about 60 of the nation 's 3,000 - plus elected sheriffs have chosen to participate in the federal program championed by Arpaio .
Meanwhile , the nation 's leading police chiefs have voiced caution about such initiatives .
In 2006 , the Major Cities Chiefs Association - which represents 56 U.S. cities - unanimously warned that putting " local police in the crosshairs " of the national immigration debate would undo the success of community policing efforts in recent decades , said San Jose , Calif. , Police Chief Rob Davis , association president and part of the group meeting Holder .
Requiring the Los Angeles Police Department to prioritize the arrest of 400,000 illegal immigrants among the city 's 4.1 million residents would " cripple us and make it impossible for us to do our jobs , " Beck said .
Harris of Phoenix said he feared the Arizona measure will become a political fad at the state level , leading federal officials to neglect a national solution to core issues of illegal immigration .
" We understand and agree : Federal immigration law , the whole system , is broken , and that people are very , very frustrated all across this country , " Harris said .
" But this state law does n't solve the immigration problems for the country .
The solution is here in Washington , D.C. , and Congress must step forward and come up with a comprehensive immigration reform that will really solve the problem . "
DALLAS — The Texas Board of Education is poised to enact a new social - studies curriculum that portrays America as a nation rooted in Biblical values and promotes the virtues of low taxes , limited regulation and free enterprise .
Those standards have provoked heated debate in the state similar to the one that broke out last year when the board overhauled the science curriculum .

Suppose your dependent variable ( DV ) is a Likert scale or something similar .
That is , it ’s some sort of rating , from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 or some such .
And suppose you want to regress that on several independent variables .
What should you do ?
There are three broad categories of regression models that might be applicable .
A lot of people routinely use linear regression ( often simply called regression ) .
Others routinely say this is incorrect , and that you should use ordinal logistic regression .
And yet others will do things such as multinomial logistic regression , or collapsing the DV into two categories , and then doing binary logistic .
Which is right ?
The short answer to this is to quote Sir David Cox
There are no routine statistical questions , only questionable statistical routines
Let ’s get more specific .
Suppose you are a doctor studying back pain , and suppose your DV is response to a scale :
How much pain are you in on a typical day
1 – None
2 – Barely noticeable
3 – Moderate
4 – Severe
5 – Excruciating
and your independent variables are things like age , sex , injury status , time since injury and so on .
If one is strict about it , linear regression requires a continuous DV – and we do not have one , at least as we ’ve measured it , although it could be argued that there is a latent underlying variable here that is continuous .
But you ’d be hard pressed to prove that the difference between “ none ” and “ barely noticeable ”
is the same as that between ( say ) “ moderate ” and “ severe ” .
Technically , if you follow Steven ’s categories of nominal , ordinal , interval , ratio , your DV is ordinal , and should be analyzed with some form of ordinal logistic regression .
But the most common type ( by far ) of ordinal logistic regression is the proportional hazards model , which assumes proportional hazards .
That assumption might be violated , in which case , you might want to use multinomial logistic .
Since those are relatively unusual methods , some people just collapse the categories into ( say ) “ severe ' ” or “ excruciating ” vs. anything less than that .
Which is right ?
The great advantages of linear regression are its ease of interpretation and its familiarity .
But it might be wrong .
Ordinal logistic is more likely to be correct , but is less known and harder to understand .
Multinomial logistic is even harder to understand , and is a very complex model , with many parameters to estimate .
Collapsing the variable will only very rarely be correct .
It throws away information , and that ’s rarely a good thing to do .
So , here ’s what I recommend :
Do ordinal logistic regression and test the assumptions .
Then if the assumptions are met , also do linear regression and compare the results by making a scatterplot of one set of predicted values vs. the other .
If they are very similar ( YOU decide .
Statistical analysis requires thought and judgment ) then go with linear regression .
If the assumptions are NOT met , then also do multinomial logistic regression , and compare those two sets of results , opting for the simpler ordinal model if results are very similar .

' Garage inventors ' is a term used to describe individuals or groups of inventors that create independently .
They are not on a salary or salary / incentive basis , paid by their companies to invent ; they work alone , on their own or in small groups , generally in someone 's garage or other part of the home .
recognizes the accomplishments of these independent inventors yearly in the June issue of its magazine .
Here are the 10 winning inventions ...
( The following inventions are not ranked ; just numbered for convenience . )
1. OneBreath : An Inexpensive Portable Ventilator
Inspired by the need to help more patients in a crisis situation , such as a pandemic , postdoc fellow at Stanford University , Matthey Callaghan developed a no- frills ventilator that runs on a 12 volt battery that works for up to 12 hours and can be easily transported .
Because hospital ventilators typically cost from $ 3,000 to $ 40,000 , hospitals generally would not have enough ventilators for patients who need them in a pandemic .
Callahan and a few fellow students took on the ventilator project so that hospitals would be prepared ... just in case .
Their device uses a $ 10 pressure sensor like one you would find in a blood pressure monitor .
It pumps air into the chest through the mouth and a sensor monitors how much air is in the lungs .
Sensor data is fed into a software program to calculate the data , letting the ventilator know when the patient needs air again .
2. KOR - fx : Ultra Sensation Gaming Device
A visiting physics professor at Rowan University , Shahriar S. Afshar is living in campus housing , which makes him subject to the bass vibrations from surrounding gamers ' rooms .
The interference made it pretty hard for Afshar to get his work done .
An inventor since childhood , Afshar invented the KOR - fx as self protection .
The KOR - fx is a device that connects to gaming consoles , PCs , or music players .
It sits around the shoulders , and the two transducers that lie on one 's chest translate stereo sound into stereo vibrations .
That way , gamers can feel complete immersion in their games without involving others who are not playing .
“ We can induce the sensation of rain , wind , weight shift , even G - forces , ” he said .
His company , Immerz , is in talks with several studios to add these effects to films .
3. SmartSight : A Third Eye For Assault Rifles
After 10 years and many prototypes , inventor ( and perfectionist ) Matthew Hagerty finally is close to what he wanted his invention , the SmartSight , to be : a third eye for soldiers that enable them to see around corners and even behind their backs without putting themselves in the line of fire .
SmartSight 's latest design includes a 1.5 pound video camera positioned under the end of an assault rifle , a tiny computer that receives the video transmission attached to a soldier 's vest , and a tiny display monitor worn on a soldier 's protective glasses that receives video images in real time from the computer .
The whole device weighs only three pounds , and though Hagerty says he would like to make the device even lighter , his SmartSight invention , as it is , can save thousands of soldiers ' lives from ambushes .
Just think about being able to point and shoot a weapon at a target without even physically facing it .
4. EverTune : Guitar Tuning Revolutionized
Guitar players and their audiences are in for a shock .
Cosmos Lyles and Paul Dowd have invented a guitar tuner you only tune once .
Right .
Not in the middle of a song , not between songs , not between sets .
Just once .
EverTune , the pair 's invention , is a bridge that keeps your strings in place by the action of six springs and levers that keep the strings ' tension , even if your tuning pegs loosen or tighten accidentally .
For guitarists , here 's a video that explains the EverTune far better than I can !
Lyles and Dowd are in talks with guitar makers to embed EverTune in new guitars , but EverTunes will be made separately to fit many older guitars .
I 'm just wondering what guitarists will do to buy some extra time between sets now ... drink some more water , I suppose .
5. SoundBite : Non-Surgical Bone Conduction Hearing Aid For One - Sided Deafness
Hearing aids amplify external sounds for those that have some residual hearing .
But when the cochlea ( the auditory portion of the inner ear ) does n't function , hearing aids do n't do any good .
For single - sided cochlea - involved deafness , there is a transplantable titanium device implanted to the base of the skull nicknamed BAHA .
But Amir Abolfathi , former Invisalign vice president , came up with a new idea while sitting in traffic one day .
( That 's when inventors get their best ideas ! )
Knowing that teeth are excellent sound conductors to bone , he thought why not create a bone conduction aid from the mouth .
With the help of an otolaryngologist , Abolfathi developed the SoundBite , an acrylic tooth insert ( a custom - molded retainer ) with a receiver that picks up sound from an in - ear microphone and then transmits the sound from the teeth to the bone up the jawline to the cochlea .
In clinical trials , typical reports from patients in tests if the device were that the SoundBite restored 80 to 100 percent of their hearing .
6. Groasis Waterboxx : A Biomimetic Planter
In his past life as a flower exporter , Pieter Hoff often oversaw the evening activities of his lilies .
He noticed that the plants collected condensation on their leaves and the water droplets were sucked in by the leaves as they cooled .
Mimicking nature 's efficient watering system , Hoff developed a planter that could capture water in the same manner to foster sapling trees even in harsh conditions .
The Groasis Waterboxx is designed as a plant incubator , which cools faster than the night air , allowing water to condense and flow into it along with rainwater to keep the plant and its roots hydrated and protected .
Hoff 's tests of the Waterboxx in the Sahara have been quite successful ; after one year of growing saplings in the desert , 88 percent of the trees he planted had green leaves , while 90 percent of those planted in the local method died from the scorching sun .

7. Zoggles : Anti-Fog Device
The device you see on Don Skomsky in the above photo is a Zoggles , but Zoggles is actually a whole technology that Skomsky and Valerie Palfy invented to keep fog from forming on lenses and windows .
The pair created a device with a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor that would stay colder than , say , a windshield , so they would sense when fog was coming and would turn on an automobile 's defroster .
But Skomsky was able to use an obscure formula to predict when fog would form based on the temperature and humidity , so that the bulky controls could all fit on a chip .
The Zoggles now operate with that chip , which calculates when the lens needs to be heated and activates a heater that shuts off when it is no longer needed .
Palfy and Skomsky are planning to license their technology to manufacturers of motorcycle helmets , windshields , scuba masks , and military gear .
8. Mini Infuser : Foolproof Programmable , Disposable Infusion Drug Pump
Mark Banister was n't on his way to developing the first programmable infusion drug pump , but while investigating another idea , the infusion pump idea grabbed him .
After working with an incubator program at the Arizona Center for Innovation , he was able to develop this drug pump in a way that could save hospitals money and make patients feel a whole lot more secure .
The Mini Infuser is the only disposable drug pump that can be programmed to dispense drugs continuously .
Taped to the patient 's chest , a microprocessor inside the pump sends dosage information to the polymer that Bannister developed to deliver the correct dosages .
Upon receipt of dosage information , this special polymer will expand and displace the proper dosage from the reservoir within the pump where the drugs are stored .
9. ECO - Auger : Fish - Saving Tidal Energy Turbine
Windmill turbines that convert tidal energy into electricity are costly and involve permanent installations that may harm marine life .
W. Scott Anderson , an industrial engineer , invented a simpler , less invasive tidal energy converter that 's less costly and more marine - friendly .
It uses an auger , a spiral - shaped device that has tapered ends , so as not to harm fish .
When the current spins the auger , it induces a hydraulic pump in the nosecone of the device to pump high pressure oil that turns a generator outside of the water .
Though Anderson had made several small prototypes of the ECO - auger to test function and safety around fish , he has hand - crafted his first large prototype that has a two - foot diameter and a polyurethane / fiberglass auger .
In a test , Anderson said it captured 14 percent of the water 's energy , which is not as much as the windmill turbines , but Anderson says the percentage will go up as the diameter of the augers increase .
He is sure that ultimately the ECO - Auger will be more cost effective and just as productive as the windmill turbine .
10 . RAD Technology : A Drag - Ready Snowmobile
Shawn Watling , a self - taught engineer , has created the first rear - drive , adjustable rear suspension snowmobile that is faster , safer , and more efficient than the snowmobiles produced today .
Snowmobile racing since he was only 9 months old ( presumably as a passenger ) , the 35 year old Watling decided to put together his own snowmobile out of a scrapped ATV , a 130 horsepower snowmobile motor and transmission to drag race on his local drag strip .
The ' Frankenstein ' was fast , and a dynamometer test revealed that 85 percent of its engine power was delivered to the ground , while a typical snowmobile only hit about 55 percent .
This result led him to discover that it was the rear suspension on front drive manufactured snowmobiles that increased rolling resistance and prevented adequate track tension .
Since Frankenstein , Watling 's rear - drive prototypes have been numerous , but five years later he has made corrections in everything that slows a snowmobile down , and his RAD ( rear - axle - drive ) Technology has also produced a safer snowmobile that 's more fuel efficient .

Even in lean times , the $ 400 billion business of higher education is booming .
Nowhere is this more true than in one of the fastest - growing -- and most controversial -- sectors of the industry : for - profit colleges and universities that cater to non-traditional students , often confer degrees over the Internet , and , along the way , successfully capture billions of federal financial aid dollars .
In College , Inc. , correspondent Martin Smith investigates the promise and explosive growth of the for - profit higher education industry .
Through interviews with school executives , government officials , admissions counselors , former students and industry observers , the film explores the tension between the industry -- which says it 's helping an underserved student population obtain a quality education and marketable job skills -- and critics who charge the for - profits with churning out worthless degrees that leave students with a mountain of debt .
At the center of it all stands a vulnerable population of potential students , often working adults eager for a university degree to move up the career ladder .
FRONTLINE talks to a former staffer at a California - based for - profit university who says she was under pressure to sign up growing numbers of new students .
" I did n't realize just how many students we were expected to recruit , " says the former enrollment counselor .
" They used to tell us , you know , ' Dig deep .
Get to their pain .
Get to what 's bothering them .
So , that way , you can convince them that a college degree is going to solve all their problems . ' "
Graduates of another for - profit school -- a college nursing program in California -- tell FRONTLINE that they received their diplomas without ever setting foot in a hospital .
Graduates at other for - profit schools report being unable to find a job , or make their student loan payments , because their degree was perceived to be of little worth by prospective employers .
One woman who enrolled in a for - profit doctorate program in Dallas later learned that the school never acquired the proper accreditation she would need to get the job she trained for .
She is now sinking in over $ 200,000 in student debt .
The biggest player in the for - profit sector is the University of Phoenix -- now the largest college in the U.S. with total enrollment approaching half a million students .
Its revenues of almost $ 4 billion last year , up 25 percent from 2008 , have made it a darling of Wall Street .
Former top executive of the University of Phoenix Mark DeFusco told FRONTLINE how the company 's business - approach to higher education has paid off : " If you think about any business in America , what business would give up two months of business -- just essentially close down ? " he asks .
" [ At the University of Phoenix ] , people go to school all year round .
We start classes every five weeks .
We built campuses by a freeway because we figured that 's where the people were . "
" The education system that was created hundreds of years ago needs to change , " says Michael Clifford , a major education entrepreneur who speaks with FRONTLINE .
Clifford , a former musician who never attended college , purchases struggling traditional colleges and turns them into for - profit companies .
" The big opportunity , " he says , " is the inefficiencies of some of the state systems , and the ability to transform schools and academic programs to better meet the needs of the people that need jobs . "
" From a business perspective , it 's a great story , " says Jeffrey Silber , a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets , the investment banking arm of the Bank of Montreal .
" You 're serving a market that 's been traditionally underserved .
...
And it 's a very profitable business -- it generates a lot of free cash flow . "
And the cash cow of the for - profit education industry is the federal government .
Though they enroll 10 percent of all post - secondary students , for - profit schools receive almost a quarter of federal financial aid .
But Department of Education figures for 2009 show that 44 percent of the students who defaulted within three years of graduation were from for - profit schools , leading to serious questions about one of the key pillars of the profit degree college movement : that their degrees help students boost their earning power .
This is a subject of increasing concern to the Obama administration , which , last month , remade the federal student loan program , and is now proposing changes that may make it harder for the for - profit colleges to qualify .
" One of the ideas the Department of Education has put out there is that in order for a college to be eligible to receive money from student loans , it actually has to show that the education it 's providing has enough value in the job market so that students can pay their loans back , " says Kevin Carey of the Washington think tank Education Sector .
" Now , the for - profit colleges , I think this makes them very nervous , " Carey says .
" They 're worried because they know that many of their members are charging a lot of money ; that many of their members have students who are defaulting en masse after they graduate .
They 're afraid that this rule will cut them out of the program .
But in many ways , that 's the point . "
FRONTLINE also finds that the regulators that oversee university accreditation are looking closer at the for - profits and , in some cases , threatening to withdraw the required accreditation that keeps them eligible for federal student loans .
" We 've elevated the scrutiny tremendously , " says Dr. Sylvia Manning , president of the Higher Learning Commission , which accredits many post - secondary institutions .
" It is really inappropriate for accreditation to be purchased the way a taxi license can be purchased .
...
When we see any problematic institution being acquired and being changed we put it on a short leash . "
We report that adult nutcrackers ( Nucifraga columbiana ) and newborn domestic chicks ( Gallus gallus ) show a leftward bias when required to locate an object in a series of identical ones on the basis of its ordinal position .
Birds were trained to peck at either the fourth or sixth element in a series of 16 identical and aligned positions .
These were placed in front of the bird , sagittally with respect to its starting position .
When , at test , the series was rotated by 90° lying frontoparallel to the bird 's starting position , both species showed a bias for identifying selectively the correct position from the left but not from the right end .
The similarity with the well - known phenomenon of the left - to - right spatially oriented number line in humans is considered .
1. Introduction
As early as 1880 , Galton showed that humans describe and think of numbers as being represented on a mental number line .
Furthermore , some statements such as ‘ Numerals are always pictured by me in a straight line from left to right ’ ( Galton 1880 ) suggest he had realized that the number line is usually oriented from left to right .
Modern research provides evidence that number magnitude may be represented on a left - to - right oriented number line ( Dehaene 1993 ) .
It remains to be shown , however , whether the spatial orientation of the human mental number line is acquired culturally ( i.e. it may be linked to writing and reading rules ) or if it depends , at least in part , on biologically specific biases in the allocation of attention in extra-corporeal space .
Here we provide some evidence for the latter hypothesis , by looking at the behaviour of non-human animals lacking any culture - specific bias in the exploration of visual space .
There are aspects of the mental number line in humans which rely on the ability to represent ordinal relations .
Such ability requires mastering the rule that when one element is added to a given set , the new set becomes larger than the previous one and smaller than the next .
Although this has been shown in some non-human animals ( Davis & Bradford 1986 ; Dacke & Srinivasan 2008 ) , a simpler and basic ability consists of identifying an object on the exclusive basis of its position in a series of identical objects .
Such ability has been widely documented in non-human animals ( e.g. Rugani Regolin & Vallortigara 2007 ) and may represent an ideal condition for investigations of the biological foundation of left–right biases in number line representation because of its intrinsic relationship with the spatial disposition of elements .
Here , we investigated two bird species , adult Clark 's nutcrackers ( Nucifraga columbiana ) , a widely employed animal model for the study of spatial cognition , and newborn domestic chicks ( Gallus gallus ) , which offer the possibility of testing animals , with known experiential histories , at a very early age in a simple task aimed at documenting left–right biases in the identification of an object on the exclusive basis of its position in a series of identical objects .
2. Material and methods
( a) Subjects
Subjects were 14 male domestic chicks ( Gallus gallus ) and six male and four female wild - caught Clark 's nutcrackers ( N. columbiana ) .
Birds were trained to identify the fourth ( n = 5 nutcrackers and n = 8 chicks ) or the sixth ( n = 5 nutcrackers and n = 6 chicks ) element in a series of 16 fixed identical aligned elements , sagittally oriented with respect to the bird 's starting position .
Chicks a few hours old were caged in standard cages ( 28 × 40 × 32 cm ) at controlled temperature ( 28 –31 °C ) and humidity ( 68 % ) .
Food and water were available ad libitum .
Testing began when they were 5 days old ( because of yolk sac reserve chicks are unmotivated to peck for food reward before day 4 post - hatching ) .
The nutcrackers were housed individually in large cages ( 48 × 48 × 73 cm ) at a controlled temperature of 22°C .
The colony was maintained on a 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle .
The birds were maintained at 85 per cent of their free feeding weight .
Water and grit were provided ad libitum .
( b) Apparatus
The apparatus was randomly rotated within the larger experimental room , from one trial to other , to prevent the use of external cues .
Chicks were tested in a wooden square - shaped arena ( 80 × 80 × 40 cm ) .
Two openings ( 7 × 11 cm ) positioned at the midline of two opposing walls connected the arena with two starting boxes ( 7 × 11 × 11.5 cm ) located outside the arena .
Along the midline of the arena 's floor was a series of 16 identical and aligned holes ( 2.5 cm in diameter ) , spaced 1.5 cm from one another , for an overall length of 62.5 cm ( 8 cm apart from the starting point and 29.5 cm from the side walls ) .
All holes could be blocked by a sliding bar ( 115 × 4.5 × 3 cm ) positioned underneath the apparatus and manoeuvred by the experimenter .
The bar contained a small elongated groove ( 0.8 × 2 × 2 cm ) filled with chick crumbs , which could be uncovered as it was positioned underneath the holes allowing the chick access to food .
Nutcrackers were tested in a square enclosure ( 140 × 140 × 61 cm ) .
An entrance into the enclosure was situated at the centre of each wall ( 23 × 35 cm ) .
Each entrance was covered with a plastic panel attached on the outside of the wall .
The starting box was positioned flush against a predetermined entrance allowing the bird to enter into the enclosure .
Sixteen aligned holes were centred along the midline of the enclosure .
Adjacent holes were 5 cm apart from centre to centre .
One sand - filled container was inserted in each of these holes .
3. Experimental procedures for chicks
( a) Shaping
One day prior to testing , after being deprived of food for approximately 3 h , each chick underwent a shaping procedure in the experimental arena .
( b) Training
For a total of 20 trials , in each trial , the chick was placed in the starting position and permitted to walk towards and peck at any position .
Only one peck on each trial was allowed .
A trial was considered correct when the chick pecked at the correct reinforced position .
The trial was terminated after 180 s in the absence of a response .
All chicks produced at least five correct responses across 20 valid trials and thus , progressed to the subsequent phases .
( c) Re-training
On the morning following training , the chicks underwent re-training , to ascertain that they had learned the task .
Learning criterion was three consecutive correct trials .
(d) Training test
An hour after re-training each chick underwent a training test consisting of 20 consecutive trials .
During each trial , the chick was allowed one peck .
Only correct responses were reinforced .
If no response occurred within 60 s , the trial was terminated .
At the end of each trial , the chick was gently placed back at the starting box and after approximately 2 s it was given a new trial .
(e) Testing
Two hours after completion of the training test , chicks underwent 20 consecutive test trials .
A new and identical apparatus was used for testing .
On the floor of the test apparatus was a series of 16 holes ( all identical to those described for test 1 ) approximately 14 cm from and along one of the walls .
Thus , the new test series was rotated by 90° when compared with the training series , and placed parallel in front of the chick 's starting point ( at about 61.5 cm ) .
4. Experimental procedures for nutcrackers
( a) Shaping
Each daily session consisted of five trials .
The correct position was indicated by a black container , whereas the remaining containers were white .
The correct container was filled with sand upon which two pine seeds were placed .
The birds were given 30 s to habituate to being in the starting box , after which the door was lifted to allow entrance into the arena .
Once the bird attained the seeds on four of the five trials , training began .
( b) Training
Each daily session consisted of five reinforced trials .
Training was conducted over a series of 11 phases to ensure accurate responding .
The learning criterion to progress to the next phase was four correct responses out of five trials .
In phases 1 –3 , the correct position was marked with a black container , making it distinct from the remaining white containers .
During each successive training phase the pine seeds were progressively occluded by sand .
Reliance on the visual cue of the black container was reduced during phases 4 – 8 by decreasing the number of trials during which the black container was present .
By training phase 9 , all containers were white .
In phases 10 and 11 , there were one and two non-rewarded trials , respectively .
Non-rewarded trials were terminated once the bird made two choices or 5 min elapsed , which ever occurred first .
Birds received one daily training session until they completed 50 training sessions , after which , they received two training sessions per day ( separated by approximately 2 h ) .
( c) Testing
Testing began immediately upon successful completion of training ( i.e. four of five correct trials on two consecutive training sessions ) .
Twenty test sessions with six trials per session were given .
Within the session , each bird received one test trial , one control trial and four baseline trials .
During test trials , the two side walls were removed allowing the bird to enter the enclosure from the sides parallel to the row of the containers .
In order to remain in the testing phase , the bird was required to obtain the correct position in the first attempt on three out of four baseline trials .
5. Analysis
The mean percentages ( ( number of pecks to a given position / 20 ) × 100 ) of pecks made per test by the nutcrackers and by the chicks ( either trained on the fourth or on the sixth position ) to the correct positions ( both from the left and from the right end of the test series ) were computed .
One - sample two - tailed t- tests were used to assess significant departures from chance level ( 6.250 % , i.e. the probability to peck by chance at each of the 16 positions in a given trial , 100/16 ) .
Overall , at test , birds showed a left - hemispace bias — selecting the location from the left - hand side more often than from the right - hand side ( figure 1 ) .

The reinforced positions have been highlighted .
The graph represents the mean percentages with s.e.m. ( ( number of pecks to a given position / 20 ) × 100 ) of pecks emitted at test by the nutcrackers and by the chicks ( either trained on the fourth or on the sixth position ) to the correct positions ( both from the left and from the right end of the test series ) .
Filled bars , nutcrackers ( n = 10 ) ; open bars , chicks ( n = 14 ) .
Below the graph is shown the left–right - oriented test series , highlighting the reinforced positions during training .
The chicks selectively chose the correct position significantly above chance only when locating it from the left end : chicks trained on the fourth position ( means ± s.e.m. : 24.125 ± 5.965 , t( 7 ) = 2.997 ; p = 0.020 ) or on the sixth position ( means ± s.e.m. : 39.167 ± 10.833 , t(5 ) = 3.025 ; p = 0.029 ) .
All other positions in the series were pecked either at or below chance level , even the correct positions from the right end : fourth position from right ( means ± s.e.m. : 9.375 ± 5.039 , t( 7 ) = 0.620 ; p = 0.555 ) , sixth position from right ( means ± s.e.m. : 2.500 ± 1.708 ) .
Thus chicks showed a bias to choose the correct position from the left - hand side significantly more often than the correct position from the right - hand side .
The nutcrackers chose the correct position significantly above chance despite the rotation of the array by 90° .
The fourth position from the left end was chosen significantly more than expected by chance ( mean ± s.e.m. : 23.000 ± 5.385 , t( 4 ) = 3.111 , p = 0.036 ) , and so was the sixth position from the left end ( mean ± s.e.m. : 26.000 ± 5.099 , t( 4 ) = 3.873 , p = 0.018 ) .
Although the birds trained on the sixth position showed an increase in choices to the sixth position from the right , this was not significantly different from chance ( mean ± s.e.m. : 19.000 ± 6.782 , t( 4 ) = 1.881 , p = 0.133 ) .
All other positions were chosen either at or below chance level ( including the fourth position from the right ( mean ± s.e.m. : 7.000 ± 3.391 , t( 4 ) = 0.221 , p = 0.836 ) .
Both groups of birds showed a bias for the container in the correct position located on the left - hand side .
Thus , the birds were able to determine the correct container based on its ordinal position starting from the left - hand side .
6. Discussion
Both species performed successfully at test , when some of the non-numerical cues available during training , such as distance from the starting point and walking time , could not be employed to solve the task ( although they could still rely on the distance of the correct position from the beginning of the series ) .
Interestingly , when locating an object in a series of identical objects on the basis of its ordinal position both species showed a leftward bias .
Our results indicate for the first time that a disposition to map the numerical number line from left to right exists in non-human , non-linguistic species , possibly as a result of right hemispheric dominance in visuospatial tasks , resulting in the left visual hemifield controlling the birds ' behaviour ( Diekamp et al .
2005 ; Regolin 2006 ; and for similarity with humans see Vallortigara & Rogers 2005 ) .
The results with chicks support the fact that such a disposition is apparent very early in development .
As stated in §1 , however , the parallel with the human condition should be considered with caution .
Effects associated with the left - to - right orientation in the mental number line in humans ( such as the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes — SNARC effect , Dehaene 1993 ) are linked to magnitude estimation , which is clearly absent in our task .
This aspect may be specific for humans only .
Further comparative research , with more complex ordinal tasks involving magnitude estimation is needed .

KEENE , N.Y. ( AP ) —
In the male - dominated sport of rock climbing , few women are working as professional guides .
Although there are many resident climbers and at least nine guide services in or near the six - million - acre Adirondack Park , only two women work as full - time guides there during the summer and winter seasons .
Although some men do not want to climb with a woman who is better than they are , Emilie Drinkwater said that most of her clients did not seem to care about gender and that some even thought women would use better judgment and more caution .
“ I am a conservative climber , ” Drinkwater said .
“ I am totally afraid of falling .
I avoid it as much as I can . ”
The battle between Japan and anti-whaling activists will be played out in a Tokyo courtroom today with the start of the trial of Peter Bethune , who was arrested after clambering aboard a Japanese whaling ship earlier this year .
Bethune , of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group , faces five charges : trespass , assault , illegal possession of a knife , destruction of property and obstruction of business .
These crimes carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison .
Dan Harris , a Sea Shepherd lawyer who visited Bethune in detention yesterday , said the activist was " unbelievably well .
He 's in really good spirits , very healthy and excited about having the opportunity to explain himself to the world . "
Harris said prosecutors were expected to demand a jail sentence of between two and a half and three years .
" We are far more optimistic , " he said .
" Our focus is on getting Pete out of Japan as quickly as possible .
" He is very proud of his role in reducing the whale catch and spreading the word about what is really happening in the Southern Ocean .
He feels that whatever sentence he gets , it will have been worth it .
He has no regrets . "
A verdict is expected on 10 June , with sentencing up to four weeks later , Harris said .
Bethune , a 45 - year - old New Zealander , was arrested after jumping on to the Shonan Maru 2 in February to protest against the sinking the previous month of the Ady Gil , Sea Shepherd 's powerboat .
The boat , which Bethune skippered , was sliced in two during a collision with the Japanese vessel and later sank .
Sea Shepherd had been using the Ady Gil to pursue and harass the whaling fleet during its annual " research " whaling expedition to the Antarctic .
The group regards Bethune as a political prisoner .
" We are taking the trial very seriously and have confidence in the Japanese system to act fairly and send Pete home , " said Jeff Hansen , Sea Shepherd 's director for Australia .
" It is horrendous what he 's been through , so we hope Japan comes to its senses and exercises good judgment . "
Under cover of darkness , Bethune leaped on to the harpoon boat from a jetski in an attempt to carry out a citizen 's arrest of the captain and present him with a $ 3 m ( £ 2.08 m ) bill for the loss of the powerboat .
He was held on board and arrested on 12 March when the ship returned to Japan .
He has been held at Tokyo detention centre ever since .
In an interview with New Zealand 's Sunday Star - Times , Bethune said he stood " a 95 % chance " of being convicted and serving a long prison term .
He said he had been escorted by more than 100 security guards when he was taken back to the Shonan Maru 2 to re-enact the boarding : " I had a hood over me , like I 'm a psychopathic killer .
It was bizarre . "
Hansen urged Australia and New Zealand to increase pressure on Japan to end its culls in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and to secure Bethune 's release .
" I do n't think either government has done nearly enough for Pete , " he said .
" The Australian government promised two years ago to stop the whale hunts , yet we still have volunteers like Pete putting their lives on the line .
Recent years have been marked by dangerous clashes on the high seas between whalers armed with water cannon and Sea Shepherd members , whose tactics include hurling parcels of rancid butter on to the decks of whaling ships .
Japan claims
Bethune was part of a butyric acid attack that left one whaler with burns to his face .
It has also issued an international warrant for the arrest of Paul Watson , Sea Shepherd 's founder , for endangering the lives of whaling crews by masterminding attacks on their ships .
Watson described Bethune as a " prisoner of war " , and demanded that the captain of the Shonan Maru 2 be questioned over the Ady Gil sinking .
The trial opens as the International Whaling Commission prepares to meet in Morocco to discuss a controversial proposal that would allow Japan , Norway and Iceland to hunt a limited number of whales commercially in return for reducing their catch over the next decade .
The 1986 ban on commercial whaling allows Japan to kill whales for " lethal research " and sell the meat on the open market .
The leader of the whaling fleet blamed harassment by Sea Shepherd activists after his crew returned last month with about half its target catch of 935 whales .
Medical study : protein builds more muscle mass with fish oil
Take 5 - 8 fish - oil caps daily , and you 'll get more muscle out of your protein shakes .
This is the message if you read between lines of a 2003 medical study .
An international research group gave protein supplements to two hundred people in hospital with cancer of the pancreas .
The supplements worked better when N - 3 fatty acid EPA was added to them .
Many cancer patients lose weight – and therefore also muscle mass – because the illness combined with the medicine they take make them too nauseous to eat .
This weight loss – doctors call it cachexia – weakens the patients and reduces their chances of survival .
The researchers looked at whether they could do something about this by giving the patients protein supplements manufactured by Abbott Laboratories .
The supplements came in 237 ml cans , each of which contained 16 g protein .
The researchers tried to get their subjects to drink 2 a day , but on average the patients only managed 1.4 cans a day .
The control group drank cans containing only protein .
The experimental group drank protein shake to which 1.1 g EPA had been added .
The researchers also added antioxidants that protect the N - 3 fatty acids from oxidising in the body .
These included vitamin A , C , E and selenium .
The energy content of all cans was 310 kcal .
Before the experiment started the subjects were losing about 2 kg weight per month .
This amount was considerably reduced when they started taking the protein supplements .
But even more significant is the subjects ' development of lean body mass .
The addition of EPA to the protein just about doubled the increase in lean body mass [ and so also the increase in muscle mass ] .
The stimulatory effect of the N - 3 fatty acids is clearer if you look at the relationship between the number of cans that the subjects drank and the increase in their lean body mass .
The first figure below shows the results for the patients who took the ordinary supplement .
The figure further down is for the patients who drank the EPA enriched mixture .
Extra protein in combination with fish fatty acids stimulates muscle building , the study shows .
So is the same true for strength athletes ?
Going on what recent research has taught us about N - 3 fatty acids , you 'd be inclined to say yes .
Here 's another calculation .
The test subjects took an average of 1.5 g EPA / day .
A cheap 1000 mg fish - oil capsule contains 180 mg EPA .
If it 's only EPA that stimulates muscle building , then you 'd need to take 8 fish - oil capsules a day .
But the same fish - oil capsules also contain 120 mg DHA .
If DHA works as well as EPA ( and we think that it does ) , then 5 fish - oil capsules a day would be enough .

It 's difficult to recall a judge using more damning language in a white - collar case , so consider the depth of premeditated wrongdoing necessary to elicit these words from U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor in describing what he found to be an illegal $ 62 - million tax shelter erected by the late founder of EMC , Richard Egan , in conjunction with family members and advisers .
" In short , the Fidelity High Tech and Fidelity International transactions were complete shams , without any economic substance of any kind .
...
" None of the participants in these complex transactions believed that they were real business transactions , with any purpose other than tax avoidance .
Indeed , it is highly doubtful that any participant believed , even for a minute , that the transactions would withstand legal scrutiny if discovered .
...
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
" No one with the slightest understanding of the tax laws could reasonably believe that $ 160 million in basis could be created out of thin air , or that $ 160 million in income could be made to vanish in a puff of smoke , " he wrote .
" ... the transactions at issue were ' real ' only in the sense that a performance by actors on stage is 'real .
No one watching ' Macbeth ' believes that they are witnessing the murder of a Scottish king , and the actors do not believe it either . "
Nevertheless , Egan 's son Michael continues to insist that it is his family that is the victim here , telling the Boston Globe of his disappointment in seeing press reports describe his father as a tax cheat : " We paid the tax .
This was essentially a request to get our money back . ''
They paid the tax only after getting caught , and those press reports might have something to do with the fact that the IRS , and now Judge Saylor , are screaming at the top of their lungs that Richard Egan was a tax cheat .
A Business Week / Bloomberg report sketches the outlines of the outlawed tax shelter Egan used , which was known as " Son of Boss . "
The Internal Revenue Service outlawed the Son of Boss transaction in August 2000 , something the Egans and their advisers were aware of , Saylor wrote .
The transaction was widely used in the late 1990s ; in 2004 , about 1,500 people settled with the IRS in exchange for reduced penalties , paying more than $ 6 billion .
The shelter " involved creating transactions with offsetting positions , which by itself meant that there was no economic risk , " said Howard Medwed , a partner in the Boston law firm Burns & Levinson LLP who was n't involved in the case .
The Egans did n't settle .
They deposited $ 62.1 million with the IRS and sued the government in 2005 to get the money back .
Saylor wrote that a " significant feature of the scheme " was the reliance on legal opinions provided by four law firms that the transaction was legitimate .
This story in the MetroWest Daily News notes that Egan did much for the town of Hopkinton , Mass. , where he lived and EMC is headquartered .
I live in Hopkinton myself and have seen first - hand the good corporate citizenship of the company ; my children have spent many an hour playing at EMC Park .
Do n't blame me for wondering , though , if he paid his fair share of property taxes .
Eagan died last August of a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
He was battling cancer at the time .

“ Nothing happens on Bloor Street , ” the thirtysomething fellow said as he exhaled a stream of cigarette smoke in my direction , “ without us knowing about it . ”
He and his pals were standing near the corner of Bloor and Bathurst , just outside Lee ’s Palace .
It was about 9:30 on a Monday evening , and as he spoke , more and more of his pals appeared out of the darkness .
As they walked up , they tapped fists and greeted each other monosyllabically .
The boys were streaming from the bars .
The Montreal - Pittsburgh game was over , the Habs had won , and Bloor Street was getting noisy .
It appeared downright unpleasant .
I was at the corner with my 17 - year - old son , Michel , and 19 - year - old daughter , Ewa Frances , trying to unleash Ewa ’s bike , which was locked to a utility pole .
She had been downtown looking for a summer job when she locked her 18 - speed to the pole .
The key broke off in the lock .
It was an expensive Kryptonite U - shaped item .
She returned home via TTC and back we headed downtown , armed with a hacksaw and hope .
After about 10 minutes of futile sawing , we were about to give up .
But we really did not want to abandon the new bicycle to the wilds of downtown .
Of course , as we tugged and sawed and pushed , passers - by offered opinions and observations .
“ I ’ve been there before , ” one soft - spoken woman offered .
“ But I was near a fire station and they brought out the jaws of life .
The lock even bent them outta shape . ”
Another man was more abrupt : “ That , ” he said , referring to our hacksawing , “ is not going to work . ”
Shortly , a few tough - looking , swarthy types swaggered out of the nearby Tim Hortons .
After checking out our helpless selves , one suggested we get a car jack , lever it into the lock and jack it apart .
Then another said , “ What you need is a grinder .
That ’s what the city does when they want to get rid of bikes — they use a grinder . ”
His pal surprised us with ; “ I have one at home .
I ’ll go get it .
I ’ll be right back . ”
He had a buzz cut , earrings and a low - riding VW parked illegally in the nearby laneway .
When I said , “ You do n’t have to do this , ” he responded with , “ Nah. Really . ”
He headed home .
His pals hung around .
They swapped yarns , talked hockey and greeted the ever - expanding group of allies .
I felt like I was being surrounded by a local gang of guardian angels .
One was a truck driver .
One a city worker .
Another a supply teacher .
They were all from the ’hood .
Most had attended Harbord Collegiate .
We waited , and they high - fived the Habs fans and greeted the guys on the street .
The crowd got bigger .
One asked if the other approved of his new girlfriend , adding , “ But I ai n’t bringing her around to meet you .
I do n’t trust you . ”
His friend countered with , “ But I ’m married now !
I have somebody . ”
“ Oh , ” Mr. New Boyfriend said , “ I guess it ’d be okay then . ”

After 20 minutes or so , the VW guy returned with a grinder and a long extension cord .
Where to plug it in ?
I said “ I ’ll take it into the Tim Horton ’s ” and Mr. Bloor Street said , “ No , not you . . . you wo n’t be able to do it . ”
One of the younger ones — an apprentice tough - looking guy — hauled the cord into the Timmie ’s and plugged it into an outlet near the front door .
But not before climbing up onto the counter to reach it .
The Tim Hortons clerk watched in amazement .
Outside , the grinder guy told me to stand back .
“ Cover your eyes , sir , ” he said .
As his friends cheered him on , he leaned in and the sparks flew .
The noise was well , grinding , and fire lit up the night .
Right when he was getting going , two police officers walked out of the laneway , past his illegally parked VW , and directly towards the flame .
I said , “ Evenin ’ gentlemen , ” and had my explanation all prepared .
They walked right past us all , not even glancing in the direction of the excitement .
They crossed Bloor and entered a store on the other side .
At the same time as the crowd eyed the grinding sparks , they kept an eye on the police .
Maybe the officers knew the lads .
Maybe they knew that these guys were only up to good .
The grinding worked .
Five minutes in , and the Kryptonite lock was in pieces .
Applause broke out .
Slaps on the back , high fives , and the cops stayed in the store .
Mr. Grinder accepted a small tip for his trouble ; his pals just wanted photographic evidence .
We left , and the gang dispersed , I suppose to make sure nothing else happened on Bloor Street without them knowing about it .

More from the archives : this is a clipping from the Deseret News of Salt Lake City - the edition of 8th September 1972 .
It carries details of an interview with Hubert Lamb , the founder of the Climatic Research Unit , in which the great man discusses the impending ice age .
This is interesting because I seem to remember William Connolley writing a paper that said that fears of an impending ice age were largely confined to the press .
I guess this is only a newspaper story , but if reputable scientists were spinning baseless scare stories then the poor hacks can hardly be blamed for reporting what was said .
I wonder if this kind of thing is the modus operandi among CRU scientists ...

BANGKOK , Thailand —
Wild battles and torched malls now light up Bangkok , currently suffering one of its most unruly chapters ever .
After occupying sectors of Bangkok for 10 weeks , protesters demanding the ruling party ’s downfall finally dispersed when soldiers overran their encampment .
But while most protesters from the so - called “ Red Shirts ” faction have returned home , a faceless band of hardliners has remained to wage an arson campaign .
As Thailand slips further into chaos , and the struggle ’s death toll ticks towards 70 , here are the five things you need to know about the current crisis :
1 ) Who are the Red Shirts ?
A self - proclaimed faction of “ commoners ” embittered that their favored political parties have been dissolved for fraud .
Though comprised largely of working - class
Thais , they are loyal to a billionaire : cop-turned - telecom mogul Thaksin Shinawatra , who reigned as premier before the military ousted him in a 2006 coup .
Their main stated goal has been new elections , an outcome many leading media outlets and academics have suggested is the best way forward .
But they also seek to end the “ rule of the elites , ” a call to action interpreted peacefully by some and violently by others .
The Red Shirts , calling themselves “ Asia ’s largest democracy movement , ” have embraced the rhetoric of peaceful disobedience .
But they have also threatened bloody reprisals ; one hardline leader prophetically warned Bangkok would become a “ sea of fire ” if the government would not yield .
2 ) Who ’s burning down Bangkok ?
A masked mob detached from any visible leadership .
But recent military crackdowns against anti-government protesters , including assault rifle strikes that have killed dozens , are clearly their inspiration .
The movement ’s “ fight to the death ” speechmaking , and failure to contain its militant streak , appears responsible for the current mayhem waged in its name .
As fires consumed parts of the Thai capital , a radical splinter group known as “ Red Siam ” sent an email to reporters claiming that “ any attempt of ‘ democratic reform ’ has now ended .
From today , we begin the journey of democratic revolution of Thailand until we achieve one . ”
3 ) Is this civil war ?
Not yet .
But both protesters and the government have claimed excesses from the other side — killing protesters with sniper rifles ; killing soldiers with grenade launchers — are pushing Thailand in that direction .
These grim forewarnings of civil war misleadingly conjure images of Rwandan genocide or the North vs. South separatism of the American Civil War .
But many foresee this “ civil war ” scenario playing out more like the Basque separatist movement in Spain : an underground movement of sporadic bombings and other attacks that destabilize but do n’t destroy the country .
“ They could go underground , basing themselves in the provinces , ” said Prateep Ungsongtham Hata , an activist sympathetic to the Red Shirts who decries the current shift towards militancy .
“ When you ca n’t fight openly , you become unseen . ”
4 ) Why does America care ?
Thailand and the U.S. are old Vietnam War buddies , bonded decades ago by a common fear of communism ’s Southeast Asian spread .
Thailand is also America ’s oldest Asian treaty ally , a major exporter to the U.S. and a tourist destination for more than 660,000 Americans each year .
But as China ’s influence rises , particularly in Southeast Asia , Thailand is strategically important as a counterweight to Chinese influence .
Each year , the U.S. and Thailand stage the world ’s largest war games on Thai soil — a projection of American strength in China ’s backyard .
A stable , America - friendly Thailand is a big priority for the State Department .
5 ) Is Thailand still safe for tourists ?
More so than it appears .
Its beaches are still among the world ’s most beautiful and its jungles are still lush and enchanting .
These tourist draws are accessible without coming anywhere near Bangkok ’s conflicts , largely contained to a 2.5 - square mile area .
Most incoming flights land in Suvarnabhumi Airport , located in Greater Bangkok , and connection flights to peaceful tourist cities have been unaffected .
And though the images from Bangkok appear hellish , few bystanders and work - a- day Thais have been injured .
Even in conflict zones , foreigners are not singled out for violence .
Quite the opposite : protesters have been desperate for international approval and the government has fretted over a plunge in tourist arrivals .
The crisis has affected most in Bangkok through inconvenience .
The city ’s commuter trains have shut down , its office towers have been temporarily shuttered and several of its nightlife districts have gone quiet .
Clinton Keith shows how designers can embrace the benefit of emergent design .
No designer has a crystal ball about any mechanic .
Instead , they need to ensure that their vision is communicated and open to all potential ideas .

When I first started working on games professionally in the early nineties , the role of designer was being instituted throughout the industry .
Following the mold of prominent designers such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Sid Meier , designers were seen as directors of the game , or at least the people who came up with many of the ideas .
The role required communication with the team on a daily basis but not much written documentation .
As technical complexity , team size , and project durations grew , the role of the designer became more delineated .
Some projects had teams of designers who specialized in writing stories , scripting , tuning characters , or creating audio .
Hierarchies emerged to include lead , senior , associate , or assistant designers , among others .
The overhead of communication with large teams and the cost of longer development efforts led to a demand for certainty from the stakeholders .
Large detailed design documents attempted to create that certainty , but at best they only deferred its reckoning .
This chapter examines how agile can help reverse this trend .
Viewpoint " Designers are the chief proponents for the player .
This has not changed in 20 years of game development .
Though titles and roles have changed , designers look out for gameplay and quality of the product from a player 's perspective .
" When teams were small — with ten or less people — this could be done easily ; it was a series of conversations while textures were created and code was written .
The design was natural and organic as it emerged from the team .
' Horse swaps ' could easily occur .
For example , trading a very difficult - to - build mechanic for an easy one that still achieved the same gameplay vision was relatively simple .
" However , in the past ten years , teams have begun to balloon , first to the 30 - to 50 - person teams of the nineties and then finally to the occasional several - hundred - person monstrosities of the 2000s .
A single designer could not have all the conversations that needed to happen ( even several designers have problems ) .
As a result , documentation began to surface that outlined the product as a whole , from the very high level to the very granular .
Although this paints the initial vision of the title , it does away with one of the most important facets of any type of product development : the dialogue .
" Scrum addresses this .
Five - to ten-person cross - discipline Scrum teams usually include a designer .
Each of these designers is entrusted by the lead designer to understand the key vision elements and speak to the team . "
— Rory McGuire , game designer
The Problems
What are some of the problems that face developers on large projects ?
The two most common problems are the creation of large documents at the start of a project and the rush at the end of the project to cobble something together to ship .
Designs Do Not Create Knowledge
Originally when designers were asked to write design documents , they rebelled .
Writing a design document seemed like an exercise to placate a publisher or commit the designers to decisions they were n't ready to make .
Over time this attitude toward documentation has changed .
Writing design documents has become the focus for many designers .
It 's felt that this is the easiest way to communicate vision to both the stakeholders and a large project team .
Designers need to create a vision , but design documents can go too far beyond this and speculate instead .
Once , on a fantasy shooter game I worked on , the designers not only defined all the weapons in the design document but how many clips the player could hold and how many bullets each clip contained !
This level of detail did n't help the team .
In fact , for a while , it led them in the wrong direction .
The Game Emerges at the End
At the end of a typical game project , when all the features are being integrated , optimized , and debugged , life becomes complicated for the designer .
This is the first time they experience a potentially shippable version of the game .
At this point it typically bears little resemblance to what was defined in the design document , but it 's too late to dwell on that .
Marketing and QA staffs are ramping up , and disc production and marketing campaigns are scheduled .
The true performance of the technology begins to emerge , and it 's usually less than what was planned for during production .
This requires that budgets be slashed .
For example , waves of enemy characters become trickles , detailed textures are decimated , and props are thinned out .
Because of deadlines , key features that are " at 90 % " are cut regardless of their value .
As a result , the game that emerges at beta is a shadow of what was speculated in the design document .
However , it 's time to polish what remains for shipping .
True to his image as the wisecracking gunslinger , Ronald Reagan was wearing a plaid shirt and cowboy boots when he walked on to the stage to debate President Jimmy Carter .
It was October 1980 .
With the polls deadlocked and just a week to go before the American people voted , the rhetorical confrontation between the two leading candidates for the presidency was important .
Confident as ever , Reagan sauntered out beneath the spotlights with a cheerful grin .
And then Carter went for him .
He read out old Reagan quotations in a mocking tone ; he reacted to Reagan 's answers by shaking his head and saying , scornfully , " That 's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard " ; he pointed accusingly after one reply and said : " This just demonstrates his shallowness . "
Meanwhile , the so - called Great Communicator seemed all over the place .
His performance was " miserable " , his opponent later recalled .
" I was shocked .
He could n't fill up the time .
His answers were n't long enough .
And what time he could fill , he filled with woolly platitudes . "
It was lucky for Reagan that nobody saw his lamentable performance , but then they were never going to .
It was a rehearsal , not the real thing : the stage had been set up under spotlights in a garage in Virginia , and his " opponent " was the Republican congressman David Stockman , who had prepared using a stolen copy of the Democrats ' briefing book .
He played Jimmy Carter better than the president did himself .
Afterwards , Stockman drove home in a mood of silent despair , convinced that Reagan , with no time for another rehearsal , was about to throw away the election on television .
Now that Britain 's political leaders have decided to follow their US counterparts by agreeing to take part in a series of three televised debates to be held on 15 , 22 and 29 April , it is a safe bet that Gordon Brown , David Cameron and Nick Clegg will have seen more than a few clips of Reagan 's performance a few days later .
Like him , they will have spent hours learning their lines , working on their put - downs , honing their impersonations of seriousness , sincerity and compassion .
Like him , they will have made more than a few howlers in rehearsal ; apparently , Brown has been practising against Alastair Campbell , while in Cameron 's rehearsals , Michael Gove plays Brown and Jeremy Hunt plays Clegg .
Above all , though , they should have learned the single biggest lesson from the history of televised debates : what matters is not substance , but style .
Dangerous territory
From the moment Reagan and Carter walked out beneath the lights in Cleveland , Ohio , it was clear that the difference between them was as much physical as ideological .
Drained after four years in the Oval Office , Carter looked stiff and nervous , his eyes puffy , his face taut with tension .
Reagan looked younger than his 69 years ( a reminder that every candidate needs a good make - up artist ) : tall , calm , determined .
Before they started , he strode across to Carter and held out his hand - a gesture that took the president by surprise , and brought home the difference in stature and confidence between the two .
Like most such encounters , Reagan - Carter was less a genuine debate than a chance for the candidates to speak their prepared lines and to remind the viewers of their most popular positions .
As Brown's , Cameron 's and Clegg 's handlers should have told them , the trick is to work with viewers ' preconceptions , deftly neutralising sensitive issues and steering the conversation on to familiar territory .
In 1980 , Reagan 's very first answer - " I 'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace " - was designed to puncture Democratic claims that he was a warmonger .
He used the word " peace " more than almost any other , and when Carter accused him of reckless belligerence , he had the perfect reply .
" I have seen four wars in my lifetime .
I 'm a father of sons ; I have a grandson , " he said seriously .
" I do n't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific , or rice paddies and jungles in Asia , or the muddy , bloody battlefields of Europe . "
There are two other lessons for Britain 's debaters in Reagan 's performance that evening .
One is the familiar point that voters prefer the man they might have a beer with to the man who knows all the answers .
At first , commentators thought the president had shaded the debate , because " by every measure except aw - shucks niceness " , as the pundit Morton Kondracke put it , " Carter was the clearly superior performer " .
But " aw - shucks niceness " is probably the biggest weapon in a debater 's armoury .
Brown 's handlers will surely have told him that knocking Cameron about the stage , even if only rhetorically , is not enough : a successful debater needs to be liked , not just
respected .
It is no accident , after all , that the best - known line of that 1980 debate was Reagan 's half - laughing , half - sorrowful quip : " There you go again . "
This was an exercise in evasion , a weak joke made after Carter 's perfectly good point that Reagan had opposed the Medicare programme back in the 1960s .
But nobody remembers Carter 's attack now .
In a gladiatorial setting where personality counts for more than policies , it is better to be funny and friendly - as George W Bush 's aides told him in 2000 - than a grim - faced know - all .
The other lesson from Reagan 's performance is that there is no substitute for a good scriptwriter .
Reagan 's opponents often derided him as a mere actor , but his years in Hollywood had taught him that a performer is only as good as the man who writes his lines .
In David Gergen , Reagan had one of the best .
His peroration that night - " Are you better off now than you were four years ago ?
Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago ?
Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago ?
Is America as respected throughout the world as it was ?
Do you feel that our security is as safe , that we 're as strong as we were four years ago ? " - was devastating in its simplicity , not least because Carter 's record made it unanswerable .
There is a lesson in this for Cameron 's aides : when times are hard , make the debate a referendum on your opponent 's record .
There 's no need to talk about your own policies if you can score points by mentioning his .
If Brown 's aides have any sense , they will have looked closely at Carter 's performance that night .
It is no good being a master of detail if nobody likes you , and banging on about your experience - Carter mentioned the " Oval Office " ten times in an hour - is generally a waste of time .
If voters cared only about experience , the older candidate would always win and Margaret Thatcher would still be in power .
Secret weapon
Above all , though , Carter 's performance is a reminder that candidates should stick to the script .
In rehearsals , the president had suggested that when the subject of nuclear weapons came up , he could mention his 13 - year - old daughter 's fears of a world war .
His aides thought it was a terrible idea .
But under the heat of the lights , and in front of 100 million Americans , Carter decided to do it anyway .
“ I had a discussion with my daughter , Amy , the other day , before I came here , to ask her what the most important issue was , " he said .
" She said she thought nuclear weaponry , and the control of nuclear arms . "
It was a trite and shameless bid for public sympathy .
" Oh my God , not that ! " exclaimed Carter 's media chief , watching backstage .
" It 's so bad that it 's funny ! "
There is a place for candidates to mention their families , as long as they do it skilfully .
But if the Prime Minister starts telling us what the six - year - old John Brown thinks about the deficit , we will know he is in trouble .
In many ways , the Reagan - Carter clash was a reminder of everything that is wrong with televised debates : their fixation with personality rather than policy , their obsession with the image rather than the word , their emphasis on the individual rather than the party .
And yet , those who worry that such debates will come to dominate British elections can take heart from the American experience .
The Reagan - Carter debate , held so close to election day , was fresh in voters ' minds as they cast their ballots , but by and large these clashes make very little difference to the result .
Most of them are constipated affairs .
Is there anyone out there who remembers the two Clinton - Dole debates , or can quote a single line from the three Bush - Gore encounters , or would voluntarily watch the three Obama - McCain clashes again ?
Top of the pops
Even the debates that have gone down in history were far less interesting than is often recalled .
All that voters learned from four hours of Kennedy - Nixon in 1960 was that they had the same policies but Nixon wore less make - up .
To be sure , television viewers thought that Kennedy had won , but the narrowing of the polls afterwards punctures the myth that this guaranteed him the election .
Even Gerald Ford 's insistence in 1976 that there was " no Soviet domination of eastern Europe " did not really matter : after a brief blip in the polls , the president recovered and went into election day neck and neck with his challenger .
If every election produced something like Reagan - Carter , it would be good television but bad politics .
Until now , British leaders have resisted debates , and for a very good reason : not only do they score points off one another every week in the House of Commons anyway , but we are meant to live in a parliamentary system , not a presidential one .
Probably the wisest thing anyone has ever said about televised debates came from , of all people , Alec Douglas - Home .
Asked if he fancied debating Harold Wilson in 1964 , he shook his head .
" If you are n't careful , you know , you 'll get , what 's it called ?
A sort of Top of the Pops , " he said .
" You 'll then get the best actor as leader of the country and the actor will be prompted by a scriptwriter .
I 'd rather have our old ways really and put our policies firmly in front of our people . "
Let the battle commence .

In the end they were neither animal , vegetable nor mineral .
Nor , as some cynics had predicted , did they resemble white elephants .
Instead , Wenlock and Mandeville , the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic mascots , elicited mostly baffled reactions as to just what they were at their unveiling today .
With a metallic finish , a single large eye made out of a camera lens , a London taxi light on their heads and the Olympic rings represented as friendship bracelets on their wrists , they resemble characters dreamed up for a Pixar animation .
But London 2012 organisers , for whom the launch of the mascots marks the start of a crucial period in which the games will become public property , pointed to the delighted reaction of a hall full of primary school children at today 's launch as evidence that they would connect with their target audience .
" They remind you of aliens , which is really weird and cool , " said 10 - year - old Ali .
" It reminds you of the Olympics , which is worldwide so it 's something you 'll want to remember forever , " added 11 - year - old Zanyab as they cavorted with life - size mascots for the cameras .
The pair are based on a short story by children 's author Michael Morpurgo that tells how they were fashioned from droplets of the steel used to build the Olympic stadium .
They will be crucial in raising funds and spreading messages about the games .
Wenlock , named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock that helped inspire Pierre de Coubertin to launch the modern Olympics , and Mandeville , inspired by the Buckinghamshire town of Stoke Mandeville , where the Paralympics were founded , will become very familiar in the next two years .
The chairman of the London organising committee of the Olympic games ( Locog ) , Lord Coe , said the mascots were aimed squarely at children and designed with the digital age in mind .
He said they had the most positive reaction in workshops to road test them .
Among the designs rejected at the start of an open pitch process were anthropomorphic pigeons , an animated tea pot and a Big Ben with arms and legs .
Children will be encouraged to interact with the characters , inviting them via Facebook , Twitter and the web to visit their school and , said Coe , inspiring them to take up different sports .
" The story itself is very rooted in the nations and regions .
Young people will be able to decide where they go , what sports they pick up .
There is a real interactivity there , it is a language and a flexibility that is driven by young people , " he said .
The pair were introduced in an animated film that followed their story from the Bolton steelworks where the frame of the Olympic stadium was made .
They will become a range of up to 30 cuddly toys , including versions based on celebrities and sports stars , as well as adorning badges , T - shirts , mugs and more .
Organisers hope Wenlock and Mandeville will rank alongside the more fondly remembered mascots , such as Waldi the dachshund from the 1972 Munich games and Misha the bear from the 1980 Moscow Olympics – rather than the much maligned Izzy of Atlanta 1996 .
" The games have got a few stupendous assets – the mascot , tickets , the volunteers , the torch relay – and you have got to really use those to bring home your key messages , " said Locog 's chief executive , Paul Deighton .
" If you link them together you begin to have a really powerful story that people will respond to . "
The unveiling of the bold London Olympics logo in 2007 was controversial , with many criticising its graffiti - like design .
Organisers , who hired Wolff Olins at a cost of £ 400,000 to design it , stood firm , arguing that it was supremely adaptable and perfect for the digital age .
But they were forced to withdraw a launch film after it emerged that it had the potential to trigger epileptic seizures .
The mascots , conceived by London design agency Iris and costing , said Deighton , just " a few thousand pounds " , are an important staging post from a financial and marketing point of view .
They will pour up to £ 15 m into the coffers of the organising committee via dozens of licensing deals , part of an overall licensing target of £ 70 m to £ 80 m towards Locog 's £ 2bn privately raised budget .
In 1984 , the Los Angeles games ushered in the money - spinning Olympic era .
The event was the first to use its Disney - designed mascot to raise funds , since when they have become a cash cow for organisers .
But the story behind the mascots is also designed to help make the Olympics relevant to the whole nation .
That will be crucial if organisers are to maintain support for a project that is also costing the public £ 9.3bn , particularly as cuts in public services begin to bite .
After a spell of behind - the - scenes work devoted to raising £ 700 m in sponsorship revenues , Locog is entering a more public phase when everything it does , from the unveiling of the mascot to its ticket pricing policy , will come under scrutiny .
Ted Haggard ’s publicist said Thursday that the ousted founder of New Life Church will announce plans for his future at a news conference at his Colorado Springs home Wednesday morning .
Haggard ’s spokesman said he would make a “ surprising ” and “ groundbreaking ” announcement with his family .
Haggard and his wife , Gayle , on April 29 incorporated a new church , St. James , at their home at 1865 Old Ranch Road .
At the time , Ted Haggard said it was done for accounting purposes as the couple managed dual speaking careers .
However , he did tell The Gazette in Colorado Springs that he likely would return to ministry one day and would n’t rule out that St. James would eventually become a real church .
Haggard was founder and senior pastor at the New Life megachurch for 25 years , until revelations about his relationship with a male prostitute and allegations about illegal drug purchases led to what he has called his exile in Arizona .
“ Excommunicated from his church , Ted disappeared into obscurity for the next two years , ” spokeswoman Amy Prenner said in a news release .
“ Now , after three and a half years , Ted is back with a surprising announcement . ”
The Haggards held two prayer meetings at their home in November , which attracted more than 100 people each time — overflow crowds for the couple ’s living room and even their second venue , the barn .

Allegations that former Victoria police chief commissioner Christine Nixon misled the Bushfires Royal Commission have been described as a " gratuitous personal attack " by counsel .
After more than a year of hearing evidence , Thursday 's final submissions from counsel assisting the commission focused on apportioning blame for failures of leadership during the Black Saturday bushfires .
Nearly 180 people died and more than 2,000 homes were destroyed when bushfires raged through large parts of Victoria in January and February last year .
Ms Nixon was singled out for criticism , along with Police and Emergency Services Minister Bob Cameron and retired chief officer of the Country Fire Authority , Russell Rees .
The inquiry 's lead lawyer , Jack Rush QC , recommended the commission find Ms Nixon gave misleading evidence when she detailed her whereabouts on Black Saturday .
He says Ms Nixon 's initial evidence failed to mention she had gone out for a meal on the night of February 7 , leaving the impression she continuously monitored the unfolding disaster .
" It was a deliberate omission , " he said .
But former Victorian attorney - general Jim Kennan SC , who appeared for Ms Nixon , says the allegations are " vague " and lack foundation .
" This is an attack on credit simply for its own sake , " he said .
" The facts relating to Ms Nixon 's conduct on the day in question are clear , they 're not in dispute and we say for that reason this recommendation should not be entertained .
" It does n't matter , we say , if she had the meal at home or had the meal out . "
Mr Kennan says Ms Nixon 's good character is beyond question and he has asked the commission to dismiss the recommendation .
Mr Rush began his recommendation by discussing the apparent failures of Mr Rees , who was accused of failing to adequately make sure the state was prepared for Black Saturday .
Mr Rees allegedly failed to get timely messages to communities under threat from the bushfires and failed to get involved in operational issues generally .
But Julian Burnside QC , acting for Mr Rees , says all the criticisms of his client were using the benefit of hindsight .
He says it was not Mr Rees and his senior management team that buckled under pressure , but rather the system itself .
" The fact that full information did n't get to Mr Rees on the 7th [ of February ] was itself something he did not know on the day , " he said .
" He did n't know that he was n't being told things that he needed to know . "
Finger pointing
Mr Burnside told the commission finger pointing is not constructive and only serves to distract the royal commission from its true purpose .
" The report of this commission should try , wherever possible , to reach findings that are constructive , not destructive , " he said .
Mr Rush also sought adverse findings against Mr Cameron .
" It is extraordinary the coordinator in chief , the Minister , would accept that those with the statutory responsibility for emergency management for leadership were not in a position to ensure a first - hand appreciation of the events as they unfolded , " Mr Rush said .
" Surely emergency response demands this .
A true leader would not contemplate anything else . "
Mr Rush attacked Mr Cameron 's and Ms Nixon 's decisions not to declare a state of disaster .
" We find it incredulous as to their lack on consideration that was given to their declaration of a state of disaster , " he said .
But the State Government 's lawyer , Allan Myers QC , urged the commission not to accept the findings recommended against any individuals .
" These recommendations are apt to undermine morale in those organisations , " he said .
" The criticisms give no adequate recognition to the extraordinary situation that existed on February 7 , 2009 .
" The individuals who were involved were subject to extraordinary pressures and it would be human to have overlooked things - to have made mistakes .
" We say please do n't criticise them for it - that wo n't help . "
Outside the commission , Premier John Brumby expressed confidence in his minister .

This question was recently posed ( and closed ! ) on stackoverflow .
The top voted reply is so good I thought I 'd replicate it here !
I 'm afraid all I know of the original author is their " Orphi " posting name .
It 's tongue - in - cheek and broadly true , although I 'd argue the details of a few points .
I think it 's interesting that it does n't contain the main reason blocking me from using it on a daily basis .
More on that in a moment .
First , here 's Orphi's response :
Nobody 's ever heard of it .
No one 's going to use something they do n't know exists .
It 's unpopular .
People assume that the most popular language is the best language , because if it was n't good , it would n't be popular .
This is actually untrue ; as you can see , the most popular language is the most popular language .
To put it another way , Haskell is unpopular because it 's unpopular .
This is what Haskell programmers refer to as " recursion " , and despite what imperative programmers tell you , it 's extremely common in The Real World .
It 's different .
People are always afraid of what 's different .
It 's difficult .
People think that Haskell is difficult to understand or difficult to learn .
This is almost certainly related to point # 3 .
It 's also related to the fact that the Haskell community is populated by people who casually remark " a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors , what 's the problem ? " and expect normal human beings to comprehend this .
It 's risky .
Most companies do n't want to be the first to use something .
Haskell is n't being used by many people , so not many people want to try it .
( See this recursive unpopularity argument again ? )
Can't hire programmers .
First , by # 2 , there are n't many programmers who already know Haskell .
Second , most people believe # 4 , which means you can't train programmers to use Haskell .
( At least , it would if it were actually true . )
A language that you can't hire programmers for is a very , very risky proposition indeed .
( Which leads us back to # 5 . ) Libraries .
This is probably the big one , so I 'm going to spend some time on it .
Quality .
We have the quantity .
We do not yet have the quality .
Most of Hackage is one - man hobby projects with little to no documentation .
Some of it is incomplete , some of it has long since bit-rotted , some of it malfunctions if used in certain ways .

The Outside World .
If you want a binary heap tree , Hackage probably provides a dozen implementations .
If you want to connect to an RPC server and fire off a few procedure calls ... good luck with that .
Same deal for talking to databases , accessing OS resources , manipulating binary file formats ...
You 'll basically have to write everything yourself from scratch .
This is a big deal for commercial work .

This is a big deal for commercial work .
Multiple incompatible libraries .
You can , in fact , connect to a database in Haskell .
Trouble is , at the last count there 's about a dozen libraries for doing this , and it 's bewildering trying to figure out which ones are actively supported and which ones are zombie projects that stopped working years ago .
It 's also not as simple as hooking up an ODBC connection ; there are different backends for each library and each DB target .
Yay . :-/

Windows .
Almost all the important libraries ( for cryptography , binary file formats , network protocols , data compression , talking to databases , etc. ) are Haskell wrappers around C libraries .
And these all fail to build on Windows .
Given that Windows is
the single biggest target platform on the market , this is a big deal .
Unpredictable performance .
This is way , way down at # 8 .
Most people do n't know enough about Haskell to even know this .
Most people just assume that " Haskell is slow " .
This is demonstrably untrue .
What is true is that it can be hard to predict the performance of a Haskell program .
Subtle , apparently irrelevant changes can sometimes make big performance differences .
Correctness .
Most companies do n't give a **** about correctness .
They do n't care about quality .
They just want to shovel code out the door as fast as possible and earn wads of cash .
If there are bugs , they 'll charge the customer money to fix them .
Getting code right is of no interest ; getting code fast is what counts .
Haskell is a language that rewards those who sit back and deeply analyse the problem , and then produce a beautiful solution .
Most companies do n't care for this approach ; let 's just hack something together as fast as possible , and worry about fixing it later ( i.e. , never ) .
There are a few places where correctness matters .
These are either safety - critical systems , or financial systems , generally .
I gather Haskell tends to be quite popular here .
One final pair of data points : I can still remember not so long ago hearing people cry " C++ is a toy language for n00bs !
You should use a proper programming language like C. "
Now take a look around you and see how many large - scale C++ programs there are .
People have been claiming that Lisp is " the next big thing " for , what , 40 years now ?
Lisp is older than almost every programming language in mainstream use .
And now many large - scale Lisp programs are there ?
Which fate awaits
Haskell , I do n't know .
I rather suspect all the good ideas of Haskell will be stolen by the likes of C# and hybrids like F# or OCaml , and people still wo n't ever use Haskell itself .
It 's just too different .
But anyway , as to why industry does n't use Haskell , see the points above .
It 's too rare , too unpopular , too weird , and has incomplete libraries .
That 's basically it , in a nutshell .
Embedding Haskell ?
The missing item for me is how hard it is to embed .
For my purposes , I need to embed Haskell within an existing C++ framework , not dissimilar to how you might embed Lua .
I need to do so in a compiler agnostic manner , where I retain control over how the embedding occurs ( i.e. compilation and linking ) and have significant influence over the operation of the runtime .
In short , Haskell must fit in to my existing C++ environment , not the other way round .
An interesting aspect of an " Embedded Haskell " would be you could remove most ( if not all ) of Haskell 's IO support if it made the job of embedding Haskell significantly easier .
The ability to efficiently embed ' pure '
Haskell would be a very interesting and useful tool in it 's own right .
It 's a simple idea , and therefore does n't take many words to state , but I 'm keen to not understate how significant this could be .
Incremental adoption
Playing the counter argument , it could be argued that my needs are rather domain specific and an Embedded Haskell is not likely to be important enough to aid mainstream adoption of Haskell .
This attitude does appear to be reflected in some parts of the Haskell community .
To start anecdotally , when I hear people propose writing something in Haskell , they generally imply the only option on the table is to write it in Haskell wholesale .
Most arguments about use of Haskell I have read online focus on this either - or situation .
For nearly all the reasons made in the quote above , this polarised position does n't appeal unless you have very tailored circumstances and considerable resources .
There is also evidence of a lack of emphasis at a more fundamental level .
GHC and the tools and libraries ecosystem that surround it are not designed with embedding as a goal .
GHC is primarily focused on producing stand alone executables , which it does very well .
Interoperability tools like Greencard immediately sideline the ability to call Haskell from C as having " little demand " .
Most emphasis is placed on wrapping C libraries for use in Haskell .
The best I can find online are some open student projects such as the ageing GSoC ticket # 1555 , or the Embedded Haskell thesis topic in the PLS group .
I believe this situation might be starting to change though , as the desire to remove the implementation obstacles surrounding much of Haskell 's inspiring research builds , and new developments such as the LLVM backend present additional options .
Wholesale adoption of Haskell is undeniably risky and definitely not the only way .
Incremental adoption is where it's at , and in a nutshell , that 's what Haskell is currently missing the most .
The worldwide financial crisis in 2008 , which led to what many in the United States now call the " Great Recession , " has caused researchers to rethink traditional economic theories of financial markets and the corporate world .
Even renowned financial theorist Michael Jensen , whose widely cited work has laid the foundation for the broad use of stock options as an executive compensation tool , has called on his fellow researchers to incorporate " integrity " into their economic models .
Douglas Stevens , an associate professor of accounting at The Florida State University , is among those who for years have proposed incorporating morality within traditional economic theory .
He has published a number of experimental studies documenting that economic decision - makers frequently factor morality into their judgments and behavior .
Now , Stevens and a colleague have published a paper that incorporates morality into the economic theory of the firm that Jensen made dominant in accounting and finance .
The paper , by Stevens and Alex Thevaranjan , an associate professor of accounting at Syracuse University , is titled " A Moral Solution to the Moral Hazard Problem . "
It was recently published in the peer - reviewed journal Accounting , Organizations and Society .
In that dominant economic theory of the firm , known as principal - agent theory , a principal must hire an agent to perform some productive effort .
A " moral hazard " arises , however , because the principal cannot observe the effort of the agent and the agent is motivated to shirk .
Under the traditional assumptions of the model , the principal must pay the agent a financial incentive to induce any effort from the agent .
The principal - agent model has been useful in accounting and finance because it addresses conflicts of interest that arise within the firm , according to Stevens .
However , a common complaint is that it relies too heavily on financial incentives to solve the moral hazard problem .
The high - powered financial incentives prescribed by the theory have been criticized for generating excessive executive compensation and risk - taking -- which analysts say precipitated the recent financial crisis .
Stevens and Thevaranjan extend the traditional principal - agent model by endowing the agent with " moral sensitivity " -- that is , a disutility for breaking a previous agreement .
Thus , their model answers Jensen 's call to incorporate integrity into economic theory .
This is significant because principal - agent theory , the most mathematically formal economic theory of the firm , has previously been closed to moral content .

Incorporating moral sensitivity into the traditional principal - agent model allows Stevens and Thevaranjan to make several contributions to the theory .
First , they are able to contrast the efficiency of their moral solution with the traditional incentive solution that becomes necessary when moral sensitivity is assumed to be zero .
Second , they are able to demonstrate the benefit of the agent 's moral sensitivity to both the principal and the agent , and thereby point out the potential cost of ignoring this moral sensitivity .
Stevens and Thevaranjan conclude that adding moral sensitivity increases the descriptive , prescriptive , and pedagogical usefulness of the model .
" We know from simple observation that the traditional principal - agent model is not fully descriptive of real - world behavior , " Stevens said .
" A majority of people are paid a fixed salary in their jobs and yet provide sufficient effort for their pay .
This is particularly true in professions and nonprofit firms where the financial incentives required by the traditional model are difficult if not impossible to arrange .
The traditional principal - agent model can't explain this behavior .
Our model , however , demonstrates that a principal can pay a morally sensitive agent a fixed salary that is increasing in the productivity of the agent 's effort . "
Their model also demonstrates the value of moral sensitivity to the firm and society .
" Our model suggests that moral sensitivity increases the efficiency of principal - agent relationships within the firm -- which makes more of these relationships possible -- and allows the agent to receive a fixed salary that is increasing in his or her productivity or skill , " Stevens said .
" Thus , moral sensitivity increases the general welfare of society by decreasing unemployment and increasing the productivity and pay of those who are employed .
This explains the emphasis placed on moral training within the firm and society at large .
This also provides a warning against letting moral sensitivity diminish . "
Stevens and Thevaranjan have used their model to teach accounting and MBA students the importance of professional ethics .
Whether the traditional approach of ignoring morality and emphasizing financial incentives caused the financial meltdown is debatable , but Stevens believes it is time for business schools to return to emphasizing professional ethics .
" Every financial crisis and scandal is a wake - up call -- for both practitioners and academics , " Stevens said .
" Hopefully , we wo n't waste yet another financial crisis . "

Vyacheslav Bykov : “ Sixty percent of today ’s roster will play in Sochi ” ( Photo © RIA Novosti / Vladimir Fedorenko )
After the 2 - 1 loss to Czech Republic in the 2010 World Championship in Germany , Vyacheslav Bykov gave an interview to the popular Russian website Sovietsky Sport .
Bykov stated that the sixty percent of today ’s roster will be playin in the 2014 Olympics , talked about his future with the Russian national team , tried to analyze the reasons of the defeat and also talked about the foreigners policy within the KHL .
Bykov : “ This was a dramatic game for us , since the first seconds of it .
We allowed such an early goal .
Fortune smiled our opponents when they needed it more .
It took us a lot of time to get a chance to beat the Czech defense .
And it was n’t easy at all .
Their goalkeeper [ Tomas ] Vokoun had a brilliant game .
Our players did n’t manage to realize their moments , even if we had not a few of them .
But anyway I ’ve thanked the guys because they fought till the last second .
I ’ve told them that the Silver is a product of their hard work and it ’s worthy of respect .
I express regrets to our fans …we tried hard , but luck was n’t on our side today . ”
What ’s next for Team Russia and in particular for its staff ?
Bykov :
“ We arrived here to get a medal , and it looks like we reached our goal .
But any medal but the Gold one gives you a bitter taste in the mouth .
We are upset .
In the first instance we are upset because we could n’t give joy to our fans .
But my future will be discussed by the Russian Hockey Federation and the Minister of Sports . ”
Do you want to stay at the head of the national team ?
Bykov : “ I did n’t think about this yet . ”
After the game you got a call from Russian President Dmitri Medvedev .
Bykov :
“ He congratulated the team – all the players and the coaches – for the silver medal .
He thanked us for the good job .
Because we got a decent result .
He emphasized that the most important thing is not to get back to the level of the 90s , where Russia rarely got medals .
And two golds and a silver in a row it ’s not bad , really not bad .
He understood that all the players are upset , but he did want to congratulate them all . ”
Did the President talk about your future within the national team ?
Bykov : “ I do n’t want to discuss this matter now . ”
Today ’s defeat in the final match was a casuality due to casual circumstances ?
Bykov : “ It ’s hard to reply to this question .
We created scoring chances and our players performed at a good level .
We had to score !
But we could n’t … We have to give credit to the Czechs .
They deserve the title of World Champions .
They had a difficult path through the tournament .
They deserved to win . ”
This tournament looked a bit like the ones from the 80s , where Swedes , Czechs and Finns played without NHL players .
And everyone was expecting the first place from Team Russia .
Do you agree ?
Bykov : “ I do n’t want to get involved into polemics concerning other teams .
In the 2000 [ World Championship in St. Petersburg ] we had a line up full of stars and we could only get the 11th place in that home tournament .
Why now we try to cancel the merits of the young guys who arrived to the tourney and worn the national team ’s jersey ?
They made their duties of citizens , they gladdened the fans .
Why we want to cancel all this ? ”
Do you think that the second place is your personal failure ?
Bykov : “ A failure is the eleventh place , as I said earlier .
But the second place is surely bitter , because it ’s not the first . ”
But your roster was considerably stronger than the others .
Bykov : “ Do you want me to resign right now ? ”
Your contract will run out in August .
Bykov : “ Then wait till August .
Or maybe until the executive committee will take an official decision . ”
Will you go there ?
Bykov : “ If I have to then I ’ll go . ”
Do n’t you think that combining the work with the national team and the work with a KHL club was a wrong decision ?
Bykov : “ No. Undoubtely no .
Absolutely no . ”
Do you still have motivations to work with the national team ?
Bykov : “ I need to sit and think .
Even more so that it ’s not up to me only , but it ’s also up to the federation . ”
If you could get back to the start of the tournament and change something , would you correct anything ?
Bykov : “ I do n’t think so .
Up to the finals we made the correct steps and we got the results .
Even before the final I would n’t change a thing . ”
Let ’s say that [ Alexander ]
Ovechkin did n’t start scoring on the powerplay playing as defenseman .
Bykov : “ We are patient .
Sooner or later
Alex would have scored [ this way ] .
But during this tournament it did n’t happen .
Well , our hopes do n’t come true every time .
But in any case this was a plus for the team .
Ovechkin ’s appearance in our powerplay put further pressure on the opposition .
Well , he had a couple of bad games …
But the guys played to win .
Do n’t you think that the goalie had some mistakes in the final game ?
We allowed the first goal too quickly .
Bykov : “ No .
We had no regrets about letting Semyon [ Varlamov ] ’s play .
The goals were n’t his fault . ”
How does Fedorov feel ?
Bykov : “ He picked up a concussion .
He does n’t feel very well .
And [ Artem ] Anisimov has a broken hand .
He could n’t hold the stick even after an injection .
Many players played with injuries . ”
Some people took off the silver medal immediately after the ceremony .
And you arrived to the press conference without it .
Maybe the silver medal was so bad that you wanted to put it in the pocket ?
Bykov : “ Maybe , no … But you can understand us .
Our aim was to get the gold medal .
We fought hard for it for the whole year .
And then it steamed away .
Emotions had the best of us .
Bitterly … ”
Your career with the National Team started with the 2007 World Championship in Moscow , where we got only a bronze medal .
Now your team got a silver .
What was worse ?
Bykov : “ Of course , having lost in the finals , you can joke yourself out , for example , say that we are the winners among losers .
But for the Russian national team this is sad , especially now . ”
Even before the finals you said that the higher level of our rivals is a consequence of their play in the KHL .
And the final game confirmed that since goals and assists came only from KHL players .
Bykov :
“ If the FHR and the KHL do n’t reach a mutual understanding then we wo n’t have hockey anymore in Russia .
In the clubs the place of Russians is took by foreigners , teams can already dress six of them , soon going up to seven , without considering Latvians , Belarusians , Kazakhs , which are n’t counted .
And what happens ?
Youngsters will start going away .
Simply , there is no space for them in the KHL .
Are we going to be better than the NHL soon ?
Instead of that we ’ll be in a hole .
Into a very deep hole .
Can you explain us why ?
Bykov : “ Because then we wo n’t have home grown players .
And without it there is no future for Russian hockey . ”
Between the staff of the national team and the KHL there is a dialog or troubled relations ?
Bykov : “ This is a question for the FHR . ”
If the situation does n’t change then [ team Russia ’s performance ] in Sochi will be under threat ?
Bykov : “ Undoubtely .
Young players that we might want to consider for the 2014 Olympics do n’t have space to prove themselves in the KHL .
The limit for foreign players needs to be not raised , but diminished , like they did with goalkeepers .
They did n’t let foreigners to get signed , and then some talented Russian goalies immediately appeared .
Because they got a chance to play and progress .
As one of the National Team coaches I say : the number of foreign players must be limited .
Or otherwise in the future we will have huge problems .
Including Sochi . ”
Two young stars were brought – Artem Anisimov and Dmitry Kulikov .
Were they called for the future ?
Bykov : “ Both have a bright future .
We know that we needed them to play here in order to get them acquainted with the national team as soon as possible .
Sixty percent of today ’s roster will play in Sochi .
This is clear .
But we need more young players .
Besides , we are really satisfied by Anisimov and Kulikov ’s play with the national team . ”
Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee gave an interview this week to the College of New Jersey news magazine The Perspective , and discussed several gay rights issues .
Huckabee said the implementation of gays in the military would be a " social experiment " .
He compared gays who want to get married to drug users and polygamists .
And he warned that parenting was a serious matter , suggesting that gays and lesbians who adopt were experimenting , as if with pets .
On Don't Ask , Do n't Tell :
" I would n’t support a repeal if I were commander - in - chief … You do n’t see foot soldiers out there demanding it .
I ’m not sure that ’s the most important thing we ought to be doing for the military .
… [ ‘ Do n’t Ask Don’t Tell ’ ] touches an extraordinarily small group of people .
[ Calls to repeal it are ] primarily a posturing point for political purposes [ and an attempt to ] force something on the military that they themselves have n’t pushed that hard .
I think we certainly should be very sensitive to the fact that the purpose of the military is not to see if we can create social experiments . "
On marriage equality :
" Even civil unions are not necessary .
I think there ’s been a real level of being disingenuous on the part of the gay and lesbian community with their goal of civil unions …
You do n’t go ahead and accommodate every behavioral pattern that is against the ideal .
That would be like saying , well , there are a lot of people who like to use drugs , so let ’s go ahead and accommodate those who want who use drugs .
There are some people who believe in incest , so we should accommodate them .
There are people who believe in polygamy , so we should accommodate them . ' "
On gay adoption and foster care :
" I think this is not about trying to create statements for people who want to change the basic fundamental definitions of family .
And always we should act in the best interest of the children , not in the seeming interest of the adults … Children are not puppies .
This is not a time to see if we can experiment and find out , how does this work ? "

My oldest son is seven years old .
When he was born , I named him a geeky middle name for one reason :
To fulfill his destiny as a nerd .
Advertisement
Let 's be honest .
I am a nerd .
Perhaps , you are a nerd , too .
We could even been kindred nerd spirits or bitter nerd enemies nerd - raging at each other .
In raising my son , I have three goals :
He is polite and considerate , he works hard and he becomes a nerd .
But why would I ever want to raise a nerd ?
For me , I take nerd to mean someone who has in - depth knowledge on a topic .
( I realize there are other connotations the word obviously has , but for me , this is my definition . )
So there are video game nerds , sports nerds , anime nerds , history nerds and so on and so forth .
What makes nerds so great is they are fountains of information , making some truly intriguing conversations possible — and better yet , some truly heated and even truly meaningless arguments .
Advertisement
But , in short , nerds care .
They have fires in their bellies .
They have passion .
You cannot fake that nerd passion .
One either has it or not .
All I can do is introduce things to him — age appropriate things .
He might like them , and if he does , then he can learn more .
If he hates something , then he is more than free to move on .

Parenting is hard .
I do not claim to be a great parent .
Or even a good parent .
But from the time he was aware of the world around him , I began introducing nerddom to him bit - by - bit .
What is one man 's nerddom , might not be for others , and my definition of " nerd " is perhaps far too broad .

Give The Kid A Good Nerd Name :
Mini -Bash 's middle name was given to him with the utmost seriousness .
Legally , Japanese people cannot have middle names .
The have first names , and they have last names .
So the middle name appears only on his U.S. birth certificate and will one day disappear into the ether should he pick Japanese citizenship when he has to choose between Japan and U.S. when he becomes of age .
His last name is " Ashcraft " and his first name is a normal Japanese name .
( We thought a normal Japanese name would help cushion the blow of his bizarro foreign last name . )
But his middle name is from a character created by Osamu Tezuka .
Tezuka is often compared to Walt Disney in scope and importance ( ironically , Tezuka 's Kimba the White Lion served as the basis for the Lion King ) .
I love Walt Disney , but I 'd take Tezuka over Disney any day of the week and twice on Sunday .
Tezuka is from Osaka , so when Mini -Bash was younger , a visit to the Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum was penciled in and off we went .
Leading up to the trip I told him how his middle name was from a Tezuka character .
Of course , I then had to explain what a middle name was .
What seemed to impress him the most was that Tezuka was some kid from Osaka who became so successful that a museum was created in his honor .

Go Places :
Every weekend , we go somewhere .
Sometimes it 's the park , sometimes it is hiking , sometimes it is to go milk cows and sometimes it is to arcades .
Mini -Bash really loves going to arcades and once asked if we could sell all our home consoles so we could get an arcade cabinet .
I immediately hugged the child .
Positive reinforcement , I 'd like to think .
Advertisement
Dress the Part :
A big part of geek culture is t- shirts .
( Just ask Mike ! )
We 've made sure Mini - Bash has a couple of choice game - related threads .
Advertisement
Have A Good Back Catalogue :
From a young age , Mini -Bash has always liked drawing .
He 's passively been interested in video gaming .
But instead of actually playing a Nintendo DS , he 'd rather draw one .
Around the house there 's a bunch of game consoles and portables .
However , they are there .
If he wants to play them , he can .
If he wants to draw , he can .
But , the games he has available are a box of old Famicom games and Super Famicom games Mrs. Bashcraft played with her brothers and sisters as a kid .
8 - bit and 16 - bit are fantastic for fueling young nerd imaginations — much more so photo real graphics .
I 'm happy to say the first Mario game Mini-Bash played was the first Super Mario Bros .
Besides games , there is manga on the shelves , books , lots of books , good books , and stuff for him to leaf through , get lost in .
He may not have read Haruki Murakami , but he knows that mommy and daddy like his books very much and that Murakami 's prose sings .
One thing that has always disturbed me is when people say things like , " I can't play this old video game , because of the graphics . "
Or " I ca n't watch black and white movies . "
Or " I hate subtitles . "
I think it 's important that the value of these " old " or " foreign " things is stressed early on .

Replenish the Supply :
It can not be said enough : Library cards and trips to the library are truly a joy .
Picking out a couple of books with your kid and browsing around is endlessly wonderful .
Then heading back home and reading through said books .
One promise my dad made with me when I was a kid :
He 'd take me to the library whenever I wanted and anytime we went to book store , he would buy one book .
Not a magazine or a comic book , a book .
I 've made the same deal with Mini -Bash .
Advertisement
Find Stuff They Can Relate Too . Geeky Stuff :
When Mini -Bash saw the new Star Trek film , he could immediately relate to Spock .
Spock is half - human , half - Vulcan .
Mini-Bash is half - Japanese , half - American .
He immediately connected with that character .
And that movie led to conversations about black holes and space .
And then conversations about how Star Trek and Star Wars are different , even though both have " Star " in the title .
The logical conclusion that George Lucas should have never made the new Star Wars films and hopefully wo n't make any more .
Oh , stay away from Indiana Jones , too .

A Family That Games Together , Stay Together :
Knock the Wii as you might ( there 's plenty to knock ! ) , it 's the go - to console when the Ashcraft family wants to play video games together .
Mini -Bash is n't so good at video games !
He 's okay .
But in the original Wii Sports , the Wii Remote is incredibly forgiving and allows him to just enjoy himself .
We have a good time playing together , and it seems like a horribly embarrassing Wii ad .
But who cares , it 's fun .
Family favorites include : Mario Kart and New Super Mario Bros .
But does n't being a nerd mean that he 'll be picked on ?
I do n't think so .
This is n't a piece on raising an anti-social child or a target for bullies .
Instead , it 's about attempting to foster an interest in the world around him .
To be himself .
To explore .
To ask questions .
To find something and learn more .
If anything , it will * fingers crossed * make him more perceptive and aware .

It 's odd , though .
When my son arrived in this world , I was dead set on all the things I would teach him .
This is Shigeru Miyamoto , he made Mario .
This is Jasper Johns , he 's amazing .
This is Kurt Vonnegut , listen to him .
But , with each passing year , I 've been finding that it is n't me who is always doing the introducing or the teaching .
It 's him .
And I 'm learning about things that interest Mini-Bash — whether it be Italian sports car or soccer or monsters .
And I 'm reading up , I 'm studying , I 'm learning .
His interest in cars meant a road trip from Osaka to Nagoya to check out the Toyota Museum .
It has made me start noticing what automobiles are on the road so I can point out his favorites .
His interest in soccer means going to watch Japanese league games .
And as much as we'd like our kids to be spitting images of ourselves , they 're not .
They 're different .
They have their own life experiences .
All we can do is hope that whatever we expose them to as children has a positive impact on them as adults .
No doubt , he 's got the nerd passion .
And that 's all that really matters .
Shahzad is -- formally or informally -- tied to millions who hate America for what they see as military aggression and religious bigotry .

America needs to face this reality .
No agency or individual can permanently halt the boundless opportunities for successful attacks that today 's technology provides .

Radicalized Muslims , enraged by a American disrespect for Islam , by U.S. foreign policy , and by wars and occupations in their homelands , are now most likely to blow up our dreams .
Still , Americans speak of U.S. " superiority " and reject that their country could be flawed and hated .
no amount of patriotism will restore U.S. invulnerability .
It 's gone forever , if it ever existed .

But sooner or later , our luck is going to run out .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. pharmacy chain Walgreen
Co plans to start selling genetic testing kits to help people assess their risk for inherited diseases in a move that has already drawn the attention of federal health officials .
Walgreen said on Tuesday it plans to start stocking gene testing kits this week made by Pathway Genomics , a start - up company based in San Diego .
The deal with Pathway would make it the first to put such tests in the local pharmacy .
But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has no record that the test kit was approved or validated by the agency and plans to take a hard look at any claims made by the company .
“ If a company is making claims about a product that has n’t been reviewed or validated by FDA , we want to make sure the information to consumers is accurate and the test will do what it says it will do , ” Erica Jefferson , an FDA spokeswoman , said in a telephone interview .
Many experts say genetic testing kits offer incomplete information , and any results about disease risk , especially for incurable diseases such as Huntington ’s or Parkinson ’s , should only be done with genetic counseling that clearly explains the limitations of genetic testing .
Several companies -- including Decode Genetics ’ DeCodeME based in Iceland , 23andME in which Google has invested , and privately held Navigenics -- sell tests that allow people to learn if they have inherited risk for disease .
Pathway said in a statement its personal genetic testing kit , the Pathway Genomics Insight Saliva Collection Kit , will be sold at many of Walgreen ’s nearly 7,500 stores nationwide , for $ 20 to $ 30 per kit .
It contains a small saliva collection kit , instructions , and a postage - paid envelope that customers can use to send their sample back to the Pathway lab .
Then , consumers go on the company ’s web site , www.pathway.com, to order a customized report about their genetic make up , with prices ranging from $ 79 to $ 249 .
Walgreen said FDA clearance is not required to sell the kit in its stores .
The drugstore chain already sells other diagnostic and testing products such as pregnancy tests , paternity tests and drug tests .
“ There are people who need or want to know more about their genetic history or their genetic makeup , ” Walgreen spokesman Jim Cohn told Reuters .
The chain will not sell the tests in the state of New York because of a state law that considers them medical tests , and not consumer information .
Pathway said in a statement the company follows regulatory guidelines that apply to its products .
“ FDA clearance is not necessary to sell the Pathway Genomics Insight Saliva Collection Kit in retail , ” the company said .
It said the tests are not intended for use in diagnosis , treatment or for the mitigation or cure of a disease -- qualities that would make it an in vitro medical device , which the FDA does regulate .
“ It does provide information that allows a person to learn about their health to make healthier lifestyle choices , ” the company said .
Bad bad Froyo and Google , you forgot a few things .
A few minor or major things , depends on who you are and how you look at it .
I am going to go over a few of those things , some things that are wishful thinking , maybe they are there but did n't get shown ?
Take a look and see if you agree .
Fragmentation
This is the biggest in my opinion .
It sucks to know that I tell my wife of all these cool Froyo things and she sits there wondering when she will get past 1.6 so that she can have a the youtube widget , she loves the youtube widget .
There are as many 1.6 and 1.5 users as there are 2.1 .
And its not like you can say it is n't possible , Cyanogen has done it , he has working builds of 2.1 on the G1 , It has limited features , some live wall papers do n't work and the 3d launcher does n't work , but crap , I do n't even user the 3d launcher !

App Piracy Protection
Maybe this will get announced on launch day of the market , but right now its an issue for devs , you can download their apps from places for free .
Its just not fair to them .
Fix this ?
OTA Rollouts
How and when will they roll out and when they do , will it take 2 weeks ?
2 weeks for Droid , 1 for Nexus and 1 or 2 for Incredible , plus other 2.1 phones that may get this update , what about the ones that they skip 2.1 and go straight to 2.2 ?
Thats a lot of roll outs , how will it all work , Verizon and their roll out provider can barely keep up and have delayed a few times during the 2.1 update .
It was a rumor that Google would take over this , but no announcement at the keynote .
Battery Life
This was mentioned a few days ago , They said if you are not getting a full day of battery life , something is wrong !
Well what can I do , because I get 6 - 8 hrs when I heavily use it and I do qualify as a heavy user !
I make 1 call a day , but I text , I email and I get constant twitter updates !
My accounts are always syncing , maybe I should turn that down a notch ?
Not sure , they did n't address it !
What can we do ?

The New Market
The new market while being cool , is a modified version of AppBrain the website .
We should get an app on the desktop .
AppBrain is great , but this is Google we are talking about , not a 3rd party dev team .
It should be better .
I am excited , but just sort of excited .
It could be better , one of the reasons Apple is doing well is iTunes ( I hate it , others love it ) , its an interface you can access from the desktop and it works well .
Maybe they are prepping for Chrome OS and the cloud , but some things still need to be something we can add to a desktop .
Codecs For Video
So we want to watch AVI files !
We do !
Thats how you get them , AVI , we want it .
Hopefully the new company Global IP will gives us that , maybe it was n't ready and will be pushed as a small OTA update when its ready , or maybe thats why we are waiting til June to get our 2.2 update , but either way , give me AVI and give it to me now .
Photo Caller ID
Who is calling , NOT SURE , their photo is still just that small BLURRY picture , weird , when I took it it was n't blurry , it was crisp .
Whats going on with that ?
i Phone has a BIG picture display , fills the screen when someone calls , where is that for us ?
Figured that would be a 2.2 release , maybe it is , no one got a call during any demos so its hard to say but I want it and I know Chris ( site owner ) wants it bad !

Droid Camera
I hope this is another that is fixed but not announced , I push the gold button and then wait .
And wait , and wait and I hear the clicking of the camera starting and I wait , and wait and then there it is , but by then I already clicked back of home figuring that I had other things going and needed to fix it and I have to press the camera button again , and its a long process , I usually end up entering the app drawer and clicking the camera icon and it starts right up .
Please say this got fixed ?
Tethering Woes
So it appears that we ran into a problem , in all the tethering excitement we seem to have forgotten , how will it be done , well it seems that it will be done by the providers , Verizon , T - Mobile , AT&T , etc etc etc , they can charge what they want is the latest rumor .

Jared Allen 's trademark mullet is no more ... at least for now .
Jared Allen , seen here in a December 2009 photo , has said his mullet was a " lifestyle " and not " just a hairdo . "

The Minnesota Vikings ' star defensive end , known as much for his hairstyle as well as his ability to get to the opposing team 's quarterback , lost his mullet as he gets ready for his upcoming wedding .
" The things men do for love , " Allen told Vikings.com .
Allen , who often says his mullet is a " lifestyle , " has capitalized on the popularity of his hairdo , selling " Mullet Militia " T - shirts and including a " mullet generator " on his iPhone app , where users can try out the " lifestyle " for themselves .
In a 2009 interview , Allen explained his love and respect for his mullet .
" The mullet is n't just a hairdo .
It 's definitely a lifestyle .
You 're carrying on a legacy , " he said " If I approach you from the front , it 's like , wow , that dude is pretty serious .
Then I walk away and you 're like , damn , he likes to party .
With two Rs. "
However , Allen hinted on this Twitter page Wednesday that " The Mullet " might reappear at some point .
" The mullet was trimmed for the wedding but the Moolay is more than just some hair , its a lifestyle !
You gotta keep a positive Mullitude ... "

From the Snitker Campaign for Senate , via PRLog :
Libertarian Alexander Snitker is urging his political rivals for Florida ’s U.S. Senate seat to join him in signing the 10th Amendment Pledge .
But , so far , Snitker is the only active candidate to sign the pledge .
The pledge , created by the Tenth Amendment Center , includes affirmations like “ I do , and will continue to , oppose any and all efforts by the federal government to act beyond its Constitutional authority , ” and “ I will only vote in favor of a bill that I have thoroughly read , considered and understood . ”
According to Andrew Nappi , the Florida state coordinator for the Tenth Amendment Center , all of the major U.S. Senate candidates have been invited to sign the pledge , but so far , only Snitker has done so .
Candidates Charlie Crist and Kendrick Meek have not responded to the center ’s requests .
Nappi says he contacted the Marco Rubio campaign three times about the pledge before getting any response .
In December 2009 , a Rubio staffer told Nappi that he would “ consider ” signing the pledge , however , Rubio has yet to do so .
“ I ’m surprised that any candidate would refuse to sign this pledge .
But I ’m most disappointed with Marco Rubio ’s failure to sign it , ” said Snitker .
“ How can you call yourself a Constitutional conservative , and then refuse to sign a pledge to uphold the Constitution ? ”
Cypress Hill have canceled a forthcoming tour stop in Tuscan , Ariz. , in protest to the state 's recently passed SB1070 immigration bill calling their decision a " show of resistance to the criminalization of immigrant communities . "
The controversial bill allows law enforcement to prejudicially detain anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant in the state .
The concert was to take place on May 21 at the Rialto Theater , and was among a string of performances behind the SoCal hip - hop act 's eighth album , ' Rise Up ! '
" This decision was made in an effort to show support and solidarity with those , undocumented and otherwise , being directly affected by this unconstitutional ' law , " a statement from the band read .
" Cypress Hill recognizes those living in the struggle for their basic civil rights . "
Cypress Hill join a legion of disapproving musicians , including Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am who recently ranted his disgust at the bill on Twitter .
" The racial profiling is aimed at Mexicans , " Will wrote .
" There are illegal Russians , Chinese , Brazilians , Europeans , Australians and Arabs in the USA .
The sad thing is Mexicans do jobs Americans do n't do and then we complain like [ they ] a nuisance . "
No word on whether Cypress Hill , whose frontman B - Real is of Mexican lineage , plan to ever reschedule or play the state again .
It 's officially illegal to be an illegal immigrant in Arizona .
Now any cop in Arizona can ask anyone to prove their immigration status , and every cop in Arizona is compelled , under threat of lawsuit , to enforce federal immigration laws .
I really can't imagine any negative consequences that will result from giving local police the authority to stop literally anyone on the " reasonable suspicion " that they just might be an illegal immigrant .
This will give police an important new tool in their crime - fighting arsenal : the ability to detain and possibly deport people without bothering obtain warrants or " prove " that they 've committed a crime .
It 's also now illegal in Arizona to pick someone up in your car if you " know or recklessly disregard the fact " that they are an illegal immigrant .
Thankfully , the Arizona House added " a prosecution exemption for people who drive illegal immigrants to church "
And once the governor signs this bill and all the illegals are sent back to Mexico ( should take , what , a month or two ? ) all of the drug violence will stop , the end .

So , is Greece the next Lehman ?
No .
It is n’t either big enough or interconnected enough to cause global financial markets to freeze up the way they did in 2008 .
Whatever caused that brief 1,000 - point swoon in the Dow , it was n’t justified by actual events in Europe .
Nor should you take seriously analysts claiming that we ’re seeing the start of a run on all government debt .
U.S. borrowing costs actually plunged on Thursday to their lowest level in months .
And while worriers warned that Britain could be the next Greece , British rates also fell slightly .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that Greece ’s problems are deeper than Europe ’s leaders are willing to acknowledge , even now  and they ’re shared , to a lesser degree , by other European countries .
Many observers now expect the Greek tragedy to end in default ; I ’m increasingly convinced that they ’re too optimistic , that default will be accompanied or followed by departure from the euro .
In some ways , this is a chronicle of a crisis foretold .
I remember quipping , back when the Maastricht Treaty setting Europe on the path to the euro was signed , that they chose the wrong Dutch city for the ceremony .
It should have taken place in Arnhem , the site of World War II ’s infamous “ bridge too far , ” where an overly ambitious Allied battle plan ended in disaster .

​ The Florida Senate has unanimously passed a bill that would ban the sale of glass smoking pipes at most stores that currently carry them .
Senate Bill 366 requires 75 percent of a business ’s gross sales to come from tobacco products before they are allowed to sell bongs , water pipes and “ air - driven pipes , ” reports WJHG
It passed the Senate unanimously , 36 - 0 , on Wednesday .
Supporters of the legislation claim the pipes can be used to smoke illegal drugs like marijuana and cocaine .
The proposal could hurt some businesses , like Condom Knowledge in Panama City Beach .
The business ’s owner already has posted signs around the pipe display case , warning that anyone mentioning “ illegal use ” of the pipes will be asked to leave .
Owner Brian Luczaj questioned if the bill will do what legislators intend .
“ Pipes are provided by people for sanitary reasons , ” Luczaj said .
“ If you take the sale of pipes away , then they will find something to smoke out of .
They ’ll make it out of the house and use unsanitary items . ”
The Palm Beach Post .
Rep. Darryl Rouson ( D - St. Petersburg ) last month described the pipes as “ destructive utensils ” that “ destroy communities , ” reports Michael C. Bender at
Rep. Erik Fresen ( R - Miami ) suggested a business could skirt the law by marking up cigarettes to $ 30 a pack and offering a “ free ” bong with each sale .
Thanks for the idea , Erik !
The companion bill in the Florida House , HB 187 , has not yet gone to a full vote .
I 've noticed an alarming trend in television finales , lately : God .
Warning : the following contains spoilers for the endings of Cowboy Bebop , Fullmetal Alchemist , Neon Genesis : Evangelion , Avatar : The Last Airbender , Battlestar Galactica , LOST , Supernatural ( current ) and The Prisoner .

The presence of God in television finales alarms me for a number of reasons .
Culturally , I think it reflects the general shift toward conservatism in the West .
Most stories that involve the presence of God ( or at least a divine entity of some sort , whether it 's Krishna in The Bhagavad - Gita or The Furies / Eumenides in The Oresteia , are about characters finding their path at a moment of confusion , or coming back down to Earth after reaching too high .
In both cases , the Divine re-establishes the " natural " order .
Arjuna steps into his role as a virtuous prince .
Orestes accepts that vengeance is not his to take .
These stories come from an inherently conservative point of view : everyone has a place to stand and a part to play , and attempts to step outside those boundaries can only result in pain and suffering .
You 'll notice that stories about God commonly involve triumph over the self , not triumph over an oppressive regime - Arjuna never once thinks that he should share his riches with the lower castes , or that he 'll unseat the monarchy once he wins the battle .
Doing so would overturn the " natural " order of his environment .
Arjuna 's kingdom , once he wins it , will continue to rely on slavery to sustain itself - because that 's how Krishna wants it .
God 's role in these stories is a conservator , one who might snip off poisoned buds or gently nudge humans in one direction or another in attempt to preserve that which is good and right , without radically altering anything .
God conserves the status quo , and we 're supposed to take comfort in that : a place for everyone , and everyone in their place .

Recent American television finales have embraced this logic .
The endings of Avatar : The Last Airbender , Battlestar Galactica , and LOST all involve a divine figure returning balance to an earthly equation by repeating an ancient pattern .
The Avatar achieves his final state and the four nations again live in harmony .
Humans create Cylons , battle Cylons , and become Cylons .
The Island calls people in need of personal change , gives it to them , then lets them go ( to Heaven ) before calling another group .
All of this has happened before , and will happen again .
The pattern does n't change , it simply repeats .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Another word for " repetition " is " letdown . "
As far back as Aristotle , critics and audiences have measured the quality of a story by ( among other things ) whether it has a discernible beginning , middle , and end .
Things must change .
The characters must be in a different place than before , and the audience must feel for them .
Traditionally , this comes about as a result of the character making a choice or taking an action that has consequences , and then suffering through them .
Agamemnon sacrifices Iphigenia so that his ships might sail to Troy , and Clytemnestra retaliates by murdering him .
Hamlet refuses to kill Claudius when he has the chance , and he ( and everyone else ) dies .
Rochester lies to Jane about his marriage , and loses her .
Meursault kills the Arab , then awaits his execution .
Consequences follow actions .
Stories progress .
Circumstances change .
Characters grow .
Advertisement
But lately on American television , they have n't .
Lately , all tension has been drained from their actions , and all opportunities for choice have been robbed from them by fate .
Does it matter that humans created Cylons ?
Not really .
They did it because God wanted them to .
Does it matter that the Losties all had issues with their parents that they needed to overcome before they could be whole ?
Nah .
They were all in Purgatory , anyhow .
Does it matter that Aang had lost access to the Avatar State ?
No - apparently stray rocks can unblock his chakra .
( That 's right , kids : Aang works like the Millennium Falcon - a well - placed punch can bring his circuits back online . )
Notable exceptions exist : Supernatural invokes God as a character who allows humans to make their own decisions and suffer the consequences .
At the end of this season , Sam and Dean did their best to flout Heaven 's will , and God essentially tousled their hair and said " You crazy kids … " before consigning one to the flames and leaving the other a soulless wreck of a man .
He threw in a couple of freebies , like re-integrating Castiel , who then gave Bobby his life back .
But as Castiel says , Dean and Sam worked hard to achieve exactly what they desired : no hell below us ; above us , only sky .
They rebelled against God 's plan , and God responded by washing his hands of them .
It 's a sad story , but it 's an eminently satisfying one .
Pity and fear , the two emotions that Aristotle said make up the crucial narrative element called catharsis , are not pleasant feelings .
But they are powerful , and they teach us the things we listen to stories in order to learn .

Stories where God fixes everything ?
That 's the narrative equivalent of a nutritionist saying that you can eat nothing but McDonald 's and not get fat .

Perhaps this is why I like anime so much : anime lets characters suffer the consequences of their actions .
The classic example is Cowboy Bebop .
Spike flees the Red Dragon crime syndicate rather than killing Vicious , and Vicious chases him across the stars , snapping at his heels until their final , mortal meeting .
This theme , the futility of trying to outrun one 's past , repeats across all the characters :
Jet wants to forget how he lost his arm , but he 's forced to confront the man who betrayed him ;
Faye wishes she were always the tough woman she 's sculpted herself into , but eventually her memories of childhood return and she realizes just how much she 's lost .
In all three cases , unfinished business comes back to bite the characters .
The decisions they made in the past have meaning in the present .
Another example is Fullmetal Alchemist .
Although the original anime series had to make up its own ending because the manga that inspired it was unfinished , that ending is still fairly satisfying , if not necessarily happy .
Edward and Alphonse have spent the entire series trying to get their bodies back without paying the price demanded by the alchemical laws of equivalent exchange , and they do - somewhat .
For Edward , that means being stranded in another universe where alchemy is impossible , without an arm or a brother .
For Alphonse , it means gaining back his body , but losing all his memories of the brother he spent the last four years with .
It 's an ending , yes , and it 's the ending Edward wanted for his brother .
But does n't make it painless .

This is n't to say that anime always gets it right .
The ending of Neon Genesis : Evangelion so thoroughly confused viewers that it inspired its own TV Trope .
Much like The Prisoner , NG : E ends a convoluted plot not by tying up loose ends , but by swerving into an extended stage - performance - as - life metaphor .
When I watched it with Peter for a Mechademia review of the series , he sat calmly for a minute , then asked me what the fuck had just happened .
I rose quickly from my seat and said something about starting dinner .
I should note that the ending of NG : E should function as a warning on multiple levels : not only should writers fire all the rifles resting over the mantelpiece , and not fire the rifles that were never there to begin with , but they should accept defeat when the trigger jams .
To this day , Hideaki Anno has yet to create a series as enduring or profitable as NG:E , primarily because neither he nor his audience ( myself included ) could leave that ending alone .
We kept picking at it its rough and ragged edges , slowly enlarging the wound by sticking two sequels , three manga series , and an entirely new sextet of films inside it .
If Anno had ended the series satisfactorily in 1996 , his career might look very different in 2010 .

But by and large , I notice that anime is better able to end a story than live - action television .
I suspect that this is because anime producers contract with studios for a set number of episodes within which to tell the story .
No one worries about the " back nine " being picked up to complete a season , or whether a second or third season will be asked for .
Those questions are answered before the animator ever lights up her table .
Granted , in cases where an anime has to sync up with a manga , there can be problems with filler .
( I 'm looking at you , Bleach . )
But even a six - episode mini-series like FLCL can tell a complete story where the world changes and characters grow .
That 's more than some series can do in six seasons .
I write this as a person routinely stymied by endings .
When I 'm in my workshop , my most frequent question is " How can we fix this ending ? "
Normally , I need someone to tell me what the story was about for them before I understand how to bring it all together .
Perspective is just harder to achieve at the end of the game , when you 're too tired to keep your eye on all the balls you have in the air .
All of the mistakes I 've written about here are ones I 've made myself , before .
I just got back Peter 's line - edit on my manuscript last Tuesday , and our discussion ( with Caitlin ) of the ending was not a pretty one .
( I believe the words " cheated , " " squandered , " and " lazy " were used multiple times . )
But a few hours and three bottles of wine later , we had worked out a few tweaks that might accomplish what I 'd been trying to do all along .
The next day , I went over these changes with both my husband and my best friend .
The former is a far more logical thinker than I will ever be , and the latter a far better writer .
They both agreed that these changes would improve the re-write .
So maybe this little essay is n't a dirge for American drama , or a paean to Japanese anime .
Maybe it 's just a meditation in praise of re-writes .
Maybe it's an acknowledgment that we all fail the first time , and that the first draft should never be the final one .

We just released Osmos 2.4.0 on iOS – our first release in almost 4 years .
Why the long hiatus ?
Was it because 2.3.1 , our previous release , was perfect ?
No , though it was solid and stable , and we were happy with it .
Rather , it was due to our reliance on “ floating - point determinism ” for multiplayer .

Sega on Thursday delayed the first installment of , a side - scrolling downloadable episodic series that takes the mascot back to his roots .
blog post on Sega Europe 's site said the company is delaying the game from summer to the latter half of 2010 , as it " wants to ensure that we 're delivering the bestexperience possible . "
" The additional time will allow the development team to focus on ensuring overall high - quality throughout the game by continuing to tune , balance , and maintain the kind of polish that an important title like this demands , " the post added .
Sega revealed Sonic 4 in February this year , saying that the game would be styled as a side - scrolling 2D game with 3D graphics , with heavy inspiration from the Genesis classics .
The downloadable title will be episodic -- the first release will be the first episode kicking off " a much larger adventure , " Sega associate brand manager Ken Balough said earlier this year .is in development at Osaka - basedco - developer Dimps .
The game is slated for release on Xbox Live , PlayStation Network , WiiWare and -- as widely known but now confirmed -- on Apple 's App Store .
The return of real glamour ( even if not everyone got it right )
It is the fashion world 's biggest night of the year , eclipsing the Grammies , the Globes , the Baftas and even the Oscars .
The Costume Institute ball held annually at the Metropolitan Museum in New York is supposed to celebrate a new exhibition ( this year , the subject was the history of the pioneering American woman ) .
But the fashion folk on the night preferred to compare notes on how on earth they managed to squeeze into all these teeny , tiny confections .
All white : Emma Watson donned a super - revealing , one - shoulder Burberry gown while Kate Hudson 's Stella McCartney frock is fabulous but the clumpy shoes let it down .
Katty Perry , right , sparkles in pale pink CuteCircuit dress complete with tacky LED lights
Standing on the sidelines of the proceedings , you could be forgiven for thinking the financial crash had never happened .
The profligacy was incredible : the stretch limos , the diamonds , the canapés that went uneaten ...
Full - on glamour was the overriding theme : there were dresses , most notably by Marchesa and Dolce & Gabbana , that used metres and metres of duchesse satin or gold and silver lamé .
Every inch of every frock was embroidered or embellished .
There were Marie Antionette corsets and huge , overblown rose prints .
Blue : Mad Men 's Christina
Hendricks shows off her famous curves in a gown by L'Wren Scott and Sienna Miller , right , looks over fussy in Emilio Pucci and loses points for flashing too much flesh while Carey Mulligan looks gamine in purple Miu Miu but she should have lost the opaque black tights and heavy shoes
There was a return , too , to the full make - up ( stand up Katy Perry , Gwen Stefani and Jennifer Lopez ) and carefully coiffed hair we have n't seen since the Thirties - which makes sense , given that stars in those days understood their job was to cheer us all up and offer escapism from everyday woes .
The women on the red carpet on Monday night understood we are all in need of a little fantasy .
Two things struck me about the whole proceedings .
First , could the world 's most famous fashion designers have chosen a more awkward new erogenous zone to introduce to us poor women than the upper inner thigh ?
Stunnin in strapless : Rachel Weisz in Oscar de la Renta was the best dressed of the night while Renee Zellweger wore a much - too - clingy gold Carolina Herrera dress .
Eva Longoria Parker , right , who wore silver Marchesa dress , had the best quote of the evening : ' When you can't breathe , that means it 's a good fit
This previously concealed part of the anatomy was being flashed all night .
And second , is n't it slightly encouraging that even women with stylists , American Express Black cards , freebies , discounts and personal trainers still manage to get it wrong sometimes ?
One of the standouts was Mad Men star Christina Hendricks , who silenced her critics as she stepped out onto the red carpet in a dress that flattered her figure in all the right places .
Fit for a princess : Jennifer Lopez in gold Zuhair Murad that shows off her amazing hourglass figure and Anne Hathaway in a fairytale dress by Valentino with Bulgari jewels
Dressed in a blue gown by Mick Jagger 's fashion designer girlfriend L'Wren Scott - with an unusual pom pom-style accessory on her shoulder - Christina looked happy and confident in her own radiant fair skin as she posed for pictures on the red carpet .
And it was an extra-special night for Christina , who is famous for her role as Joan Holloway in the hit US drama Mad Men , as she was also celebrating her 35th birthday .
Christina came under fire in January for wearing a ruffled peach - coloured Christian Siriano gown at this year 's Golden Globes awards .
Fashion veterans : Naomi Campbell defies time and gravity in a black asymmetric gown by Dolce and Gabbana and Demi Moorein a slashed - to - the - thigh Lanvin gown .
Bit is she trying a little too hard ?
She caused a flashbulb frenzy in the dress which clung to her hourglass curves , but she was slated by fashion journalist Cathy Horyn who insunuated that she was a large girl by observing : ' You do n't put a big girl in a big dress .
That 's rule number one . '
P.S. WHO'S THE OAP IN STACK - HEEL TRAINERS ?
Mick Jagger , 66 , raises his game in platforms while L'Wren Scott shimmers in one of her own designs
The New York Times , which ran Horyn 's piece , admitted the photo of Christina had been slightly distorted inadvertently due to an error during routine processing which widened the shot , and it was replaced .
And despite many - including her actor husband Geoffrey Arend - jumping to Christina 's defence , the actress admitted that she was left embarrassed by the scrutiny .
Speaking to New York magazine , she said : ' It kind of hurt my feelings at first .
Anytime someone talks about your figure constantly , you get nervous , you get really self - conscious .
' I was working my butt off on the show , and then all anyone was talking about was my body !'
But last night her confidence was back as she attended the fashion event which was hosted by The Gap 's Patrick Robinson , Vogue editor - in - chief Anna Wintour and chat show queen Oprah Winfrey , and celebrated the opening of the ' American Woman : Fashioning a National Identity ' exhibition .
Christina was joined by her Mad Men co-star January Jones , who stood out in a short hot pink Yves Saint Laurent with a gothic black pattern , which she accessorised with long black gloves and towering black heels .
It was the sort of Mad Men match - up that will have fans in paroxysms of delight - and looking forward to many more .
The NHL Draft Combine is going on this week , which means all the top draft prospects are going through a pretty rigorous set of interviews with NHL teams .
It 's especially daunting for NCAA kids , since they have a more limited time frame to do everything due to NCAA rules .
( Update : Or not .
Apparently the NCAA loosened those restrictions .
Any guesses why ?
Because the NFL decided they needed more than 48 hours for their Combine . )
Anyway , I just heard from someone involved in the interview process that interviewed Tyler Pitlick today , and he confirmed that Pitlick will be playing for the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL next season , rather than returning to Minnesota State for his sophomore season .
It 's a pretty crushing loss for Minnesota State , although not necessarily one that was unexpected .
Also , for what it is worth , I asked about Riley Sheahan and his recent arrest , and the person I talked to said it would n't be a big deal for that particular team .
When taking in the whole picture of Sheahan 's past history , it seems like an isolated embarrassing incident .
Regardless , it 's not a guarantee that Sheahan will return to Notre Dame next year .
It sounds like if the team that drafts him wants him to play in the OHL next season , Sheahan would be open to that possibility .
This made me lol .
And I mean I actually did laugh out loud !
I think this one is better than having them say the same thing .
I was sort of expecting them to do so , so it kind of cought me of guard .
Thanks for brightening up my , and hopefylly alot of other peoples , day !
MONROVIA
Humanitarian workers in Liberia worry that as the UN and NGOs scale down aid operations , the fight against sexual violence will suffer , given a limited capacity in national institutions to take it on .
The fight against sexual violence , led by the Ministry of Gender and Development , is part of a wider four - year national plan to implement Security Council Resolution 1325 on women , peace and security ; the resolution was passed in 2000 but Liberia - where a 14 - year war ended in 2003 - began implementing it just last year .
The action plan relies heavily on aid agencies and on international donors for funds , said the Norwegian Refugee Council 's coordinator for sexual and gender - based violence , Anna Stone .
" But after the [ presidential and legislative ] elections next year many international NGOs , including the NRC , will scale down operations in Liberia . "
Many aid agencies , including NRC and Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) - also active in the fight against sexual violence - are gradually cutting their programmes in Liberia .
And the post-election role of the UN mission ( UNMIL ) , which has supported much of the government 's anti-sexual - violence programmes , is uncertain .
“ Agencies do move out and there is high turnover , ” agreed Madhumita Sarkar , programme adviser at the joint UN - government SGBV ( sexual and gender - based violence ) programme in the capital Monrovia .
“ That is a very big concern .
This is the wrong time to withdraw - even though Liberia is not in a conflict state .
Until now we ’ve tried to work on building local capacities and we now need to continue that , and hand over projects to the government . ”
“ We will go back to zero if people just withdraw now , ” she said .
Meanwhile the gender ministry is turning to donors to fund its programmes over the long term , aware that international support my wane ; the ministry recently received funding from Italy and the United States , according to Deputy Gender and Development Minister Annette Kiawu .
No recourse
Sexual violence consistently comes first or second ( after armed robbery ) in monthly crime statistics in Monrovia , with most victims being children , according to MSF .
Legal recourse is rarely an option for survivors , due to a lack of means as well as weak law enforcement , health NGOs in Liberia say .
But most rapes are committed by family members and are not reported , according to the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs ( NIIA ) in a 2009 study , “ Nobody Gets Justice Here ”
Attorneys often do not take it as seriously as armed robbery , as nothing is “ stolen ” in the attack , an aid worker told the NIIA .
NRC is trying to encourage women to report sexual crimes through a nationwide collective of women ’s groups , called WISE Women ; the organization promotes women ’s rights and develops practical responses to sexual crimes , such as how to raise money for a medical exam .
Rita Kollie , 17 , was the youngest member at a WISE Women meeting in Bong County in central Liberia , earlier this month .
“ I was curious to find out what women ’s rights are about .
We are not taught about that at school , ” she said .
“ Of course I am happy that we have a woman president , but we still do n’t have women role models in Bong County . "
Too piecemeal
Whatever institutions lead the sexual violence fight , NIIA says , the approach must focus more on the political , cultural and economic roots of such crimes .
NIIA says the current UN approach is too fragmented and shortsighted .
Groups working to reduce sexual violence must harmonize statutory and traditional law , saying international actors do not have an adequate grasp of the latter , it points out .
The government has made some steps at the policy level :
It now has a policy to promote women ’s rights ; it has strengthened rape and inheritance laws ; and it has created a secretariat to implement Resolution 1325 .
But implementation still lags behind , UNMIL - government representative Sarkar told IRIN .
For instance , according to the NRC ’s Stone , while Liberia is one of only two countries in the world that has specially assigned court to handle crimes against women and children , and has also set up special police units to protect women and children , the units helped convict just five perpetrators in 2009 .
NRC trains the units on how to address sexual crimes , but efforts are hampered by a lack of means and equipment , says NIIA .
Further , few trained officers want to leave Monrovia to work in rural areas - one of several problems impeding the fight in rural zones : poor roads , inadequate facilities , difficult access to some communities and lack of funds for counties , says the NRC .

" All items of value have been removed , " reads the sign on the boarded - up Flag and Whistle pub , the first thing you see when you leave Margate railway station .
For large parts of Britain the phrase sums up the state of things .
I have been on the road for the best part of two weeks trying to look beyond the financial crisis at the structural problems affecting the real economy - travelling from Margate in south - east England to St David 's in west Wales - and back .
Along the way I have been asking people - what is wrong with Britain and how do we fix it ?
Anti-migrant sentiment
When I first asked the question , on a wind - whipped Margate seafront , the answer was blunt : " Foreigners mate .
Take our jobs , undercut our wages . "
One person after another told the same story - they cannot get a job and believe migrant workers are undercutting their wages .
This may shock you , but it does not shock me - I have been hearing this message for two or three years now .
It is the signature tune of the recession - and one politicians do not really want to hear .
But to me it is evidence of a deeper problem .
Social mobility has declined , industry has shrunk from 20 % of GDP to 13 % under the present government .
Social historian Michael Collins , who has studied the working class diaspora of the South East , tells me that large sections of the population now reject the officially prescribed route upwards - education - in favour of a more tangible one : cash .
Low social mobility and this deep alienation of a section of unskilled manual workers has created a cultural divide in Britain that would have shocked Orwell and Disraeli , between an urban , metropolitan and multi-ethnic working culture in the cities and the one you find on Margate seafront .
Micro-economy
It was all too obvious as I hit London that it is there that the power and wealth in society rests .
In central London - and central Birmingham , Manchester and Glasgow to an extent - you have got a self - sufficient micro-economy whose badge of membership is the cappuccino and the laptop .
It has survived the recession well - the Starbucks barista buys their lunch in Subway , buys a cheap top in Zara , lives in the modern version of a rooming house , which is a £ 500 k rented London terrace divided into only bedrooms .
The wages are never brilliant , and nobody plans to do this forever , but there is a supercool aspect to the lifestyle that is a world away from life in a small town .
" We 've centralised the economy , " conservative philosopher Philip Blond told me .
" We 've taken all the wealth , talent , capital and centralised it inside the M25 .
And the state underwrites the finance system - so it rewards speculation .
Why would capital go anywhere else ? "
The results are obvious once you get to a place like Stoke - on - Trent .
Most of what Stoke was famous for had already gone by the time the financial crisis hit .
Viewed from the air the city is scarred with demolition sites of the great names of ceramics and steel .
What is new are warehouses and cut - price stores - Aldi , B&Q , cheap sofa stores .
Stoke 's workforce has fallen from 106,000 to 98,000 in the last three years and on no projection does it ever get back to 106,000 .
On a projection that includes government spending cuts , the workforce does not stop shrinking until 2017 .
Industrial collapse
The urban landscape of Hanley , a place to which I have returned throughout this recession , is a living demonstration of the failure of an economic model .
There are more than enough pawnbrokers and cheque cashing stores , some temp agencies , with very meagre offers in the window .
And at night , silence - save for the trashy student bars where , say the posters , you can get " trollied " for 99p .
Something about the economic model we adopted over the last 20 years has just not worked .
Financial speculation has been rewarded , industry has declined , wages at the bottom end have not kept pace with growth and the basic test of an economy - does it make poor people richer - has been flunked .
What is the answer ?
For me , the urban landscape of Stoke contains a buried clue .
Slicing through the five pottery towns are the canals , flanked by the picturesque ruins of the early kilns that made the names Wedgwood , Spode and Doulton famous .
In the 1770s canals were like the internet - a revolutionary new communications network that made new consumer products like a Staffordshire tea service possible for the masses .
Stoke exists because three or four entrepreneurs said : " A new age is coming , let 's be part of it , in fact let 's do it first . "
Eco businesses
For 20 years we thought we were already in a new age - that it was the age of high finance and call centres .
Then the banks collapsed .
In St David's , Britain 's smallest city , one thing strikes you - there is no big business .
Once a backwater , Pembrokeshire is now home to a booming seasonal micro-economy of eco-tourism , alternative technology , crafts and organic farming .
It is a kind of middle class nirvana , kept out of the hands of the property wide - boys and lookalike retail chains by the fact that it is inside a National Park .
I went there because I had uncovered a network of local businesses operating in ways that might hold clues to Britain 's future .
" We 're one of the oldest industrial countries , " adventure company boss and deep green business guru Andy Middleton told me , " but we could become the first successful post - industrial economy " .
I sat round the table with Andy and his mates - the T - shirt boss , the tepee camp owner , the recycleable furniture designer whose company turns over £ 30 m a year , and Andy himself whose adventure company morphed into a business consultancy .
" Nothing in nature maximises , " Andy told me .
" Trees do n't ask ' how high can I grow ? ' "
" If you maximise profit " Chris , former MD of local sportswear group Howies , said , " you 've no room for manouver .
It 's a recipe for boom and bust " .
A changing world
It is clear to me there are two big things happening in the world :
A tech revolution that started with the internet , but has now spread to everything from materials science to medicine to robotics ;
and a green revolution , that started with carbon reduction and is now changing the way people run businesses and live their lives .
This west Wales cluster of eco-business , who do not want to be part of the city - financed world , and want a bottom line that includes people and planet as well as profit , represent one way forward - but not without some bigger structural changes .
As I retrace my steps ( the return journey is featured on Tuesday 's Newsnight ) I find the beginnings of a more sustainable kind of economy - at Emma Bridgewater 's booming family - owned pottery in Stoke , at a London dotcom where they have invented an alternative to banking , and in Margate , with artist Tracey Emin , who believes the new art gallery soon to open there will transform the place .
And I meet the people trying to heal the fractiousness and mistrust of migrant workers through the ingenious means of getting them paid decent wages so the jobs and livelihoods of the existing workforce cannot be undercut .
" We 're weaving the social fabric of this country , " says the woman standing in the rain on London 's Oxford Street , fighting to get cleaners paid above the minimum wage .
The irony is not lost on me that she is Polish .
If we are going to be part of a third industrial revolution we are going to have to have a frank discussion about power .
All the power has been centred on finance and the financial model and , funnily enough , we have just hocked our entire economy to save that broken system .
From the coasteering teams in Wales to the boxing clubs of the potteries I sense a deep frustration with this absence of voice and power that traditional politics just does not capture .
But do n't just take it from me - join me on Newsnight , Monday 29 March and Tuesday 30 March , to hear it from the brickies , bantamweights , emigrant plasterers , immigrant cleaners , seaweed enthusiasts , pottery painters , city refuseniks and Brit - art geniuses .
Hear their answer to " What 's wrong with Britain and how do we fix it ? " - and hit the comments button to give us yours .

FARMVILLE , Cafe World , Mafia Wars , Petville - Facebook could be on the verge of losing a key part of what makes it so popular .
Zynga - the company behind four of Facebook 's top 10 social gaming apps - has had enough of the site 's increasing love of cash , according to Techcrunch .
Following an escalating battle over Facebook credits , Zynga has begun preparing its own social gaming network , Zynga Live .
Facebook Credits is the only payment platform the site will allow its app developers to use .
Facebook takes a 30 per cent cut of any revenue generated through Facebook Credits .
A Zynga source told Techcrunch that CEO Mark Pincus confirmed the move last Thursday in a staff meeting and Facebook is n't taking the news well .
Several weeks ago , Facebook shut down third - party notifications for some of Zynga 's games - including Farmville - which has seen its app drop some 10 million users as a result .
Farmville , which at its peak was played by 80 million Facebook users , has lost four million of them since mid-April .
If the split happens , Farmville will form the basis of Zynga 's first independent site , Farmville.com , given that Facebook is also threatening to remove Zynga 's games altogether .
The notification crackdown has not just cut into Zynga 's audience .
MindJolt Games lost a third of its 21 million player user base , while Facebook 's second - most popular game , Birthday Cards , suffered a 5.5 million drop , according to GamePro .
Industry insiders are following the rise in tension , and most agree that Facebook can live without Zynga , but Zynga can't live without Facebook .
Businessweek claims it will generate more than $ 500 m in 2010 and has quarupled its staff to 775 in the past 12 months .
Last week , it notified the share market of plans to issue shares that would value the company at more than $ 4 billion , so Zynga will not make any decision to break with Facebook lightly .
But discussions are at a critical level - today , games.com published a domain registration form that confirms the existence of zyngalive.com .

In what is being billed as one of the most ambitious projects to be made in Australia , the Jim Henson Company is partnering with Omnilab Media to make Power Of The Dark Crystal - a sequel to the 1982 fantasy hit The Dark Crystal .
Aussie directing duo Peter and Michael Spierig ( Daybreakers ) will helm the film , which will be made in stereoscopic 3D with a mix of live action and Henson puppetry .
Power Of The Dark Crystal will be produced by the Australia - based production arm of Omnilab Media , Ambience Entertainment , while Omnilab - owned special effects house Illoura will work on the CGI elements of the film .
Set hundreds of years after the events of the first movie , when the world has once again fallen into darkness , Power Of The Dark Crystal follows the adventures of a mysterious girl made of fire .
Together with a Gelfling outcast , the girl steals a shard of the legendary crystal in an attempt to reignite the dying sun that exists at the centre of the planet .
The screenplay was written by Australian Craig Pearce based on an original script by Annette Duffy and David Odell .
Fantasy artist Brian Froud will reprise his role as conceptual designer of the film .

Tax revenue at state and local governments has plummeted .
With house prices in California down substantially , it is even more dire for municipalities there .
The result will be widespread budget cuts and , where possible , income tax hikes .
Budget cuts alone wo n’t get you there .
Below is one specific example in Fresno , California .
They are taking money from their reserve fund to make ends meet .
That is not sustainable .
They are an example of the fiscal emergency coming to a local municipality near you .
I guarantee you this will have a negative impact on the economy and on house prices and foreclosures , a major reason I still give a double dip even odds .
I work with teams to turn technological possibilities into engaging and functional user experiences .
Explore my projects below to see how I put this process into action .

OTTAWA — Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been accused of systematically undermining women in this country by stripping their advocacy groups of tens of millions of dollars and targeting those critical of his government ’s anti-abortion stance on the world stage .
In the past two weeks , the federal government has ended funding to 14 women ’s groups , including a non-governmental agency that was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency ( CIDA ) for more than 30 years .
But women are pushing back before next month ’s global G20 summit in Toronto where Harper had hoped to make funding of maternal health a cornerstone of the meeting .
Canadian women wo n’t be ordered to keep quiet no matter how much Harper threatens to get even with any group that criticizes his Conservative government , critics and women groups promised Tuesday .
Opposition critics and a representative from the Ad Hoc Coalition for Women ’s Equality and Human Rights accused the Conservative government of turning back the hands of time on women ’s issues .
Exhibit A , they say , is its refusal to fund abortion in foreign aid even though abortion in Canada is legal .
“ Women ’s groups are saying we are not going to be intimidated anymore , and this is the group that is being told to go to the back of the bus and shut up , ” NDP critic MP Irene Mathyssen said .
Said Green Party Leader Elizabeth May : “ It ’s like moving back to the ( Richard ) Nixon era in a whole bunch of areas … it ’s chilling to see Canada going backwards ”
Conservative Senator Nancy
Ruth ’s well - intentioned warning to some 80 aid representatives on Monday that they should “ shut the f --- up ” about abortion for fear of retribution from Harper has become a rallying cry for organizations that have seen their funding eliminated or cut drastically .
The warning dominated a good chunk of Tuesday ’s House of Commons question period .
“ This is a culture of intimidation that has now been established by the Conservative Party :
If someone has a disagreement with the government , just shut the F up , ” Liberal MP Bob Rae told MPs .
“ Canadians need to wake ( up ) to the fact that this is a government that has a problem with democracy … the pattern is clear and it is becoming more and more disturbing , ” Rae told reporters later .
The Conservatives distanced themselves from Ruth ’s comments .
“ Let me say again the language is unacceptable and in no way , shape or form represents the views of the government , ” Transport Minister John Baird , speaking for Harper , told the House .
Judy White , president of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women ( CRIAW ) , told the Star that cutting off funding for women ’s organizations “ is an interesting way of silencing them .
I think it is very short - sighted on the part of government . ”
The Ad Hoc Coalition for Women ’s Equality and Human Rights says the government war on women ’s groups “ is actually an attack on democracy in Canada .
“ By defunding those women ’s groups you are effectively silencing discussion . . . on women and women ’s advocacy , ” said Claire Tremblay , coordinator of the coalition , which represents about 30 organizations . .
Since 2006 , Harper has cut funding for women ’s advocacy by 43 per cent , shut 12 out of 16 Status of Women offices in Canada and eliminated funding of legal voices for women and minority groups , including the National Association of Women and the Law and the Courts Challenges Program , critics say .
A spokesman for Rona Ambrose , the minister responsible for the status of women , said funding for the women ’s programs is at “ its highest levels ever , ” with the government footing the bill for 75 projects that will help more than 24,000 women .
“ Unfortunately , not all projects that submitted proposals were able to receive funding , ” Chris Hilton said in an email to the Canadian Press .
“ The funding for advocacy for women rights has disappeared , ” May told the Star .

The Green Party leader said the government will gladly provide funding to women ’s shelters , for example , but resists when it comes to funding organizations that might look at the underlying social problems .
“ They will fund Band - Aids after the fact but they will not fund root causes , identification or elimination of root causes .
That ’s not their agenda , ” May said .
She said the women ’s advocacy non-governmental group , MATCH International , which received funding for 34 years , just had its $ 400,000 funding pulled with only two days notice .

“ If you standardize all these signs , you not only take away the little giggle you get while strolling in the park but you lose a window into the Chinese mind , ” said Mr. Radtke , who is the author of a pair of picture books that feature giggle - worthy Chinglish signs in their natural habitat .
Lest anyone think it is all about laughs , Mr. Radtke is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Chinglish at the University of Heidelberg .
Still , the enemies of Chinglish say the laughter it elicits is humiliating .
Wang Xiaoming , an English scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , painfully recalls the guffaws that erupted among her foreign - born colleagues as they flipped through a photographic collection of poorly written signs .
“ They did n’t mean to insult me but I could n’t help but feel uncomfortable , ” said Ms. Wang , who has since become one of Beijing ’s leading Chinglish slayers .
Those who study the roots of Chinglish say many examples can be traced to laziness and a flawed but wildly popular translation software .
Victor H. Mair , a professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania , said the computerized dictionary , Jinshan Ciba , had led to sexually oriented vulgarities identifying dried produce in Chinese supermarkets and the regrettable “ fried enema ” menu selection that should have been rendered as “ fried sausage . ”
Although improved translation software and a growing zeal for grammatically unassailable English has slowed the output of new Chinglishisms , Mr. Mair said he still received about five new examples a day from people who knew he was good at deciphering what went wrong .
“ If someone would pay me to do it , I ’d spend my life studying these things , ” he said .
Among those getting paid to wrestle with Chinglish is Jeffrey Yao , an English translator and teacher at the Graduate Institute of Interpretation and Translation at Shanghai International Studies University who is leading the sign exorcism .
But even as he eradicates the most egregious examples by government fiat — businesses dare not ignore the commission ’s suggested fixes — he has mixed feelings , noting that although some Chinglish phrases sound awkward to Western ears , they can be refreshingly lyrical .
“ Some of it tends to be expressive , even elegant , ” he said , shuffling through an online catalog of signs that were submitted by the volunteers who prowled Shanghai with digital cameras .
“ They provide a window into how we Chinese think about language . ”
What happens when you add a Portal gun to the already hilarious arsenal that Team Fortress 2 has ?
An even more hilarious game of epic proportions .
Last week , a video was released by the 3 - Point Games Gaming Community that showed an early alpha build of the Team Portress Mod project .
Today , John , Mr_Mustash ( Reddit friend of mine ) , and I were allowed into Team Portress Mod private server to get a hands - on demo .
To sum it up , it would be like saying “ It ’s something we never knew we needed . ”
To read on for my full review and some video highlights , go past the break .
Please note that 2 of the videos are me playing the mod .
If it looks like I suck , it ’s because I ’m exploring the mod rather than using my super - powered - awesome - epic - pro- status - skills .
UPDATE : We ’ve uploaded 2 more videos of Team Portress gameplay from a Scout ’s POV

3 - Point Games community member , Pawn , is the creator of this mod .
Pawn said he has been working on this mod project since Portal 2 was announced .
He also added that it was just something that needed to get done .
His fellow community members told me that he had been through every inch of the Source SDK non-stop .
I asked if the Portal Gun and physics were tough to recreate in Team Fortress 2 .
He told me that it was a bit tough , but he did do a lot of reading between both TF2 and Portal Wikis , which helped him out a great deal .
As with alphas and betas of anything , there were a couple of bugs right from the start of our experience .
It reminded us immediately that even though this was a great mod , it really is n’t ready for “ primetime . ”
Some of the bugs that are in need of stomping were : the Portal Gun replaced your number “ 2 ” key binding , sometimes the mod crashed the server , and because of the latest Source SDK update , other people could n’t see that you were holding the portal gun .
It just looked like you are holding nothing in your hands .
Besides those little bugs , using the Portal gun in combat added a whole new strategy to Team Fortress 2 .
For example , a couple of people playing the alpha test were engineers .
After building a level 3 sentry gun , they would create an exit portal right next to the gun , go find an enemy to fight with their shotguns , switch to the Portal gun , then shoot an entrance portal at their feet .
If you ca n’t see what happens next in your head , I ’ll spell it out for you .
The enemy gets teleported right in front of the sentry gun for a sweet instant kill for the engineer .
Now , how ’s that for an “ engy ” update ?
[ blip.tv ?posts_id=3651500&dest=-1 ]
All in all , the mod was really well done and excites me in the pants .
More so because of how huge my ( that ’s right ladies ) Team Fortress 2 fandom is .
Like I said The Portal gun and physics added a whole new strategy and element to the game that could make the already fun and awesome game of Team Fortress 2 even better !
Below are a couple more quick notes I wrote while playing :
When completed , Pawn wants other “ mappers ” to build maps around the Portal gun element
Projectiles do not go through the portals
Shooting portals does not have the same speed as in Portal the game .
They shoot from the portal gun to the wall in the same speed as a regular rocket launcher
Enemies can destroy your portals by shooting them and vice versa
If you die , your portals get destroyed as well
The Portal Gun , physics , and portals took over 2,000 lines of code to create
I would like to thank the 3 - Point Gaming community for allowing us to test this mod and Pawn for creating something epic .
I cannot wait for this mod to come out .
But I can wait for it to be bug free and polished .

A team of archaeologists who uncovered a 1,400 year old pyramid in Peru say that the finding is particularly unusual .
The flat - topped pyramid , which was built by the Moche culture , was used for the living rather than just for the dead , and contains a wealth of artefacts , murals and human remains .
The pyramid was discovered at Huaca Colorada , which translates as ‘ coloured hill ’ .
Excavation leader Professor Edward Swenson , of the University of Toronto , describes how he suspected that the area may be archaeologically significant .
“ I knew it was more than a natural hill – this was modified . ”
Swenson ’s hunch paid off .
With the pyramid so far only partially uncovered , archaeologists have already made remarkable discoveries .
“ Our biggest surprise was that at the top of this pyramid construction we found elite residences ” , said Prof Swenson , who added that it is very unusual to find pyramids used in this way .
The Moche are known to have used pyramids for burials and ritual activity rather than everyday living .
The living complex would have housed no more than 25 people , and was complete with patios , a kitchen , and stands for ‘ paica ’ – large vessels for storing water and corn beer .
The team also identified a bin used to hold guinea pigs :
“ The preservation was so good that we actually came across guinea pig coprolites ( faeces ) . ”
Several murals covered the corridors at the pyramid 's summit .
The best - preserved of these depicts a Moche warrior - who Swenson describes as looking “ like a Smurf ” - carrying a club .
Other murals include a depiction of what appears to be a cactus with two mountain peaks and a rainbow , and a representation of two litter - bearers carrying a person .
Evidence of ritual sacrifice was also discovered at the site .
The skeletons of three adolescent girls , and body parts belonging to four other individuals , were found on a platform at the top of the pyramid .
The girls were buried with beads around their neck and their feet were close together , suggesting that they had been bound .
Charring on the girls ' knees indicate that their bodies were subject to “ ritualistic burning . ”
This evidence raises the possibility that the girls were sacrificed as part of a ritual , something not uncommon among the Moche .
However physical anthropologists examining the skeletons could find no evidence of trauma .
This means the girls either died naturally or were killed in such a way that no evidence was left on their bones .
“ It ’s possible they were sacrificed but we do n’t know , ” adds Prof Swenson .
To the south of the pyramid the team found a large number of copper artefacts including spatulas , knives , smelting receptacles and ornaments .
“ I ’ve never found such a high quantity of copper , ” says Swenson .
“ The power of these elites could very much have been grounded in control of copper production . ”
Huaca Colorada is near the coast of Peru where copper is scarce , so the site ’s rulers would have had to trade with people living in the mountains , at least 200 km to the east .
Swenson speculates that the rulers “ may have been considered lords – but lords of a particular kind – in transforming ore into finished products ” .
Alternatively , says Swenson , there could have been a “ corporation of co-operating but high status practitioners . ”
Huaca Colorada appears to be undefended .
Swenson said the team found “ no walls , no sling - stones ... unlike many of the sites built on the coastal hills . ”
The area surrounding the settlement was mostly flat , and would have offered little resistance from invaders .
There was certainly warfare in the Moche world , but perhaps , for some unknown reason , Huaca Colorada and its pyramid were off - limits to invaders .
“ It ’s kind of like ( the ) open city of Rome in World War II , ” says Swenson .
“ I do n’t know exactly what ’s going on . ”
Me : “ Hello , sir .
How can I help ? ”
Customer : “ I want to make a complaint about the lady who just served my wife .
She is eight - months pregnant .
When she came to pay , the checkout girl did n’t offer to help with the packing .
She let my wife struggle ! ”
Me : “ I ’m really sorry .
It ’s store policy to ask if the customer needs help with the packing .
Do you have the receipt so I can see who served her ? ”
( I walk over to the till and show the checkout girl the receipt .
She explains what happened .
I return to the customer . )
Me : “ Hi , sir .
The checkout girl explained that your wife was on her phone at the till .
She asked a few times if she needed help packing but she did n’t answer .
I ’m confident we did all we could to help . ”
Customer : “ Well , that ’s not good enough .
I want some money back on the shopping for the poor service .
My wife is pregnant and in a lot of pain and had to struggle on her own .
No one helped her . ”
Me : “ This receipt is from a few minutes ago .
Can I ask where you were ? ”
Customer : “ I sat in the car waiting for her to come back .
What ’s that got to do with anything ? ”
Light and Crispy Tempura with Shrimp and Assorted Vegetables
NotesVegetables for Tempura
You ’ll want at least 4 different vegetables , but 6 or even 8 would be so much more fun !
How many pieces should you prepare overall ?
For six people , you could get away with two dozen pieces — but for my kind of crowd , I ’d be ready to go with 50 or 60 .
Zucchini .
Choose smallish zucchini .
Cut off the ends , leaving a cylinder that ’s about 4 inches long .
Stand the cylinder on one of its round bottoms ( choose the wider of the two ) .
Starting at the top and cutting downward toward the counter , cut off an 1/8 - inch slice of skin on two opposite sides and discard .
Now cut the remaining block of zucchini into rectangles that are ¼ inch thick ( they will have a strip of skin on the outside , and seeds in the center ) .
Sweet Potato .
This is one of the great tempura candidates .
Peel and cut the potato into 1/8 - inch rounds .
You may substitute regular white potato , which will give you a french - fry taste .
Snow Pea .
This makes delicious tempura , but there are two tricks you should know .
First , dampen the pea pods with a little water so they ’ll take the initial flour dusting .
Second , when the pea pod tempura comes out of the hot oil , cut it with a very sharp knife , on the diagonal , into 3 or 4 pieces , cutting swiftly and deftly to keep the coating on .
String Bean .
Follow the directions for snow peas .
Japanese Eggplant .
Cut the eggplant , skin on , into ¼-inch slices .
Or try this much more interesting cut .
Buy small Japanese eggplants that weigh about 3 ounces each .
Cut off the stem end and halve the eggplant lengthwise .
With the cut side of one half on the counter , make four cuts the long way , keeping the flesh attached at the stem end , to create a fan .
Spread the fan out with your fingers .
Repeat with the other eggplant half .
When flouring and battering , keep spreading the fan out , making sure that all exposed flesh gets coated .
Onion .
Slice an onion ( preferably a sweet one ) very thinly and toss into tangles .
Pick up about 2 tablespoons of tangle , and proceed with flouring and battering .
When the tangle hits the oil it will spread out a bit .
Enoki Mushroom .
Treat these long , thin mushrooms like onion slices : just force ’em into a tangle .
You ’ll be amazed at the depth of flavor .
Shiso .
If you can find shiso leaves ( sometimes called perilla ) — a Japanese herb that tastes like minty pine — you can make one of the most exciting tempura items !
Flour and batter lightly on one side , then pop into the oil .
Nori .
Nori , the dried sheet of compressed seaweed used so often at the sushi bar , makes great tempura .
Cut a strip that ’s about 1 by 2 inches .
As with shiso , flour and batter on one side only .
Shrimp for Tempura
The ideal in shrimp tempura — which you can see in any good Japanese restaurant — is a straight shrimp , not at all curled .
This takes a little work — and a few tips from Sachi .
First , buy shrimp that run about 24 to the pound .
Then you can easily do the math : if you ’d like to serve each guest 8 shrimp , you ’ll need about 2 pounds .
Peel off the shells , but leave the tail section intact .
The trick is to remove a small piece of shell that looks like a thorn ; it ’s right over the spot where the tail meets the shrimp flesh .
Just pick it off .
This little piece holds water , which is not good for the frying .
Similarly , the ends of the tail hold water .
Lay the shrimp on the counter , and with a sharp knife , diagonally cut off the bottom 1/8 inch of the tail ; you will likely see water being expelled as you do .
Place the shrimp on its side on the cutting board , with the “ back ” of the shrimp to your right ( if you ’re a righty ! ) .
With one hand , hold the flat side of the blade of a chef ’s knife along the vein side of the shrimp ; working with your other hand , push the shrimp up against the blade , lining it up against the blade and straightening the shrimp in the process .
Make a slit along the vein side of the shrimp , and use the knife to pick out the vein .
Time to enforce the straightening .
Pick up the shrimp , and place it de-veinedside down on the cutting board .
With the knife , make four even gashes on the underside of the shrimp ( where the legs were ) ; each gash should be about 3/8 inch thick .
Now turn the shrimp over , so the de-veined side is on top .
Use the first two fingers of both hands to press firmly on the tail end , until you hear a little crack .
Move your fingers up the shrimp and crack it again .
Crack it two more times , moving toward the head end of the shrimp .
Now wrap your fingers around the shrimp , which is still de-veined side up on the board , squeezing hard from both sides toward the center .
You will end up with a long , straight , slightly compressed strip of shrimp .
It is now ready for flouring and battering .
You can have more than 1 piece of tempura going at a time , perhaps as many as 6 pieces in a large wok , and if you have two large woks with hot oil , 12 pieces simultaneously !
Start slowly , but you will soon get into the rhythm .
You may want to use a spider or tongs for efficiency .
Try to keep the oil at an even 335 °F .
The Mazda dealership in Orangeville may have given new meaning to the automaker ’s slogan of “ zoom , zoom , zoom ” for motorist Madeline Leonard .
Leonard walked into the dealership wanting to replace the tires on her 2004 car .
By the time she left she was on the hook for a spiffy , black 2010 Mazda6 sedan at the eye - popping price of almost $ 66,000 , after taxes and the value of her trade - in vehicle .
That ’s $ 25,000 more than she should have paid , according to Ontario ’s auto regulator .
She says “ Moe , ” the salesman , talked fast .
The numbers whizzed by and before she knew it she had bought the 2010 model .
“ I was overwhelmed and confused and I soon felt like I had been mistreated , ” the 56 - year - old woman said in an interview from her small , subsidized apartment in the town 85 km northwest of Toronto .
The Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council , which regulates new and used car dealers , took action after she complained .
Its investigation found she should have paid about $ 41,000 for the vehicle — which was n’t even new .
“ In my eight years here , I have n’t seen a case like this , ” said Carey Smith , the regulator ’s director of investigations .
“ The deal was way over the top regarding pricing . ”
Smith has charged Mazda of Orangeville and two senior employees with breaching Ontario legislation that protects consumers .
The dealership could face a fine of up to $ 250,000 if found guilty .
Kien Trung , business manager at Mazda of Orangeville and one of the employees facing charges , said he did not treat Leonard improperly or make any big profits in the deal in late December .
“ We did n’t do anything wrong in the case of this transaction , ” said Trung .
“ We made a little bit of money on the deal .
I guess she was not happy with it . ”
In promotional messages , the dealership says it treats customers “ with dignity and respect . ”
But Smith said in Leonard ’s case , the store and two employees used several tactics to unfairly jack up the price .
“ They put a list price of a new vehicle on the model but it was a demonstrator that the dealer used with about 6,000 kilometres on it , ” he noted .
Mazda Canada lists the base price of the new sedan at $ 39,969 on its national website , but the dealership allegedly posted a sticker of $ 45,846 on the car .
Smith said the salesmen also billed Leonard , who is intellectually disabled , about $ 4,500 for a “ protection package ” that included fabric guarding , rust and sound proofing and window etching .
Other dealers charge about a third of that for the same items , he said .
Furthermore , Smith said Leonard , who is unemployed , should not have qualified for a loan from the dealer because her monthly income including a disability pension is less than $ 2,000 .
But Smith added that did n’t stop the two employees from offering an eight - year loan that will result in about $ 16,000 in financing costs for her , including a final balloon payment of $ 7,000 .
Mazda of Orangeville says in a promotional message for phone callers that owning “ your dream vehicle might be easier than you think . ”
The message goes on : “ If you are a great person with not - so - good credit , we have you in mind . ”
Leonard said she originally came to the store to replace the tires on her 2004 Mazda3 and did n’t even want to buy a car .

“ I wished I had never walked into the place , ” she said .
“ I ’ve had a lot of trouble keeping up with these payments .
The stress has been terrible . ”
Leonard described the salesman at the dealership as “ slick ” and the process mesmerized her .
But after signing a contract and driving the vehicle away , she checked prices at other Mazda outlets .
“ The differences were shocking , ” she said .
“ I felt very disappointed how I was treated . ”
The regulator charged the dealership ; Trung , 38 , of Vaughan ; and sales manager Mohammed ( Moe ) Shaikh , 46 , of Mississauga with “ engaging in unfair practice by making an unconscionable representation , ” contrary to the provincial Consumer Protection Act .
Trung said the defendants will plead not guilty when they appear in court this month .
Under the act , the employees could receive fines up to $ 100,000 each and / or two years less a day in jail if found guilty .
The defendants could also be liable for damages to Leonard .
The regulator could also revoke the registrations of the dealerships and salesmen .
“ Dealers tell me there is nothing wrong with making money but the law says there is something wrong if you take advantage of someone , ” Smith said .
Mazda Canada said it would not decide on any action involving the dealership until a court rules on the charges .
“ Obviously we expect our dealers and staff to operate professionally , ” said spokesman Greg Young .
“ We ’ll see what the ( court ) determination is . ”
Mazda of Orangeville has also popped up on the radar screen of the Better Business Bureau of Mid-Western and Central Ontario .
Although the dealership is not a member , the bureau has received six complaints and issued a D+ rating on a scale from A+ to F since January 2008 .
“ It speaks for itself , ” said a bureau official .

theatre news
Thinking about how to shunt Subjectiviste forward , I ’m adding performance video compilation posts ( under the recurring title some productions ) and stories from theatreland ( links to news , reviews , interviews , etc – as where now ) .
These will flank the ongoing core studies of plays and playwrights ( expect Genet , Lorca , Churchill nextish ) , and I ’m hoping I can mange one of each a week ( hopelessly hopeful … )
Starting with economics , an American ’s view of UK funding culture was slight , but triggered the kind of mutinous banquet that comment boxes can be at their best – my high point : “ … the arguments have to be about what kind of civilised country we want to be . ” ( JHolloway )
In the real world , Brighton Festival entered it ’s third or terminal week and , as one of the judges of the best new play in fest award I saw many , many pieces that I can not talk about .
But I am going to glance toward The Arts Desk ’s article on I Am a Warehouse because I got to spend an evening exploring Newhaven Fort which was more fun than blogging by a factor of how - long - have - you - got ?
Love or hate him , it ’s time to say goodbye ( or , um , get out , I guess ) to The Times ’ Benedict Nightingale , who wrote a quite - sweet - actually last column looking over his career ( meanwhile , The Stage surveyed the position of the critic in 2010 ) .
George Hunka angled David Mamet ’s new book , Theatre , as a prism to scout the old master ’s recent right turn and how that might tie to the wider mindset of American theatre circa now .
Finally , I wish I could have gone along to the ICA ’s Futures and Pasts symposium , which hosted , and probably prodded at , possibly tickled , some of the wildest minds in live art .
Read ( or hear ) Chris Goode ’s thirty one - minute lectures for an idea ( well , thirty ideas ) .
Finally plus one : in a similar vein , why not mainline primary evidence from Forest Fringe ’s Mayfest Microfest page ?
Energising times .
With gasoline prices on the rise and carbon dioxide emissions threatening to bring about global climate disaster , MIT spinoff startup Levant Power is trying to help drivers cut fuel consumption — by turning their shock absorbers into a source of energy .
A car going down a bumpy road vibrates .
Springs absorb the vibrations , and shock absorbers damp the action of the springs by dissipating the energy as heat .
Levant Power plans to recover some of this energy through a new type of shock absorber the company calls GenShock , which converts the energy into electricity .
And Levant Chief Operating Officer and co-founder Zackary Anderson says the company is on track for large - scale production of the shocks — which can be installed on cars , trucks , trains , Humvees , and even tanks — in 12 to 18 months .
“ Talks with potential manufacturers are ongoing , and a major focus of the company is selecting the right partners , ” Anderson says .
Levant is pilot - testing the new shocks on buses , trucks , and military vehicles .
The startup has signed test agreements with several vehicle manufactures , who are paying for the test units .
“ It is a good deal and an important step for Levant Power , ” Anderson says .
Between those agreements and the capital that Levant has raised from private investors , Anderson says , the company has the resources necessary to develop its products .
( Levant is not currently disclosing the identities of its investors or vehicle manufacturer partners nor the amount of capital it has raised , though we reported a $ 400,000 equity deal for the startup last October . )
Anderson founded Levant with Shakeel Avadhany ( now CEO ) and Vladimir Tarasov ( now VP of marketing ) in 2008 , when the three were all undergraduate students at MIT .
“ MIT gave us a lot of support , ” Anderson says .
The trio concluded that only about 20 percent of the fuel that a car or truck burns is used to actually move the vehicle .
Some of the lost energy is dissipated through the suspension , and Anderson , Avadhany , and Tarasov wanted to capture at least some of that escaping valuable stuff .
To do so , they built a new kind of shock absorber that uses the bouncing and vibrations of the vehicle to pump a fluid through a hydraulic motor .
The motor is coupled to a generator that produces electricity to drive accessories , relieve strain on the alternator , and charge the battery .
All in all , Levant expects that its new shocks can cut fuel consumption by one to six percent , depending on a vehicle ’s weight and the terrain traversed — the heavier the vehicle and the rougher the terrain , the greater the savings .
Levant ’s strategy is to bring the new shock absorber technology — which can be retrofitted into existing vehicles — to market first in heavy vehicles , with passenger cars following suit approximately one to two years later .
The company is starting in the United States but eventually will target global markets as well .
Anderson projects that Levant ’s shocks will be more expensive than a conventional units , but on par or less expensive than “ intelligent shocks ” that dynamically change damping levels based on road conditions — a function that Levant ’s technology can also perform .
All in all , Levant ’s shock absorbers will be priced for a less - than - two - year payback , Anderson says .
And the startup calculates that Sysco , Coca - Cola , and Walmart , for example , would each save more than $ 30 million in six years if they equipped their truck fleets with the new shock absorbers .

Critics called it the " best ad ever , " but many fans are rueing Nike 's World Cup spot as the tournament enters its final stages .
Nearly every soccer player prominently featured in the lavish " Write the Future " ad had an extremely poor World Cup campaign , leading to a great deal of only half - facetious speculation about whether the commercial had " cursed " its superstar protagonists .
" Not one of its stars has played anything like the beautiful game , " says Asher Klein in The New York Times , and many of them crashed out in the group stages — " does that spell out a curse ? "
Yes , it does , says Richard Whittall at Yahoo Sports .
The ad " ripped through the chances of almost every one of its featured World Cup hopefuls , " and even some of the " ad 's non-footballing celebrities " have been affected .
Here 's a look at the carnage :
Didier Drogba
Country : Ivory Coast
Can be seen at : 0:03 — 0:30
The curse strikes :
The Cote D'Ivoire striker almost did n't make the World Cup at all , after fracturing his arm shortly before the tournament began .
But even with the Chelsea star playing , his team " collapsed in the group stage . "
An injury - hampered Drogba scored just one goal in the World Cup .
Fabio Cannavaro
Country : Italy
Can be seen at : 0:10 — 0:45
The curse strikes :
The Italian defender is shown in the ad heroically saving a goal with a backflip kick .
If only he had shown such skill on the actual field — Cannavaro 's typically stingy " past - it Italian defense " let in five goals in three games , and the world champions failed to get past the group stage .
Wayne Rooney
Country : England
Can be seen at : 0:45 — 1:44
The curse strikes :
The striker failed to score a single goal in the World Cup , and " barely ventured into the German area " during England 's 4 - 1 defeat in the knock - out stage .
As predicted in the ad , the British tabloids have ripped him to pieces .
Our " so - called talisman could n't even control the ball , " said the Sun 's Steven Howard .
" What an embarrassment . "
Franck Ribery
Country : France
Can be seen at : 0:56 — 1:27
The curse strikes :
The sensational meltdown of France 's World Cup squad barely needs repeating , but Ribery was also accused of soliciting sex with an underage prostitute before the tournament even started .
The winger could not inspire his team beyond the opening stages in South Africa .
Roger Federer
Country : Switzerland
Can be seen at : 1:41 — 1:44
The curse strikes :
Even star tennis players are n't immune from the curse .
Shown briefly playing Rooney at table tennis , Federer lost his No. 1 world ranking soon after the Nike ad premiered , and narrowly avoided a humbling first round defeat at Wimbledon last week .
Ronaldinho
Country : Brazil
Can be seen at : 1:50 — 2:12
The curse strikes :
The curse struck the A.C. Milan star early — he was dropped from the Brazilian World Cup squad in May .
Cristiano Ronaldo
Country : Portugal
Can be seen at : 2:12 — 2:58
The curse strikes :
The Portuguese striker may be the only soccer player not to have been afflicted by the curse ... so far .
Ronaldo broke his scoreless international run during his team 's 7 - 0 drubbing of North Korea — but Portugal 's game against Spain this afternoon will determine whether or not he has truly escaped unscathed .
4.27 PM update : Portugal lost , and the curse has claimed its last victim .

En pleine campagne militaire , le camp d'Arthur est en difficulté .
Arthur et Lancelot décident de tenter une dernière action : envoyer Perceval et une troupe d'archers près de la frontière du Pays de Galles .
Ce dernier peine à comprendre sa mission .
104 .
La blessure mortelle : Daprès la Dame du Lac , Arthur se verra conduire par la fée Morgane , le jour de sa mort , sur lîle dAvalon .
Justement , après une sévère blessure , Morgane apparaît et demande à Arthur de la suivre .
Celui - ci refuse tant que Merlin ne la pas soigné .
Ce dernier arrive à le guérir contre toute attente , et Morgane déprime .
103 . L'Escorte : Arthur convoque Bohort au château alors que celui- ci se trouve dans le camp de Léodagan .
Bohort doit traverser la forêt en pleine nuit .
Contre toute attente , Léodagan et Bohort sympathisent et Léodagan escorte personnellement le chevalier peureux , et en profite pour lui parler de ses futures tourelles .
102 . Merlin et les Loups :
Les envahisseurs sont en marche .
Arthur , Léodagan , Lancelot et larmée de Kaamelott sont en position dans une forêt , et tentent de mettre en place un plan pour encercler lennemi  plan qui repose en grande partie sur lintervention de Merlin et de son sort de « mur de flammes ».
Seul problème : les loups grondent pour prévenir quune des leurs a été victime dune fracture .
Le druide doit donc choisir entre secourir la louve ou protéger Kaamelott .
Il choisira la première solution , tandis que larmée adverse viendra se fracasser contre Arthur et ses hommes .
98 . Le Sort de rage :
Arthur est las de voir ses hommes se battre mollement , et décide donc de faire envoyer par Merlin un sort de rage pour « remuer » ses troupes .
Le sort touche aussi malheureusement les troupes adverses et , très vite , les deux armées attaquent dun commun accord Arthur et les chevaliers .
96 . Le Pain : Guethenoc enrage , mais cest un fait : le pain de Kaamelott est le plus mauvais de toute la Bretagne .
Comme il hurle au complot , Arthur et Léodagan convoquent Karadoc pour goûter aux divers pains proposés par Guethenoc .
Le jugement du « roi de la fourchette » est sans appel : « Cest de la merde . »
91 . Adoubement : Arthur saperçoit que Perceval na jamais été adoubé , et donc par conséquent quil nest pas un chevalier et na pas sa place autour de la Table Ronde .
Perceval , quant à lui , ne comprend pas pourquoi son armure ou son arme ne lui confère pas de légitimité .
Arthur finira par adouber Perceval à la va-vite .
90 .
Arthur et la question :
Un voleur nargue lautorité du roi en refusant de dénoncer ses complices .
Léodagan propose de le torturer , et fait venir Arthur et Bohort pour leur présenter les produits de Venec .
De son côté , Guenièvre voudrait que Arthur lui raconte ses journées .
89 . Le Fléau de Dieu : Arthur , Léodagan et Bohort doivent négocier face à Attila , roi des Huns .
La réunion , dans la salle du trône , révèle que lenvahisseur a des exigences déraisonnables : il veut lintégralité de lor de Kaamelott .
Face aux protestations du roi , et en dépit de ses terribles cris , Attila montre quil nest pas aussi terrifiant que sa réputation laffirme .
Ainsi , après dâpres négociations , le chef barbare crie victoire : il a gagné un plat cuisiné .
88 . La dent de requin : Perceval et Karadoc ont été envoyés chez Merlin chercher une dent de requin dont il a besoin sur le champ de bataille pour lancer un sort sur lennemi .
Les deux amis , parvenus à la taverne avec lobjet , décident apeurés par une prétendue malédiction de le faire brûler par laubergiste .
Pendant ce temps , Merlin parvient à trouver une dent de rongeur en forêt et tente de lancer le sort .
Celui - ci ne parvient quà provoquer une crise de fou rire chez larmée adverse .
Toutefois la diversion permet à
Arthur de remporter la bataille , et d'élaborer une nouvelle tactique : passer pour des incapables en un temps record .
86 . Le prodige du fakir :
En mission en Gaule , Yvain et Gauvain , qui ont rencontré un fakir et des éléphants , tentent de raconter leurs mésaventures au roi et au Père Blaise .
85 . La Mort le Roy Arthur :
Pour ramener de largent dans les caisses du royaume , Père Blaise organise des visites guidées de Kaamelott .
Lors de lune dentre elles , Arthur lentend mentionner la prochaine étape de la visite : le tombeau du défunt et légendaire roi Arthur .
Cette invention du prêtre , étudiée pour soustraire plus dargent aux visiteurs en jouant sur leur émotion , nest pas du goût du roi .
83 .
Le secret de Lancelot :
Arthur doit sabsenter et cherche un chevalier de confiance pour veiller sur la reine .
Lancelot , secrètement amoureux , se porte volontaire .
Il ne reste plus quau roi et son ami à convaincre Guenièvre dêtre surveillée , ainsi que de porter une ceinture de chasteté .
81 . Les Volontaires : Désireux dobtenir les félicitations du roi , Perceval et Karadoc sont volontaires pour laccompagner en mission en souterrain .
En plein combat , ils fuient et abandonnent le roi en prise avec des gobelins .
80 .
Le sixième sens : Karadoc et Perceval sont convoqués à la Table Ronde .
Cest la Dame du Lac qui veut les voir , et Arthur , seul avec eux , leur explique quils ne pourront pas la voir .
Arrivée , elle explique que Perceval aura un destin exceptionnel , à la grande surprise du roi .
79 .
Le maître d'Armes :
Arthur se fait entrainer par son maître darmes , qui stimule le combat en insultant copieusement le roi .
Ce dernier napprécie guère , et le fait savoir .
Le maître d'armes , dévoué à son roi , lui explique que sans les insultes , il leur serait difficile d'avoir envie de se battre l'un contre l'autre .
Il exhorte Arthur à suivre son exemple .
Arthur entre un peu trop bien dans le jeu : il utilise des blessures intimes du maître .
Cela stimule d'autant plus les combattants .
78 . Codes et stratégies :
Arthur et ses chevaliers dirigent une bataille depuis une colline .
Mais les hommes ne regardent pas les signaux que létat - major leur envoie , ce qui les mène vers une défaite certaine .
75 . Guenièvre et les oiseaux : Guenièvre évite la salle à manger depuis quelle a appris que la charpente trouée laisse passer les oiseaux .
Arthur apprend donc quelle a peur des volatiles .
Néanmoins , il savère aussi que Yvain a peur des guêpes , et le roi des serpents .
74 . L'expurgation de Merlin : Le Répurgateur est agacé par Merlin et sa pratique de la magie : il souhaite le faire brûler en tant quhérétique .
Arthur persuade alors lenchanteur de reconnaître lexistence du « dieu unique » devant lhomme dÉglise .
Le Répurgateur est satisfait , mais prend Merlin un peu trop de haut .
Résultat : ses cheveux et sa barbe poussent de façon démesurée , sans qu'il puisse prouver que cela vient de l'enchanteur .
71 . La botte secréte : Quand Karadoc ne comprend pas un mot , et quil ne souhaite pas passer pour « un gland » , il répond à ses interlocuteurs : « Cest pas faux .
» Perceval , instruit de cette « botte secrète » , lutilise à tort et à travers avec son amante Angharad , ainsi quavec le roi et Lancelot , ce qui est propice à maints quiproquos .
70 .
Perceval relance de quinze :
Le patron de la taverne invite Perceval et Karadoc à faire une partie de Cul de chouette , un jeu de dés .
Perceval , éliminé de la partie de Cul de chouette , propose alors de jouer à un jeu du Pays de Galles et il savère vite quil est le seul à en comprendre les règles .
69 .
Le dernier empereur :
Le centurion romain Caius Camilus est invité à la table du roi , et fait part de la prochaine désertion de larmée de César de lîle de Bretagne .
En effet , le nouvel empereur est âgé de onze ans , et la rumeur court quil sagit du dernier .
68 . La fureur du Dragon : Yvain et Gauvain sont accompagnés par Arthur et Perceval dans une chasse au dragon en forêt qui tourne vite au fiasco .
65 .
Feu l'âne de Guethenoc : Guethenoc accuse Roparzh davoir tué son âne , et la séance de doléances devient un prétexte à un réglement de compte entre les deux paysans , au grand dam dArthur et Lancelot .
64 . La table de Breccan :
Arthur a commandé une table ronde et cest le moment de constater lachèvement de la commande .
Il regrette quelle ne soit pas en pierre , et lartisan le prévient de se méfier du cuir : cest salissant .
63 . Goustan le Cruel : Arthur reçoit à sa table Goustan le Cruel , père de Léodagan et ancien roi de Carmélide .
Goustan na de cesse de critiquer le comportement dArthur ( ses excès de table , ses idées novatrices , sa sagesse , labsence dun héritier ) mais se demande malgré tout les raisons qui poussent les habitants de Carmélide à fuir le pays .
Arthur , lui , a son idée : entre Goustan «le Cruel » et Arthur «le Juste » , les gens ont fait leur choix .
62 . Le Chaudron Rutilant : Arthur et Perceval partent en quête du chaudron rutilant , un chaudron qui sillumine si on lit un parchemin magique en sa présence .
Seul problème : Perceval a oublié le parchemin à la taverne .
61 . Le Cas Yvain : Yvain , fils de Léodagan et de Séli , est un jeune chevalier peu dynamique qui passe le plus clair de son temps à dormir et vadrouiller avec son ami Gauvain .
Réunis autour de la Table ronde , Arthur et les parents discutent de lavenir dYvain , tiraillé entre lintimidation martiale du père et lappui artistique de la mère .
52 . Le code de chevalerie : Le Père Blaise et Léodagan ont traduit le code de chevalerie , originellement écrit en ancien celte .
Depuis , larmée fait grêve lors des combats et les chevaliers se « relâchent » lors des veilles de pleines lunes .
Tout compte fait , Arthur décidera de réinstaurer lancien code .
51 . Le banquet des chefs : À Kaamelott , on prépare le banquet des chefs de clans .
Bohort veut servir des fruits de saisons , tandis que Venec insiste pour quils commandent plusieurs douzaines de femmes , et propose de fournir trois porcs par personne aux chefs .
47 . Patience dans la plaine :
Arthur et ses hommes sont sur le champ de bataille .
Mais lennemi est absent et se fait attendre très longtemps .
42 . Basidiomycètes : Quelques heures avant un assaut , gagné davance , contre lennemi , les troupes dArthur se réunissent en forêt et mangent une omelette , avec des champignons soigneusement cueillis par Perceval et Karadoc .
Toutefois , ceux - ci ne savent pas reconnaître les champignons dangereux , et bientôt de sérieux troubles gastriques éparpillent larmée dans les fourrés .
38 . Le Repos du guerrier : Demetra , Perceval et Guenièvre reprochent à Arthur davoir lhumeur variable : après quelques nuits avec Demetra , il serait calme et généreux , mais après quelques nuits avec Guenièvre , il deviendrait agressif et cinglant .
36 . La Taxe militaire :
Le seigneur Jacca , que Léodagan croyait mort , vient protester contre une taxe que le royaume lui réclame , alors quil est noble .
Les ministres dArthur lui répondent que cest une taxe normale décidée pour tous les seigneurs non combattants .
Jacca hésite alors entre payer , tout en se plaignant de ne pas avoir la somme , et rejoindre larmée , tout en espérant un poste planqué .
Sommé de payer tout en étant interdit de prélever l'argent sur ses paysans , Jacca se tâte .
33 . Guenièvre et l Orage :
Un orage sabat sur le château , et Guenièvre est terrifiée dans son lit : elle pense que les dieux veulent la punir .
Arthur se voit alors obligé de la réconforter .
30 . Heat : Arthur , Léodagan et Perceval sont isolés en forêt pendant une bataille et se cachent derrière des arbres .
Tout en cherchant à imaginer des plans pour se tirer de cette situation , Arthur et Léodagan constatent la bêtise de Perceval , qui suggère de très nombreuses solutions stupides ( telles quun allumage dincendie pour débusquer les ennemis ) , ce qui manque de les faire repérer .
28 . Un bruit dans la nuit : À la veille dune bataille , Arthur et ses troupes campent en forêt .
Bohort ne parvient pas à dormir , et chercher à se rassurer auprès du roi sur les animaux peuplant la forêt .
Arthur parvient à lui faire croire quil ny a que des lapins , avant que Léodagan ne déclare avoir rencontré un ours .
27 . Le Négociateur :
Des barbares sont aux portes du domaine , et Arthur et ses chevaliers sapprêtent à partir les chasser .
Mais Bohort a négocié avec eux , et a obtenu quils nattaquent point en échange des marais , ce qui fâche Arthur et Léodagan .
En effet , pour une fois , ils étaient sûrs de gagner .
D'autant plus que Bohort a cédé des terres aux envahisseurs : toutes celles qui bordent le château .
Finalement la bataille a bien lieu , mais au pied des remparts .
24 . Le Trois de cur :
Arthur se sent très mal à laise de devoir partager sa couche avec deux personnes : sa femme et sa maîtresse Demetra .
22 . Un roi à la taverne :
Arthur a réussi à retrouver Perceval et Karadoc à la taverne .
Ces derniers justifient leur absence de la Table ronde , tandis que le roi leur entretient de leur destin , et que le tavernier cherche à savoir où il la déjà vu .
19 . Les Fesses de Guenièvre : Le Père Blaise met une touche finale à lécriture d'une aventure dArthur et de Perceval , et en fait la lecture aux intéressés .
Mais dans la scène finale , lors de la récapitulation des différents protagonistes , il fait mention de la reine dune manière assez inattendue ( « Guenièvre à la blanche fesse » ) , ce qui provoque lire du roi .
18 . Eunuques et Chauds Lapins :
Arthur a convié Perceval à dîner , ainsi que le Perse Narsès , général de lempire byzantin .
Bien que cet invité soit eunuque  un mot qu'il faut expliquer laborieusement à Perceval et qui a pour conséquence de lui donner la nausée  il se montre particulièrement insistant pour voir des femmes .
Et comme Arthur lui demande ce quil compte faire , Narsès explique quil se contente de regarder les ébats des autres .
8 . Tel un chevalier : Vexé par une insulte de Léodagan , Perceval se confie à Karadoc , qui lui recommande de ne pas se laisser faire .
Il lui rappelle qu'il est un vrai chevalier et lui suggère d'aller voir le Roi et d'exiger qu'on le considère en tant que tel .
Perceval en parle à Arthur à l'occasion d'un repas .
7. Le Coup dépée :
Arthur est sévèrement atteint à la tête et requiert laide de Merlin pour le guérir avec des incantations magiques .
Toutefois , ce dernier souhaite utiliser des méthodes modernes , cest - à- dire désinfecter au gros sel .
Arthur napprécie guère , et injecte à Merlin le relaxant qu'il lui destinait .
Puis il lui conseille d'oublier cette nouvelle mode : la médecine ...
5 . Des nouvelles du monde : Guenièvre et sa mère ont convoqué un barde au dîner , qui leur chante les nouvelles du monde .
Malheureusement , les chansons sont atroces et les nouvelles sont vagues  y compris une qui concernerait la mort du roi Loth d'Orcanie .
3. Le Repas de famille : Arthur , Guenièvre et ses parents sont à table .
Léodagan et Arthur discutent stratégie militaire , ce qui contrarie Séli et la Reine .
Le ton monte , l'ambiance s'envenime et Guenièvre découvre au détour d'une réplique qu'Arthur ne l'a pas épousée pour les raisons qu'elle croyait .
2. Le Répurgateur : Arthur et Lancelot , formant un tribunal avec le répurgateur , se retrouvent à devoir juger Perceval et Karadoc , arrêtés pour sorcellerie .
Le répurgateur veut les brûler vifs pour hérésie .
1. La Carte :
En pleine campagne militaire , le camp d'Arthur est en difficulté .
Arthur et Lancelot décident de tenter une dernière action : envoyer Perceval et une troupe d'archers près de la frontière du Pays de Galles .
Ce dernier peine à comprendre sa mission .
s02
1. La Chambre : Arthur voit son bain compromis par Karadoc , Mevanwi , Léodagan et Séli , qui viennent se plaindre de problèmes dans lattribution des différentes chambres .
Le roi , passablement énervé , tente un changement pour Karadoc et Mevanwi , peu après refusé par Léodagan et Séli .
Arthur leur propose alors de rentrer chacun chez soi : Léodagan et Séli en Carmélide , Mevanwi et Karadoc à Vannes .
Finalement , Mevanwi et Séli s'arrangent entre elles .
2. Séli et les Rongeurs : Séli , qui a horreur des souris , en découvre une en pleine nuit dans les cuisines , et décide dattendre quelle sorte de son trou afin de la tuer avec un maillet .
Léodagan , Karadoc et Perceval la rejoignent .
3. Les Exploités : Perceval et Karadoc frappent à la porte de la chambre du roi pour se plaindre dêtre exploités , « bon gré mal gré pour arriver vers la fin .
» Arthur comprend vite quil sagit dun malentendu .
4. Le Rassemblement du corbeau : Arthur apprend que Merlin ne veut pas se rendre à une fête druidique nommée le « Rassemblement du corbeau ».
Lenchanteur avoue quil a peur de participer aux épreuves dimprovisation de blagues .
Arthur , secondé par Elias de Kelliwc'h , lui demande den raconter quelques - unes , pour finalement lui interdire de se rendre à la fête , tant son humour est navrant .
5. Le Terroriste :
Un des prisonniers des geôles de Kaamelott réveille les habitants du château en hurlant la nuit .
Il savère quil sagit d'un ancien terroriste qui est resté emprisonné des années après la fin de sa peine .
Enfermé à l'époque d'Uther Pendragon , il avait mis le feu à plusieurs édifices afin de protester contre l'alliance prévue avec les Romains .
Arthur lui signale que l'alliance a été faite par lui , et que c'est plutôt une réussite pour tout le monde .
Le prisonnier préfère alors rester enfermé , pensant qu'il recommencera ses attentats dès qu'il sera sorti de geôle .
6. Le Portrait : Léodagan sest fait peindre son portrait , et ni Arthur , ni Bohort ne parviennent à le reconnaître , peut - être à cause du sourire que Léodagan affiche sur le portrait .
Arthur leur montre alors une pièce de bronze à son effigie , mais les chevaliers , épaulés par Perceval , ne le reconnaissent pas eux non plus .
Arthur se rend compte que sa femme a le même sourire que son père .
7. Unagi II : Perceval et Karadoc décident de casser des pierres à mains nues , tandis quArthur assiste au spectacle .
8. L'enlévement de Guenièvre : Lancelot annonce au roi que Guenièvre a été enlevée par des Pictes .
Arthur demande une participation à Léodagan pour une rançon éventuelle , avant denvoyer Séli soccuper de léchange .
Il savère en fait que Séli a orchestré avec Guenièvre un simulacre denlèvement , afin de soutirer de l'argent à son mari et à son gendre .
9 . Vox populi II : Le roi décide dorganiser de grands sondages pour connaître les aspirations de son peuple .
Il savère qu'une minorité souhaiterait voir Léodagan à la place dArthur .
Le roi de Carmélide est galvanisé par ce résultat .
10 . L'Ambition :
Tour à tour les gardes , Guethenoc , le Père Blaise et Lancelot annoncent au roi leur départ et leurs aspirations à une condition supérieure .
11 . La vigilance d'Arthur :
Le bruit court que la reine et Lancelot sont très proches , et Arthur demande à son ami dêtre prudent avec les rumeurs .
12 . Les classes de Bohort : Arthur confie Bohort au maître darmes pour laguerrir un peu .
Celui-ci , après l'avoir asticoté , finit par réveiller la fougue martiale du chevalier , qui se déchaine .
A la bataille suivante , alors que le roi décide du replis , Bohort charge seul .
Une fois à l'infirmerie , Arthur est obligé de le faire garder , sans quoi Bohort retournerait au combat .
13 . La Révolte : Guethenoc est à la tête dune révolte paysanne , et Arthur et Léodagan essaient de le calmer .
14 . Le Reclassement : Arthur , Lancelot et Léodagan , après avoir manqué de l'occire , proposent à Caius Camillus de déserter et daccepter un titre de seigneur breton .
Celui - ci est outré , mais demande toutefois à réfléchir quelques temps encore .
15 . Plus près de toi :
Le pape annonce à Arthur quil considèrera la Bretagne comme une terre barbare tant quune cathédrale naura pas été bâtie .
Venec est appelé pour résoudre ce problème , et propose au roi une « pyramide en sapin aménagée en maison de passe » ( dixit Arthur ) .
Puis Venec lui fait remarquer qu'il n'a qu'à graisser la patte du pape .
Le père Blaise opine , mais le problème demeure : Kaamelott est à cours de liquidités .
Venec parle alors de ses prêts d'argent .
16 . Le monde d'Arthur :
Arthur , en phase de régression infantile , se met à jouer avec la nourriture .
17 . L'Escorte II : Lancelot escorte la reine et sa mère dans la taverne .
Séli est répugnée par le peuple pendant que Guenièvre saperçoit de ce quil pense delle .
Arthur tente de lui remonter le moral , mais sans succès .
18 . Sous les verrous :
Les gardes nont pas reconnu Arthur , habillé en homme du peuple , et lont enfermé dans les geôles .
Yvain refuse de len laisser sortir .
Arthur lui propose alors de prendre sa place comme roi , après l'avoir fait sortir .
Yvain prend donc la place du roi dans sa cellule .
19 . Le Poème : Guenièvre essaye dapprendre un poème , en pleine nuit , au grand dam dArthur , qui entame une diatribe sur la poésie .
20 . La Quinte juste : e Père Blaise en a assez dentendre des intervalles musicaux païens : pour lui , rien ne vaut la quinte juste .
Arthur et Bohort entendent lui prouver le contraire .
21 . Les Paris :
Le tavernier propose à Perceval et Karadoc de parier sur des combats de chiens , dont le seul but pour lui est de se débarrasser danimaux gêneurs : un petit chien , puis un furet , et enfin un oiseau , mais toujours conter un chien entrainé .
Les deux premiers sont massacrés par leur adversaire , mais l'oiseau gagne le combat , et le tavernier propose un nouveau pari aux deux compères : un combat entre un chien et un asticot .
22 . Immaculé Karadoc : Karadoc dissimule de la nourriture dans son lit , et sa femme Mevanwi lui demande de se laver .
Karadoc finit par céder , mais apporte de quoi manger dans son bain , et trouve finalement ça pas si mal .
Il accepterait donc de se laver quelques fois l'an .
Arthur retrouve les restes du casse - croûte dans son bain .
23 . Les Misanthropes : Morceaux choisis dénervements : Séli , le tavernier , Merlin , et enfin Arthur ont besoin de solitude .
Malheureusement , les gêneurs rôdent .
24 . Sept cent quarante - quatre : Perceval dévoile sa capacité incroyable à compter très rapidement et précisément .
Malheureusement les tentatives pour évaluer l'intérêt stratégique de cette capacité sont mises à mal par Karadoc .
De plus , Perceval a des soucis avec des notions à priori plus simples pour les autres , y compris Karadoc .
25 . Les Tuteurs : Arthur confie Yvain et Gauvain à Lancelot , afin de les aguerrir .
C'est un échec , : les deux jeunes gens pensent avoir frôlé la mort .
Venec est à son tour mis à contribution , mais leur sortie en bateau ne lui impose qu'une solution : les vendre .
Ils sont ensuite confiés à Bohort , qui a beaucoup moins de mal à leur trouver des qualités .
Mais ce ne sont pas exactement celles - là qu'Arthur souhaitait qu'ils développent .
26 . Corpore sano : Tandis que
Arthur et les chevaliers font des repas de trois heures , le maître darmes suit un régime strict et frugal .
Les commentaires de Guenièvre , Léodagan ou Karadoc montrent des points de vues très différents sur ce régime .
27 . Silbury Hill : Guenièvre et Séli contractent des motifs rouges sur la peau , après sêtre rendues près dun cercle de pierre .
Arthur et Léodagan font donc construire des remparts autour des cercles de pierre pour éviter les inconvénients .
Le jour suivant , la mère et la fille ont de nouvelles marques : elles se sont rendues sur un cercle de culture .
Arthur demande à Léodagan de construire des remparts autour des champs , ce qui ne manque pas de faire réagir Guethenoc .
28 . Le Larcin : La panique gagne Bohort et le roi :
Excalibur a disparu , ainsi que plusieurs affaires de la reine et de sa suivante Angharad .
Il savère que les voleurs sont organisés par Venec .
Celui-ci , après avoir tenté de négocier , finit par rendre les affaires , tout en empochant un acompte .
29 . Les Mauvaises Graines : Yvain et Gauvain , embrigadés par des jeunes , ont écrit « Mort au roi » sur un mur de la cité , et se sont fait prendre .
Léodagan part à la recherche des voyous , et les fait emmener comme esclaves .
Séli lui reproche d'être trop dur , mais Léodagan lui rappelle qu'elle ne voulait pas que cela se sache .
30 . La Joute ancillaire : Arthur et Guenièvre se battent à propos de leurs amis respectifs .
Guenièvre invite Angharad à table , disant que c'est son amie .
Arthur fait de même avec une servante étrangère .
31 . L'Ivresse : Morceaux choisis divresse :
Bohort se saoûle à la suite dun traité de paix raté , Arthur boit par dépit , et Léodagan , le maître d'armes et Guenièvre racontent leurs exploits de beuveries .
32 . La Délégation maure :
Une délégation maure est reçue à Kaamelott pour signer un traité de paix .
Perceval , que le roi a invité à la table à condition de bien se comporter , manque de compromettre la paix en faisant des blagues douteuses sur les invités .
A la fin du repas , il est en plus incapable de roter pour respecter les coutumes maures .
Arthur finit par l'assommer .
Le soir , Perceval le réveille pour lui montrer qu'il sait désormais roter .
33 . La Cassette : Léodagan se retrouve en pleine nuit aux cuisines avec une cassette contenant un trésor dérobé au roi , quil essaye de dissimuler à un Karadoc affamé .
34 . Le Tourment II : Perceval , lassé dêtre sans cesse réprimandé par le roi , pense que celui- ci ne laime pas .
Arthur lui démontre astucieusement le contraire .
35 . Le Message codé :
Arthur confie un message codé oral de la plus haute importance à Karadoc , qui doit le remettre à Lancelot .
Mais il est pris , et le transmet à Perceval .
Celui - ci le remet à Lancelot , mais évidemment il a été déformé .
36 . LAncien Temps : Ygerne vient rendre visite à son fils , peu heureux d'une telle visite .
Curieusement , celle - ci nest pas aussi agressive que dhabitude .
Elle vient en effet demander de largent au roi pour les fêtes paysannes .
37 . Perceval et le Contre- sirop : Perceval propose un nouveau jeu au tavernier et à Karadoc : le Sirop .
Comme toujours , les règles sont très complexe .
38 . La Fête du printemps :
Bohort est en charge de lorganisation de la fête du printemps de Kaamelott .
Lui et le roi cherchent des animations originales à organiser .
Les propositions de Léodagan , Séli ou Yvain et Gauvain , voire Perceval et Karadoc , sont loin dêtre encourageantes .
39 . La Garde royale : Perceval propose que ses cousins sans - logis forment une garde royale .
Le roi est sceptique , à juste titre .
40 . Le Havre de paix :
Arthur a pris lhabitude de se reposer sur un banc , au pied dun arbre dans le parc du château .
Quand Léodagan prend sa place , le roi sénerve .
Puis ils finissent par s'habituer à leurs présences respectives .
41 . La Botte secrète II : Perceval a fait trop bon usage de la botte secrète de Karadoc , si bien que le chevalier lui demande de ne pas se faire repérer , et davouer de temps en temps quil ne comprend pas un mot .
Cette astuce paye , car Arthur manque de comprendre la technique de la botte secrète .
42 . Le Jeu du caillou : Karadoc et son frère Kadoc jouent à un jeu : le jeu du caillou .
Lancelot qui passe par là se retrouve à jouer avec le frère de Karadoc pendant que celui- ci est parti se soulager .
La partie continue ; Arthur qui cherchait Lancelot partout et le père
Blaise qui leur criait dessus parce qu'ils jouaient à côté de la chapelle , se trouvent mêlés au jeu .
Mais Kadoc gagne toutes les parties .
43 . Les Jumelles du pêcheur :
Arthur reçoit deux de ses maîtresses : les surs « Jumelles du pêcheur » .
Lune est douce et calme , lautre est vive et agressive .
44 . Le Dialogue de paix : Les Burgondes campent sur le territoire dArthur .
Ce dernier organise une entrevue avec le roi des Burgondes , mais sans interprète , il ne parvient pas à aborder le sujet du traité de paix .
45 . Le Cadeau :
Les barbares offrent un cadeau étonnant à Arthur : un jeune bouc surnommé « Ferme - Ta - Geule ».
Demetra est vexée et stressée par la présence de ce bouc dans sa chambre , alors qu'Arthur semble plus apprécier la présence du bouc que celle de sa maitresse .
46 . Feue la vache de Roparzh : Encore un conflit entre Guethenoc et Roparzh ; cette fois , une vache de Roparzh est décédée sur le champ de Guethenoc .
Linteressé réclame une vache en dédommagement .
47 . Les Vux : Chaque chevalier de la table ronde doit avoir fait promesse d'un vu , mais Arthur et le père Blaise se rendent vite compte que cette histoire de vux est un vrai casse - tête .
48 . Les Chiens de guerre :
Arthur demande des chiens de guerre à Galessin .
Alors que le dressage nest plus pratiqué en Orcanie depuis quelques siècles , celui-ci lui donne un petit chien craintif nommé Attila .
49 . The Game : Les Calédoniens provoquent Kaamelott au jeu de la balle : cest loccasion pour le roi et ses chevaliers ( Lancelot , Bohort , Perceval et Léodagan ) de sentraîner , dans un chaos croissant .
50 .
Arthur in Love :
Arthur tombe amoureux dune jeune femme dans le parc du château .
Il décide de lui offrir une fleur , spécialement greffée par Guethenoc .
La jeune femme apprécie les fleurs , quoique dune manière inattendue .
51 . La Rencontre :
Arthur expose un traité de paix entre les peuples de Tintagel , représentés par sa mère Ygerne , et les Pictes , représentés par sa belle - mère Séli .
La rencontre débute mal , et ne s'améliore pas .
Mais Arthur fait remarquer aux belligérantes que leur avis n'est plus demandé , car elles ont signées le traité .
Séli et Ygerne , désolées de cette paix , se proposent de relancer la guerre , afin de maintenir les hommes occupés et en forme .
52 . Le Guet : Yvain boude parce qu'Arthur lui préfère Gauvain pour une mission .
Lors de celle - ci , Gauvain se montre particulièrement maladroit en cherchant le trésor qu'ils sont venus chercher .
Désirant tout d'abord ramener une cuillère en bois au château , il trouve des pièces d'or , et demande au roi si elles ont de la valeur .
Au deuxième coffre , il s'enfonce une écharde dans le doigt .
Du coup , lorsqu' Arthur propose à
Yvain de l'accompagner dans une nouvelle mission , ce dernier préfère refuser , craignant qu'il lui arrive la même chose .
53 . Les Alchimistes : Perceval et Karadoc souhaitent une potion de puissance , mais lenchanteur Merlin la leur refuse après que les deux amis ont déclenché un incendie dans le château avec un parchemin de boule de feu .
Ils vont alors emprunter des fioles pour concocter la potion eux-mêmes , et le résultat est plutôt inattendu .
Grâce à leur potion , ils aident à remporter la bataille suivante , mais les nerfs des autres chevaliers sont mis à mal par les compères .
54 . La Corde : Arthur , Calogrenant , Lancelot et Léodagan sattachent à une corde et sespacent pour ne pas perdre leur chemin dans une forêt supposée hantée .
Quand Lancelot fait une pause pour enlever des épines dans ses pieds , la discorde se déclenche .
55 . Les Neiges éternelles :
Bohort va mal : le climat et la neige le dépriment .
Arthur lui propose une mission en Andalousie , prétexte pour des vacances .
Mais Bohort ne veut pas d'un traitement de faveur .
Arthur est alors obligé de lui tirer dessus avec une arbalète pour que le chevalier se décide à partir .
56 . LInvincible : Merlin a élaboré par erreur une potion dinvincibilité , en essayant de créer une potion pour les maux de gorge de dame Mevanwi .
Arthur et Lancelot organisent , avant de découvrir lerreur , une fête en son honneur .
La fête tourne court lorsque Merlin rate une démonstration de ses pouvoirs .
57 . La Fumée blanche : Léodagan et Arthur s'étonnent de voir une fumée blanche s'élever de la forêt .
Curieux , ils décident de partir voir d'où elle vient .
Il s'avère en fait que ce sont les seigneurs Calogrenant et Lancelot qui se sont perdus et qui attendaient de l'aide .
Bien entendu , ni Léodagan , ni Arthur n'ont pris de carte et les voilà perdus pour plusieurs jours jusqu'à ce qu'ils retrouvent enfin le chemin du château .
De retour à Kaamelott , ils croisent Yvain qui se demande pourquoi il n'y a plus de fumée dans la forêt , alors qu'il en avait vu une peu de temps auparavant .
Ils l'injurient copieusement pour ne pas avoir prévenu le château alors qu'ils étaient perdus .
Le jour suivant , Léodagan et Arthur aperçoivent à nouveau la fumée blanche : ils décident de ne pas s'en occuper .
58 . LAnniversaire de Guenièvre : Lancelot rappelle à Arthur le jour de l'anniversaire de la reine .
Offusqué que le roi l'ait oublié , il se fait rappeler que l'anniversaire du roi , tout aussi proche , n'a pas l'air d'avoir la même importance pour lui .
Il aide ensuite Arthur à préparer le dîner d'anniversaire de Guenièvre .
Tout se passe bien , excepté pour le cadeau fait à Guenièvre , intentionnellement immonde .
59 . L'Absent : Arthur sest faché contre Lancelot , et celui- ci nest plus convoqué à la Table Ronde , au grand dam des autres chevaliers .
Arthur reconnaît son erreur et cherche une solution .
60 . Le Donneur :
Une bande de brigands a saccagé une partie de la cité sans rencontrer de résistance de la part des gardes , qui étaient sous le commandement de Bohort .
Il savère en fait que Perceval et Karadoc essayaient dapprendre un jeu du Pays de Galles aux gardes , ce qui a conduit à leur désertion .
Pour ne pas dénoncer , Bohort assume ses fautes , à la grande surprise dArthur et du Père Blaise .
Mais il finit par lâcher le morceau , et s'en veut alors terriblement .
61 . O'Brother : Premier contact dArthur avec le frère de Karadoc , Kadoc .
Celui - ci est atteint dun retard mental , expliqué par le fait quil ne dort jamais .
Karadoc essaye de le caser à la Table Ronde , en vain , avant de lengager dans larmée de Kaamelott
62 . Les Esclaves : Bohort persuade Arthur daller acheter quelques esclaves au marché .
Grüdü les accompagne .
Venec leur vend bien un esclave , mais ils sont victimes d'un vol à l'arraché sur le chemin du retour .
63 . Les Drapeaux : Bohort engage un nouveau porte - drapeaux .
Celui - ci est assez maladroit : au lieu de parlementer avec les ennemis , il les insulte sans le vouloir , et déclenche la bataille .
64 . La Ronde :
La reine et les maîtresses se réunissent sur le lit dArthur , qui a désespérement besoin de sommeil .
65 . La Voix céleste : La Dame du Lac guide Arthur , sans apparaître , dans un souterrain .
Celui - ci se perd et commence à sénerver .
La Dame , perdue elle aussi , finit par se vexer et le plante là .
Après un moment , elle se manifeste à nouveau , et tente une nouvelle fois de le guider .
Mais ils se disputent à nouveau .
Après avoir difficilement retrouvé son chemin , Arthur est recontacté mais fait semblant de ne plus rien entendre .
66 . Merlin larchaïque : Guenièvre consulte toute la cour pour noter les dates danniversaire de tout un chacun , et apprend avec Lancelot que Merlin a 883 ans .
Cest un problème , puisque Arthur avait promis doffrir lâge en pièces dor des personnes fêtant leur anniversaire .
67 . Spiritueux : Guethenoc , Roparzh et Belt présentent tous trois leurs vins à Arthur , chargé de les départager .
Le roi est formel : ils sont tous aussi mauvais les uns que les autres .
La dégustation s'achève dans une grande beuverie .
68 . Amen : Le père Blaise recommande à tous de venir écouter la première messe à la chapelle de Kaamelott , ce qui dérange Arthur dans ses plans pour une mission militaire .
A la fin de la messe , lui et Lancelot ont quelques éclaircissements à obtenir du père Blaise : pourquoi en latin ?
Le père Blaise est assez étonné de savoir que certains auditeurs se sont endormis , et propose que la messe soit désormais obligatoire , afin de s'assurer de l'assiduité des fidèles .
La semaine suivante , Arthur décide que la messe n'aura lieu que tous les mois .
69 . Pupi : Arthur et Grüdü , avec Karadoc et sa petite famille , assistent au marché du village au spectacle de marionnettes avec les personnages représentant la cour de Kaamelott .
Arthur se rend compte que son personnage est un des plus populaire , mais également que l'idylle naissante entre Guenièvre et Lancelot est connue du peuple .
70 .
Un roi à la taverne II : Arthur se rend compte que Perceval et Karadoc passent la majeure partie de leur temps à la taverne , et sy rend pour en parler avec le tavernier .
La situation savère encore pire que prévue .
71 . LAlliance : Un chef de clan calédonien refuse de se rallier à Arthur .
Ce dernier est inquiet .
72 . Mater dixit : C'est l'hiver et Arthur est malade en pleine campagne militaire .
Sa mère Ygerne vient lui apporter personnellement de quoi le soigner , mais Arthur fait l'enfant .
Elle lui annonce que son adversaire , ancien camarade de jeu et malade lui aussi , a fait une trêve ( par l'intermédiaire de sa propre mère ) pour se soigner .
Mais elle empêche
Arthur d'aller voir ses hommes sans avoir revêtu plusieurs fourrures .
73 . L'Absolution : Le Répurgateur initie Arthur à la pratique de la confession .
74 .
Aux yeux de tous :
Lasse dêtre remise en cause , la Dame du Lac propose au roi dapparaître aux yeux de Bohort et de Lancelot .
Malheureusement , elle apparaît sous les traits de Bohort , et déguisée avec un uniforme de centurion .
75 . Le Sort perdu : Merlin rate un sort , ce qui a pour effet de rendre les yeux dArthur et Léodagan phosphorescents ; Léodagan a par ailleurs les yeux roses .
A la réunion de la Table ronde , le conseil annule la prochaine mission , qui nécessitait une discrétion absolue et le noir complet .
Arthur et Léodagan , en désespoir de cause , font un « numéro » sur la place du marché , qui ne leur rapporte quasiment rien .
76 . La restriction :
La nouvelle intendante refuse la bectance de nuit au chevalier Karadoc , qui réagit plutôt mal .
Arthur intervient : l'intendante doit surveiller les chapardages , excepté dans le cas très spécial du seigneur Karadoc .
Le soir où Léodagan cherche un casse - croûte pour la nuit , l'intendante intervient à nouveau .
77 . LOubli : Arthur et Léodagan font le retour sur une mission dans un labyrinthe plein de gobelins .
À force de s'engueuler et de ne pas pouvoir dormir , ils décident de retourner au labyrinthe .
Peine perdue : les gobelins sont toujours là mais l'or reste introuvable .
Ils y retournent une troisième fois lorsque Léodagan se souvient enfin l'avoir posé avant la sortie .
Pourtant , ils ne retrouvent rien .
78 . Le Rebelle : Arthur n'assiste pas à une réunion de la Table Ronde .
Il entend dire que Lancelot se serait écrié : « Le roi , je l'emmerde . » Arthur lui demande des explications .
La discussion tourne court quand Lancelot perd à nouveau son calme et morigène le roi .
Celui - ci lui offre des vacances forcées , dont Lancelot reviendra avec encore plus de rancur contre Arthur .
79 . Le Temps des Secrets : Arthur dit à Lancelot qu'il a rêvé qu'on essayait « de lui piquer sa femme , » mais il ne se souvient plus qui .
Plus tard , dans la chambre de Lancelot , Bohort lui révèle son grand secret : il n'a jamais fait ses classes militaires .
Lancelot lui révèle alors le sien : il est amoureux de la reine .
Le lendemain , Arthur apprend que Bohort a passé la nuit dans la chambre de Lancelot , et se méprend sur la raison .
Il avertit alors Lancelot , qui avoue le secret de Bohort .
80 . La Morsure du Dace : Arthur consulte Merlin : un chef des Carpates l'a mordu au cou et il ne supporte plus la lumière du jour .
Merlin lui conseille de ne s'approcher trop près de personne , tant qu'il n'a pas trouvé le remède .
Lancelot , puis Demetra font tout de même les frais du changement de personnalité d'Arthur .
Merlin arrive tout de même à le guérir , mais en employant une potion qu'il n'a pas faite lui-même .
81 . La Conscience dArthur :
Arthur est très dur avec Perceval , et s'ensuit un dialogue avec sa conscience .
Celle - ci lui explique que tant qu'il traitera
Perceval comme un nul , celui- ci le sera , afin de correspondre le plus possible à ce qu'Arthur suppose qu'il est .
La conscience lui conseille donc de le féliciter , ou de ne pas trop le blâmer quand c'est nécessaire .
Mais le premier essai est un échec : Perceval s'évanouit lorsqu'il entend Arthur le complimenter .
82 . Les Volontaires II : Karadoc et Perceval demandent l'aide de Merlin pour devenir des « pièces - maîtresses » .
83 . Always : Par Calogrenant , Arthur reçoit un message de Galles : Perceval est mort .
Il est atterré , tout comme Léodagant et Karadoc .
Mais il a l'impression que le fantôme de Perceval le suit et le conseille .
Sa motivation pour la quête du Graal remonte : il parvient même à intéresser Yvain et Gauvain .
C'est alors que Perceval réapparaît : pas du tout mort , mais ayant été très malade , il avait demandé qu'on envoie une missive « au cas où ».
La motivation d'Arthur retombe .
84 . Spangenhelm : Les chevaliers de la Table Ronde inaugurent une nouvelle cérémonie de prière pour honorer les morts au combat .
Malheureusement , dune part ils narrivent pas à se souvenir de quiconque tombé au combat , dautre part ils refusent de mettre leur casques darmure , car cela leur donne des « têtes de gland » .
85 . Les Pigeons :
Arthur se pose des questions sur les capacités de ses pigeons voyageurs , ainsi que sur la date et la provenance des messages qu'il transporte .
Tout d'abord Lancelot , puis Léodagan lui prouvent que ce système n'est pas fiable .
86 . Les Félicitations : C'est l'anniversaire d'Arthur .
Il reçoit , comme chaque année , les voeux de ses chevaliers .
Mais entre l'« oubli » de Lancelot , l'autoplagiat volontaire de Calogrenant , les errances métaphysiques incompréhensibles de Gauvain , le poème infantile raté d'Yvain , et la chanson à boire de Perceval , le roi Arthur n'est pas vraiment gâté .
87 . Le Plat national : Arthur sollicite Guethenoc et Roparzh afin de trouver un plat national .
Voyant la difficulté pour les agriculteurs que cela représente , il fait appel à Karadoc .
Celui - ci allonge une tranche de jambon sur une tranche de pain , et recouvre le tout d'une tranche de fromage ; il leur conseille ensuite de griller le tout au four .
Les autres sont impressionnés , et veulent donner au nouveau plat le nom de son inventeur .
Ce dernier préfère son surnom , « Kroc » .
Arthur présente donc : « Le Kroc , messieurs ! »
88 . Des hommes dhonneur :
Dans le but d'impressionner leurs hommes , Léodagan amène Arthur à la recherche d'un temple perdu défendu par une hydre à six têtes .
Mais ses informations datent un peu :
Arthur a déjà effectué la mission , et ramassé le trésor après .
Pour ne pas avoir l'air de rentrer bredouille , ils concoctent un faux trésor , tiré de leurs bourses .
89 . L'Enragé : Arhtur est fou d'amour de Tegeirian .
Enragé !
90 .
Trois cent soixante degrés : Yvain et Gauvain veulent réussir une mission dans des souterrains .
Arthur donne un conseil : il faut regarder à 360 degrés à chaque fois qu'on entre dans une pièce , par mesure de sécurité .
Tout d'abord pensant qu'il s'agit d'une température , ils comprennent qu'il faut faire un tour sur soi-même .
Ils enchaînent donc les tours sur eux-mêmes , mètre après mètre , les faisant toujours dans le même sens .
Ils finissent par s'évanouir , et sont retrouvés par Arthur et ses chevaliers qui se demandent ce qu'il a pu leur arriver .
91 . Le Passage secret : Bohort est éclaireur pour une mission avec Arthur et Léodagan .
Sauf qu'il n'est pas très éclairé .
Le passage qu'il arpente les amène d'ailleurs dans la salle du trône de Kaamelott , sans embûches .
92 . Le Complot :
Arthur se fait attaquer dans le couloir de Kaamelott .
Parmi les clans revendiquant l'attentat , on retrouve étonnement le blason de la Carmélide .
Arthur est un peu fâché avec Léodagan .
93 . Le Secret dArthur : Ygerne avoue à Séli , devant Léodagan et Arthur , que ce dernier a eu une éducation romaine , de 10 à 20 ans dans la Légion .
Léodagan entre dans une colère noire , Séli n'est pas loin d'avoir la même réaction .
Même si Arthur clame qu'il n'est pas romain , sa femme non plus n'arrive pas à l'accepter .
Son mari lui explique alors que Rome n'aurait jamais accepté qu'il fédère les clans bretons si lui-même n'avait pas été éduqué par les Romains .
94 . Stargate : La Dame du Lac n'est pas contente .
En revanche , Arthur est vraiment fatigué d'avoir à aller chercher des « objets magiques débiles dont tout le mode se fout ».
Mais La
Dame lui révèle que les Dieux sont exaspérés , et pour se venger , elle a ouvert une Porte du Chaos , qui laissent passer les pires créatures de l'Univers .
Celle - ci est directement ouverte à l'intérieur de Kaamelott .
Lancelot , Bohort et Arthur attendent la première créature qui apparaît .
C'est Perceval , qui a aperçu la même porte dans la cour du château .
Il n'y a donc pas de danger .
Arthur discute ensuite avec Perceval , pour savoir si c'est le courage ou l'inconscience qui l'a fait prendre un passage dont il ne voyait pas l'issue .
95 . Le Pédagogue : Léodagan a des problèmes avec l'éducation d'Yvain .
Il demande de l'aide à Merlin , qui lui recommande « l'écoute » .
Yvain ne veut plus « subir les fantasmes carriéristes d'une entité générationnelle réactionnaire et oppressive .
» Léodagan a l'air de comprendre le concept de l'écoute , et parvient apparemment à dialoguer avec son fils , soulevant l'incrédulité de Séli .
Mais il a le malheur d'essayer cette nouvelle méthode sur un sujet plus brûlant : les tours de garde dont Arthur ne veut plus discuter avec lui .
L'énervement de Léodagan l'emporte , et il s'en prend ensuite à Merlin .
Le druide lui répond qu'il faut vraiment écouter son interlocuteur , et non pas , comme Léodagan , faire semblant .
96 . Les Parchemins magiques : Les Vandales ont infligé une sévère défaite à Arthur : ils ont utilisé la magie , alors que Merlin était absent .
Les Vandales n'étant pas habituellement des adeptes de la magie , Arthur se pose quelques questions .
Il découvre , tombé de la sacoche d'un ennemi , un parchemin de sort signé Merlin .
Celui-ci , tout d'abord soupçonné de traîtrise , explique qu'il a paumé des parchemins qu'il avait acheté pour la bataille .
Il attend des excuses .
97 . L'Orateur : Les paysans sont en colère .
Les Saxons les attaquent .
Arthur doit faire un discours pour les rassurer .
Un discours c'est une chose , mais Excalibur ça impressionne .
98 . Excalibur et le Destin :
Au cours d'un entraînement , le maître d'armes prend Excalibur en main .
Celle - ci perd alors tout rayonnement .
Arthur voudrait bien avoir une explication , et la Dame du Lac lui apparaît lors d'un échauffement avec Karadoc .
La Dame lui explique que seul le Destin de son porteur fait briller Excalibur .
Si cela ne marche ni avec le maître d'armes , ni avec Karadoc , c'est qu'ils n'ont pas de destin grandiose .
Peu après , lors d'un entraînement avec Perceval , Arthur lui propose de prendre son épée et la sienne en main , alors que lui ne se servira que de ses mains .
Mais quand Excalibur est empoignée par Perceval , elle flamboie encore plus que lorsque c'est Arthur qui la tient .
99 . La Frange romaine : Arthur et Perceval sont chez Caius Camillus , qui fait le coiffeur .
Caius en fait un peu trop , Arthur ne se reconnaît plus , et ça fait trop Romain .
100 . Les Comptes :
Il n'y a plus un rond à Kaamelott .
Lancelot demande où sont toutes les richesses qu'ils ont amassées .
Il déclare avoir remis le butin de toutes ses quêtes à Léodagan , qui est pris à parti par Arthur .
En réalité , Lancelot dissimule une partie de ses découvertes .
The root causes of the world ’s corruption can most likely be traced back to scar tissues from our childhood .
Another startling piece of research in this direction reveals how widespread child abuse actually is in the world .
Below please find the freedomainradio clips , some of this stuff is simply unbelievable , but so important to be aware of in order to understand where the root of all evil lies :
Below is the full article in writing :
The following speech was given at the National Parenting Conference in Boulder , Colorado , on September 25 , 1997 .
During the past three decades , I have spent much of my scholarly life examining primary sources such as diaries , autobiographies , doctor ’s reports , ethnographic reports and other documents that document what it must have felt like to have been a child–yesterday and today , in the East and the West , in literate and preliterate cultures .
In several hundred studies published by myself and my associates in The Journal of Psychohistory , we have provided extensive evidence that the history of childhood has been a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken .
The further back in history one goes–and the further away from the West one gets –the more massive the neglect and cruelty one finds and the more likely children are to have been killed , rejected , beaten , terrorized and sexually abused by their caretakers .
Indeed , my conclusion from a lifetime of psychohistorical study of childhood and society is that the history of humanity is founded upon the abuse of children .
Just as family therapists today find that child abuse often functions to hold families together as a way of solving their emotional problems , so , too , the routine assault of children has been society ’s most effective way of maintaining its collective emotional homeostasis .
Most historical families once practiced infanticide , erotic beating and incest .
Most states sacrificed and mutilated their children to relieve the guilt of adults .
Even today , we continue to arrange the daily killing , maiming , molestation and starvation of children through our social , military and economic activities .
I would like to summarize here some of the evidence I have found as to why child abuse has been humanity ’s most powerful and most successful ritual , why it has been the cause of war and social violence , and why the eradication of child abuse and neglect is the most important social task we face today .
THE CHILD AS POISON CONTAINER
The main psychological mechanism that operates in all child abuse involves using children as what I have termed poison containers –receptacles into which adults project disowned parts of their psyches , so they can control these feelings in another body without danger to themselves .
In good parenting , the child uses the caretaker as a poison container , much as it earlier used the mother ’s placenta as a poison container for cleansing its polluted blood .
A good mother reacts with calming actions to the cries of a baby and helps it “ detoxify ² its dangerous emotions .
But when an immature mother ’s baby cries , she cannot stand the screaming , and strikes out at the child .
As one battering mother put it , “ I have never felt loved all my life .
When the baby was born , I thought he would love me .
When he cried , it meant he did n’t love me .
So I hit him .²
Rather than the child being able to use the parent to detoxify its fears and anger , the parent instead injects his or her bad feelings into the child and uses it to cleanse his or herself of depression and anger .
Consider a typical infanticidal , incestuous culture , the Bimin - Kuskusmin of New Guinea .
As is so often true in pre-literate cultures , the mothers have long post - partum taboos against sex with their husbands , sleep naked against their children until they are about four years old , have orgasms while nursing them and regularly masturbate them .
One three - year - old boy describes how whenever his mother was sad or angry she masturbated him so roughly that it hurt him , and he struggled to get away , complaining of a pain in his penis .
“ It hurts inside , ² he told the ethnologist .
“ It goes Œkoong , koong , koong ’ inside .
I think it bleeds in there I do n’t like to touch it anymore .
It hurts when I pee… ² Sometimes , after his mother hurt him while masturbating him , he wounds himself in the thigh and abdomen with a sharp stick and draws blood , looking at his penis and saying , “ Now it hurts here , outside , not in penis .
Look , blood .
Feels good … ²
Although he is only three years old , he understands quite well that he is being used as a poison container by his mother to relieve her depression .
He says , “ Mother twist penis , tight …
Hurt inside … Mother angry , hurt Buuktiin ’s penis .
Mother sad , hurt Buuktiin ’s penis… Mother not like Buuktiin ’s penis , want to cut off … ”
Maternal incest and pederasty by men are quite common in pre-literate groups and were common in earlier historical times .
Boys in many New Guinea groups today , for instance , are so traumatized by the early erotic experiences , neglect and assaults on their bodies that they need to prove their masculinity when they grow up and become fierce warriors and cannibals , with a third of them dying in raids and wars .
In fact , I have found that rather than the incest taboo being universal–as anthropologists claim–it is incest itself that has been universal for most children in most cultures in most times .
A childhood more or less free from adult sexual use is in fact a very late historical achievement , limited to a few fortunate children in a few modern nations .
To give you some idea of the extensive evidence I have gathered for such an unlikely conclusion , I would like to begin by summarizing the evidence which exists for the sexual abuse of children around the world today .
THE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN TODAY
In America , the most accurate scientific studies , based on lengthy interviews , report that 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women remember having been sexually molested during childhood — defining “ molestation ” as actual genital contact , not just exposure .
About half of these are directly incestuous , with the family members , the other half usually being with others , but with the complicity of caretakers in at least 80 percent of the cases .
These experiences of seduction are not just pieced together from fragmentary memories , but are remembered in detail , are usually for an extended period of time and have been confirmed by follow - up reliability studies in 83 percent of the cases , so they are unlikely to have been fantasies .
The seductions occurred at much earlier ages than had been previously assumed , with 81 percent occurring before puberty and an astonishing 42 percent under age 7 .
As high as these molestation rates seem , however , they represent only a portion of the true rates , not only because those interviewed do not include populations that have been shown to have extremely high rates — such as criminals , prostitutes , juveniles in shelters , psychotics , etc. –but also because only conscious memories were counted , and the earliest seductions of children are almost never remembered except during psychotherapy .
Adjusting statistically for what is known about these additional factors , I have concluded that the real sexual abuse rate for America is 60 percent for girls and 45 percent for boys , about half of these directly incestuous .
Other Western nations have made fewer careful studies .
A recent Canadian study by Gallup of 2,000 adults has produced incidence rates almost exactly the same as those found in the United States .
Latin American family sexual activity –particularly widespread pederasty as part of macho sexuality –is considered even more widespread .
In England , a recent BBC “ ChildWatch ” program asked its female listeners–a large though admittedly biased sample –if they remembered sexual molestation , and , of the 2,530 replies analyzed , 83 percent remembered someone touching their genitals , 62 percent recalling actual intercourse .
In Germany , the Institut für Kindheit has recently concluded a survey asking West Berlin schoolchildren about their sexual experiences , and 80 percent reported having been molested .
Outside the West , the sexual molestation of children is a routine practice in most families .
Childhood in India begins , according to observers , with the child being regularly masturbated by the mother , the girl “ to make her sleep well , ” the boy “ to make him manly . ”
The child sleeps in the family bed , witnesses and most likely takes part in sexual intercourse between the parents .
The child is often “ borrowed ” to sleep with other members of the extended household , leading to the Indian proverb that “ For a girl to be a virgin at ten years old , she must have neither brothers nor cousin nor father . ”
Childhood is so eroticized that , as one Western observer put it , “ The little Hindu girls are deflowered by the little boys with whom they play , and repeat together the erotic lessons which their parents have unwittingly taught them on account of the general promiscuity of family life throughout India .
In all the little girls of less than ten years of age the complete hymen is wanting …
Incest is often the rule rather than the exception . ”
Child marriage was , of course , a long - standing Indian practice .
When laws were passed in 1929 trying to outlaw it , the government was overwhelmed by men insisting that early marriage was an absolute necessity , since little girls were naturally very sexual and must be married early if they are to be restrained from seducing adults .
“ Cupid overtakes the hearts of girls … at an early age , ” they said .
“ A girl ’s desire for sexual intercourse is eight times greater than that of males . ”
Indian mothers also often supported early marriage , frankly admitting it was necessary in order to protect their little girls against rape in the family , saying that “ they were afraid to leave their daughters at home , even for one afternoon , without a mother ’s eye and accessible to the men of the family . ”
The Indian subcontinent , in fact , still has many groups , such as the Baiga , where actual incestuous marriage is practiced , between fathers and daughters , between mothers and sons , between siblings and even between grandparents and their grandchildren –thus disproving the oft - repeated anthropological truism that “ no known tribe has ever permitted incest ” because if it were allowed society would surely cease functioning .
In many of these villages , the children move at the age of 5 or 6 from the incestuous activities of the family bed to spend the rest of their childhood in sex dormitories , where they are initiated by older youth and men into intercourse with a succession of other children , none for longer than three days at a time , under threat of gang rape .
Childhood in China has historically had the same institutionalized rape rituals as in India , including the pederasty of boys , child concubinage , the castration of boys to be used sexually as eunuchs , marriage of young girls to a number of brothers , widespread boy and girl prostitution and the regular sexual use of child servants and slaves .
So prevalent was the rape of little girls that Western doctors found that , as in India , few girls entering puberty had intact hymens .
Even the universal practice of foot binding was for sexual purposes , with a girl undergoing extremely painful crushing of the bones of her feet for years in order that men could make love to her big toe as a fetish , a penis - substitute .
Childhood in contemporary Japan , although somewhat more Western than that of other Eastern nations , still includes masturbation by mothers “ to put them to sleep . ”
Parents often have intercourse with their children in bed with them , and “ co- sleeping , ” with parents physically embracing the child , often continues until the child is ten or fifteen .
One recent Japanese study found daughters sleeping with their fathers over 20 percent of the time after age 16 .
Recent sex surveys report memories of sexual abuse even higher than comparable American studies , and “ hot lines ” of sexual abuse report mother - son incest in almost a third of the calls , the mother saying to her teenage son , “ It ’s not good to do it alone .
Your IQ becomes lower .
I will help you , ” or “ You can not study if you can not have sex .
You may use my body , ” or “ I do n’t want you to get into trouble with a girl .
Have sex with me instead . ”
Historically , Japan has been one of the most endogamous societies in the world , with incestuous marriages in court circles being approved even in historical times and preferred sibling , cousin , uncle - niece and aunt - nephew marriages having been so extensive that genetics experts have discovered that the incestuous inbreeding has affected the size and health of the Japanese .
Even today , there are rural areas in Japan where fathers marry their daughters when the mother has died or is incapacitated , “ in accordance with feudal family traditions . ”
The sexual use of children in the Near East is as widespread as in the Far East .
Historically , all the institutionalized forms of pedophilia which were customary in the Far East are documented extensively for the Near East , including child marriage , child concubinage , temple prostitution of both boys and girls , parent - child marriage ( among the Zoroastrians ) , sibling marriage ( quite common among Egyptians ) , sex slavery , ritualized pederasty and child prostitution .
Masturbation in infancy is said to be necessary “ to increase the size ” of the penis , and older siblings are reported to play with the genitals of babies for hours at a time .
Mutual masturbation , fellatio and anal intercourse are also said to be common among children , particularly with the older boys using younger children as sex objects .
The nude public baths ( hammam ) are particularly eroticized in many areas , being especially notorious as a place of homosexual acts , both male and female .
Girls are used incestuously even more often than boys , since females are valued so little .
One report found 80 percent of Near Eastern women surveyed recalled having been forced into fellatio between the ages of 3 and 6 by older brothers , cousins , uncles and teachers .
The girls rarely complain , since “ if there is any punishment to be meted out , it will always end up by being inflicted on her . ”
Arab women know that their spouses are pedophiles and prefer having sex with children to having sex with them .
Their retribution comes as follows .
When the girl is about 6 years old , the women of the house grab her , pull her thighs apart and cut off her clitoris and often also her labia with a razor , thus usually ending her ability to feel sexual pleasure forever .
One Egyptian woman relates her memory of how it happened to her .
After being used sexually by the men in her family during her early childhood , she says :
I was six years old that night when I lay in my bed , warm and peaceful …
I felt something move under the blankets , something like a huge hand … another hand was clapped over my mouth to prevent me from screaming .
They carried me to the bathroom …
I remember …a rasping metallic sound which reminded me of the butcher when he used to sharpen his knife …
My blood was frozen in my veins …my thighs had been pulled wide apart …
I felt that the rasping knife or blade was heading straight down towards my throat .
Then suddenly the sharp metallic edge seemed to drop between my thighs and there cut off a piece of flesh from my body .
I screamed with pain despite the tight hand held over my mouth , for the pain was not just a pain , it was like a searing flame that went through my whole body .
After a few moments , I saw a red pool of blood around my hips .
I did not know what they had cut off from my body , and did not try to find out .
I just wept , and called out to my mother for help .
But the worst shock of all was when I looked around and found her standing by my side .
Yes , it was her , I could not be mistaken , in flesh and blood , right in the midst of these strangers , talking to them and smiling at them .
A recent survey of Egyptian girls and women showed 97 percent of uneducated families and 66 percent of educated families still practiced clitoridectomy .
Nor is the practice decreasing –UN reports estimate that more than 74 million females have been mutilated , with “ more female children mutilated today than throughout history . ”
Clitoridectomy , like all sexual mutilations , is , I believe , an act of incest .
If it is incest when a father rapes a daughter , it is also incest when parents assault their children by cutting off , sewing up , burning , flaying or gashing their genitals .
In all these cases , the child is being used for the sadistic sexual pleasure of the parent .
In fact , circumcision ceremonies are often followed by drinking parties that end in intercourse , so sexually arousing is the circumcision — in some areas , the traveling circumcizer is actually accompanied by some prostitutes , who know how sexually excited villages become after the ceremony .
Therefore , the practice of sexually mutilating children ’s genitals — one of the most widespread rituals in the world–by itself makes incest a near - universal trait .
THE EVOLUTION OF CHILDHOOD
Historically , the routine use of children as poison containers to prevent adults from feeling overwhelmed by their anxieties has also been universal .
Examples from the history of childhood regularly reveal children are expected to “ absorb ” the bad feelings of their caretakers .
As one peasant community in rural Greece puts it , you must have children around to put your bad feelings into , especially when the “ Bad Hour ” comes around .
An informant describes the process as follows :
One of the ways for the Bad Hour to occur is when you get angry .
When you ’re angry a demon gets inside of you .
Only if a pure individual passes by , like a child for instance , will the “ bad ” leave you , for it will fall on the unpolluted .
Newborn infants , in particular , were perfect poison containers because they were so “ unpolluted . ”
The newborn then became so full of the parent ’s projections that even if he or she is allowed to live ( up to half the children in early societies were murdered at birth ) , the infant had to be tied up–tightly swaddled in bandages for up to a year or more — to prevent it from “ tearing its ears off , scratching its eyes out , breaking its legs , or touching its genitals , ” i.e. , to prevent it from acting out the violent and sexual projections of the parents .
Children were particularly useful as poison containers when adults felt anxious about recent or impending success .
Success stirs up superego retaliation , and the sacrifice of children to appease the gods –that is , the punitive parents –was an extremely widespread guilt - reducing device .
Most early states practiced child sacrifice .
Typical was Carthage , where a large cemetery has been discovered called The Tophet filled with over 20,000 urns deposited there between 400 and 200 B.C.
The urns contained bones of children sacrificed by their parents , who often would make a vow to kill their next child if the gods would grant them a favor –for instance , if their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port .
Some urns contain the bones of stillborn babies along with the bones of two - year - olds , indicating that if the promised child was not born alive , an older child had also to be killed to satisfy the promise .
The sacrifice was accompanied by a music , wild dancing and riotous orgy , and was probably accompanied by the ritual rape of virgin girls , as it was with the Incans .
Plutarch told how the priests would “ cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds ; meanwhile the mother stood by without a tear or moan [ while ] the whole area before the statue was filled with a loud noise of flutes and drums … ”
Sacrifice , rape and genital mutilation of young girls continues to take place today in the Andean mountains , particularly to ward off the guilt coming after successful cocaine deliveries .
These ceremonies , from antiquity to today , resemble closely the satanic rituals made familiar recently in the newspapers , using the infliction of rape , sexual mutilation and other horrors in order to visit upon child victims elements of the traumas of the satanists ’ own childhood .
That child sacrifice was carried out mainly by the rich in each of these early societies confirms my theory that it is a guilt - reducing technique .
Whenever new ventures were begun , children would be sacrificed .
Whenever a new building or bridge was built , a child would be buried within it as a “ foundation sacrifice . ”
Children still play at capturing a child and making it part of the bridge in “ London Bridge ’s Falling Down . ”
Children ’s bodies were particularly useful in curing disease .
Whatever one ’s physical ills , a child could be used to “ absorb ” the poison that was responsible .
When , for instance , one wanted to be cured of leprosy , one was supposed to kill a child and wash one ’s body in its blood .
When one wanted to find out if a house whose previous occupants had died of plague was still infected or not , one rented some children to live in it for several weeks to see if they died–rather like the use of canaries in mines to detect poisonous gas .
When one was impotent , depressed or had venereal disease , doctors prescribed having intercourse with a child .
As late as the end of the nineteenth century , men who were brought into Old Bailey for having raped young girls were let go because “ they believed that they were curing themselves of venereal disease . ”
Raping virgins was particularly effective for impotence and depression ; as one medical book put it , “ Breaking a maiden ’s seal is one of the best antidotes for one ’s ills .
Cudgeling her unceasingly , until she swoons away , is a might remedy for man ’s depression .
It cures all impotence . ”
And , of course , whenever a parent had a disease , they always had their children handy to absorb the poison .
Thus British doctors in the nineteenth century regularly found when visiting men who had venereal disease that their children also had the same disease–on their mouths , anuses or genitals .
No matter what anxieties one had , one had children always at hand to use to relieve them .
The evolution of childhood from incest to love and from abuse to empathy has been a slow , uneven path , but one whose progressive direction is , I think , unmistakable .
This evolution of parent - child relations is , I contend , an independent source of historical change , lying in the ability of successive generations of parents to live through their own childhood traumas a second time and work through their anxieties in a slightly better manner this second time around .
It is in this sense that I say that history is like psychotherapy , which also heals through revisiting one ’s childhood traumas and reworking earlier anxieties .
If the parent –the mother , for most of history –is given even the most minimal support by society , the evolution of childhood progresses , new variations in historical personality are formed , and history begins to move in new , innovative directions .
The crucial relationship in this evolution is the mother - daughter relationship .
If little girls are treated particularly badly , they grow up to be mothers who cannot rework their traumas , and history is frozen .
For instance , although China was ahead of the West in most ways during the pre-Christian era , it became “ frozen ” and fell far behind the West in evolutionary social and technological change after it adopted the practice of footbinding girls .
Similarly , the cliterodectomy of girls in Moslem societies has inhibited their social development for centuries , since it likewise puts a brake on the ability of the next generation of mothers to make progress in caring for their children .
Clearly , different groups have moved different distances up the ladder of psychological evolution , since some contemporary groups still practice brain - eating as our Paleolithic ancestors did , and different subgroups of our more advanced nations still terrorize and abuse their children in ways identical to those that were commonplace centuries ago , producing the “ historical fossils ” ( early “ psychoclasses ” ) we now call borderline personalities and other severe character disorders .
Your neighbor is as likely to be a result of medieval parenting as of modern parenting , so modern societies contain a full range of childrearing modes and psychoclasses .
The “ generational pressure ” for psychological change is not only an independent historical force–originating in inborn adult - child striving for relationship–it occurs independent of social and technological change , and can be found even in periods of economic stagnation .
My “ psychogenic theory of history ” posits that a society ’s childrearing practices are not just one item in a list of cultural traits , but –because all other traits must be passed down from generation to generation through the narrow funnel of childhood –instead makes childrearing the very basis for the transmission and development of all other cultural traits , placing definite limits on what can be achieved in the material spheres of history .
The main source of childhood evolution is , I believe , the process I call psychogenesis , by which parents –mainly the mother for most of history –revisit a second time around the stages of childhood and undo to some extent the traumas they themselves endured .
It is in this sense that history is like a psychotherapy of the generations , undoing trauma and giving historical personality a chance at a new start with every baby born .
Only humans have brain networks that allow this miracle to take place .
All cultural changes in the past 100,000 years of Homo sapiens sapiens are epigenetic , not genetic .
Regardless of changes in the environment , it is only when changes in childhood occur that epigenetic changes in the brain can occur and societies can begin to progress and move in unpredictable new directions that are more adaptive .
That more individuated and loving individuals are ultimately more adaptive is understandable –because they are less under the pressures of infantile traumas and are therefore more rational in reaching their goals .
But that this childhood evolution–and therefore all social evolution –is terribly uneven is also understandable , given the varying conditions under which parents all over the world have to conduct their childrearing tasks .
THE SIX CHILDREARING MODES
The basic patterns of evolution of childhood have begun to be traced by myself and other psychohistorians .
I would like to summarize the six childrearing modes that I have suggested are common to all groups that have traversed the full path of childhood and cultural evolution so far .
These modes are , in fact , quite independent of technological development .
But the overall evolutionary direction of parent - child relations is , I think , evident in the historical record , regardless of what labels one chooses to put on its stages .
The earliest childrearing mode I have called infanticidal to highlight the constant presence of infanticidal wishes in the parent .
Real infanticide is , of course , ubiquitous in most preliterate cultures , ranging about a third or more of all children born , and evidence remains of widespread infanticide among all historical records .
By historical times , census figures from antiquity show boy / girl ratios as high as 400 boys to 100 girls–a believable figure since , as Poseidippos said , “ even a rich man always exposes a daughter . ”
I have estimated that perhaps half of all children born in antiquity were killed by their caretakers , declining to about a third in medieval times and dropping to under one percent only by the eighteenth century .
Since these skewed sex ratios do not vary by economic class –the rich do away with their children at about the same rates as the poor–the evidence suggests that the parents were coping with the emotional anxieties of childrearing more than economic conditions .
That incest is also traditional in the infanticidal mode is harder to prove conclusively , since what really happened in the family bed does not often leave historical traces .
Yet all the records we have suggest that this was so .
Man began , after all , as an incestuous primate–along with other primates , who remain incestuous today .
In most simple societies today in such areas as New Guinea , boys and girls are used sexually by both their mothers and by the men , who gang rape girls and often are also pederasts who use the boys sexually , have boy - wives , or force all the boys to fellate them daily from age seven to fourteen “ in order to ingest semen to counteract maternal pollution . ”
By the time historical records begin , the widespread sexual use of children is well documented .
The Greek and Roman child lived his or her earliest years in an atmosphere of sexual abuse .
Girls were commonly raped , as reflected in the many comedies that have scenes that were considered funny of little girls being raped .
Both Greek and Roman doctors report that female children rarely have hymens–just like the Indian and Chinese girls I described above .
In order to find out if your young wife was really a virgin ( girls usually married before puberty to older men ) , one had to use mystical tests for virginity , since intact hymens were so rare .
Boys , too , were regularly handed over by their parents to neighboring men to be raped .
Plutarch has a long essay on what was the best kind of person a father should give his son to for buggering .
The common notion that this occurred only at “ adolescence ” is quite mistaken .
It began around age seven , continued for several years and ended by puberty , when the boy ’s facial and pubic hairs began to appear .
Child brothels , rent - a - boy services and sex slavery flourished in every city in antiquity .
Children were so subject to sexual use by the men around them that schools were by law prohibited from staying open past sundown , so their pedagogues–slaves who were assigned to protect them against random sexual attack –could try to see that their teachers did n’t assault them .
Petronius especially loved depicting adults feeling the “ immature little tool ” of boys , and Tiberius was said by Seutonius to have “ taught children of the most tender years , whom he called his little fishes , to play between his legs while he was in his bath .
Those which had not yet been weaned , but were strong and hearty , he set at fellatio … ”
Since boys in antiquity shared the experience of being buggered , Christianity constructed its central myth of the Father sending his son down to be penetrated by a soldier ’s lance in order to restage the common experience of fathers giving their boys to a neighbor to be sexually penetrated .
Those who accepted the myth , accepted the penetration , and were promised the Father ’s love and Mary ’s tears in return .
Although Christianity attempted to reduce the outright killing of newborns , thus moving beyond the infanticidal mode , it continued the abandonment of children–whether by child sale or by sending to wet nurse or monastery or nunnery or foster family or to other homes as servants –which is why I labeled this second stage the abandoning mode .
The refusal of parents to raise their own legitimate children was so powerful that through the nineteenth century over half of the children born in Florence , for instance , were dumped into foundling homes at birth , to be picked up by their families –if they lived that long ( the majority died ) –when they were around five years old , thus avoiding having homes where crying babies disturbed the peace .
The same abandonment was common in France , where , in 1900 , over 90 percent of the babies born in Paris were carted out to the countryside to wetnurses at birth .
As one author put it , “ mother love ” was a late historical achievement , not an instinctual trait .
Despite the advance that just abandoning rather than outright killing your children represents , most of the other childrearing practices of antiquity continued in the middle ages , with the buggering of boys–even in monasteries –continuing to be widespread and even accepted by society .
By the time boys were in their teens , they were so addicted to violent sex that they sometimes formed adolescent raping gangs that grabbed and raped any girls or young women they could find unprotected , to such an extent that the majority of women in some cities would have been raped by these gangs at some time in their lives .
The erotic beating of children continued in Christian times , because of the anxieties of living with a child who is so full of your projections .
Children were experienced as always about to turn into “ changelings , ” those who , as St. Augustine puts it , “ suffer from a demon ” – which usually meant just that they cry too much , since the Malleus Maleficarum says that one can recognize changelings because they “ always howl most piteously , ” and since Luther says they “ are more obnoxious than ten children with their crapping , eating , and screaming . ”
That children with devils in them had to be beaten goes without saying .
A panoply of beating instruments existed for that purpose , from cat - o’- nine tails and whips to shovels , canes , iron rods , bundles of sticks , the discipline ( a whip made of small chains ) , the goad ( shaped like a cobbler ’s knife , used to prick the child on the head or hands ) and special school instruments like the flapper , which had a pear - shaped end and a round hole to raise blisters .
The beatings described in the sources were almost always severe , involved bruising and bloodying of the body , began in infancy , were usually erotically tinged by being inflicted on bare parts of the body near the genitals and were a regular part of the child ’s daily life .
Century after century of battered children grew up to batter their own children in turn .
Public protest was rare .
Even humanists and teachers who had a reputation for gentleness approved of the severe beating of children .
Those who attempted reform did so only to prevent death .
As a thirteenth - century law said , “ If one beats a child until it bleeds , then it will remember , but if one beats it to death , the law applies . ”
As Batholomew Batty put it , parents must “ keep the golden mean , ” which is to say they should not “ strike and buffet their children about the face and head , and to lace upon them like malt sacks with cudgels , staves , fork or fire shovel , ” for then they might die of the blows .
The correct way , he said , was to “ Hit him upon the sides … with the rod , he shall not die thereof . ”
By the thirteenth century in the West , abandonment via oblation , or the giving of young children to monasteries for sexual and other uses , was ended , the first disapproval of pedophilia appeared , the first childrearing tracts were published and some advanced parents began to practice what I have termed the ambivalent mode of childrearing , where the child was not born completely evil , but was seen as being still full of enough dangerous projections so that the parent , whose task it was to mold it , must beat it into shape like clay .
Church moralists for the first time began to warn against sexual molestation of children by parents , nurses and neighbors ( the mothers had previously been instructed to masturbate their boys “ so their yards will grow long ” ) .
The length of time of swaddling was eventually reduced from a year or more to only a few months .
Pediatrics and educational philosophy were born .
Parents of means began suggesting that perhaps rather than sending their infants out to be wetnursed in some peasant village–and thereby condemning over half of them to early death –the mother might herself nurse her infant .
The baby , said some mothers who began to try nursing their own babies , even responds to this care by giving love back to the nursing mother , stroking her breast and face and cooing .
And if the father , as often happened , complained that his wife ’s breast belonged to him not the baby , these bold new mothers suggested that the father should be allowed to hold the baby too .
These childhood reforms immediately preceded and thereby produced the humanistic , religious and political revolutions we associate with early modern times .
For the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Western Europe represent the great watershed of psychogenic change , wherein vastly improved childrearing allowed at least some of the schizoid and borderline personalities of antiquity and medieval times –who regularly heard voices and hallucinated visions –to move on to the more integrated , less splitting modern neurotic personality more familiar to recent times , thus achieving Melanie Klein ’s “ depressive position . ”
The sixteenth - century watershed in childrearing allowed people to reduce splitting and feel real depression for the first time , as can be seen in the popularity of Renaissance melancholy ( Hamlet ’s admirable depressive guilt ) , the ability of Protestants to end the good mother / bad mother splitting of Mary / Eve , and the ability to internalize the projective panoply of split Catholic saints / devils into Protestant depressive guilt .
With this vast improvement in childrearing –in some families at least –the modern world could begin , with the development of science , technology and democratization now being possible in parts of the West .
By the seventeenth century , the intrusive mode of childrearing began , particularly in England , America and France , whereby the child was seen as less full of dangerous projections , so it could actually be unswaddled soon after birth , not given regular enemas ( which had until then been given daily from birth to remove the bad contents felt to be inside the infant ) , toilet trained early rather than late , hit but not regularly whipped , and punished for masturbation rather than being masturbated by adults .
It eventually became unacceptable for men to go about with a mistress on one arm and a catamite on the other , though underground seduction of minors continued .
Intrusive parenting , in essence , began to substitute psychological pressure for physical abuse , so that rather than whipping the child to prevent it from sin , it was , for instance , shut up in the dark closets for hours or left without food , sometimes for days .
One mother shut her three - year - old boy up in a drawer .
Another had a house she described as “ a sort of little Bastille , in every closet of which was to be found a culprit–some were sobbing and repeating verbs , others eating their bread and water … ”
Another five - year - old French boy , in looking at a new apartment with his mother , told her , “ Oh no , mama …it ’s impossible ; there ’s no dark closet !
Where could you put me when I ’m naughty . ”
Although erotic whipping of children decreased gradually , the intrusive mode required nevertheless a steady pressure on the child to “ break its will ” and discipline it properly .
This breaking of the will began early .
John Wesley ’s mother said of her babies , “ When turned a year old ( and some before ) , they were taught to fear the rod , and to cry softly . ”
One would never know , she claimed , that children were present in her house .
Rousseau confirmed that in France babies in their earliest days were often beaten to keep them quiet .
Another mother wrote of her first battle with her four - month - old infant , “ I whipped him til he was actually black and blue , and until I could not whip him any more , and he never gave up one single inch . ”
One can sense in this description of baby battering the struggle with the mother ’s own powerful parent , with the baby seen as so obstinate that it “ won the battle ” even after being beaten .
In fact , this “ double image ” of the child as both a powerful adult and a wicked child accounts for the merging of beater and beaten in our myriad historical accounts of child abuse .
Here , for instance , is an early American father describing the beating of his four - year - old boy for not being able to read something .
The child is first tied up naked in the cellar .
Then , the father writes ,
With him in this condition , and myself , the wife of my bosom , and the lady of my family , all of us in distress , and with hearts sinking within us , I commenced using the rod … During this most unpleasant , self denying and disagreeable work , I …felt all the force of divine authority and express command that I ever felt in any case in all my life …
But under the all controlling influence of such a degree of angry passion and obstinacy , as my son had manifested , no wonder he thought he “ should beat me out , ” feeble and tremulous as I was ; and knowing as he did that it made me almost sick to whip him .
At that he could neither pity me nor himself .
This picture of the merging of parent and child , with the father complaining that he is the one “ beaten out ” and in need of pity , is common for the intrusive mode .
Similar confusion between parent and child can be seen in the severe punishments for masturbation championed by the child - training literature since Tissot .
Prior to this , children were masturbated by adults and even licked on their bodies as though they were substitute breasts .
For instance , Little Louis XIII , in 1603 , was described by his pediatrician as having his penis and breasts kissed by everyone in the court , and his parents would regularly make him part of sexual intercourse in the royal bed .
But childrearing reformers beginning in the eighteenth century began to try to bring this open sexual abuse under control , only it was the child who was now punished for touching his or her genitals , under threat of circumcision , clitoridectomy , infibulation and various cages and other genital restraint devices .
These terrorizing warnings and surgical interventions only began to die out at the end of the nineteenth century , after two hundred years of brutal and totally unnecessary assault on children ’s bodies and psyches for touching themselves .
Despite the reformers ’ efforts , progress was so uneven that one British journalist could write in 1924 that “ cases of incest are terribly common in all classes .
[ Usually ] the criminal … goes unpunished … Two men coming out from [ an incest ] trial were overheard saying to a woman who deplored there had been no conviction , ŒWhat nonsense !
Men should not be punished for a thing like that .
It does n’t harm the child . ' ”
It goes without saying that the effects on the child of these physical and psychological punishments were immense .
Adults remembered that as children they had had recurring nightmares and even outright hallucinations as they lay awake at night , terrorized by imaginary ghosts , demons , “ a witch on the pillow , ” “ a large black dog under the bed , ” or “ a crooked finger crawling across the room . ”
History is filled with reports of children ’s convulsive fits , dancing manias , loss of hearing and speech , loss of memory , hallucinations of devils and confessions of intercourse with devils .
Nor did the parents help their children ’s mental anguish by giving them comfort .
It was thought that the way for children to get over their fears was to make them face fear even more concretely , so adults used to take children on visits to the gibbet to inspect rotting corpses hanging there , while being told moral stories .
Classes used to be taken out of school to witness hangings , and parents would also sometimes take their children to hangings and then beat them when they returned home to make them remember what they had seen .
Even humanists , like Mafio Vegio , who protested the severe beating of children , would admit that “ to let them witness a public execution is sometimes not at all a bad thing . ”
The effect on the children of this corpse - viewing was of course massive .
One little girl , after her mother showed her the fresh corpse of her nine - year - old friend as an example , went around saying , “ They will put daughter in the deep hole , and what will mother do ? ”
Another woke at night screaming after seeing hangings , and “ practiced hanging his own cat . ”
Religion was a further source of terrorizing .
God was said to “ hold you over the pit of hell , much as one holds a spider , or some loathsome insect , over the fire ” and children ’s books depicted Hell as follows :
“ The little child is in this red - hot oven .
Hear how it screams to come out …
It stamps its little feet on the floor … ” Various terrorizing figures were used to control the child .
If you were bad , the werewolf would gulp you down , Blue Beard would chop you up , Boney ( Bonaparte ) would eat your flesh , the black man or the chimney sweep would steal you away at night .
This need to personify punitive figures was in fact so powerful that adults actually dressed up dummies to use in frightening children .
As one English writer , in 1748 , explained the practice :
The nurse takes a fancy to quiet the peevish child , and with this intent , dresses up an uncouth figure , makes it come in , and roar and scream at the child in ugly disagreeable notes , which grate upon the tender organs of the ear , and at the same time , by its gesture and near approach , makes as if it would swallow the infant up .
Another writer , in 1882 , described how the nurse of a friend ’s child wanted to leave for the evening while the parents were out , and so told the little girl that a
horrible Black Man…was hidden in the room to catch her the moment she left her bed … [ Then ] she made a huge figure of a black man with frightful staring eyes and an enormous mouth , and placed it at the foot of the bed where the little innocent child was fast asleep .
As soon as the evening was over …[ she ] went back to her charge .
Opening the door quietly , she beheld the little girl sitting up in her bed , staring in an agony of terror at the fearful monster before her , both hands convulsively grasping her fair hair .
She was stone dead !
By the nineteenth century ’s socializing mode , some parents no longer needed to terrorize , beat and sexually seduce their children , and more gentle psychological means began to be used to “ socialize ” the child .
The socializing mode is still the main model of upbringing in Western nations , featuring the mother as trainer and the father as provider and protector , and the child is seen as slowly being made to conform to the parents ’ model of goodness .
Many of the abusive practices are reduced in the home but remain elsewhere in society .
While Elizabeth I was sexually seduced as a girl by her caretakers and Louis XV had Madame du Barry procure little girls for the King to rape in his royal bedroom , by the nineteenth century parents would less often commit incest themselves but still sent their children to schools where they were erotically whipped on the bare buttocks and usually buggered by the older boys and masters .
As John Addington Symonds reported his experience as a boy at public school :
Every boy of good looks had a female name , and was recognized either as a public prostitute or as some bigger fellow ’s Œbitch . ’
Bitch was the word in common usage to indicate a boy who yielded his person to a lover .
The talk in the dormitories and the studies was incredibly obscene .
Here and there one could not avoid seeing acts of onanism , mutual masturbation , or the sports of naked boys in bed together .
Reformers during the nineteenth century tried to bring the rest of society into the socializing mode by legislation designed to prevent outright battering and sexual abuse of children , which of course still went on in the majority of families around them .
But those who tried to oppose buggering and beating boys in schools were opposed by parents who said “ It did n’t hurt me . ”
Those who tried to pass child labor legislation to reduce horrendous working conditions and hours were labeled Communists .
And those who thought one could bring up children kindly were considered impractical visionaries .
Even so , the decrease in parental seduction and beating during the intrusive mode produced an explosion of social innovation , allowing nations to produce the democratic and industrial revolutions of the modern period .
As Hanns Sachs pointed out long ago in his paper “ The Delay of the Machine Age , ” when people in antiquity first invented the steam engine , they dared to use it only for children ’s toys .
It was only after fifteen centuries of childrearing evolution that steam could finally begin to be used by less fearful and more individuated adults to provide power for the benefit of mankind .
As hellfire and physical discipline were replaced by other childrearing methods , it was the socializing psychoclass that built the modern world , with its democratic , innovative and class - dominated society .
What kind of society might be envisioned by children brought up under the latest childrearing mode–what I have termed the helping mode –whereby a minority of parents are now trying to help their children reach their own goals at each stage of life , rather than socializing them into adult goals–is yet to be seen .
I suspect it will be far less class - centered and more empathic of others than is the socializing modern world with which we are familiar .
That helping mode children grow up to be incapable of creating wars is also becoming evident from watching the anti-war activities of my children and those of their friends who have been brought up by other helping mode parents .
For war is only understandable as a sacrificial ritual in which young men are sent by their parents to be hurt and killed as representatives of the independence - seeking parts of themselves .
Psychohistorians have regularly found that images on the magazine covers and in political cartoons in the months prior to wars reveal fears of the nation becoming “ too soft ” and vulnerable , with images of dangerous women threatening to engulf and hurt people .
These regressed group - fantasies eventually produce so much anxiety that a sacrifice of innocent victims is deemed necessary , and another nation who also needs a sacrifice is located .
So regular are these group - fantasies in the media that I was able to forecast , for instance , the recent Persian Gulf War months before Iraq invaded Kuwait by locating in the American media an upsurge in imagery of devouring mommies and guilty children needing punishment .
hat periodic sacrifices are in fact lawful is suggested by the regularity with which they occur , nearly every state producing a major war on the average of about every 25 years throughout the past two millennia .
In between wars , periodic economic sacrifices serve to relieve our guilt for too much prosperity and to cleanse us of our dangerous economic and social progress .
Depth psychology has shown that in individuals progress toward individuation and success often produces regression , including both fears of leaving mommy and wishes for maternal re-engulfment , along with fears of losing one ’s self .
In nations , the same thing occurs after periods of rapid change and prosperity , and is defended against by the sacrificial ritual called war .
THE TASK OF THE FUTURE
That all social violence –whether by war , revolution or economic exploitation –is ultimately a consequence of child abuse should not surprise us .
The propensity to reinflict childhood traumas upon others in socially - approved violence is actually far more able to explain and predict the actual outbreak of wars than the usual economic motivations , and we are likely to continue to undergo our periodic sacrificial rituals of war if the infliction of childhood trauma continues .
Clear evidence has been published in The Journal of Psychohistory that the more traumatic one ’s childhood , the more one is likely to be in favor of military solutions to social problems .
Technologically , the human race is now quite able to satisfy its needs –if we can live together without violence .
But unless we now employ our social resources toward consciously assisting the evolution of childrearing , we will be doomed to the periodic destruction of our resources , both material and human .
To Selma Freiberg ’s dicta that “ Trauma demands repetition ” I would only add “ repetition in social behavior . ”
We can not be content to only continue to do endless repair work on damaged adults , with more jails and police and therapists and political movements .
Our task now must be to create an entirely new profession of “ child helpers ” who can reach out to every new child born on earth and help its parents give it love and independence .
Such a parent outreach movement is already under way in a few cities , and special issues of The Journal of Psychohistory have been published to document its operation .
A special issue on “ Changing Childhood ” is the most recent to be published , showing the success of parent outreach projects in several states .
The success of parenting centers such as the one pioneered in Boulder , Colorado , for instance , has been astonishing .
Through parenting classes and home visiting by paraprofessionals , they have measurably reduced child abuse , as shown by careful followup studies and by reduced police reports and hospital entrance rates .
All this has been accomplished with very small monetary outlays , since these parent outreach centers operate mainly with volunteer labor , while it has the potential to save trillions of dollars annually in the costs of social violence , police enforcement , jails and other consequences of the widespread child abuse of today .
Such a parent support movement would resemble the universal education movement of over a century ago .
People then objected to providing universal education , by saying , “ Well , yes , perhaps free education is useful for all children–but that would require hiring millions of teachers .
How can we afford it ? ”
We , too , admit that we will eventually need millions of parent helpers to teach parents how to bring up children and produce non-violent adults .
But the teaching of parenting is just the unfinished half –the most important half –of the free education movement of the past , with its goal the empowerment of children to realize their innate capacities for love and work .
Changing childhood is a communal task .
And it works .
In 1979 , Sweden passed a law saying that hitting children was as unlawful as hitting adults !
Imagine the audacity !
Children were people , just like adults !
Parents who hit their children were n’t put into jail –that would just deprive the children of their caretakers .
But the parents were taught how to bring up children without hitting them .
And at the same time , high school students were taught how to bring up children without violence .
By now , 20 years later , these high school students have their own children , and …surprise !
They do n’t hit them !
To those who object to the cost of communities helping all parents , we can only reply : Can we afford not to teach parenting ?
What more important task can we devote our resources to ?
Do we really want to have massive armies and jails and emotionally crippled adults forever ?
Must each generation continue to torture and neglect its children so they repeat the violence and economic exploitation of previous generations ?
Why not achieve meaningful political and social revolution by first achieving a parenting revolution ?
If war , social violence , class domination and economic destruction of wealth are really revenge rituals for childhood trauma , how else can we remove the source of these rituals ?
How else end child abuse and neglect ?
How else increase the real wealth of nations , our next generation ?
How else achieve a world of love and laughter of which we are truly capable ?
It appears we have our work cut out for us .

SAN FRANCISCO , March 23 , 2010 -- Scientists today described development of a new method to determine the age of ancient mummies , old artwork , and other relics without causing damage to these treasures of global cultural heritage .
Reporting at the 239th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , they said it could allow scientific analysis of hundreds of artifacts that until now were off limits because museums and private collectors did not want the objects damaged .
" This technique stands to revolutionize radiocarbon dating , " said Marvin Rowe , Ph.D. , who led the research team .
" It expands the possibility for analyzing extensive museum collections that have previously been off limits because of their rarity or intrinsic value and the destructive nature of the current method of radiocarbon dating .
In theory , it could even be used to date the Shroud of Turin . "
Rowe explained that the new method is a form of radiocarbon dating , the archaeologist 's standard tool to estimate the age of an object by measuring its content of naturally - occurring radioactive carbon .
A professor emeritus at Texas A&M University College Station , Rowe teaches at a branch of the university in Qatar .
Traditional carbon dating involves removing and burning small samples of the object .
Although it sometimes requires taking minute samples of an object , even that damage may be unacceptable for some artifacts .
The new method does not involve removing a sample of the object .
Conventional carbon dating estimates the age of an artifact based on its content of carbon - 14 ( C - 14 ) , a naturally occurring , radioactive form of carbon .
Comparing the C - 14 levels in the object to levels of C - 14 expected in the atmosphere for a particular historic period allows scientists to estimate the age of an artifact .
Both the conventional and new carbon dating methods can determine the age of objects as far back as 45,000 to 50,000 years , Rowe said .
In conventional dating methods , scientists remove a small sample from an object , such as a cloth or bone fragment .
Then they treat the sample with a strong acid and a strong base and finally burn the sample in a small glass chamber to produce carbon dioxide gas to analyze its C - 14 content .
Rowe 's new method , called " non-destructive carbon dating , " eliminates sampling , the destructive acid - base washes , and burning .
In the new method , scientists place an entire artifact in a special chamber with a plasma , an electrically charged gas similar to gases used in big - screen plasma television displays .
The gas slowly and gently oxidizes the surface of the object to produce carbon dioxide for C - 14 analysis without damaging the surface , he said .
Rowe and his colleagues used the technique to analyze the ages of about 20 different organic substances , including wood , charcoal , leather , rabbit hair , a bone with mummified flesh attached , and a 1,350 - year - old Egyptian weaving .
The results match those of conventional carbon dating techniques , they say .
The chamber could be sized to accommodate large objects , such as works of art and even the Shroud of Turin , which some believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ , Rowe said .
He acknowledged , however , that it would take a significant amount of data to convince museum directors , art conservators , and others that the new method causes no damage to such priceless objects
The scientists are currently refining the technique .
Rowe hopes to use it , for instance , to analyze objects such as a small ivory figurine called the " Venus of Brassempouy , " thought to be about 25,000 years old and one of the earliest known depictions of a human face .
The figurine is small enough to fit into the chamber used for analysis .

GOING GAGA : Lady Gaga stands for God Bless America during the seventh inning stretch as the New York Yankees play the New York Mets in a baseball game .
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld does n't see the funny side about Lady Gaga 's outlandish behaviour during her recent outings at a couple of baseball games .
" This woman is a jerk .
I hate her , " Seinfeld said during a radio interview .
" I can't believe they put her in my box , which I paid for . "
Lady Gaga attended a game between the San Diego Padres and the New York Mets at Citi Field in New York earlier this month and was photographed flipping the bird .
She was reportedly unhappy with her front - row seats , which were too close to the photographers , and later reappeared in the vacant luxury box owned by Seinfeld .
" You give people the finger and you get upgraded ?
Is that the world we 're living in now ? " the 56 - year - old comedian said .
" I do n't know what these young people think or how they promote their careers . "
Last weekend Lady Gaga rocked up to a New York Yankees ' baseball game wearing fishnet stockings , a bikini bottom and a pinstriped jersey unbuttoned to reveal her bra .

The Egyptian parliament extended the country ’s 29 - year - old emergency law for another two years on Tuesday .
The decision drew immediate criticism from foreign governments , opposition groups , dissidents and human - rights organizations which have been working to end emergency rule for almost three decades .
Egypt ’s Emergency Law has been in place since the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981 .
It gives the police extensive powers and provides the government with the ability to suspend constitutional rights and restrict political activity .
While the government defends the law as an anti-terrorism measure and made moves to limit its extraordinary powers , rights groups said such limitations are cosmetic and argue that the law provides for the arrest of political opponents , detention without charge and trials before state security courts which do not allow appeals .
“ It violates so many fundamental human rights and it ’s not legitimate by international law , ” Heba Morayef , a Cairo - based researcher with Human Rights Watch , told The Media Line .
“ At this stage there are still 5,000 administrative detainees detained under the Emergency Law .
” The move comes at a particularly sensitive time for Egypt , which is heading into both legislative and presidential elections next year .
Philip Crowley , US assistant secretary of state for public diplomacy said in a press briefing that the State Department was “ disappointed ” by the move .
“ We have questions about how this fits with pledges that the government of Egypt has made to its own people to try to find a way to move beyond the emergency law . ” Egypt has been one of the top recipients of US foreign aid since it signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979 .
Some in Washington believe that the US should condition its aid to Egypt on greater political reform .
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights ( EOHR ) said that the new format of the emergency law “ still contains aspects that threaten the rights and freedoms for all citizens , without distinction , or limiting measures on the perpetrators of crimes of terrorism .
”
“ The law retained the establishment of special courts and military courts to try civilians on any of the crimes referred by the President of the Republic , ” EOHR said in a statement .
“ EOHR insists on the need to abolish the state of emergency and return to constitutional legality .
” But Dr. Gamal Soltan , director of the Al - Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Egypt , argued that in a larger context the extension should be seen as a positive move .
“ Some credit should be given to the government , ” he told The Media Line .
“ For the first time we have a legal commitment , which became a part of the law , that would limit the applicability of the law to certain crimes related to drug trafficking and terrorism , ” he said .
“ In the past , there was an oral commitment to limit the usage of the law , but now it became part of the law , so it ’s a move forward .
”
“ The best case scenario would have been new legislation dealing with terrorism and removing all mention of emergency laws altogether , because the mere presence of the words ‘ Emergency Law ’ is poisoning the public atmosphere , ” he continued .
“ That did n’t happen , but hopefully this will happen soon .
In the meantime , we should n’t underestimate the importance of this new legal commitment to limit the application to terrorism .
” Soltan said the extension of the law is likely to affect the popularity of the ruling NDP party in the upcoming legislative elections , which will have to prove to the voters that the law is not being applied arbitrarily .
“ The renewal of the law puts a burden on the NDP , ” he said .
“ It needs to market the law and demonstrate to the public that it is qualitatively different , even though the measures are still there .
It wo n’t help improve the NDP ’s image unless they launch an effective campaign to explain the difference , otherwise it will be used by the opposition to mobilize more support and criticize the NDP .
” Morayef had a different take on the link between the law and the upcoming elections .
“ It ’s not a question of gaining more support , ” she said .
“ Rather , the Emergency Law is used as a tool to crack down on the opposition and it ’s a very effective tool .
They can define terrorism extremely broadly .
” The law has been applied in frequent crackdowns on the Muslim Brotherhood and other political opponents .
Although the arrests are justified by the authorities as a matter of national security , they are construed by critics as being a tool to silence the opposition .
What do you get when tea party activists team up with Ron Paulbots ?
A nightmare :
The official platform for the Republican Party of Maine is now a mix of right - wing fringe policies , libertarian buzzwords and outright conspiracy theories .
The document calls for the elimination of the Department of Education and the Federal Reserve , demands an investigation of “ collusion between government and industry in the global warming myth , ” suggests the adoption of “ Austrian Economics , ” declares that “ ‘ Freedom of Religion ’ does not mean ‘ freedom from religion ' ” ( which I guess makes atheism illegal ) , insists that “ healthcare is not a right , ” calls for the abrogation of the “ UN Treaty on Rights of the Child ” and the “ Law Of The Sea Treaty ” and declares that we must resist “ efforts to create a one world government . ”
It also contains favorable mentions of both the Tea Party and Ron Paul .
You can read the whole thing here .
Dan Billings , who has served as an attorney for the Maine GOP , called the new platform “ wack job pablum ” and “ nutcase stuff . ”
I would say that Mr. Billings sums it up nicely , although most of the really objectionable stuff is straight out of the Ron Paul playbook .
Ridding ourselves of the Fed is the first step on the road back to a gold standard , a dubious idea that Milton Friedman pointed out would increase government regulation of the economy :
With no Fed , inexpert Congress will bear the onus of alleviating economic suffering .
With deeper , longer recessions , Congressmen will inevitably succumb to pressure for more spending and regulation of the economy –as they did during the Great Depression .
How about eliminating the Department of Education ?
When first proposed by Ronald Reagan , the Department was in its infancy , only sucking up $ 6 billion dollars of taxpayer monies and serving as a repository for federal education programs that previously had existed in the various departments .
No more today .
The Department is now a $ 60 billion behemoth with almost every school district in the country dependent on its largess .
Cutting it down to size while gradually getting the feds out of the education business might be more to the point .
But for our tea party patriots , no half measures and nothing “ gradual ” allowed .
But it is the conspiracy mongering that should give us the most pause .
Putting paranoid loons in charge of the GOP in Maine who believe in a global warming “ conspiracy ” involving industry and government and that there is any possibility on planet earth that we would be yoked under some kind of “ one world government ” is madness .
Are all tea party patriots inclined to believe this “ whack job pablum ? ”
Certainly not all , although if you spend much time listening to them , similar sentiments are expressed by many .
As a free - standing group of activists dedicated to fiscal sanity and constitutional principles , the tea party movement has a vital role to play in any American revival .
But as purely political animals , they are a washout .
There are a sizable number of birthers among them , and a significant number who believe Obama is a Muslim , or favors Muslims , or is working for their interests .
I hate to bring up the “ R ” word but yes , there is a small but significant number who are racists as well .
In short , while the majority of tea partiers are average , normal Americans with pretty standard views , there is a sizable segment of the movement that makes them a political liability .
Another case in point was the tea party revolt in Utah that ousted Senator Bob Bennett .
For someone who has a lifetime rating of 85 from the ACU , it is amazing to think that Bennett would n’t be “ conservative enough ” for any state in the union .
But Utah Republicans had a few beefs with the senator and not even a last minute plea from Mitt Romney – popular in the state for his stewardship of the Salt Lake City Olympics – could save his political hide .
Other factors besides Bennett ’s obvious conservatism were in play .
Bennett , along with his Democratic colleague from Oregon Ron Wyden , made a serious attempt to address the health insurance problem in America with a flawed , but earnest effort at comprehensive reform .
Called “ The Healthy Americans Act , ” the bill incorporated some standard liberal thinking like an individual mandate , but was also innovative in the way costs would be shared and how the program would be administered at the state level .
It would also have done away with Medicaid – a plus in any conservative ’s book .
In short , it was a good old - fashioned senate compromise on a thorny issue that , in another less mindlessly partisan time , would have served as a starting point for the two parties to work out their differences .
It was n’t just his dalliance with the “ enemy ” that angered right wingers in Utah .
Bennett courageously voted against the Constitutional amendment to prohibit flag burning back in 2006 — one of only three GOP senators to do so .
He also supported comprehensive immigration reform .
While there was a lot wrong with that bill , the guest worker provision had broad bipartisan support and Bennett worked tirelessly to improve it .
As for the rest of it , the best that could be said of the measure was that it was attempting to address a problem for which there are probably no good answers .
That Bennett felt responsible enough as a legislator to lend his name and support to the bill reveals much about how he views his responsibilities .
To get rid of a senator of Bennett ’s seniority and experience is the most unconservative thing the tea party movement has done to date .
To effect change simply to realize change is the antithesis of conservative thinking and the excessive partisanship demonstrated by activists in Utah who hated Bennett for working with “ the enemy ” does not serve the interests of their state .
Maine and Utah are the first stirrings of tea party activists flexing their muscles in the political arena .
They see success where failure is the real outcome .
The largest study to examine a potential link between cellphone use and cancer is already stirring up controversy , two days ahead of its actual release .
After many years of ambiguous and sometimes conflicting results , the Interphone study was an attempt to provide a definitive measure of any risks associated with heavy cellphone use .
But even the study 's authors spent several years arguing over how to interpret the data that came in , before finally producing a report that 's due to be published Monday evening , US time .
A number of newspapers , however , have released stories on Interphone ahead of its general availability , and they suggest that the final product wo n't do much to clarify the health risks .
The past decade or so has seen a number of studies published that examined the potential for a link between cellphone use and cancers of tissues in the head , such as gliomas and parotid tumors .
A few of these have found potential associations between heavy cellphone use and specific tumors , but these have generally used methods that are potentially subject to issues of bias — asking a user which side of the head that they typically held their cellphone on only after cancer had been spotted on one side of the head , for example .
A steady flow of reports have failed to find any indication of an increased risk at all , even as cell phone use has increased dramatically .
From the biochemical perspective , there 's no obvious mechanism for cellular radiation to cause genetic damage .
As a result , the medical community had largely settled on the conclusion that there is no clear risk in the medium term , but longer - term ( greater than a decade ) risks could not be ruled out with the available evidence .
The Interphone study was an attempt to limit some of these ambiguities by recruiting a study population that was large enough to enable any signal of risk to rise above the statistical noise .
Subjects were enrolled in 13 countries , and the whole effort was coordinated by the World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer .
The cellphone industry provided financial support for the effort , suggesting that those with a large financial interest in its outcome would be less likely to attack any indication of risk that came out of this work .
A detailed report on the recruitment of Interphone subjects and methods used for the analysis was published back in 2007 , based on progress made up through 2006 .
Although Interphone was based on self - reported use , the plan was to get some measure of whether the self reporting was accurate , both by obtaining records from the network providers and by installing monitoring software on participants ' phones .
The nature and location of cancers would be confirmed through medical records .
Despite these precautions , the authors of that paper are very much aware of the potential for bias , noting " Cases may spend time after the diagnosis of their tumour trying to understand why they have developed this disease , which might introduce a differential bias ( sometimes referred to as rumination bias ) in comparison with controls in recall of the amount and side of phone use . "
That 's where things stood in 2006 ; the long silence since has been filled with rumors that the authors themselves could n't reach an agreement about how to interpret the data they had .
Apparently , the silence was due to end on Monday evening , US - Eastern time , when the study was scheduled to be published .
The WHO provided advanced copies to some members of the press with the understanding that they keep from reporting on it until that time .
Ivan Oransky , Executive Editor of Reuters Health , has found that this limit was widely ignored ; reports started appearing as early as Saturday , leading Reuters to release its own article .
We do n't have a copy of the study yet , but you can get some sense of its contents simply by scanning the headlines .
For every " increased risk " and " brain cancer link , " there 's a headline with " inconclusive " or " no answer . "
At the other extreme , an industry group responded with a press release that trumpets several quotes from the paper as evidence that its products are safe .
Despite its promise , Interphone has apparently left us right where we started : no obvious risk , but a potential health threat cannot be completely excluded .
Based on reading a number of the stories , it appears that , overall , cell phone use was associated with a slight protection from brain tumors — only the heaviest users saw an increased risk .
Both of these effects , however , seem to have been right on the edge of statistical significance , and a number of the study 's authors felt that they could probably be accounted for by the various sources of error inherent in the study design .
Perhaps more significantly , Reuters correctly points out that the study is a snapshot of the patterns of cellphone use from nearly a decade earlier now , and many things have changed significantly .
Cell phone use is much , much higher , but a lot of that now involves texting or data consumption , which do n't involve the user sticking the phone next to his or her head .
Improved transmission protocols have ensured that the power of the signals sent by handsets has also dropped in the intervening years .
All of that means that the patterns of exposure are significantly different now than they were during the period covered by the Interphone study .
We 'll take a look at the study in more detail once it becomes publicly available .
In the mean time , there 's a reasonable chance you 'll see headlines blaring about the dangers of cellphone use .
All indications are that the underlying study does n't support those conclusions — in fact , it 's not clear that it supports any conclusions .

A tipster texted the Appeal at around 9:30 this morning ( you can , too , at 6619 - APPEAL ) , saying “ Looks like there is a body being fished out of the bay by police at Embarcadero and Folsom . ”
It took us a while to get the details , but here ’s what we ’re told thus far : according to SFFD spokesperson Mindy Talmadge , a witness pointed a suitcase on the rocks near the Bay out to firefighters returning from a Bay rescue .
They retrieved it , and discovered that the suitcase contained a body .
( We do n’t have details on the race or gender of the person . )
Apparently , the suitcase , which had police believe had been washed up on the rocks at Embarcadero and Folsom for about an hour , was discovered by Margarito Real , who was walking with his niece .
A firefighter “ opened it and I think I saw a leg ” said Real .
They alerted the police at 8:53 , says police spokesperson Lt. Lyn Tomioka .
According to KTVU , , Lt. Mike Stasko , SFPD ’s homicide head , says this discovery ’s being treated as a “ questionable death . ”
The body ’s currently with the medical examiner , and has yet to be identified .
Update : The Chronicle reports that the body was a “ white ( woman ) or a light - skinned Latina and appeared to be in her 30s , ” and that “ the suitcase had probably been in the water for only a couple of days , based on the lack of decomposition of the body . ”
The ME ’s office is expected to perform the unidentified woman ’s autopsy on Wednesday .
Today , completely by accident , I ran across this blog post by a blogger at “ Student Activism , ” about whom I previously knew nothing .
In fact , I still do n’t know anything about this writer .
( Unlike me , a lot of bloggers seem not to want to disclose their identities too soon . )
This thoughtful post , entitled “ Childhood , Disability , and Public Space , ” discusses the negative judgments made by some nondisabled adults about behaviors sometimes exhibited by children , and / or by adults with developmental disabilities .
The writer is careful to emphasize that she does not mean to imply that adults with DD are childish or childlike .
Rather , she is concerned about the different and related prejudices that both groups face when venturing into public places .
This piece resonates with me on several levels .
I have a daughter , just on the cusp between childhood and adulthood , who carries several labels including DD .
She is gregarious and fun-loving , and loves to go to museums , plays , sporting events , and other activities that take place in shared public venues .
Most of the time , when we ’re out and about , she is courteous and perfectly appropriate … sometimes , not so much .
At these times , she talks too loudly during a performance , or eats messily while her napkin remains pristine , or yells at her parents for trying to correct her .
Her other mom and I work with her to learn good social skills , and she ’s making real progress , but I ’m aware that there are people out there who think kids like her should just stay home .
I ’ve read news stories about families getting kicked out of movie theaters because of sounds made by their autistic children .
I ’ve heard of restaurant patrons requesting a different table because they did n’t want to watch a disabled person eat .
I ’ve seen signs posted in stores , making supposedly funny threats against children who misbehave .
I know that we all have certain expectations when we go shopping , or buy a ticket to a performance .
In any society that aspires to freedom and equality , those expectations need to include the variations in atmosphere introduced by people of different ages , abilities , cultures , and so on .
I myself am a very noticeable presence in any public venue .
I use a power wheelchair which I operate by blowing into a tube .
I have more tubes going into my nose , connected to a mechanical ventilator , which pumps air into my lungs as I breathe .
At symphony orchestra concerts , during pianissimo passages , I ’ve become acutely aware of the mechanical sounds emanating from my respiratory equipment .
My self - consciousness has sometimes veered close to embarrassment , but I ’ve reminded myself that I have as much right as anyone to be in the presence of that great music .
I go so far as to believe that I make an important contribution to those public gatherings , even when I am merely a customer , a passerby , or an audience member .
I help to demonstrate , without fanfare , that all kinds of people get around in the world in all kinds of ways .
Everyone is not the same .
Some people make unusual noises .
Some look , move , or act a bit differently .
Some people even breathe differently .
That ’s one of the things I want my daughter to learn when we go out — though it ’s clear to me that she already knows that , more comfortably and more generously than most people .
The blogger at Student Activism , who is nondisabled and a parent , makes the following important point :
“ Public space is not our space .
Children , the elderly , and people with disabilities do n’t use parks , restaurants , stores , museums , and theaters at our indulgence , because it ’s not our space .
It ’s everyone ’s space , and everyone has an equal claim on it . ” ( Emphasis in the original . )
That ’s why we need accessible buildings and buses .
That ’s why we need welcoming businesses and cultural facilities .
That ’s why we need to re-commit to the idea of real community .

Balloon Boy Parents Get Balloon Back
Richard Heene , the father responsible for the balloon boy hoax , will get his runaway balloon back after all .
The runaway UFO - like balloon that was said to be carrying his 6 - year - old boy , Falcon is back in the hands of the parents who pleaded guilty to the hoax , the Associated Press reports .
According to authorities , the Heenes staged the hoax to try to get attention for a reality television show .
Court records also indicate the Heenes were in financial trouble and working with a production company to create a reality television show based on their lives , as previously discussed .
Richard
Heene requested to measure the balloon to make sure it was the same one he launched on Oct. 15 , the Larimer County Sheriff 's office said .
As previously discussed , the balloon boy incident was captured on national television as the balloon traveled nearly 50 miles at an altitude of around 8,000 feet .
Since then , the Heenes have performed their court ordered duties .
Heene completed a 90 - day jail sentence for his plea of falsely influencing authorities .
His wife , Mayumi , was sentenced to 10 weekends working at nonprofits for filing a false report .
As previously discussed , the couple is also on the hook to pay $ 36,000 in legal restitution to authorities who responded to the incident .
Prosecutors reduced the original $ 48,000 sought , agreeing to $ 36,000 and dropped the sheriff 's request for investigative costs .
Damage to a farmer 's wheat crop where the balloon landed has not been calculated , according to the Associated Press .
Richard Heene also faces an $ 11,000 civil penalty from the Federal Aviation Administration .
The balloon briefly shut down a runway at Denver International Airport .
Thai military crushes Bangkok protest
By John Roberts
20 May 2010
At least six people were killed and more than 60 injured yesterday when the Thai army cracked down on anti-government protesters who had been camped out in Bangkok ’s Ratchaprasong commercial district for weeks .
The military had besieged the protest site over the past week , cutting off food , water , power and mobile phone services .
In a display of overwhelming force , armoured vehicles smashed through makeshift barricades followed by heavily - armed troops who fired live rounds at anyone showing signs of resistance .
Military helicopters circled overhead to track the movements of demonstrators .
An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 protesters were present as the soldiers moved in .
At least six protest leaders surrendered to the security forces , saying they were seeking to avoid further bloodshed .
In reality , the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) leadership appeared to have lost control of the protesters , many of whom were determined to resist the army .
The New York Times reported that UDD leader Jatuporn Proman was booed off the stage as he declared , just prior to handing himself in : “ We can not resist against these savages anymore ” .
He pleaded : “ Please listen to me !
Brothers and sisters , I will use the word ‘ beg ’ .
I beg you .
We have to end this for now . ”
As the article reported , his call was not heeded .
Some protesters reported to an army - designated assembly point , but others began setting fire to nearby buildings .
One told the newspaper : “ Everyone feels that our leaders betrayed us .
We want democracy .
True democracy , free democracy .
Why is it so hard , why ? ”
The Nation reported that a protest meeting in the Klong Toey area of Bangkok erupted when it was announced that the UDD leaders at the Ratchaprasong site had decided to turn themselves in .
“ If you do n’t want to fight then get out , ” one demonstrator yelled .
The newspaper reported those on the stage had lost control .
A section of the crowd ransacked the nearby CP Fresh Mart and KBank , which protesters “ regarded as supporters of their political enemy ” .
Dense plumes of smoke rose above the city as angry protesters set fire to at least 27 buildings in the capital , including the luxury Central World and Siam Paragon shopping malls and the library at the Thai stock exchange .
The Channel 3 television station was torched and the staff of the Bangkok Post and Nation — English - language newspapers known for their hostility to the UDD — were evacuated after demonstrators appeared near their offices .
The government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva , which had already imposed a state of emergency in the capital and 23 of the country ’s 76 provinces , imposed an overnight curfew throughout these areas .
It announced that troops had been ordered to shoot looters and arsonists on sight .
Army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd declared that “ the general situation is under control ” and that the security forces had ended “ their offensive ” .
While the government has managed to break up the Ratchaprasong protest , none of the political and social issues which fuelled two months of anti-government protests has been resolved .
The UDD , which is aligned with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , began the demonstrations in March to demand immediate elections .
But as the protests in Bangkok ’s glitzy commercial and tourist hub were joined by the rural and urban poor , issues of social inequality emerged more insistently .
The death toll yesterday and over the past month will only heighten social tensions .
At least 25 people died and more than 850 were injured in street fighting on April 10 when soldiers attempted to clear another protest site near the Phan Fah bridge in central Bangkok .
In the week since last Thursday , another 51 people died after a compromise collapsed and Prime Minister Abhisit shelved his offer to call an election in November .
Medical authorities yesterday reported another six bodies at a Buddhist temple near the Ratchaprasong site , calling official figures into question .
In the rural north and northeast , where many of the UDD demonstrators came from , there have been protests and skirmishes with security forces .
Protesters set fire to government offices in Udon Thani and damaged the City Hall in Khon Kaen .
The government buildings in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai were reportedly torched .
An email to the WSWS described the situation in Chiang Mai : “ Today ’s ‘ D day ’ in Bangkok has sparked unrest here .
I was in town at midday when loud explosions were heard near the governor ’s residence .
I saw several armoured personnel carriers with troops disgorging and entering the governor ’s compound .
The [ UDD ] red shirts had responded to events down in Bangkok , setting fire to tyres at the entrance gates .
When they threw petrol bombs , the troops opened fire with live rounds over the heads of the protesters . ”
Business commentators yesterday voiced fears that the unrest was far from ended .
Kongkiat Opaswongkarn , CEO of Asia Plus Securities , told Reuters : “ This is n’t over .
The government is really going to have to look at the grassroots problem and what these people are calling for …
The social division , as we see it , is way too deep . ”
Kavee Chukitsakem , research head at Kasikorn Securities , expressed concerns that the UDD leaders were no longer in charge .
“ This situation is worse than expected now and it ’s very difficult to stop .
After the red shirt leaders surrender , things are out of control .
It ’s like insects flying around from one place to another , causing irritation .
We do n’t know who they are and why they are doing this .
If the situation does not improve quickly , it will severely affect the overall economy , ” he told Reuters .
The Abhisit government shows no sign of compromising with Thaksin or the UDD leadership .
UDD leaders have been branded as “ terrorists ” in the pro-government media and could face harsh penalties if put on trial .
Abhisit has declared that he will proceed with the five - point reconciliation plan , but that is unlikely to be accepted by opposition leaders without any commitment on early elections .
The bitter infighting between the pro- and anti-Thaksin factions of the Thai ruling establishment has continued for the past four years .
Thaksin , a telecom billionaire , was ousted in a military coup in September 2006 following sharp differences over economic policy .
The traditional Thai elites that had backed Thaksin in 2001 turned on him when he continued to open up the economy to foreign investors and undermined the patronage networks that favour the military and state bureaucracy .
Despite 14 months of military rule and a new constitution designed to keep Thaksin ’s supporters out of office , the pro-Thaksin People Power Party ( PPP ) won the election in December 2007 .
The PPP drew its support from the rural north and north east provinces where farmers and small proprietors had benefitted from the Thaksin government ’s limited handouts and provision of cheap health care .
Political infighting continued throughout 2008 .
Protracted demonstrations were mounted by the anti-Thaksin Peoples Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) — backed by the monarchy , the army , the state bureaucracy and the courts .
The security forces , which mobilised in force yesterday against UDD demonstrations , allowed PAD supporters to occupy the government house compound in central Bangkok for months and took no action when PAD occupied the capital ’s two main airports .
At the height of the 2008 airport occupation , a court ruling banned the PPP over alleged electoral misconduct , leading to the collapse of the government .
The country ’s top generals played a significant role behind the scenes in pressuring former PPP allies and a PPP faction to join a coalition with Abhisit ’s Democrat Party .
The determination of UDD protesters over the past two months has been fuelled in part by resentment and bitterness over the partisan role of the state apparatus in installing Abhisit .
Even if the rival factions of the ruling elite reach a compromise , neither the government nor the opposition parties is capable of resolving the social crisis facing workers and rural poor .
The ruthless army crackdown on protesters yesterday is a warning to the working class in Thailand and internationally of the measures that will be used increasingly to suppress any opposition to the impact of the worsening global economic crisis .
North Korea has announced it will scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea , amid rising tensions over the sinking of a South Korean warship .
The move is in retaliation for Seoul blaming Pyongyang for a torpedo attack that sank the Cheonan in March .
The announcement comes as the South Korean navy conducts a major anti-submarine drill .
An international probe found the Cheonan was sunk by a Northern torpedo .
North Korea has denied the allegation .
In a statement on the North Korean official news agency on Thursday , the North Korean military said the country would " completely nullify the bilateral agreement that was concluded to prevent a contingent clash in the West Sea of Korea [ Yellow Sea ] .

" In connection with this , [ we ] will completely stop using international maritime ultra-short wave walkie - talkies and will immediately cut off the communication line that was opened to handle an emergency situation . "
It also warned of an immediate attack if the South 's navy violated the disputed Yellow Sea borderline , and that it would consider a complete block on access to a joint industrial project in the North Korean city of Kaesong .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says the announcement is another piece in the picture that is coming out of North Korea of increasing tension .
On Tuesday , North Korea announced it would sever all ties with the South .
It had also banned South Korean ships and planes from its territory - a measure it repeated in its Thursday statement .
South Korea will " resolutely " deal with the North 's measures , a South Korean defence ministry official said without elaborating , according to the Associated Press news agency .
South Korea had already announced a package of measures , including a halt to most trade with North Korea .
It is also seeking action via the United Nations Security Council .
The Yellow Sea was the site of deadly naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002 .
South Korean drill
Thursday 's announcement came hours after 10 South Korean warships took part in an anti-submarine drill .
The South Korean exercise is one of the first visible signs of a raising of South Korea 's defence posture in response to the incident , our correspondent says .
With tensions rising rapidly , the North has reacted angrily to trade and shipping sanctions announced by the South .
The two states are technically still at war after the Korean conflict ended without a peace treaty in 1953 .
WASHINGTON , April 19 ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N added aggressively to its political war chest in the months before it was charged with civil fraud , collecting a record sum for donations to 2010 election campaigns , according to government disclosure documents .
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc Political Action Committee , the Wall Street bank 's vehicle for funding candidates for federal office , collected $ 1.28 million from its employees between January 1 , 2009 , and Feb. 28 , 2010 , the last date for which public records are currently available .
The 14 - month total , taken from monthly disclosure reports filed with the Federal Election Commission , far exceeds the amounts the PAC either raised or spent during any of the last decade 's full two - year election cycles , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics .
The numbers show Goldman 's PAC activity in the months before the fraud charges surfaced .
Sources have said the bank learned it was facing potential civil liability over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product six months before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company with civil fraud .
Last week , the SEC accused Goldman Sachs of hiding from investors that a prominent hedge fund manager was betting against a subprime mortgage product that he helped create .
Goldman has denied the charge .
Goldman spokeswoman Melissa Daly emphasized that the PAC 's finances are not paid by the bank but by its workforce .
" PAC donations ... are a reflection of our employees ' right to participate in the political process , " she said .
Goldman 's PAC filings , which the Center for Responsive Politics summarizes on its website , www.opensecrets.org, also shows the PAC entering March with more cash on hand than it collected or spent during any election cycle dating back to 2000 .
Goldman is due to file a new PAC disclosure report for the month of March on Tuesday .
PACs provide U.S. corporations with an avenue for contributing to the campaigns of individual political candidates under government rules enforced by the Federal Election Commission .
Goldman 's PAC contributions currently favor Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 63 percent to 37 percent .
In addition to candidates , the PAC has contributed to national party committees and other political action committees .
MAROANSETRA , Madagascar —
Exploiting a political crisis , Malagasy timber barons are robbing this island nation of its sylvan heritage , illegally cutting down scarce species of rosewood trees in poorly protected national parks and exporting most of the valuable logs to China .
For a decade or more , this illicit trade existed on a small scale .
But in the past year , it has increased at least 25 - fold , according to environmental groups that have been tracking the outgoing shipments .
They estimate the value of trees felled this past year at $ 167 million or more .
This accelerated plunder of the rainforest coincided with a military coup in March 2009 .
Andry Rajoelina , the mayor of Antananarivo , Madagascar ’s capital , was installed as president , and he has since led a weakened and tottering government that is unable — and perhaps unwilling — to stop the trafficking .
“ The government does nothing because it shares in the money , ” said Ndranto Razakamanarina , president of an association of Malagasy environmental groups and a policy officer with the World Wildlife Fund .
“ Many of the ministers think they ’ll be in office only three or six months , so they decide to make money while they can .
The timber mafia is corrupt , the ministers are corrupt . ”

He is Apache N4SIR .
Nearly a month after Microsoft shut down the original Xbox Live , he was one of the Noble 14 who kept their connections running .
Their numbers slowly dwindled , and today , he was the last Spartan standing .

Today , The Original Xbox Live Dies It 's April 14 .
If you own an old Xbox and play online with it , or still play original Xbox games on Read more
At 4 p.m. U.S. Pacific
Time , Agent Windex and Apache N4SIR were the last ones left connected to Halo 2 multiplayer - a link kept alive since midnight of April 15 .
Though Microsoft attempted to lure the Halo 2 diehards away with Halo : Reach beta codes and a pat on the back they stayed in until they got the boot .
But then at 4:21 Agent Windex sent this message to the Bungie forums :
I just got kicked off guys .
Good Job Apache , your the last one .
As of 7 p.m. U.S. PDT , Apache N4SIR was still in Halo 2 ( see screen ) - doing what , who knows .
Apache N4SIR had been streaming his play , and now , without an opponent , wondered what he should be doing .
Someone suggested beginning the campaign - but not beating the final mission , as it would sign him off .
Advertisement
Others asked that he capture himself signing out of the game and post the video to YouTube .
I 'm not sure what kind of signoff he could give to do this game justice .
It should be something epic .
Maybe something along these lines .
Final Update : Shortly before 11 p.m. PDT , May 10 , 2010 , Apache N4SIR left Halo 2 .
He says he was booted from the game .
This is the end of multiplayer on Halo 2 and the original Xbox Live .
