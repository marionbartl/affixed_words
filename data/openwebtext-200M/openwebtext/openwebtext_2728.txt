Again , these people call themselves " pro life " .
Do they sound like they value life to you ? :
A small sample of the hatred expressed on twitter after the assassination of Dr Tiller .
[...]
The overwhelming majority of tweets from both sides of the abortion issue expressed horror at the assassination of Dr Tiller .

At a bake sale that would make Mayor Bloomberg proud , a 10 - year - old Upper West Side girl displays the calorie count of homemade oatmeal raisin cookies she ’s selling at a folding table at West 89th Street and West End Avenue yesterday .
“ Some people care about calories , ” said Hannah , who attends Hunter College Elementary School .
“ The cookbook I got the recipe from listed the calories , so I thought I should , too . ”
Hannah has sold lemonade to benefit leukemia and lymphoma research every summer since age 4 , but she “ did n’t feel like making lemonade ” this weekend , so she decided to switch to baked goods and give the money to the ASPCA .
By early afternoon , Hannah had raised $ 23 .
“ Some people came by and laughed , ” said Hannah .
“ It was lots of fun . ”
A national survey has found people in Perth show greater prejudice against minority groups than other Australians .
The ' Challenging Racism Project ' surveyed more than 16,000 Australians over seven years .
Of the 850 people surveyed in Perth , more than 14 per cent said they were prejudiced against other cultures , compared with a national average of about 12 per cent .
Across other states and territories the survey included people living in both city and rural areas .
In WA , it was confined to the metropolitan area .
Lead researcher Kevin Dunn from the University of Western Sydney says while there were differences between the states , the greatest difference in attitudes was between generations .
" Older Australians - not all older Australians - but in general are more intolerant and younger Australians much more tolerant , " he said .
Mr Dunn says that location and age showed the greatest difference in attitudes .
" In every state , attitudes vary dramatically and in a statistically significant way across age categories , across generations , " he said .
What is it with conservative evangelical Republican hypocrites having all sorts of sinful extramarital dalliances with their staffers ?
Republican Sen. John Ensign of Nevada is admitting he had an extramarital affair with a member of his campaign staff .
Ensign told The Associated Press in a statement , “ I deeply regret and am very sorry for my actions . ”
An aide in Ensign ’s office said the affair took place between December 2007 and August 2008 , with a campaign staffer who was married to an employee in Ensign ’s Senate office .
Neither have worked for the senator since May 2008 .
The aide spoke on condition of anonymity .
The aide declined to comment on Ensign ’s political future .
The extent of the sexual hangups plaguing repressed Republican lawmakers is truly frightening .
Is anyone even bothering to keep score anymore ?
Off the top of my head I can name David Vitter , Newt Gingrich , Rudy Giuliani , John McCain , Larry Craig and Bob Barr .
Sigh …
Update : Think Progress plumbs the depths of Ensign ’s rank hypocrisy :

Are you using them all in your social media marketing efforts ?
What about online video , content aggregators , podcasts , social media news releases , forums , and photo sharing ?
Some people would have you believe that you should be engaged in all , or most , of these social media tools and tactics to promote your business .
Those people are wrong .
Why it Does n’t Pay to be an Early Adopter
It ’s a common marketing misconception that businesses should take advantage of every tool available to them if using that tool could potentially attract new visitors , readers , or customers .
While there ’s nothing wrong with testing new tools , attempting to try everything may cost more than you ’d think ( in wasted time ) , especially if you insist on being one of the first .
When a new social media tool is released , early adopters rush in .
From a marketing perspective , being an early adopter is not a smart business move for most businesses .
Why ?
Unless large numbers of your particular target market are also early adopters already using the tool , you ’re not going to reach your market by jumping on board .
Your marketing message has to reach your actual market .
If they ’re not there yet , there are more productive ways to spend your ( or your employees ’ ) time .
The All - Important ROI
Return on investment ( ROI ) is one of the most important business concepts out there .
In essence , when you maximize your ROI you ’re getting as much as you can out of as little as possible .
Let ’s say you have $ 5000 to invest in a social media marketing campaign for the next quarter .
You naturally want to get the biggest return possible on that investment ( let ’s say your goal is to attract more visitors to your website ) .
You could invest a little bit of that budget into every social media tool you can think of .
For example , you might produce a very low - budget video to release on YouTube , hire a part - time blogger to update your company blog and respond to comments , put out one or two social media news releases , hire a forum poster to visit communities to link to your website , and hire someone to help you setup social media and microblogging accounts ( such as with Facebook , LinkedIn , and Twitter ) .
When you try to do too much , your budget is stretched .
That video may be much poorer quality than you would have liked .
You may get a handful of blog posts for the month instead of a blogger who can post daily and build a real community around your blog .
You may have social networking profiles and a Twitter account , but you may not have anyone to constantly update them .
It ’s far better to strike a balance .
Let ’s say you still have a $ 5000 budget .
In this case you choose a more limited campaign plan–a blogger to post several times a week , a piece of linkbait ( like a free tool for download from that blog ) , and one social media press release ( which includes social bookmarking options ) to announce the release of that new tool .
You may not get as much “ stuff ” for your $ 5000 , but the targeted approach very often leads to greater returns for the same investment .
In this case , you ’ll have a populated blog attracting links and readers naturally , a free download which will attract even more links and visitors naturally , and a news release helping to give that tool ’s launch an edge by promoting it to other bloggers and members of your target market .
The key is the cohesiveness–finding tools and tactics that work well collectively to reach your marketing goals .
Knowing When Enough is Enough
Sometimes trying to get more , or do more , will actually give you less .
That ’s very true in social media marketing and jumping on the hype of new tools ( many of which are fads that die down significantly in just a few months to a few years ) .
Target your social media marketing campaign not only to tools that actually reach your audience right now , but also to tools that will give you the best return on the time or money you sink in .
Your social media marketing plan wo n’t necessarily look like anyone else ’s .
Even the most talked - about tool may not be right for your company , your budget , or your potential visitors and customers .
Remember that tried and true marketing strategies have earned that reputation for a reason .
Do n’t sacrifice promotional efforts that are already successful for your company to pursue new tools that may have a heavy learning curve ( meaning more time invested ) unless your market research tells you that tool or tactic can work even better than what you ’re already doing .
It ’s okay to try social media tools as they ’re released .
Just never forget to find out how your customers are using those tools before you invest in them solely for fear of being left behind .
Sen .
Dick Durbin , the second most senior democrat in the Senate , cashed out his stock the day after meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Durbin took the money and invested much of the $ 115,000 in Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc .
The transfers occurred on Sept. 19th .
The prior day he met with Paulson and Bernanke on the banking crisis .
Bloomberg reports that “ The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index plunged 4.7 percent last Sept. 15 after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bank of America Corp . ’s government - engineered takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co .
By the end of October , the index had fallen 22.6 percent . ”
I have long advocated a change in the ethics rules to require blind trusts for all members of Congress .
Currently , members can make killings on the market by using their access to policy changes and special tips .
For prior columns , click here and here .
Durbin , 66 , insists that he was only doing what other people were doing : moving his money to safer investments .
Moreover , he insists that the thrust of the information that he received from the Administration was released publicly the next day .
This may be so .
However , as noted in the above columns , senators have performed better than industry experts in the the past and the suspicion is that their success is due in some part to the special information that they received through their positions .
More importantly , these trades and investments create an obvious appearance of self - dealing .
Why should Senators ( who generally have no skills or training in the market ) insist on making these investments instead of using an expert in a blind trust ?
They obviously believe that they can do better — and historically they have .
The result is that members routinely invest in areas where they are voting and legislating .
If you want to write the laws affecting the markets , you should not be allowed to play the markets .

Hours before the start of NBA free agency , Detroit Pistons president Joe Dumars made a splash of a different sort
Tuesday , firing coach Michael Curry after just one season amid ongoing concerns about Curry 's command of the locker room and fears that keeping him could hamper Detroit 's offseason business .
NBA front - office sources told ESPN.com that the Pistons -- projected to have more spending money than any team in the league when the market opens for business at 12:01 a.m. ET Wednesday -- had been contemplating the move for weeks after Curry 's rocky debut season , and decided to go ahead with the change , in part to help maintain their position as the team with the most free - agent ammunition this summer .
After making what he described as a " difficult " decision , " Dumars told ESPN.com Tuesday afternoon : " As we have continued to go through this transition , it has become clear that we needed a more experienced coach to help guide us through this period . "
The Detroit Free Press also quoted Dumars as saying that he " asked a lot of Mike as a first - year head coach . "
Pistons spokesman Kevin Grigg said the timetable for naming a new coach was up in the air .
" Obviously with the free agency period starting tomorrow [ Wednesday ] , we do n't know quite the speed of it , " Grigg said .
One prominent coaching source told ESPN.com that it 's unlikely Dumars would push for such a move , given the timing , without already having reached out to prospective targets .
Sources said that two names high on Dumars ' list as potential replacements are former Pistons coach and current TNT analyst Doug Collins , along with ex-Dallas Mavericks coach Avery Johnson , who just completed his first season as an ESPN analyst .
A source close to the situation told ESPN that Johnson met with the Pistons on Wednesday .
Recently , reports have been circulating that Walmart may indeed be testing the used game trade - in market .
The process , however , is n’t what you ’d expect .
Instead of handing the game to a store employee , you ’ll be submitting it into a machine .
This process , as you may recall , is similar to the RedBox DVD rental machines .
All you have to do is bring your desired game into the store , scan the barcode , turn it in , and voila .
You ’re finished !
However , the process still has its fair share of glitches .
Numerous complaints have circulated , citing the inability for the scanner to read the barcode , or reporting that the game they want to trade in is n’t in the machine ’s database .
No word yet on whether this is a direct shot at GameStop ’s long - tenured dominance at the trade - in market , or just a meager attempt to raise some money .
Anyone brave enough to try it out themselves ?

European researchers in robotics , psychology and cognitive sciences have developed a robot that can predict the intentions of its human partner .
This ability to anticipate ( or question ) actions could make human - robot interactions more natural .
The walking , talking , thinking robots of science fiction are far removed from the automated machines of today .
Even today 's most intelligent robots are little more than slaves – programmed to do our bidding .
Many research groups are trying to build robots that could be less like workers and more like companions .
But to play this role , they must be able to interact with people in natural ways , and play a pro-active part in joint tasks and decision - making .
We need robots that can ask questions , discuss and explore possibilities , assess their companion 's ideas and anticipate what their partners might do next .
The EU - funded JAST project ( http://www.euprojects-jast.net/) brings a multidisciplinary team together to do just this .
The project explores ways by which a robot can anticipate / predict the actions and intentions of a human partner as they work collaboratively on a task .
Who knows best ?
You cannot make human - robot interaction more natural unless you understand what ' natural ' actually means .
But few studies have investigated the cognitive mechanisms that are the basis of joint activity ( i.e. where two people are working together to achieve a common goal ) .
advertisement
A major element of the JAST project , therefore , was to conduct studies of human - human collaboration .
These experiments and observations could feed into the development of more natural robotic behaviour .
The researchers participating in JAST are at the forefront of their discipline and have made some significant discoveries about the cognitive processes involved in joint action and decision - making .
Most importantly , they scrutinised the ways in which observation plays an important part in joint activity .
Scientists have already shown that a set of ' mirror neurons ' are activated when people observe an activity .
These neurons resonate as if they were mimicking the activity ; the brain learns about an activity by effectively copying what is going on .
In the JAST project , a similar resonance was discovered during joint tasks : people observe their partners and the brain copies their action to try and make sense of it .
In other words , the brain processes the observed actions ( and errors , it turns out ) as if it is doing them itself .
The brain mirrors what the other person is doing either for motor - simulation purposes or to select the most adequate complementary action .
Resonant robotics
The JAST robotics partners have built a system that incorporates this capacity for observation and mirroring ( resonance ) .
advertisement
“ In our experiments the robot is not observing to learn a task , ” explains Wolfram Erlhagen from the University of Minho and one of the project consortium 's research partners .
“ The JAST robots already know the task , but they observe behaviour , map it against the task , and quickly learn to anticipate [ partner actions ] or spot errors when the partner does not follow the correct or expected procedure . ”
The robot was tested in a variety of settings .
In one scenario , the robot was the ' teacher ' – guiding and collaborating with human partners to build a complicated model toy .
In another test , the robot and the human were on equal terms .
“ Our tests were to see whether the human and robot could coordinate their work , ” Erlhagen continues .
“ Would the robot know what to do next without being told ? ”
By observing how its human partner grasped a tool or model part , for example , the robot was able to predict how its partner intended to use it .
Clues like these helped the robot to anticipate what its partner might need next .
“ Anticipation permits fluid interaction , ” says Erlhagen .
“ The robot does not have to see the outcome of the action before it is able to select the next item . ”
The robots were also programmed to deal with suspected errors and seek clarification when their partners ’ intentions were ambiguous .
For example , if one piece could be used to build three different structures , the robot had to ask which object its partner had in mind .
From JAST to Jeeves
But how is the JAST system different to other experimental robots ?
“ Our robot has a neural architecture that mimics the resonance processing that our human studies showed take place during joint actions , ” says Erlhagen .
“ The link between the human psychology , experimentation and the robotics is very close .
Joint action has not been addressed by other robotics projects , which may have developed ways to predict motor movements , but not decisions or intentions .
JAST deals with prediction at a much higher cognitive level . ”
Before robots like this one can be let loose around humans , however , they will have to learn some manners .
Humans know how to behave according to the context they are in .
This is subtle and would be difficult for a robot to understand .
Nevertheless , by refining this ability to anticipate , it should be possible to produce robots that are proactive in what they do .
Not waiting to be asked , perhaps one day a robot may use the JAST approach to take initiative and ask : “ Would you care for a cup of tea ? ”
The JAST project received funding from the ICT strand of the EU ’s Sixth Framework Programme for research .
To show how Genetic Programming of Pyevolve can be flexible , I ’ve done a simple example using Adobe Flex and Pyevolve , the example is just to show how to evolve some kind of Flex layouts , I ’ve not implemented the fitness function , this example will just create a random Flex layout using MXML .
So , here is the Pyevolve code of the example :
import random from pyevolve import * def gp_hbox ( x , y ) : return " %s %s " % ( x , y ) def gp_vbox ( x , y ) : return " %s %s " % ( x , y ) def gp_panel( x , y ) : return " %s %s " % ( x , y ) def eval_func ( chromosome ) : code_comp = chromosome.getCompiledCode( ) for a in xrange ( 0 , 5 ) : for b in xrange ( 0 , 5 ) : evaluated = eval ( code_comp ) return random.randint ( 1,100 ) def main_run ( ) : genome = GTree.GTreeGP ( ) genome.setParams(max_depth=5 , method= " ramped " ) genome.evaluator += eval_func ga = GSimpleGA.GSimpleGA( genome ) button = repr ( " < mx: Button label= ' Button '/> " ) label = repr ( " < mx : Label text =' Label ' / > " ) text_input = repr ( " < mx : TextInput width= ' 50 '/> " ) ga.setParams( gp_terminals = [ button , label , text_input ] , gp_function_prefix = " gp " ) ga.setMinimax ( Consts.minimaxType[" minimize " ] ) ga.evolve ( freq_stats=5 ) print ga.bestIndividual( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main_run ( )
As you can see , I ’ve created the layout tags like HBox , VBox and Panel as functions of GP and the Button , Labe , TextInput as terminals of the GP , the result is very funny , it ’s just a random layout , but you can use your imagination to create some nice and interesting fitness functions .
Here is the SWF generated from a random individual of the population :
I hope you enjoyed =)

The short answer : Very hard .
In the spirit of From The Rink 's James Mirtle 's " How hard is it to win the Stanley Cup ? " and Habs Eyes on the Prize 's Robert L.'s " How Hard Is It For A First - Round Pick To Win A Stanley Cup ? " comes this exploration of the chances an Ottawa Senators draft choice might go on to win the Stanley Cup .
The answer ?
Zero per cent .
Since the franchise first started drafting in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft , 151 prospects have had their name called by Ottawa brass , and not one of those individuals has gone on to hoist the Stanley Cup over their head .
Certainly , the sample size is relatively small , and it's true that only 14 per cent of NHLers ever win the championship , but does n't this indicate a fairly ugly drafting record for the seven all - time Ottawa Senators general managers ?
Pundits have historically given the Ottawa Senators some reasonable kudos for drafting well , thanks in large part to selecting diamonds - in - the - rough who are able to develop into regular NHL contributors .
But for every Daniel Alfredsson ( 1994 , 6th round , 133 overall ) and Sami Salo ( 1996 , 9th round , 239 overall ) , there 's a Mathieu Chouinard ( 1998 , 1st round , 15 overall ) and Jakup Klepis ( 2002 , 1st round , 16 overall ) .
Although 41 per cent of the Senators ' 151 all - time draft choices ( 62 in real terms ) have gone on to play at least one NHL game , only 17 per cent ( or 26 players ) have hit the 200 - game mark , and 8.6 ( 13 individuals ) per cent have played over 500 career NHL games .
This , of course , includes players drafted in recent years who have n't had the opportunity to play in the NHL yet , but the statistics remain interesting nonetheless .
Although he and the Detroit Red Wings did n't manage to seal the deal on Tuesday night , Marian Hossa has the opportunity to be the first Ottawa Senators draft pick ever to win the Stanley Cup this Friday in game seven of the Stanley Cup Final .
And if he does n't , well , it 's anyone 's guess as to who could be the first .
For anyone interested , here are the numbers for each draft year since the Senators ' joined the NHL :
2008 : 0/7
2007 : 0/4
2006 : 0/7
2005 : 0/8
2004 : 0/11
2003 : 0/9
2002 : 0/8
2001 : 0/12
2000 : 0/9
1999 : 0/10
1998 : 0/10
1997 : 0/8
1996 : 0/7
1995 : 0/9
1994 : 0/10
1993 : 0/10
1992 : 0/12
And just for fun , can anyone think of a player who left the Ottawa Senators and then won the Stanley Cup afterwards ?
I 'm having a hard time thinking of any .
Feel free to post in the comments .

“ Join us for the release of our two new seasonal beers , Dunkel Weiss and Saison .
$ 15 admission includes food and unlimited beer ( Dunkel and Saison only ) .
6 - 9 pm on Friday , April 17th .
As always , the party is in the brewhouse and you Must have a valid ID to enter . ” ]
( Denver , CO ) –
The following info on these beers comes from an email from Great Divide , posted in this Beer Advocate thread :
“ We are planning to package the new 22 oz beers , the Dunkel Weiss and the Saison , later this week … .
The new 6 pack selection will be Belgica , our Belgian IPA …
Great Divide Belgica
The Roman name for the Low Countries –is a marriage of the best in American and Belgian brewing traditions .
Belgian pilsner malt , a generous amount of American and European hops and a unique Belgian yeast strain combine to give Belgica big notes of citrus and spice , creating a lively concoction perfect for spring in the Rockies–or the Ardennes .
7.2 % ABV .
Great Divide Dunkel Weiss
Think of it as a hefeweizen ’s older brother .
A hearty mix of wheat and dark German barley malts gives it a medium body and muddy brown hue , while our proprietary yeast strain provides the signature notes of banana and clove .
If you like wheat beers , come to the Dunkel side .
You wo n’t be disappointed .
Just do n’t put any lemon in it .
6.4 % ABV .
Great Divide Saison
Our homage to the beers that have quenched the thirst of Belgian farm workers for centuries .
Brewed with barley , wheat and rice and fermented at high temperatures with a special blend of four different yeast strains , Saison is fruity and slightly tart , with a dry finish that makes it that rarest of treats–a beer as refreshing as it is complex .
7.3 % ABV .
In politics , it seems , you can justify almost anything ; being an Aboriginal member of the Labor or Liberal Party is no longer one of them , given Marion Scrymgour 's recent exit from the Labor Party in NT .
In politics you can justify almost anything .
But being an Aboriginal member of the Labor or Liberal Party is no longer one of them .
At least , that ’s the case in the Northern Territory , and it ’s all thanks to Marion Scrymgour , the former NT Deputy Chief Minister who yesterday walked away from the Labor Party and , in the process , changed the face of black politics in this country forever .
Scrymgour will now serve out her term as an Independent for the seat of Arafura .
And there ’s not a damn thing Labor , infamous for drowning “ rats ” that desert the sinking ship , can do about it .
Until yesterday , Labor held 13 of the NT parliament ’s 25 seats , the minimum number to govern in its own right .
Today , it must negotiate with one of two independents to retain power : Gerry Wood , a former deputy speaker of parliament who was screwed out of the job by Labor , and , of course , Marion Scrymgour .
In politics , you reap what you sow .
Scrymgour ’s desertion has left NT Labor Chief Minister Paul Henderson so powerless , so impotent that this morning he was reduced to issuing a flapping press release headlined , “ STRONG STABLE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES ” .
Sure it does .
Just not in the NT .
Up there , government is paralysed .
Pure and simple .
And note to Paul : writing the headline in capitals does n’t make it any more convincing .
Scrymgour by all reports is taking no comfort in her “ betrayal ” .
It has been a gut - wrenching , distressing period of her life .
Regardless , it ’s being celebrated around black Australia .
Press releases are pouring in from black institutions all over the nation offering their support and admiration .
I ’ve never even heard of some of the organisations .
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

Scrymgour ’s resignation came about two months too late .
As Minister for Education , she presided over the axing of bi-lingual education in NT schools , a no-brainer policy which has outraged Aboriginal people around the country .
A wealth of international research shows that it ’s vital young Aboriginal children learn in both their native tongue and English .
But that ’s another story for another day .
The issue at hand here is the latest Labor treachery that tipped Scrymgour over the edge — her party ’s recently announced “ Homelands policy ” .
There ’s not much difference , morally at least , in this stinking albatross of a policy and Labor ’s bi-lingual betrayal .
Again , a wealth of international ( and in this case local ) research shows that Aboriginal people “ living on country ” — that is on their remote outstations — are much healthier than Aboriginal people who live in larger cities and towns .
So why would Labor withdraw future support for homelands ?
Because in the short - term it ’s the more expensive option , even though in the long - term it ’s obviously the cheapest ( not to mention the most moral ) .
In the Territory , you do n’t win government by being moral , nor by spending money on the blacks .
That ’s how you lose government .
And therein lies the quandary not just for Labor , but for the CLP as well .
From this point forward , that does n’t matter anymore .
Everything has changed .
It might not be politically popular to afford black people equal rights and equal access , but it ’s what you ’ll have to do if you want to win office .
I do n’t imagine for one minute that things will improve overnight for black Territorians .
But irrefutably Scrymgour has re-shaped the political landscape in one of the most desperate regions of this country .
Aboriginal people now hold the cards , not to mention the balance of power .
Indeed , they have for some time , but have either not realized it or been too scared to accept it .
Aboriginal Territorians make up almost 30 percent of the population in the NT , and their birth rate is about 60 percent higher than the white population .
That sort of voting base ( now , and into the future ) can make a government and break it as well .
The NT is the only jurisdiction in Australia where Aboriginal people have any realistic chance of flexing any significant political muscle .
Yet over the last 30 years , black Territorians have still been repeatedly screwed by the NT parliament .
Under the CLP and Labor , Aboriginal communities have been starved of housing , education and health funding .
They ’ve missed out on any significant investment in their towns , save for communities that have appeal to white tourists .
The fifth largest town in the NT ( Wadeye ) has no road access five months of the year ( it ’s cut off in the wet season ) .
It only recently got a high school , despite having a school - aged population of more than 1,000 kids .
This sort of criminal government neglect could only be inflicted on an Aboriginal community in Australia .
And it ’s not just the starving of resources , politically , Aboriginal people have been fodder for generations of the Territory ’s Labor and Liberal politicians desperate to curry favour with the redneck masses .
What better way than to beat up on the blacks ?
In the late 1990s , then CLP Chief Minister Shane Stone publicly called on Territorians to “ monster and stomp on ” homeless Aboriginal people .
That was shortly before he described Australian of the Year Galarrwuy Yunupingu as “ just another whinging , whining , carping black ” .
His predecessor , Paul Everingham told media that Aboriginal people would still be “ bashing their babies heads in with rocks ” if the white man had n’t arrived .
And that was the just the CLP .
At almost every election they ’ve fought , the CLP has played the race card .
Over to Labor , where Clare Martin in the first hour of her first ever re-election campaign as Chief Minister promised to lock up Aboriginal people who begged for money .
The Australian political process — both in the provision of resources and the promotion of its citizens has failed Aboriginal people miserably , in particular in the Territory .
Since 1974 , 13 Aboriginal people have been elected to the NT parliament through the two - party process , and yet despite all these atrocities , we still feign faith in the process .
Exactly which part of “ This sh-t ai n’t working ? ” are n’t we getting ?
So it ’s time .
There are currently five black faces in NT parliament — Scrymgour , Malarndirri McCarthy , Alison Anderson and Karl Hampton for Labor , and Adam Giles for the Country Liberals .
The question now becomes who else will follow Scrymgour ’s lead ?
McCarthy , the member for the neighbouring seat of Arnhem , is close to Scrymgour and built of the same stuff .
She has defied her party in the past on issues like the McArthur River Mine .
Her cultural ties are as strong as they come .
Karl Hampton is no shrinking violet , neither is Alison Anderson .
Giles is an impressive young leader .
So it ’s time to join forces , either as a new black party , or as a loose coalition of independents .
Combined , the “ NT Black Five ” have an historic opportunity to change not just governance in the NT , but the Australian political process forever .
Can you imagine a jurisdiction in Australia where Aboriginal people have a chance not just for a seat at the table , but for a seat at the table as equals ?
Can you imagine a parliament in Australia where people can win more than just concessions ?
The question is , do the black elected members of parliament have the courage to turn a political process on its head which has kept them and their families down for generations , a process which still to this day treats them like dogs and human detritus ?
They well have sworn an oath to a political party , but if it requires them to abandon their own , to turn their backs on the ancestors who fought and died so that future generations might enjoy at least some of the rights other Australians hold dear , then it hardly seems an oath worthy of keeping .
It ’s an exciting time for black politics in Australia .

Some Christian activists “ must see ” some NBC apologies :
A recent Law & Order show portraying a leader in a college Christian ministry as anti-homosexual and Christians as “ Bible thumpers ” is drawing ire from a watchdog group for anti-Christian bigotry .
…
There is a relentless attempt by the media to stereotype Christians as prone to violence , said Dr. Gary Cass , chairman and CEO of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission , as he criticized the producers as insensitive .
…
He added that it is negative portrayals of Christians like that featured in “ Law & Order ” which are used to “ legitimate violence against Christians . ”

For Americans who hear the name Washington Post and still think of “ All the President ’s Men ” – brave journalists and editors facing down a corrupt President – today ’s version of the newspaper would be a sad disappointment , a betrayal of a noble past .
Over the last three decades , the Post has evolved into a neoconservative propaganda sheet , especially its opinion section which fronted for George W. Bush ’s false Iraq - WMD claims , led the long - term bashing of Iraq War critics , and defends whatever actions the Israeli government takes , including the recent war in Gaza and apparently its desire to preemptively bomb Iran .
Rather than a newspaper committed to the truth and favoring a broad debate about important issues , the Washington Post has become an enforcement mechanism for a neocon - dominated Establishment , setting the parameters for permissible points of view and twisting facts for that purpose .
A recent example of this enforcement role was its March 12 lead editorial trashing former U.S. Ambassador Charles “ Chas ” Freeman for issuing a two - page statement pointing out that his nomination to serve as a top intelligence analyst had been torpedoed by Washington ’s powerful Israel Lobby .
To the Post ’s editors , however , there apparently is no Israel Lobby ; there has been no large - scale organized effort to bend U.S. foreign policy to the interests of Israeli governments over the years .
Even the suggestion that such a body exists is a sign of delusion , bigotry and a conspiratorial mindset .
The Post editorial entitled “ Blame the ‘ Lobby ’ ” declared that “ Mr. Freeman issued a two - page screed … in which he described himself as the victim of a shadowy and sinister ‘ Lobby ’ whose ‘ tactics plumb the depths of dishonor and indecency ’ and which is ‘ intent on enforcing adherence to the policies of a foreign government . ’
Yes , Mr. Freeman was referring to Americans who support Israel – and his statement was a grotesque libel . ”
The Post editors then raised the irrelevant fact that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee “ says that it took no formal position on Mr. Freeman ’s appointment and undertook no lobbying against him ” as the choice to chair the National Intelligence Council , which oversees production of intelligence estimates about threats facing the United States .
The Post ’s sleight of hand here was to pretend that only a formal AIPAC objection and direct actions by AIPAC personnel could represent the Israel Lobby .
In reality , the Israel Lobby is far more expansive than simply AIPAC and includes a wide array of think tanks , contributors to political campaigns , and media commentators , including senior Post editors and columnists .
The Post ’s View
In the editorial , the Post ’s effort to deny the existence of an Israel Lobby moves on to assert that since U.S. governments have not done everything that some Israeli leaders have demanded – for instance , giving them help in bombing Iran – then , ipso facto , there is no Israel Lobby .
Left out of this sophistry are all the actions that Washington has taken in line with Israeli desires , such as overthrowing Saddam Hussein ’s government in Iraq , turning a blind eye to Israel ’s use of high - tech U.S. weapons against Palestinian and Lebanese targets , and fending off international condemnation for such acts as the recent war on Gaza .
The Post makes its case this way :
" Let 's consider the ambassador 's [ Freeman ’s ] broader charge :
He describes ‘ an inability of the American public to discuss , or the government to consider , any option for U.S. policies in the Middle East opposed by the ruling faction in Israeli politics . ’
“ That will certainly be news to Israel 's ‘ ruling faction , ’ which in the past few years alone has seen the U.S. government promote a Palestinian election that it opposed ; refuse it weapons it might have used for an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities ; and adopt a policy of direct negotiations with a regime that denies the Holocaust and that promises to wipe Israel off the map . …
“ What 's striking about the charges by Mr. Freeman and like - minded conspiracy theorists is their blatant disregard for such established facts .
Mr. Freeman darkly claims that ‘ it is not permitted for anyone in the United States ’ to describe Israel 's nefarious influence .
“ But several of his allies have made themselves famous ( and advanced their careers ) by making such charges -- and no doubt Mr. Freeman himself will now win plenty of admiring attention .
Crackpot tirades such as his have always had an eager audience here and around the world . ”
Yet , what is striking about the Post ’s up - is - down rant is that it was made in the context of a successful neoconservative campaign to blackball Freeman from a job in the U.S. government , where he had a long and distinguished career .
In other words , the Post ’s editors pretend that the termination of Freeman ’s government career ( which they helped destroy ) and the smearing of his reputation ( which they contributed to ) were , in some way , the advancement of his career and his fame .
They also left out that they commissioned one of the most influential attacks on Freeman , a Feb. 28 op - ed by Jon Chait , an editor at The New Republic , an important neoconservative journal whose publisher Martin Peretz has been a staunch supporter of Israeli government actions for decades .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Neocons Wage War on a ‘ Realist . ’ ” ]
Piling On
Over the weekend , the Post ’s opinion section delivered two more coup - de - grace shots to Freeman ’s reputation by publishing columns by Rep. Frank Wolf , R - Virginia , and Post editorial writer Charles Lane – articles that alternatively linked Freeman to the Taliban and to the Darfur genocide – and blasted him for complaining about being subjected to “ libelous ” accusations .
“ Freeman 's charges of an elaborate conspiracy to derail his nomination are disingenuous , ” Wolf wrote in his op - ed , picking up the theme of no formal AIPAC action .
“ The ‘ Israel lobby ’ never contacted me . ”
However , Wolf made clear that he had read and absorbed much of the anti-Freeman propaganda that Washington ’s neoconservatives were spreading .
Wolf links Freeman to the Taliban ’s Mullah Omar ( via Saudi financial support both for Islamic madrassas and for a Middle East think tank run by Freeman ) and to the Darfur atrocities ( via a Chinese - government - backed oil company which paid Freeman $ 10,000 a year for advice and which has invested in exploration for Sudanese oil ) .
While such Kevin - Bacon - style guilt by tenuous association might seem over the top in other circumstances , the Post ’s editors appeared determined to go to any lengths to ensure that former Ambassador Freeman would face permanent scarring for having mentioned the Israel Lobby – or as they would put it , the “ Israel Lobby . ”
Using Wolf ’s logic , one could accuse nearly every American of supporting the Taliban ( because we use Saudi oil ) and of complicity in the Darfur atrocities ( because we as a nation buy billions of dollars in Chinese goods each year ) .
Up - Is - Down
Despite the Post ’s extraordinary devotion of editorial space to demonize a little known ex-diplomat who had been appointed to an obscure job , the Post ’s piling on was n’t over .
The newspaper next published an op - ed by one of its own editorial writers , Charles Lane .
Lane ’s chief point was that President Barack Obama must join in the destroy - Freeman campaign .
“ The President needs to knock Freeman 's insinuations down hard -- for two reasons , ” Lane wrote .
“ The first is to stop them from gaining any more currency than they already have in the rest of the world , especially in Arab and Muslim regions .
The second has to do with the United States itself and the quality of our political culture [ which Obama has vowed to improve ] .
Letting Freeman 's comments pass unchallenged would undercut it . ”
In other words , Lane suggests that Freeman is the one responsible for the ugly personal attacks and that the poor neocons are the victims .
“ To be sure , Freeman and his supporters feel ill used , ” Lane acknowledged .
“ The criticism he faced was not 100 percent fair ; some of it went over the top in labeling him a pawn of the Saudis , etc .
But for the most part it was n't ‘ libelous , ’ as Freeman claims .
It was basically a strong policy reaction based on his own voluminous paper trail . ”
Lane then cites what he terms a “ strange ” speech by Freeman in 2006 in which the former ambassador labeled the Republican and Democratic parties as " xenophobic , Islamophobic , Arabophobic , and anti-immigrant " and also observed that the United States had become " the planet 's most despised nation , with its most hateful policies . "
However , in the real world , Freeman ’s observations in 2006 were largely correct .
Both parties were scurrying to burnish their “ anti-immigrant ” credentials and were endorsing or acquiescing to President George W. Bush ’s extreme rhetoric about the “ long war ” against Islamic militants .
As Pew and other opinion research organizations discovered , there was widespread global condemnation of Bush ’s policies , including his invasion / occupation of Iraq and his use of torture and other barbaric practices in the “ war on terror . ”
Lane continues : “ Even if Freeman had a perfectly legitimate grievance , even if he had been maligned , he would n't be entitled to respond in kind -- much less to brand large numbers of his fellow citizens as fifth columnists . ”
Remember that just the previous day , the Washington Post had run Wolf ’s op - ed linking Freeman to the Taliban protectors of Osama bin Laden and to the Darfur genocide .
Some of the neocon attacks on Freeman also had painted him as “ an agent of influence ” for Saudi Arabia and China , but Lane says Freeman does n’t have the right “ to respond in kind . ”
As totalitarian as the Post ’s editorial mindset seems to have become – a citizen can be pulverized by powerful interests , including Washington ’s dominant newspaper , but he must n’t dare defend himself or he will invite a new round of punishments – the Post 's behavior is part of a long - term pattern .
The Plame - gate Offense
The Post ’s war against Freeman was not an aberration .
Indeed , it parallels a similar campaign against another former U.S. ambassador , Joseph Wilson , who dared step forward in the spring - summer of 2003 to challenge President Bush ’s “ twisting ” of intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq .
While Wilson ’s complaint was directed at the Bush administration , his criticism also reflected negatively on the Post ’s editors whose coverage of the run-up to the Iraq invasion had all the diversity of opinion – and tolerance of dissent – that one might have expected from Izvestia and Pravda in the old Soviet Union .
The Post editors stacked their influential editorial section with notorious neocons like Charles Krauthammer and Robert Kagan , along with other Iraq War enthusiasts such as David Ignatius , Jim Hoagland , Michael Kelly and Richard Cohen .
So , in September 2002 , when former Vice President Al Gore objected to the rush to war , the Post let loose their columnists to distort and mock what Gore had said .
Kelly called Gore ’s speech “ dishonest , cheap , low ” before labeling it “ wretched .
It was vile .
It was contemptible . ”
Krauthammer added that the speech was “ a series of cheap shots strung together without logic or coherence . ”
There was no countervailing opinion published .
[ For details , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
After Secretary of State Colin Powell made his now - infamous presentation of the Iraq evidence to the United Nations on Feb. 5 , 2003 , the Post judged Powell ’s WMD case as “ irrefutable ” and added : “ it is hard to imagine how anyone could doubt that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction . ”
That judgment was reinforced by a solid phalanx of Post columnists , all hailing Powell ’s speech .
The Post ’s own editorials treated the Bush administration ’s false allegations about Iraq ’s stockpiles of WMD as indisputable fact and trashed even long - time American allies who dared disagree .
“ The [ Post ] editorials during December [ 2002 ] and January [ 2003 ] numbered nine , and all were hawkish , ” wrote Columbia University journalism professor Todd Gitlin .
“ This editorial mood continued into February , culminating in a blast at the French and Germans headlined ‘ Standing With Saddam . ’
Apparently it ’s not only George W. Bush who does n’t nuance . ”
[ American Prospect , April 1 , 2003 ]
After the U.S. “ preemptive ” invasion of Iraq and the failure to discover the imaginary WMD stockpiles , Post editorial - page editor Fred Hiatt was forced to make a rare and grudging apology .
Hiatt acknowledged that the Post should have been more skeptical .
“ If you look at the editorials we write running up [ to the war ] , we state as flat fact that he [ Hussein ] has weapons of mass destruction , ” Hiatt said in an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review .
“ If that ’s not true , it would have been better not to say it . ” [ CJR , March / April 2004 ]
No Accountability
Yet , at the Post and many other U.S. news organizations , there was no sense that accountability was in order when news organizations joined a neoconservative stampede , even one that contributed to the deaths of thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
Instead , Hiatt and his opinion pages continued to punish anyone – a politician or a citizen – who disagreed with the wisdom of Bush ’s Iraq War .
One of the Post ’s most troubling smear campaigns was directed against former Ambassador Wilson , who stepped forward in the months after the invasion as the first Washington Establishment figure to decry Bush ’s exaggeration of the threat from Iraq .
The history of what happened to Wilson -- a scandal known as “ Plame - gate ” -- is now well documented :
In 2003 , an arrogant administration sought to damage a critic , Wilson , who had offended Vice President Dick Cheney by accusing the White House of having " twisted " Iraq War intelligence .
The Cheney - led counterattack against Wilson sought to portray him as a boastful liar and involved leaking to reporters that Wilson ’s wife , Valerie Plame , worked at the CIA .
That disclosure was published ( in the Washington Post ) by right - wing columnist Robert Novak , destroying Plame ’s career as a covert intelligence officer and endangering the lives of her network of foreign agents .
Then , as the White House recognized the potential criminality – not to mention the political dangers – of its actions , a cover - up was launched , with Bush insisting that he knew nothing about the anti-Wilson campaign and his top aides lying to or dissembling in front of investigators .
One might have thought a newspaper upholding the Watergate legacy of Woodward and Bernstein would have jumped all over this disgraceful abuse of power by an imperial President and his vengeful entourage .
Instead , the Washington Post went after Joe Wilson .
Hiatt and his editorial page cohorts made trashing Wilson and mocking the seriousness of Plame ’s exposure almost a regular feature , recycling false White House talking points , including an attempt to question whether Plame was in fact “ covert . ”
The Post ’s editorial page , which had swallowed Bush ’s WMD lies hook , line and sinker in 2002 - 03 , apparently could n’t countenance someone who was right while so many super - smart Post editors and executives were wrong .
Endless Wilson Bashing
Even after Cheney ’s former chief of staff , Lewis Libby , was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for his Plame - gate role in March 2007 , Hiatt and his team were still bashing Wilson , declaring in one editorial that the ex-ambassador “ will be remembered as a blowhard . ”
In haughty tones – like the deprecating commentaries deriding former Ambassador Freeman – the Post wrote :
“ Mr. Wilson was embraced by many because he was early in publicly charging that the Bush administration had ‘ twisted , ’ if not invented , facts in making the case for war against Iraq .
He claimed to have debunked evidence that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger ; suggested that he had been dispatched by Mr. Cheney to look into the matter ; and alleged that his report had circulated at the highest levels of the administration .
“ A bipartisan investigation by the Senate intelligence committee subsequently established that all of these claims were false – and that Mr. Wilson was recommended for the Niger trip by Ms. Plame , his wife .
When this fact , along with Ms. Plame ’s name , was disclosed in a column by Robert D. Novak , Mr. Wilson advanced yet another sensational charge : that his wife was a covert CIA operative and that senior White House officials had orchestrated the leak of her name to destroy her career and thus punish Mr. Wilson . …
“ The [ Libby ] trial has provided convincing evidence that there was no conspiracy to punish Mr. Wilson by leaking Ms. Plame ’s identity – and no evidence that she was , in fact , covert . ”
[ Washington Post , March 7 , 2007 ]
But everything in this Post attack on Wilson was either a gross distortion or a lie , often parroting long - discredited White House talking points .
Wilson did debunk suspicions that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger .
He was dispatched by the CIA because of questions asked by Cheney .
( Wilson never said Cheney personally sent him . )
His information did reach the highest levels of the administration , explaining why the CIA kept trying to delete references to the Niger claims from Bush ’s speeches .
The full Senate Intelligence Committee did not conclude that “ all [ Wilson ’s ] claims were false . ”
That assertion was rejected by the full committee and then inserted into “ additional views ” of three right - wing Republicans – Sens .
Pat Roberts , Orrin Hatch and Christopher Bond – who carried the White House ’s water in claiming that Wilson ’s statements “ had no basis in fact . ”
As for the CIA selection of Wilson for the Niger trip , the Post editorial - page editors knew that Wilson was chosen by senior CIA officials in the office of counter - proliferation , not by Valerie Plame , who played only a minor introductory role in the agency ’s recruitment of her husband .
The Post also knew that Wilson was well qualified for the assignment since he had served as a diplomat in the U.S. embassies in Iraq and Niger .
He also took on this task pro bono , with the CIA only paying for his expenses .
Plus , Wilson was right again when he alleged that the White House was punishing him for his Iraq War criticism .
Indeed , the Washington Post ’s own reporters had described this reality in the news pages .
On Sept. 28 , 2003 , a Post news article reported that a White House official disclosed that the administration had informed at least six reporters about Plame and did so “ purely and simply out of revenge ” against Wilson .
“ Plame - gate ” special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald made the same point in a court filing in the Libby case , stating that his investigation had uncovered a “ concerted ” effort by the White House to “ discredit , punish or seek revenge against ” Wilson because of his criticism of the administration .
Hiatt and his editorial team could have looked up that fact .
It was on the Post 's front page .
[ Washington Post , April 9 , 2006 ]
The Post ’s ‘ Covert ’ Lie
Regarding Plame ’s covert status , the Post editors were lying there , too .
In the March 7 editorial , they apparently were still hanging their hats on false statements by right - wing lawyer Victoria Toensing , who had made a small cottage industry out of her assertion that Plame failed to meet the definition of “ covert ” in the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 , which Toensing said she had helped draft .
Toensing insisted that Plame was not “ covert ” because she had not been “ stationed ” abroad in the past five years , which Toensing claimed was the law ’s standard .
For instance , on Feb. 18 , 2007 , as jurors were about to begin deliberations in the Libby case , the Post editors gave Toensing space on the front page of the Post ’s influential Outlook section for a long article in which she insisted that Plame was not “ covert ” and published “ indictments ” of other figures in the scandal , including Wilson and Fitzgerald .
Toensing ’s claim about Plame ’s covert status was legalistic at best , since it obscured the larger point that Plame was working undercover in a classified CIA position and was running agents abroad whose safety would be put at risk by an unauthorized disclosure of Plame ’s identity .
But Toensing was n’t even right about the law .
It does n’t require that a CIA officer be “ stationed ” abroad in the preceding five years ; it simply refers to an officer who “ has served within the last five years outside the United States . ”
That would cover someone who – while based in the United States – went abroad on official CIA business , as Plame said she had done , according to her sworn testimony at a March 16 , 2007 , congressional hearing .
At that hearing of the House Oversight Committee , Chairman Henry Waxman also read a statement that had been approved by CIA Director Michael Hayden .
The statement described Plame ’s status at the CIA as “ covert , ” “ undercover ” and “ classified . ”
“ Ms. Wilson worked on the most sensitive and highly secretive matters handled by the CIA , ” Waxman ’s statement said , adding that her work dealt with “ prevention of development and use of WMD against the United States . ”
Toensing appeared as a Republican witness at the hearing and was asked about her bald assertion that “ Plame was not covert . ”
“ Not under the law , ” Toensing responded .
“ I ’m giving you the legal interpretation under the law and I helped draft the law .
The person is supposed to reside outside the United States . ”
But that ’s not what the law says , either .
It says “ served ” abroad , not “ reside . ”
When asked whether she had spoken to the CIA or to Plame about Plame ’s covert status , Toensing said , “ I did n’t talk to Ms. Plame or the CIA .
I can just tell you what ’s required under the law .
They can call anybody anything they want to do in the halls ” of the CIA .
In other words , Toensing had no idea about the facts of the matter ; she did n’t know how often Plame might have traveled abroad in the five years before her exposure ;
Toensing did n’t even get the language of the statute correct .
Nevertheless , Toensing was accepted as an expert by the Washington Post ’s editors to issue “ indictments ” of people – like former Ambassador Wilson and special prosecutor Fitzgerald – who had gotten in the way of Bush ’s imperial presidency .

A Sad Truth
The sad truth appears to be that the Washington Post can no longer be counted on to be anything like an honest broker , especially when it comes to issues near and dear to the hearts of neocons .
Rather the Post ’s role is now to set the parameters for whatever debate the neocons find acceptable .
A recent example of how the Post played this role was its decision to publish only pro-Israeli op - eds and editorials – sometimes two a day – during the first 11 days of the Gaza War , which killed more than 1,000 Palestinians including many children and other non-combatants .
On Jan. 2 , for instance , neocon ideologue Krauthammer wrote : “ Some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated .
The Israel - Gaza war is not .
It possesses a moral clarity not only rare but excruciating . ”
On the same day , Bush ’s former speechwriter ( now Post columnist ) Michael Gerson added , “ There is no question – none – that Israel ’s attack on Hamas in Gaza is justified . ”
So , as much of the world recoiled in horror at the ferocity of the Israeli attacks , the Post ’s neocon - dominated opinion section only heaped blame on Hamas for its firing of small rockets into southern Israeli territory .
It took 12 days into Israel ’s punishing assault on Gaza for the Washington Post to permit the first op - ed suggesting that there might be two sides to the dispute , an article by former President Jimmy Carter who presented both Israeli and Palestinian concerns .
In a column entitled “ An Unnecessary War , ” Carter noted that Israel had failed to live up to the goals of last year ’s truce agreement .
He also described the near - starvation of many of Gaza ’s 1.5 million inhabitants , cut off from the outside world by an Israeli blockade .
While Carter ’s column fit well within the mainstream of international opinion , it represented an anomaly in the opinion circles of Washington , appearing almost like a fringe viewpoint after a steady diet of neocon propaganda , especially in the Post ’s editorial section .
Looking back over the Post ’s recent history , I ’m also reminded of my experience at the Post - owned Newsweek magazine in the late 1980s .
I had been hired because of my early work exposing what became known as the Iran - Contra Affair .
Newsweek – like the Post – had bought into the earlier false denials of the Reagan administration .
I thought maybe Newsweek sincerely wanted to catch up on possibly the most important scandal story of the decade .
But I soon encountered what I considered troubling neocon trends at the magazine , particularly an elitist view about the need to steer the public in a direction favored by the Establishment , rather than to trust in the people ’s well - informed democratic judgment .
When I spoke once with Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas about what I considered the importance of giving unvarnished information to the American people so they could make up their own minds , he upbraided me with an admonition that at Newsweek our purpose was less to inform the readers than to guide them to the proper conclusions .
Over the ensuing two decades , that elitist attitude , a core feature of neoconservative ideology , appears to have spread throughout the Washington Post company .
It influences the tone of the news pages [ see , for instance , “ WPost Admits Bungling Obama Quote ” or “ Obama ’s War with the Right ( & Media ) ” ] , but it pervades the editorial section .
Rather than encouraging as free and open debate as possible , the Post now sees its role as herding the American people to certain preordained conclusions – and casting out from acceptable society anyone who dares threaten the Washington consensus .

We 've been tracking the Conficker worm since it launched itself into the wild last November ; despite the best efforts of security officials worldwide , the worm still has n't been completely crushed .
The original flavor and its nastier follow - up ( Conficker . A and Conficker .B ) have been locked down , but the worm 's creators have a third version ( Conficker . C , naturally ) prepared to hit the tubes come April 1 .
The new " C " twist wo n't have all of the tools " B " used to replicate , but it will be able to detect and kill certain system processes designed to find and remove it .
Ars spoke with Don DeBolt , CA 's Director of Threat Research , to get some additional information on Conficker .C , its threat profile , and why the gosh - darned thing is n't dead yet .
CA ( formerly Computer Associates ) has published an extensive guide to Conficker .C , which includes information on its attack vectors , behavioral analysis , and how to tell if the " C " variant of Conficker is running on your system .
This last part could pose a challenge — unlike previous versions , C adopts what DeBolt refers to as a " defensive stance " and throws up a number of roadblocks , all of which are aimed at hindering user detection of the worm .
The security industry was collectively able to put the brakes on Conficker .
B's expansion when they managed to reverse - engineer the virus and determine which domains it would attempt to register and dial home to on particular dates .
With Conficker .
A and B , the worm chose to contact 32 addresses out of a possible 250 on any given attempt .
With their algorithm broken , the malware authors went a step beyond updating their randomization / selection code — they also vastly increased both the number of domains the worm could generate as well as the number it will randomly select .
Conficker .
C will select 500 domains out of a randomized pool of 50,000 instead of the previous 32/250 .
This will drive up the cost of operating the botnet ( we 've previously covered how vulnerable malware networks can be to changes in their cost structure ) but will also significantly increase the cost of attempting to monitor and prevent botnet registrations , even once the randomizing algorithm has been broken .
Once installed , Conficker .
C implements a variety of nasty behaviors .
The worm will attempt to disable Windows Automatic Update and stop access to the Windows Security Center , can detect and kill SysInternals ' Process Explorer program , and will interfere with the operation of a number of other search - and - destroy programs including WireShark and SysClean .
It will also reset and delete system restore points , disable various services ( including WinDefend , BITS ( Background Intelligent Transfer Service ) ERSvc ( Error Reporting Service ) and WerSvc ( Windows Error Reporting Service , Vista - only ) .
In a final fit of pique , Conficker .
C will prevent any attempt to connect to a variety of antivirus software services or websites .
This behavior is nothing new to malware in general , but it 's the first time we 've seen it from our Conf ( l ) ickt - causing little friend .
The security industry 's battle against Conficker is unlikely to resolve this go - round — we'll probably see at least a " D " variant before this is done — but DeBolt believes the coordinated response and organized counter - attack from Team White Hat has dramatically retarded the virus ' ability to infect new systems .
In the meantime , Romanian researchers from BitDefender have released a tool that should remove Conficker , though it 's not clear if this will clean versions A , B , and C , or just the first two .

Street protests in Iran are important but are themselves not enough to force change .
The supreme leader will not be swayed because he considers himself accountable to God , not to the people .
Indeed , even the Islamic Republic 's clerical establishment is irrelevant in this calculus .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's invocation of folk religion -- his appeals to the messianic Hidden Imam , for example -- is a way to bypass senior religious figures who , according to Shiite theology , will be among the greatest obstacles to the Hidden Imam 's return .
Nor does the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , pay too much heed to his fellow clerics in Qom .
They have always refused to bestow on Khamenei a level of religious legitimacy to match his ambition .
Today , the majority of Iran 's grand ayatollahs oppose the concept of theological rule .
Not by coincidence , the majority are now in prison or under house arrest .
Khamenei can weather the public 's disdain so long as the Revolutionary Guard serves as his Praetorian Guard .
Khomeini , the Islamic Republic 's founder , formed the Revolutionary Guard to defend his revolutionary vision .
It is more powerful than the army and answers only to the supreme leader .
That the Islamic Republic has lost legitimacy in the eyes of the Iranian public is now evident to the outside world , but it is not news to the regime .
In September 2007 , Mohammad Ali Jafari , the new Revolutionary Guard chief , reconfigured the force into 31 units -- one for each province and two for Tehran -- on the theory that a velvet revolution posed a greater threat to regime security than any external enemy .
Guardsmen are not stationed in their home cities so that they do not hesitate to fire on crowds that might include family and friends .
In the public mind , the Islamic revolution 30 years ago looms large .
The regime is not aloof to this .
It understands the shah 's mistakes and is determined not to repeat them .
Next month marks the 10th anniversary of the student uprising , which erupted after the security forces attacked a student dormitory .
Their brutality shocked the Iranian public , and demonstrations spread throughout the country .
For a few days , regime survival was also subject to speculation .
In the aftermath of the protests , the Chinese government supplied security consultants to Tehran .
Rather than bash heads and risk protests and endless cycles of mourning , Iranian security services began photographing demonstrations , after which they would arrest participants over the course of a month when they were alone and could not spark mob reaction .
With the assistance of European businessmen , the Iranian government upgraded its surveillance of communication ( and the Internet ) .
Ultimately , the theocracy will fall only if servicemen in the Revolutionary Guard switch sides .
There will be compromise .
The end will come only over Khamenei 's dead body .
Certainly , Iran today is a tinderbox .
The question is whether the regime is better at putting out fires than demonstrators are at starting them .
Two years ago a science teacher from a high school in Oregon called Greg Craven became a web phenomenon when he posted a video on YouTube entitled The Most Terrifying Video You 'll Ever See .
In the video , which has now been viewed more than 7 m times , Craven sets out his take on why — from which ever angle you look at it — we must act to tackle climate change .
His common sense approach to the problem was that a basic understanding of risk assessment suggests that we'd be pretty dumb not to spend some effort and cash now trying to avert the worst of the predicted climate change scenarios .
In summary , he 's arguing for a " better safe than sorry " approach to climate change .
Needless to say , the popularity of the video — and the follow - ups Craven posted on his YouTube homepage in the following months — irked the usual suspects and a trail of debate has followed Craven ever since .
But now he 's back with a new video that is a not so subtle plug for his book What 's the Worst That Could Happen ?
A Rational Response to the Climate Change Debate .
He 's says he 's written the book to help him pay for the " Red Bull bill " he 's wracked up over the past two years trying to debate with people responding to his videos .
I suspect that he 's only half - joking .
" This book is my best effort to answer the question that has us all deadlocked in this debate over global warming : " When faced with contradictory statements from experts on a crucial issue , just what the heck is the over - busy lay person supposed to do ? ? "
And I think I managed to do it in a fair manner .
In fact , the main criticism I got from both sides was — I went too easy on the other side !
How 's that for striking the middle ground ?
NO ONE likes me . "
Craven says his dream is to try to get the book to sell out its first print run of 15,000 copies before its official release date on July 7 .
Judging by how quickly his call - out has gone viral — he only sent out his rallying email to friends , family and fans yesterday afternoon — he may well succeed .
June 8 , 2009
Damage from Zuni rockets ( possibly US made ) fired from unmarked Israeli Jets .
The machine gun damage probably came from the Israeli torpedo boats later .
This attack came out of the blue after apparently friendly Israeli reconnaissance overflights � which would definitely have seen the large US flag and hull markings .
A Photographic Essay of Israel�s Treachery The USS Liberty , June 8 , 1967 Israeli Mystere Jet ( French made ) lacking national insignia ( a war crime ) , during one of the strafing runs and photographed by Captain McGonagle with a 35 mm camera kept on bridge .
The crew had no idea just who was attacking them until the torpedo boats showed up .
Photograph taken during high - speed turn to evade Israeli torpedo boat attack .
One of the 3 Israeli torpedo boats .
These boats actually machine - gunned the deployed lifeboats from the ship ( a war crime ) .
One took aboard a shot - up inflatable raft , probably as a souvenir .
Israeli helicopter , possibly with a commando boarding party , circles stricken ship before being called off by home base .
It appeared to be looking for a place to set down on the ship and crew members described seeing armed , helmeted soldiers ready to disembark .
Were they planning on gunning down the crew at close quarters and sinking the ship with explosives ?
Marked for death : Dazed , but lucky survivors shortly after the attack .
Many are covered in blood from their shipmates .
In this stark color photo , Napalm ( to burn alive the bridge crew ) , Zuni rockets , machine gun and cannon fire damage is easily seen .
The Israeli�s first attack priority was on the communications antennas and bridge � to stop any revealing maydays .
Only by the crewman using a jury - rigged spare antenna , managed to save the entire crew from a watery grave � the Israelis must have intercepted their calls for help to the US Sixth fleet and , once realizing the jig was up , called off the rest of the attack .
A US helicopter from the Sixth Fleet comes to give aid long after attackers had left .
The Liberty limps under her own power 14 hours after .
When attacked , the ship was in international waters , 14 miles off the coast of Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai .
Arrival at port in Malta ( when it should have been ordered to the much closer Crete ) .
The Israelis could not sink her , but they sure tried .
The only real question left :
Were they the only ones trying ?
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara with President Johnson .
They called off supporting US planes * from the US Sixth fleet and Johnson is said to have known they were Israelis before the crew even did .
McNamara�s memory of the day remained " foggy " and dismissive to the end .
Reports from officers on board the USS Saratoga say that planes took off for Egypt , carrying nukes for a preplanned attack , but were soon recalled when it was found out the ship still floated and that sailors had survived .
Back in the port , the crew were threatened to stay silent about it all , with John McCaine�s admiral father heading a phoney investigation .
The US government has covered up much about all this , even 42 years after .
One Texas clown was President for a false - flag attack on the US in 1967 and another Texas clown was President in 2001 .
Think about it !
Torpedo ( probably US made ) damage from Israeli torpedo boats .
Looks a lot like what happened to the USS Cole after a terrorist attack in Yemen that killed 17 US sailors .
The USS Liberty lost 25 sailors and communications analysts from this torpedo explosion alone and only by fluke did the ship not break apart and sink .
No Hebrew translators were on board .
34 lives were lost in total and about 174 wounded , some terribly .
" The ground control station stated that the target was American and for the aircraft to confirm it , " Forslund recalled .
" The aircraft did confirm the identity of the target as American , by the American flag .
" The ground control station ordered the aircraft to attack and sink the target and ensure they left no survivors . "
Forslund said he clearly recalled " the obvious frustration of the controller over the inability of the pilots to sink the target quickly and completely . "
" He kept insisting the mission had to sink the target , and was frustrated with the pilots � responses that it didn�t sink . "
Read the Chicago Tribune Article on the evidence of Israeli duplicity .
Ask yourself these things :
If this was a mistake by Israel , like they still try to say , then why would they spray paint out the insignia on their attacking Jets and launch 3 different kinds of attacks on her ?
All trying to sink her and kill the 300 man crew .
And why would Johnson and McNamara call off US Jets on their way to help ?
My blog posting on this : A Treacherous False Flag Attack Foiled by Fate " People may dismiss what I say as the rantings of an angry old man , but given what is taking place today regarding the war in the Middle East and everything that may happen , my suggestion is that �while there is time �people turn off the Britney Spears , the Desperate Housewives and the football games and listen , listen carefully to what happened , as it is likely to happen again , because , as the old saying goes , ' a leopard does not change its spots . � " -� Phil Tourney , A Survivor�s Blog ( excellent ) here at WordPress
The tragedy though ( and certainly the part hardest to swallow by patriotic Americans who would just as soon take their own lives as betray their fellow countrymen ) is that there have been and are players on the American side of the equation whose hands are just as dirty as those of their Israeli counterparts Mark Glenn American Free Press ' These rats , � he said , referring to Israel and her defenders .
' They lie about everything .
You can�t believe a word they say� he told AFP .
Insider Tells the Truth about Attack Excellent blog synopsis of this event : Slow Decline blog posting * Sometimes the excuse is given that the planes happened to be carrying nuclear weapons ( which actually leads to even more inconvenient questions ) and could not respond so equipped , but how many other planes on hand could have been vectored easily to the scene with conventional armaments ?
This shows you just one of the many lies of our government in covering all this up .
Fresh off reports that Steve Jobs received a liver transplant a few months ago , Joe Wilcox wrote a piece trying to articulate why “ Steve Jobs ’ return is still vaporware . ”
In other words , Wilcox believes that the source for the Wall Street Journal ’s scoop came from inside Apple ( fair enough ) as a means to manipulate Apple ’s stock price because Steve Jobs will never return to Apple as a full - time CEO and Apple knows it ( say what now ? ! )
Apple is once again up to its media manipulation tactics , or so I allege .
Surely I ca n’t be the only person seeing just how transparent was yesterday ’s Wall Street Journal Steve Jobs liver transplant story .
The timing , on day of iPhone 3GS launch , helps protect Apple ’s share price and deemphasize an important fact :
Steve is n’t really coming back this month .
How does the news of Jobs ’ liver transplant protect Apple ’s share price ?
The iPhone 3G S launch was extremely successful , and the device itself has received overwhelmingly positive reviews .
The stock price hardly needs protecting , and even if that were the case , a liver transplant “ manipulation tactic ” probably is n’t the best avenue to achieve that goal .
Once again , I challenge Yikari and Joann to dispute my assertion that their main source was from inside Apple and most likely someone in corporate communications .
Of course , to protect their sources and source of future Apple leaks , the reporters can make no defense .
But WSJ will get lots of page views and inbound links from the leaked story .
Maybe I ’m missing something here , but why does it matter if Apple was the source of the story ?
Also , it ’s downright laughable that a site like the WSJ , which requires paid subscriptions in order to view articles in their entirety , would use this as a means to generate page views and inbound links .
Seriously .
First , there is the bombshell — the kind that sends a company ’s stock free - falling : Steve Jobs had a liver transplant about two months ago .
The information confirms , at last , that Apple ’s CEO was way sicker than previously revealed .
Wilcox is already contradicting himself .
First he asserts that the story was purposefully sourced by Apple to protect its stock price , then claims just 2 paragraphs later that news of a CEO undergoing a liver transplant would typically send a company ’s stock price into a free - fall .
The original WSJ article noted that Jobs ’ return to Apple might be more of a gradual process , and that COO Tim Cook might remain on as acting CEO for a while longer until Jobs regains his full strength .
Wilcox theorizes that this might simply be a set - up to ease us into accepting the fact that Jobs might never return as Apple ’s 100 % in - charge CEO .
I tend to disagree with that assessment , but it ’s a valid argument .
But right after making sense for the first time , Wilcox goes right off the deep end .
Wilcox goes on to write that the release of the iPhone 3G S was pushed up a month to coincide with news of Jobs ’ liver transplant .
The “ logic ” goes that Apple wanted to balance news of Jobs ’ surgery with a high - profile phone release .
I say the iPhone 3GS distraction goes even further , with Apple using the launch to blunt the severity of really bad news :
The CEO was sicker than revealed , he recently had major life - saving surgery and he really is n’t ready to return to his duties .
What a joke !
Apple is the last company on earth that would manipulate key launch dates on its product roadmap as a means to artificially keep its stock price afloat .
If anything , Apple has been criticized for not taking its investors into consideration vis a vis how they typically handle the dissemination of information regarding Jobs ’ health .
The executives at Apple are n’t day - traders .
They ’re not worried about day to day or week to week fluctuations in Apple ’s stock price .
On the day when every blog or news organization is covering the iPhone 3GS launch , Apple drops the public company equivalent of an atomic bomb .
Buzz about iPhone 3GS will obscure much of the fallout .
Come Monday , Apple will release data on number of iPhones shipped , quite likely mixed iPhone 3G and GS numbers together , which will inflate overall sales figures .
Actually , news of Jobs ’ procedure has had the opposite effect and has somewhat obscured coverage of the impressive new iPhone 3G S.
If the liver transplant story is as much of an atom bomb as Wilcox claims , then what makes him think that the iPhone 3G S would do anything to divert significant attention away from that ?
I assert that this has all been carefully orchestrated by Apple to sugarcoat the very bad news about the CEO ’s health and to diminish the medicine ’s most bitter taste — that he ’s not really returning to work later this month and may never again assume the duties of full - time chief executive .
Well , I guess we ’ll have to wait and see what capacity Steve Jobs will assume when he returns to Apple .
I personally think he ’ll eventually return as a full - time CEO , but might decide to lower his public profile a bit as it pertains to making keynotes on a regular basis at special Apple events .
Ultimately , mitigating bad news is about one thing : Protecting , some people might argue manipulating , Apple ’s share price .
As I write this , Apple ’s stock price is up in after - hours trading to $ 139.83 .
Shareholders are giddy about iPhone 3GS .
Apple ’s strategy is working .
Oh yes , the evil masterminds at Apple have cunningly used the media to its advantage to manipulate Apple ’s stock price .
And Apple ’s stock price is up in after - hours trading ?!
Wow !
The strategy is working brilliantly !
What happens to Wilcox ’s theory when Apple ’s stock price is down on Monday morning ?
What kind of bullshit strategy would that have been — to artificially keep Apple ’s stock price high for one day ?
Maybe news of the iPhone 3G S is preventing Apple from trading down 5 points as opposed to 2 .
Does Wilcox honestly think Apple cares about its short term stock price enough to engage in what Wilcox refers to as “ market manipulation ” ?
Wilcox claims in his byline that he ’s particularly knowledgeable about Apple .
After reading his most recent article , I respectfully disagree .
But I am asserting that today ’s news about his imminent return is really vaporware . ”
I now do assert that he ’s not returning as CEO , certainly not full time at the end of June and likely not full time ever .
News of his return is even more vaporware now that it was two weeks ago .
I guess we ’ll see who ’s full of it ( me or Wilcox ) in just a few weeks .
Lastly , a few more reasons why Wilcox ’s theories are BS .
For one thing , Apple has consistently maintained that Jobs will return to his position as Apple CEO at the end of June , so I ’ll go ahead and take their word for it .
Second , with Jobs ’ impending return to Apple now less than 10 days away , are n’t we bound to see stories about his health pop up more frequently than we did over the past few months ?
That being the case , the timing of the WSJ story might not be as suspicious as Wilcox makes it out to be .
And lastly , seeing as how Jobs is only 2 months out from a liver transplant , who ’s to say if Jobs will or wo n’t make a full 100 % recovery ?
It ’s clearly too soon to make that prediction , so why would Apple pre-maturely conclude that Jobs wo n’t return as CEO , and subsequently source a news story to the WSJ to purposefully manipulate its stock price .

Frankreich schützt Kommunikationsfreiheit : Internetsperre für Raubkopierer gekippt
Frankreichs oberste Verfassungshüter haben die umstrittene Internetsperre für Raubkopierer gekippt .
Die Strafe widerspreche der in den Menschenrechten festgegten Kommunikationsfreiheit .
PARIS ap |
Der französische Verfassungsrat hat ein Gesetz für rechtswidrig erklärt , das Raubkopierer vom Internet aussperrt .
Das im Mai verabschiedete Gesetz verstoße gegen die Erklärung der Menschen - und Bürgerrechte von 1789 , befanden die Verfassungshüter am Mittwochabend in Paris .
Gleichwohl kündigte die Regierung an , sie wolle an dem umstrittenen Gesetz festhalten .
Das erst im zweiten Anlauf von der Nationalversammlung verabschiedete Gesetz führt eine neue Behörde ein , die Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Oeuvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet , kurz Hadopi genannt .
Wer illegal urheberrechtlich geschützte Musik oder Filme im Internet herunterlädt , soll von dieser Behörde zunächst mit zwei E - Mails , dann per Einschreiben verwarnt werden .
Danach kann die Behörde nach dem bisherigen Gesetzestext Netzsperren für die Dauer von zwei Monate bis zu einem Jahr verhängen .
Der Verfassungsrat urteilte , dies sei eine so schwerwiegende Sanktion , dass sie nicht von einer Behörde , sondern allenfalls von einem Richter verhängt werden könne .
Das Internet habe eine so hohe " Bedeutung für die Mitwirkung am demokratischen Leben und der Äußerung von Ideen und Meinungen " , dass eine Netzsperre einen Verstoß gegen Artikel 11 der Menschenrechtserklärung von 1789 darstelle .
Kulturministerin Christine Albanel kündigte nach dem Spruch der " Verfassungsweisen " an , dass sie Staatspräsident Nicolas Sarkozy und Premierminister François Fillon vorschlagen werde , das Gesetz entsprechend zu gestalten , dass die vorgesehene Strafe von einem Richter verhängt werden könne .
Während die Sozialistische Partei den Spruch des Verfassungsrats als Bestätigung für ihre Kritik an dem Gesetz werteten , sagte Franck Riester von der konservativen Regierungspartei UMP , dies ändere nichts an der eigentlichen Zielrichtung des Gesetzes .
" Die Warn - E - Mails werden von Hadopi verschickt .
Die letzte Entscheidung wird dann einfach von einem Richter ausgesprochen . "

At school we were taught never to start sentences with “ And ” .
And yet newspaper journalists are trained to start a sentence with and .
I do it all the time .
Not starting a sentence with And is one of the first so - called rules professional writers learn to break .
There ’s nothing wrong with using “ And ” to begin a sentence or a paragraph .
It is a great way to smooth the flow when you have a series of short sentences that would otherwise be too staccato for comfortable reading .
Go ahead , start a sentence with and
Only break this rule in moderation .
Overusing “ And ” at the start of sentences quickly becomes boring .
As Keith Waterhouse points out in the excellent Daily Mirror Style , too many sentences starting with the word means your writing reads like the New English Bible .
I aim for only one “ And ” sentence start in a short piece of 300 words .
For longer stories , you can get away with using it a few times – about once every 3-500 words .
Control any urge to sprinkle sentences starting with “ And ” through your copy .
Other conjunctions
The school rule did n’t just apply to “ And ” , starting sentences with other conjunctions was also forbidden .
As an aside , conjunctions are ‘ joining ’ words used to string phrases together – usually , but not always , to build more complex sentences .
There are plenty of alternative conjunctions to call on at the start of your sentences :
“ But ” is a great way to start a sentence that disagrees with the previous one .
“ Yet ” is a less - frequently used alternative .
“ Or ” is a great word for helping text flow .
Some people do n’t like sentences to start with “ However ” .
I would regard that as another rule worth breaking .
“ Although ” is a possibility .
In practice , it can be better to shorten the word to “ Though ” at the start of a sentence .

The rape lies that ruined our lives :
Taxi driver and his wife reveal the devastating cost of a drunk teenager who cried rape
There was never a moment when Sue Bishop believed her husband Clive was capable of rape .
Not when five police officers turned up on her doorstep in the middle of the night , hammering on the door and then arresting part - time taxi driver Clive on suspicion of rape .
Not even when they carted him off to Yeovil Police Station in Somerset and put him in a cell .
When she collected him the following day , Sue simply threw her arms around his neck and sobbed .
Falsely accused : Sue and Clive Bishop are still struggling to get on with their lives following allegations of rape
' I did n't doubt him for a minute , ' she says .
' I just knew it was n't in his nature .
It was n't possible that it was true . '
This week , more than two years after their nightmare began when her husband was falsely accused of rape by a drunken teenage passenger , Clive made legal history when he won the right to apply for compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority .
The 50 - year - old , who works for Somerset County Council caring for vulnerable adults , had previously been turned down on the grounds that he had not suffered physical injuries as a result of the false claim .
Kirsty Palmer , the mother - of - two who made up the rape allegation , was given a ten - month prison sentence as a result of her crime .
But as Clive and Sue 's account of the past two years makes clear , the emotional and mental legacy of what happened to him in the hours and days after his wrongful arrest runs as deep as any physical scar .
' It 's taken over our lives , ' says 48 - year - old Sue , who works as a carer .
Both she and Clive also foster young adults and help them make the transition from the care system to self - sufficiency .
The girl who cried rape : Kirsty Palmer accused Clive of assaulting her as he dropped her home in his taxi
She adds : ' We have lived with this for so long now .
I 've seen Clive go from a laid - back person to being constantly anxious about everything . '
In effect , says Clive , who lost his taxi business as a result of the rape allegation , Palmer 's actions amounted to an act of violence against him .
' I am physically and mentally drained .
It has taken everything out of me , ' he says .
' It 's not about money .
It 's about moral justice , and recognising that when women lie like this , men suffer horrendously .
' I feel as if I 've been raped of my dignity and my self - confidence .
That night , my choices in life were taken away from me and I 've been struggling ever since .
I 've had to fight for everything .
' I wish I could turn back the clock and have my life back as it was before .
But that can never happen .
This has caused so much distress and hurt and pain .
Things can never be the same .'
Looking back on the events of the past two years , the couple from Walton in Somerset , both of whom have been married previously , still find it hard to believe how their lives were so suddenly turned upside down .
It happened , quite literally , overnight .
Sue still recalls the terror of being woken up at 4.30 am on February 25 , 2007 , by the sound of someone banging on the door of their three - bedroom semi- detached home .
' I was in a deep sleep , ' she says .
' It was very frightening .
I looked out of the window and there were two police cars and a riot van , and five policemen .
' I thought something terrible had happened to one of Clive 's children , but I could n't understand why so many policemen had come . '
When she first heard the word ' rape ' ,
Sue 's first reaction was a split - second moment of relief that nothing terrible had happened to anyone in the family .
' Then , ' she says , ' I thought " What did he say ? " I could n't take it in .
My mind was spinning .
I felt as if I could n't breathe . '
Clive , who went downstairs to open the door , adds : ' I thought it was bad news and that something had happened to one of the young adults we'd been looking after , or to my son or daughter .
' Then I noticed one of the policemen was wearing blue surgical gloves .
When he said he was arresting me on suspicion of rape , I said : " That 's absolute rubbish . "
I was totally shocked and stunned .
' In the car on the way to the police station , I kept saying : " I have n't done anything wrong " and the police kept telling me to " Shut up " .
I thought you were meant to be innocent until proven guilty , but that 's not how I was treated . '
' At no point did I touch her .
She did not even pay me because her friend had already done it , so we 'd never even come into contact '
Placed in a police cell for several hours , Clive was photographed and fingerprinted before undergoing a series of humiliating medical examinations .
In the early morning , a female doctor swabbed his mouth , his penis and the backs and palms of his hands .
He was asked to provide a 20 ml sample of spit , and scrapings and clippings from each fingernail , as well as hair samples from his head and groin .
' It was degrading and humiliating , ' recalls Clive .
' I felt numb .
I still did n't even know who it was or what she was claiming . '
Later that afternoon , the police finally began questioning him and it quickly became clear that there was no case against him .
The rape allegation had been made by 17 - year - old Kirsty Palmer , a passenger he had picked up in his taxi the previous night .
' I asked them what she had actually accused me of , ' he recalls .
She 'd said she 'd been taken to a remote lane and raped by a man who was black , Asian or possibly heavily tanned - which , as a white man without a tan , clearly was n't me .
' The duty solicitor nearly fell off his chair .
He could n't comprehend why I was there .'
But Clive remembered Kirsty Palmer clearly .
He 'd begun work at 7 pm on Saturday , February 24 .
He collected Palmer and a friend at 9.45 pm and took them to a nightclub .
At 1 am , he received a call from Palmer 's friend asking him to pick Palmer up and take her home .

At first he refused because he had another booking .
But after the friend begged him , he agreed on condition that he took her home immediately so he would have time to get back for the other booking .
' When I arrived , Palmer was very drunk and had already been sick , ' says Clive .
He insisted that her friend paid him before the start of the journey , then Palmer sat in the front with a carrier bag .
' I told her that if she was going to be sick , to be sick in the bag , ' says Clive .
' At no point did I touch her .
She did not even pay me because her friend had already done it , so we 'd never even come into contact . '
He dropped Palmer outside her home and made sure she reached her front door , then he returned for his final booking and went home to bed .
It emerged that when Palmer got to her door , she found she was locked out .
At that point , she made her way to a neighbour 's house and , for whatever reason , claimed she had been raped .
Hours later , Clive was arrested .
After 12 hours in police custody , he was released , but only after he'd been placed on police bail and told to return to the police station in six weeks ' time .
During that time , there was no possibility of life returning to normal .
Clive 's red Nissan Primera was seized by the police , making it impossible for him to work .
' Even though I knew I was innocent , it felt as if the police did n't believe me .
Sue and I agreed that we would n't tell anyone .
We did n't want to upset our parents or our children , and we did n't want it to get out .
We live in a small community and I was afraid of the backlash . '
Sue adds : ' Keeping it to ourselves meant that we had no one to talk to except each other .
It was all we talked about .
We went over and over it .
My mum said I looked ill , but I did n't want to burden her with it , so I kept it hidden .
It was terrible for both of us , but worse for Clive . '
Daily struggle : Clive and Sue say they will try and move on with their lives but it will never be the same again
Then , two days before he was due to report back to Yeovil police station , Clive received a phone call from his solicitor .
' He said not to bother turning up because no action was being taken against me , ' recalls Clive .
' It was like being stabbed through the heart , to think that they could just leave it like that .'
He wrote a letter of complaint to the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police .
' I said that if they could send five officers to my house at 4.30 am , why could n't they send a single officer to tell me that they 'd found what I was saying was true , and that no further action would be taken against me .
' In the end , they sent someone to my house to apologise , but I wanted it in writing as well .
I wanted a letter exonerating me .'
But even when he got that , life for Clive did not return to normal .
' When I got my car back , I tried to go out taxiing again , but I was a nervous wreck .
One of my passengers was another drunk girl .
I just dropped her off and drove straight home .
I told Sue : " I ca n't do this any more . "
I had to get rid of the car . '
Clive also feared - wrongly - that the accusation against him might affect the Enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check , a procedure he undergoes at regular periods because of the nature of his work fostering vulnerable adults .
In the end , after seeing his GP , he underwent counselling to help him cope with the stress he was suffering .
He took up running to help work out his emotions and last year raised many hundreds of pounds for the cancer charity CLIC Sargent by completing the Glastonbury 10 km race .
In April last year , mother - of - two Palmer pleaded guilty to the false rape allegation and was jailed for ten months at Bristol Crown Court .
Sue says : ' When I first saw her in court , I did n't know how to feel .
Part of me wanted to slap her face .
But I just tried to keep myself together and to stop myself crying .
' As time went on , I found my emotions were very mixed .
I was glad that she was jailed at first , but then I thought about her two babies being left behind .
I felt awful .
As if we were responsible for causing that .
But , of course , she was responsible .
She 'd put herself there , not us . '
Clive recalls how , during an earlier committal hearing , Palmer and her boyfriend and baby stepped into the lift that he and Sue were in .
' She did n't have a clue who I was , but I knew who she was .
She was laughing and joking .
It made me feel sick . '
Even seeing his accuser jailed did not compensate for what Clive had suffered .
' The mental scars run deep , ' he says .
' I 'm a very nervous person now .
Very anxious and stressed .
' I do n't like being alone with women I do n't know , which makes my job very hard .
I 'm very conscious of what I say and how I act .
I 'm very aware of my surroundings all the time .
I can't get what happened out of my head . '
' Women who make up stories like these should be put on the sex offenders ' register .
Lies like these ruin people 's lives '
The publicity surrounding the court action against Palmer also forced the couple to tell their family and friends what had happened .
' It all came into the open , ' says Clive .
' I had to drive round to my parents , who are in their 70s , and my children , and explain what this girl had done .
They were heart - broken .
But everyone has been incredibly supportive towards me .'
For both Clive and Sue then , the decision by a Taunton tribunal last week that he was eligible to apply for compensation is hugely symbolic .
' Finally , it makes clear all the distress I have suffered , ' he says .
' It had to be acknowledged .
' I understand that rape is a horrendous crime for anyone to suffer , but there has to be balance .
You can't have a one - sided system .
' And when it 's clear that someone has been wrongly accused , someone - should say : " Sorry for what you have been through . "
' Women who make up stories like these should be put on the sex offenders ' register .
Lies like these ruin people 's lives . '
Clive still has no idea why Palmer made up her story - ' And I do n't want to know , ' he says .
His battle for justice is not yet over .
While he has been given leave to apply for compensation , it may take up to five years for an amount to actually be granted .
In the meantime , he has also won damages from a County Court judgment against Palmer for ' malicious falsehood ' .
When the teenager initially failed to pay the damages awarded to Clive , the case returned to court last month .
He does n't want to say how much he has been awarded , only that it barely scratches the surface of the earnings he has lost from his taxi business , and that Palmer , who is on benefits , has agreed to pay him a small amount each month .
He spoke to her for the first time on the steps outside the court .
' It was so strange , ' he recalls .
' I was about a foot and a half from her .
I said : " Do you know that you have never once apologised to me or my wife ? "
' She said : " I 'm so , so sorry .
If I could turn back the clock , I would .
I did n't realise all this was going to happen . " '
In the end , it 's hard to get away from the irony of it all : that Clive and Sue , who have spent the past eight years caring for disadvantaged teenagers like Kirsty Palmer , should have suffered like this .
Clive looks at it like this : ' She 's done a very stupid thing .
She has done a great disservice to women .
' But she 's served her time .
And now she 's apologised .
I just hope now that she can give a good life to her children and bring them up properly .
' She needs to get on with her life , and somehow I need to get on with mine . '
Technology.am ( May 25 , 2009 ) — Sony Ericsson has filed a patent for a system through which a cellphone could be controlled by facial expressions , shuffling between music tracks according to visual mood analysis .
The patent , titled “ Generating music playlist based on facial expression ” , describes capturing an image of a user and using facial recognition to build a custom playlist depending on the listener ’s mood .
The method includes playing a first song on a device , capturing an image of a user , performing facial expression recognition of the user based on the image , and selecting a second song based on a facial expression of the user .
The company suggests the brief video could be captured , tracking emotional states of happiness , sadness , surprise , anger , fear , disgust , neutrality , etc .
California medical marijuana grower , spiritualist , and activist Eddy Lepp was sentenced Monday to a mandatory minimum 10 - year prison sentence on federal marijuana cultivation charges in a case where he grew more than 20,000 pot plants in plain view of a state highway in Northern California 's Lake County .
US District Court Judge Marilyn Patel also sentenced him to five years probation .
He must report to federal authorities by July 6 .
Eddy Lepp ( courtesy cannabisculture.com )
Lepp contended that the plants were a medical marijuana grow for members of the Multi Denominational Ministry of Cannabis and Rastafari and legal under California law .
But during his trial , he was not allowed to introduce medical marijuana or religious defenses .
He was found guilty of conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute more than 1,000 pot plants and of cultivating more than 1,000 plants , which carries a maximum life sentence .
According to California NORML ( CANORML ) and the Santa Rosa Press - Democrat , there were gasps and sobs from Lepp supporters in the courtroom as Patel passed sentence .
The sentence was " extreme , " Patel conceded , but said her hands were tied by federal law .
In a nod toward the current turmoil over the status of federal prosecutions of medical marijuana providers , Judge Patel said Lepp could apply for a rehearing if the laws changed .
Lepp and his attorneys plan to appeal the verdict and the sentence .
Lepp attorney Michael Hall told Patel the sentence was " incredible . "
" Incredible is what the law requires , " Patel responded , adding that legalizing marijuana appeared to be Lepp 's driving passion .
" Maybe you want to be a martyr for the cause , " she said .
Sentencing Lepp , a 56 - year - old veteran in ill health , to prison is a travesty and a waste , said supporters .
" This case sadly illustrates the senselessness of federal marijuana laws , " said CANORML's Dale Geiringer .
" The last thing this country needs is more medical marijuana prisoners .
Hopefully , we can change the law and get Eddy out of jail before he completes his sentence . "
" Locking up Eddy Lepp serves no purpose and is a huge waste of life and scarce prison space , " said Aaron Smith , California policy director of the Marijuana Policy Project .
" The community would be a lot better served if we taxed and regulated California 's $ 14 billion marijuana industry rather than continuing to incarcerate nonviolent people like Eddy , who are clearly of no danger to society . "
Thomas Casagranda , a former tax compliance officer with HM Revenue and Customs , said MPs ’ tax affairs were effectively “ above the law ” because senior managers refused to scrutinise them .
Mr Casagranda , who quit his post at HMRC ’s Reading office 18 months ago , said he had been “ shocked ” by their reluctance to act .
He confirmed he suggested an investigation after receiving a tip - off that an MP was failing to declare rental income from a property .
He said : “ During a routine meeting to discuss possible projects , such as investigating taxi drivers or subcontractors in the building in­­d­­­u­­­stry , I suggested running a project on MPs .
“ The meeting went on as normal but afterwards I was taken aside by the head of the regional risk intelligence team and told I would be ‘ out on my ear ’ if I mentioned MPs again .
I was told that if I looked at an MP ’s tax return or checked them out on PAYE records I would face disciplinary proceedings .
What are the bill 's prospects in the Senate ?
Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith , D - Queens , reiterated he won't
bring the issue to the Senate floor until the 32 votes are secured .
" If we get the 32 I will do it , " he said this week .
" But I 'm not
going to put a bill on the floor just for symbolism . "

and right now supporters are a number of votes shy , anywhere from 4 to
8 depending on who 's counting .
There may be some chance that recent events
in Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine and Iowa , plus the large majority in the
Assembly could affect a couple of votes , but it still looks like a longshot ,
not that they 're not trying :
The Empire State Pride Agenda has focused the bulk of its efforts on
Republicans , particularly those in Long Island districts that are
likely to be battlegrounds next fall , with advocates promising whoever
stands with them on marriage will get support in 2010 .

Update 3 : NY Times article discussing Senators on the fence
Smith released a statement today , reiterating his support :
" It is my goal to realize that same accomplishment in the Senate and as a strong supporter of marriage equality legislation , I will continue to work until we have sufficient votes to pass it . "
" Marriage equality is about equal rights and basic personal freedom that no person should ever be denied .
I remain steadfast in my commitment to protecting those rights and ensuring that all New Yorkers can enjoy a privilege which is fundamentally theirs .

so if there are 32 votes to be gotten , it seems like we can count on
him to push to get them .
In news from other states , we have a new poll in New Hampshire
HANOVER , N.H.
A new poll shows New Hampshire residents are evenly
split on the issue of same - sex marriage .
Forty - five percent of those polled by Dartmouth College oppose
legalizing gay marriage , and 41 percent support it .
The difference was
within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points .

and Massachusetts will be celebrating its fifth anniversary of
legal same - sex marriage this coming Sunday , May 17th .
How do things
look from there ?
... although Roman Catholic leaders and some conservative activists
remain vocally opposed , there is overwhelming political support for
same - sex marriage and no prospect for a referendum .
According to the latest state figures , through September 2008 , there
had been 12,167 same - sex marriages in Massachusetts ,

Update Obligatory amazement expressed at being on rec list !
It seems as if the bad old days have returned with a vengeance in Ireland .
Emigration is back — and it looks like it could be official government policy .
A report in today 's Sunday Independent says the Irish government expects the economy to recover in 2011 as long as 150,000 people emigrate .
That 's right ; 150,000 people .
Over the next 12 months .
The paper quotes " senior figures " in the Department of Finance who have said they are " expecting and hoping " that as many as 150,000 people will emigrate .
The story relies on anonymous sourcing for this information which makes me worry about the veracity of the report .
But then , on the other hand , who 's going to stick their head above the parapet in the Department and admit they blew the whistle .
The paper does n't say where the workers are expected to emigrate to .
America is pretty much closed to the Irish because of the state of the immigration system .
Australia is reducing its worker visas .
In England , tradespeople are competing with workers from Eastern Europe who can charge less for their work .
But Irish workers , with mortgages of € 2,000 a month , need to earn more or they will have to walk away from their homes .
The specter of emigration was the main topic on Marian Finucane 's show this morning .
But nobody is answering the big question .
Given that this is a global meltdown ; and not confined to Ireland , where does the Irish Government expect everyone to go ?
The report comes in the wake of new figures which show that immigrants account for 20 percent of people receiving unemployment benefits in Ireland .
The total " signing - on " in Ireland stands at about 400,000 ( up from about 200,000 last year ) with most economists expecting it to rise to about 500,000 .
About 80,000 of those in receipt of benefits are immigrants and that number will presumably rise along with the total number .
Most of these , some 45,000 , are from Poland , Lithuania and Latvia , three of the 10 accession states which joined the EU in May 2004 .
It 's a far cry from 2005 when immigration into Ireland reached a record high of 53,000 and construction , industry and the hospitality industries welcomed the immigrants with open arms .
The same immigrants are now being somehow smeared for collecting benefits they are entitled to after working in Ireland for the past five years and paying for their social welfare .
I 'd like to see a report which shows how much the immigrants contributed to the Irish coffers before they get scapegoated for collecting social welfare .
Construction workers like Joe Callan , 23 , have seen their hopes and dreams crushed in the downturn .
Callan studied to be a surveyor and while he was in school he worked hard at making sure he was well qualified .
Now , he 's living in in a flat with London with four other Irish emigrants , and tries to come home every month .
" I 've heard all the stories from the old guys in Kilburn , " he says , referring to immigrants in the traditional Irish haunt in London .
" The only difference these days is that I am flying back to Dublin whereas they could only afford the boat from Holyhead . "
" We were all forced to leave . "

Not sure we ’ve got a good general heading to put this under .
But over the weekend Francine Busby was holding a fundraiser in an upper - income neighborhood in San Diego , prepping to run again in the fairly Republican CA - 50 district .
Remember , that ’s Duke Cunningham ’s old district , now represented by Brian Bilbray .
So Busby ’s holding her fundraiser .
Some neighbor calls the cops complaining of noise .
And before you know it , the sheriff ’s department is there with eight squad cars and a helicopter , dousing multiple attendees with pepper spray and arresting one of the hostesses .
( Click here for our TPMDC interview with Francine Busby discussing the incident . )
Only it gets better , or worse , depending on your perspective .
There ’s evidence the noise complaint was bogus .
Busby did use a microphone to communicate with the crowd for a period of time — a crowd she described as “ middle aged and above . ”
But no other neighbors heard any noise to speak of , according to reports .
And there is this .
The fundraiser was hosted by a lesbian couple .
And not long before the sheriff ’s deputies showed up , someone was heard outside screaming anti-lesbian epithets .
As you can see , a lot of unanswered questions .
Here ’s our initial report .
We ’ve got an interview with Francine Busby coming shortly .
A key member of the Saudi royal family who headed the country ’s intelligence service for 25 years accused both the Obama and Bush administrations Monday of “ deceiving ” the American people that the U.S. can ever end its dependence on foreign oil .
“ You ca n’t get rid of oil .
You ca n’t get rid of fossil fuels — gas and coal — unless you want to price yourself out of existence , ” Prince Turki al - Faisal , former ambassador to Washington , told editors and reporters at The Washington Times .
“ I ’d hope that the general public in the United States would be wiser than to be deceived into thinking that the U.S. can ever be energy independent , ” he said .
Saudi Arabia , a long - time U.S. ally that has suffered a significant image problem since it was revealed that 15 of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , hijackers hailed from the kingdom , is the world ’s largest oil exporter .
Last year , the U.S. imported from Saudi Arabia 1.5 million barrels of oil a day — more than 11 percent of total imports .
“ The U.S. has rising energy needs despite the economic downturn , ” Prince Turki said .
“ If you are going to be paying for wind , electric and solar energy equivalents that cost five or 10 times more than it costs to use oil , you are going to price yourself out of the market .
You are going to lose whatever competitiveness you have in your products . ”
He noted that the first president to declare the goal of independence of foreign oil was George W. Bush , in his 2006 State of the Union speech , shortly after the prince was named ambassador to the U.S .
“ Politicians , when they do that , I think they are misleading their publics , ” he said .
During his election campaign last year , President Obama said , “ I will set a clear goal as president .
In 10 years , we will finally end our dependence on oil in the Middle East . ”
On its Web site , the White House has outlined a plan how to “ eliminate our current imports from the Middle East and Venezuela within 10 Years . ”
It includes increasing fuel economy standards , getting one million plug - in hybrid cars on the road by 2015 , creating “ a new $ 7,000 tax credit for purchasing advanced vehicles ” and establishing a national “ low - carbon fuel standard . ”

The future of SkyOS , the closed - source alternative operating system , had been hanging by a thread for a long time now .
Barely any releases , until they came to a grinding halt altogether and Robert Szeleney explained he was pondering the future of SkyOS , and where to take it from here .
One of the main problems was a lack of driver support which really made development difficult .
Well , this is a problem Szeleney might be able to fix .
In an announcement posted on the SkyOS website , Szeleney writes that he is experimenting with replacing the SkyOS kernel with either the Linux of the NetBSD kernel .
The idea is to let the SkyOS APIs run on op of the Linux or NetBSD kernels , so you get the SkyOS user experience , but the hardware support of either Linux or NetBSD .
This would enable Szeleny to focus on the userland , instead of having to devote a lot of time to getting hardware support up to par .
To achieve this , Szeleney wants to move the SkyGI ( graphics layer ) part that currently resides in the SkyOS kernel into userland , in a manner similar to appserver .
“ Only the linux kernel will be used .
No textmode .
From a user point of view no difference should be visible between the current SkyOS kernel on this proof of concept linux kernel , ” Szeleny writes .
He is using a Linux From Scratch kernel , version 2.6.27.4 , and only uses the absolute bare necessities , so just the actual kernel – not even the text mode .
“ Based on the results of these proof of concepts ( e.g. performance , user experience , etc. ) further decisions regarding the SkyOS future can be made . ”
This actually sounds like a very promising path to explore for SkyOS , and I hope the results will be encouraging .
They say that every action spurs an opposite reaction .
Well , that certainly seems to be the case in Congress .
Just days after Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Barney Frank , along with 13 cosponsors , reintroduced HR 2835 , the Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act of 2009 in Congress , Republican Rep. Mark Kirk ( Illinois ) has called for federal legislation to sentence certain first - time marijuana offenders to up to 25 years in prison .
UPDATE !!!
UPDATE !!!
It gets even worse .
Check out some of the comments and coverage from Rep .
Kirk ’s press conference ( WTF is “ koosh ? ! ” ) , which took place this afternoon .
You can also offer your opinions regarding this misguided and mean - spirited proposal on Alternet.org and the ever - popular Huffington Post blog .
You can also send Rep .
Kirk and his colleagues a strong message by making your thoughts known on The Hill.com ’s Congress blog here .
U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk to push tougher sentences for more - potent marijuana
via The Chicago Tribune
U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk will call for legislation Monday that would toughen drug - trafficking laws regarding a highly potent form of marijuana , with penalties of up to 25 years in prison for a first - time offense .
The law would target offenders who sell or distribute marijuana that has a THC content exceeding 15 percent .
… Drug dealers are increasingly cross- breeding plants to produce high - potency variants of marijuana , which are called “ kush ” in street slang when they have 20 percent THC , Lake County Sheriff Mark Curran said .
“ When you amplify the strength of it , you are increasing the harm to the system , ” said Curran , who supports the legislation , which would amend a federal law .
“ They are more dangerous behind the wheel of a vehicle .
It ’s not a good idea to have people that messed up . ”
… The Republican North Shore lawmaker said he plans to release more information during a news conference in Chicago on Monday , where he will be joined by representatives from the Lake County Sheriff ’s Department , the Lake County Metropolitan Enforcement Group and Waukegan Police Department .
Okay , where to begin ?
Well , we can start with U.S. Representative Mark Kirk .
According to the Congressman ’s website , Rep. Kirk is “ pro-personal responsibility . ”
Unless , of course , we ’re talking about allowing responsible adults ( or patients ) the choice to relax ( or medicate ) in the privacy of their own homes with a substance that is objectively safer than alcohol ( or most prescription pharmaceuticals ) .
Then , naturally , all bets are off .
Representative Kirk ’s website also alleges that the five - time - elected Congressman is “ pro-science . ”
Unless , of course , we ’re talking about cannabis — in which case he is actually “ pro-ideology ” and “ anti-science . ”
After all , if Rep .
Kirk was truly interested in the science of cannabis he would already know that :
1 ) According to a 2008 review ( see page 12 ) of marijuana potency by the University of Mississippi , the average THC in domestically grown marijuana — which comprises the bulk of the U.S. market — is less than five percent , a figure that ’s remained unchanged for nearly a decade .
2 ) THC — regardless of potency — is virtually non-toxic to healthy cells or organs , and is incapable of causing a fatal overdose .
Currently , doctors may legally prescribe a FDA - approved pill that contains 100 percent THC , and curiously , nobody among Rep .
Kirk ’s staff or at the Lake County Sheriff ’s office seems to be overly concerned about its potential health effects .
3 ) Survey data gleaned from cannabis consumers in the Netherlands — where users may legally purchase pot of known quality — indicates that most cannabis consumers prefer less potent pot , just as the majority of those who drink alcohol prefer beer or wine rather than 190 proof Everclear or Bacardi 151 .
When consumers encounter unusually strong varieties of marijuana , they adjust their use accordingly and smoke less .
Of course , if Rep. Kirk ( write him here ! ) was really concerned about potential risks posed by supposedly stronger marijuana , he would support regulating the sale of drug ( as opposed to jailing first - time pot sellers for a quarter of a century ) so that its potency would be consistent and this information would be publicly displayed to the consumer .
This same advice applies to the members of the Lake County Sheriff ’s Department and the Waukegan Police Department — who claim “ we do n’t make the laws ; we just enforce them ” — yet seem to have no problem whatsoever lobbying for increased federal pot penalties while on company time .
Fortunately , the likelihood is that Rep .
Kirk ’s proposed legislation will be all bark and no bite .
One , I suspect that few if any of Rep .
Kirk ’s colleagues in Congress will even consider supporting such an asinine measure .
Two , even if such legislation were to become law ( and it wo n’t ) — who would test each and every seized marijuana sample for THC potency and who would pay for it ?
Currently , only the University of Mississippi engages in such potency testing , which is highly expensive and requires the use of a gas chromatography mass spectrometer device .
In short , it appears that the misguided Congressman from Illinois is simply trying to make headlines .
One ca n’t blame him for trying .
After all , across the pond , unsubstantiated claims regarding the dangers of often - talked - about - but - never - actually - defined supposedly “ lethal ” ‘ skunk ’ weed caused a national frenzy and resulted in Parliament hastily deciding to reclassify pot possession offenses from a verbal warning to up to five years in jail .
Never mind that , under Britain ’s short - lived experiment with decriminalization , marijuana potency actually fell — as did the number of adolescents using the drug .
Of course , as the latest actions of the so - called “ pro-science , pro-personal liberty ” Congressman show , facts play virtually no role in political drug policy debate , and ignorance hardly disqualifies someone from holding elected office .

The authorities were faced with a credible challenger , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who had the potential to challenge the existing power structure on certain key issues .
He ran a surprisingly effective campaign , and his “ green wave ” began to be seen as more than a wave .
In fact , many began calling it a Green Revolution .
For a regime that has been terrified about the possibility of a “ velvet revolution , ” this may have been too much .
On the basis of what we know so far , here is the sequence of events starting on the afternoon of election day , Friday , June 12 .
• Near closing time of the polls , mobile text messaging was turned off nationwide
• Security forces poured out into the streets in large numbers
• The Ministry of Interior ( election headquarters ) was surrounded by concrete barriers and armed men
• National television began broadcasting pre-recorded messages calling for everyone to unite behind the winner
• The Mousavi campaign was informed officially that they had won the election , which perhaps served to temporarily lull them into complacency
• But then the Ministry of Interior announced a landslide victory for Ahmadinejad
• Unlike previous elections , there was no breakdown of the vote by province , which would have provided a way of judging its credibility
• The voting patterns announced by the government were identical in all parts of the country , an impossibility
• Less than 24 hours later , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei publicly announced his congratulations to the winner , apparently confirming that the process was complete and irrevocable , contrary to constitutional requirements
• Shortly thereafter , all mobile phones , Facebook , and other social networks were blocked , as well as major foreign news sources .
All of this had the appearance of a well orchestrated strike intended to take its opponents by surprise -- the classic definition of a coup .
Curiously , this was not a coup of an outside group against the ruling elite ; it was a coup of the ruling elite against its own people .
It is still too early for anything like a comprehensive analysis of implications , but here are some initial thoughts :
1 . The willingness of the regime simply to ignore reality and fabricate election results without the slightest effort to conceal the fraud represents a historic shift in Iran ’s Islamic revolution .
All previous leaders at least paid lip service to the voice of the Iranian people .
This suggests that Iran ’s leaders are aware of the fact that they have lost credibility in the eyes of many ( most ? ) of their countrymen , so they are dispensing with even the pretense of popular legitimacy in favor of raw power .
2 . The Iranian opposition , which includes some very powerful individuals and institutions , has an agonizing decision to make .
If they are intimidated and silenced by the show of force ( as they have been in the past ) , they will lose all credibility in the future with even their most devoted followers .
But if they choose to confront their ruthless colleagues forcefully , not only is it likely to be messy but it could risk running out of control and potentially bring down the entire existing power structure , of which they are participants and beneficiaries .
3 . With regard to the United States and the West , nothing would prevent them in principle from dealing with an illegitimate authoritarian government .
We do it every day , and have done so for years ( the Soviet Union comes to mind ) .
But this election is an extraordinary gift to those who have been most skeptical about President Obama ’s plan to conduct negotiations with Iran .
Former Bush official Elliott Abrams was quick off the mark , commenting that it is “ likely that the engagement strategy has been dealt a very heavy blow . ”
Two senior Israeli officials quickly urged the world not to engage in negotiations with Iran .
Neoconservatives who had already expressed their support for an Ahmadinejad victory now have every reason to be satisfied .
Opposition forces , previously on the defensive , now have a perfect opportunity to mount a political attack that will make it even more difficult for President Obama to proceed with his plan .
Certainly , we are concerned about spontaneous reactions .
Iran 's youth has been engaged and mobilized .
Around the country , there have already been some violent clashes .
We do not agree with violence , because violence will only give the Right an excuse to suppress the opposition .
Certainly , the gap inside Iran , politically , will be widened .
Our main concern is how to keep the enthusiasm that was created for the election alive , in order to monitor and constrain the power of the government .
The only way to counter it is the power of the people .
We need to organize them .
In this we have an experience to guide us .
During the era of the Shah , there was only one moment in which the power of the people was mobilized against the Shah and to support changes in the Constitution , and that was during the era of [ Prime Minister ] Mossadegh .
[ Mossadegh was ousted in the 1953 coup organized by the CIA and British intelligence . ]
In that era , there was a very powerful political movement inside the country that checked the power of the Shah .
Today we have to do the same .
We are nor after subversion .
We do not want to change the Constitution .
We do want to create a viable political force that can exert its influence .
engaged and mobilized
Although the United States is pursuing diplomacy with Iran in its own self - interest , electoral fraud ( or the perception of fraud ) complicates this strategy .
And if political paralysis reigns in Iran , valuable time to address the nuclear issue through diplomacy will be lost .
The White House 's posture thus far is a constructive one -- while it cannot remain indifferent to irregularities in the elections , it must be careful never to get ahead of the Iranian people and the anti-Ahmadinejad candidates .
Rightists have already decided that the Iranian election was stolen ; maybe it was ; maybe it was n't .
But rightists want everyone to run out and buy the new book by compulsive liar and reactionary Iranian exile Amir Taheri , The Persian Night : Iran under the Khomeinist Revolution .
Most Americans know Taheri because CNN and theuse him as a commentator whenever they want to slant a story against the Iranian government -- despite the fact that his hysterical pronouncements ( like Jews being forced to wear special clothes ) are consistently shown to have been pulled out of his ass .
Despite Taheri and a gaggle of right - wing propagandists , it is possible that Ali Khamenei and Ahmadinejad pulled off in Iran just what the Bush family pulled off in Florida in 2000 and again in Ohio in 2004 -- essentially , a coup against democracy .
Gary Sick , an Iran expert , a professor at Columbia and a far more reliable source of analysis than the deranged Taheri , explains the ramifications of what may have been a coup Yesterday we thought the protests against the purported theft of the Irani presidential election would result in about the same level of protest as the result in 2000 at the theft of the U.S. presidential election .
America yawned as they surrendered any claim to democracy .
Iranians , however , did n't .
Iranians are out in the streets demonstrating against not just Ahmadinejad but , unthinkably , Ali Khamenei .
Everything I 'm reading is telling me that the Islamic Republic regime is losing legitimacy -- at least in Tehran , maybe just North Tehran .
Former Iranian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi , now an exile and a dissident :
Will this get out of hand and turn into an actual civil war ?
Look at this clip .
Someone ' smad as hell and does n't want to take it any more : Trita Parsi , founder and president of the National Iranian American Council , writing persuasively at Passport , a blog set up by the editors of , warns that ever - truculent neo-cons , who openly rooted for Amadinejad for just this reason , want Obama to put the breaks on an outreach to Iran .
Even if the election was rigged , as just about everyone believes , does this mean Obama needs to change his policy agenda ?
Labels : Iran
The Obama administration sat by last week as 12 Senate Democrats joined 39 Senate Republicans to block a vote on an amendment that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to modify troubled mortgages .
Senator Obama campaigned on the provision .
And President Obama made its passage part of his antiforeclosure plan .
It would have been a very useful prod to get lenders to rework bad loans rather than leaving the modification to a judge .
But when the time came to stand up to the banking lobbies and cajole yes votes from reluctant senators  the White House did n’t .
When the measure failed , there was n’t even a statement of regret .
Mr. Obama ’s plan to keep struggling Americans in their homes now relies on lenders to voluntarily rework bad loans .
The plan provides ample incentives , including payments to servicers who successfully modify loans and , in some cases , payments to mortgage investors who agree to modifications .
Whether that will be enough remains to be seen .

PARIS  Crude oil climbed above $ 72 a barrel on Thursday as the International Energy Agency revised upward its forecast for global oil demand on signs that the downturn in the world economy was flattening out .
The agency , based in Paris , now estimates global demand will be 83.3 million barrels a day this year , up 120,000 barrels a day from its previous forecast .
The new forecast still represents a decline of 2.9 percent from the 2008 level , the agency said , cautioning that the revisions “ do not necessarily imply economic recovery , but may reflect a slowing in previously sharp decline . ”
Crude oil futures settled at $ 72.68 a barrel in New York trading .
The price of oil has more than doubled since sliding below $ 35 in February , in part because of Chinese stockpiling that began in April .
It ’s very rare that I use Telnet these days , so it took a long time for me to notice that by default it was not packaged with Windows 7 .
I did some research and found out that this was also true for Windows Vista .
More than likely this was an attempt to make Windows more secure by default , as Telnet is very insecure and whenever you have the choice you should always use SSH .
However , with that being said , you can quickly re-enable Telnet by following these steps :
Start Control Panel Programs And Features Turn Windows features on or off Check Telnet Client Hit OK
After that you can start Telnet via Command Prompt .
A former civil servant who wrote an internet article imagining the kidnap , rape and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud was cleared of obscenity today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Darryn Walker , 35 , faced prosecution after writing a 12 - page blog on a fantasy pornography site .
The Crown Prosecution Service took action , believing that the group 's young fans could easily have stumbled across it while searching the internet for material about the band .
But a report for the defence by an information technology expert found the article was not easily accessible , and could only be discovered by those looking for such specific material .
Mr Walker , of Mowbray Street , South Shields , Tyneside , walked free from Newcastle Crown Court after he was cleared .
The court heard that he had lost his job since he was arrested last year .
The defendant , who wore a smart grey suit , only said : " No comment " as he left court .
Kidnapped farmer beheaded by Filipino al - Qaeda militants after family fail to pay ransom
Militant group : Handcuffed members of the al Qaeda linked Abu Sayyaf following a previous killing
A Filipino farmer kidnapped by Muslim militants has been beheaded after his family failed to pay a ransom for his release .
Police in the Phillipines have recovered the severed head of farm owner Doroteo Gonzales , 61 , who had been snatched by gunmen on April 25 .
He was taken from his house in the southern Zamboanga city to the nearby Basilan Island , where al - Qaeda - linked Abu Sayyaf rebels are holding at least another five people following a surge of ransom kidnappings .
At least three gunmen believed to be involved in Gonzales ' abduction have been arrested , regional military spokesman Captain Neil Estrella said .
Police found Gonzales ' severed head in Basilan 's Akbar town yesterday , said Chief Inspector Rolando Democrito .
The victim 's family had failed to pay a ransom of 25 million pesos ( $ 525,000 ) for his release , he added .
Regional police head Bensali Jabarani said : ' The Abu Sayyaf has been by far the most violent armed group .
They resort to killing their hostages if the situation starts to drag . '
He said authorities had put up a reward of 500,000 pesos for information on the hostages .
Gonzales was the latest victim of the brutal Abu Sayyaf group , which is notorious for beheadings and bomb attacks - despite efforts by U.S. - backed Filipino troops to wipe them out .
This year , from hide - outs in the jungle , the militants embarked on a kidnapping spree to raise money .
They have taken hostage three Zamboanga teachers , a lending firm collector and a Sri Lankan peace activist on Basilan .
Different groups of gunmen stalk potential victims in urban areas , carry out the abduction , then hand over the victims to the mountain - based Abu Sayyaf militants , who keep the hostages and negotiate for a ransom , Estrella said , citing statements from captured kidnappers .
' It 's emerging now that this is some sort of a criminal conspiracy , ' Estrella said .
' Our campaign has focused on cutting these tentacles of the Abu Sayyaf . '
On nearby Jolo Island , Abu Sayyaf gunmen kidnapped three workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross in January .
Two have been released but ailing Italian hostage Eugenio Vagni , 62 , remains in captivity .
The government has ordered troops to rescue Vagni , leading to sporadic clashes with the militants .
The Abu Sayyaf , which has about 400 fighters , is believed to have received funds from al - Qaida and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organisations .
Same - sex marriage protestors stop traffic

Hundreds of demonstrators converged on the steps of City Hall this evening and later blocked traffic on Market Street after speakers urged protesters to channel their anger and rage over the Supreme Court 's ruling to uphold Proposition 8 .
" This is our chance , right here and right now , in the streets together to make a difference , " said Lea Brown , a speaker from Metropolitan Community Church .
Earlier in the day , police arrested more than 100 protesters blocking Van Ness Avenue near the Civic Center after giving the chanting , sign - waving crowd more than an hour to vent its anger and sadness .
Many of those arrested were released in time to return for the evening event .
All day , the opponents of Prop. 8 far outnumbered the supporters who gathered in San Francisco .
However , several conservative groups issued statements that promised to fight any efforts to change the state constitution to allow same - sex marriages once again .
Shortly after noon , officers began arresting anti-Prop.
8 protesters , starting with clergy members .
The arrests went so smoothly they seemed choreographed - which in a way they almost were , considering the police and protest organizers had been talking for days to make sure everything went smoothly and peacefully .
" It 's the right thing to do , " Rabbi Sydney Mintz of Congregation Emanu - El of San Francisco said of her decision to protest Prop. 8 , shortly before she was led off with wrists tied .
The first group of protesters were booked at the jail and then released at about 2:45 p.m. , more than two hours after being arrested .
Mintz received her citation and was back on the street by 6 p.m. , this time with her 8 - year - old son Gabe Newbrun - Mintz , who said his mother 's arrest was " sad . "
But she stayed in the street " so that they would know she was serious about the civil rights , " he said .
Mintz said , " The police handled it very , very well and I think we made our point . "
Itai Bojdak - Wates , also 8 , was also at the post - school , evening protest at City Hall , alongside his two moms .
" Prop. 8 was decided that it was OK and we want to protest that it 's not OK , " he said .
" It 's stopping people who want to marry from marrying . "
At about 6:30 p.m. , the evening protesters started to march , with a scheduled destination of Yerba Buena Gardens .
Trailing at the back of the procession was the San Francisco Lesbian / Gay Freedom Band .
As they marched past the California Supreme Court building , protected along the front by police , the band launched into a rendition of Al Jolson's , " California Here I Come . "
A large group of protesters then broke off and started a separate march up Market Street to the Castro neighborhood , where they took over the intersection of Castro and Market streets , blocking traffic .
Police did not appear to be making arrests .
The march continued what had been a long day for protesters .
The only tense moment came at about 1 p.m. when pro-Prop .
8 demonstrator Chancey Killens , a minister from Salinas , began trying to address the crowd through a bullhorn .
All he got out before being surrounded by angry protesters were the words : " We need to respect the homosexual community ... "
About 30 demonstrators continued to shout him down for several minutes until police officers came and moved him up Van Ness to McAllister Street .
There , away from the main protest , he debated a same - sex protest group that followed him .
" We do n't hate homosexuals , we just disagree with them , " he said after the debate dissipated .
He said he came " to celebrate " the Prop. 8 ruling and " to share my free speech . "
Aleada Minton of San Francisco was one of the loudest trying to drown Killens out with her voice and a harmonica .
" I do n't care what their dissenting opinion is , " she said .
" I do n't need to hear it . "
Reactions from political and community leaders to the ruling were swift and stark , and seemed to mostly condemn the ruling .
Mayor Gavin Newsom promised to work to overturn Prop. 8 , and in a statement urged every Californian to " please talk to a lesbian or gay family member , neighbor or co-worker and ask them why equality in the eyes of the law is important to every Californian . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a statement saying that while he believed " one day either the people or courts will recognize gay marriage , " as governor he has to uphold the court 's decision .
City Attorney Dennis Herrera and advocates for same - sex marriage gathered in the South Light Court at City Hall to say that same - sex marriage will become reality in California someday - but will happen at the ballot box , not inside a courtroom and will take the hard work of everyday citizens , not lawyers .
" Our official role ends here - this fight remains in capable hands with all of you , " Herrera said , adding that when couples regain their right to marry , he hopes they return to where the marriages began five years ago .
" You 'll all invited back to City Hall because that celebration belongs here . "
The conservative Pacific Justice Institute issued a statement applauding the court 's support for Prop. 8 and predicting that " more litigation over several years " may yet undercut the simultaneous ruling upholding the 18,000 same - sex marriages that took place before the statewide vote .
" Today 's decision is a victory for democracy and a victory for the civil rights of clergy , county clerks and Californians across the political spectrum who did not want to be forced by the government to approve of same - sex marriage , " institute President Brad Dacus said in a statement .
He urged his pro-Prop .
8 colleagues to remain vigilant , saying , " The bully tactics and intimidation used by the gay - rights lobby during the Prop.
8 campaign showed us that they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals . "
Yana Kulinich was with a group of students from American River College in Sacramento who drove in to support Prop .
8 .
" I 'm really happy that Prop. 8 was upheld , but I was just told by somebody that she 's going to harass me until the day I die , " Kulinich said .
" Now I 'm really concerned for my safety .
" I did n't expect that , " she said .
" I 'm shaking right now . "
" Inter arma enim silent leges , " holds the hoary Roman maxim thought to originate with Cicero :
In time of war , the laws fall silent .
In our own era , few proponents of that doctrine have been as influential or forceful as Berkeley law professor John Yoo , who in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , worked within the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department to lay the legal foundations for the Bush administration 's approach to the war on terror .
Despite repeated pleas from civil liberties groups , crucial memoranda authored by Yoo , justifying controversial tactics ranging from coercive interrogation to warrantless surveillance , remained closely guarded secrets — until Monday .
The Department of Justice , citing the " legitimate and substantial public interest " in these opinions , today released a series of nine documents not previously available to the public : six legal opinions issued by Yoo and his contemporaries in 2001 - 2002 , and two more recent memoranda repudiating many of those opinions in strikingly sharp language .
Among them are several opinions — two presented in full , one in summary — offering a theoretical basis for President Bush 's decision to authorize a program of extrajudicial wiretapping and data mining by the National Security Agency .
The first of these opinions is dated September 25 , 2001 , just weeks after the 9/11 attacks .
In it , Yoo endeavors to respond to an almost astonishingly modest question :
Whether it would be consistent with the Constitution to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act so as to permit the secret FISA court to authorize ( under somewhat more lax standards than apply in criminal cases ) surveillance of agents of foreign powers when the gathering of foreign intelligence was " a purpose " of the surveillance .
The statute at the time required that this be the " primary purpose " of FISA intercepts , though the USA PATRIOT Act , in what might be seen as something of a compromise , would soon change the standard to a " significant purpose . "
( Perhaps ironically , this memo is addressed to then - Associate Deputy Attorney General David Kris , later a prominent critic of the legal rationalizations for the warrantless surveillance program , and now Barack Obama 's pick to head the National Security Division at Justice . )
Having asserted that the Constitution assigns the president not merely the power but the obligation to act in defense of national security
Yoo then portentously observes that " FISA itself is not required by the Constitution , nor is it necessarily the case that its current standards match exactly to Fourth Amendment standards . "
Yoo rather perfunctorily concludes that there would be no constitutional barrier to such an amendment .
The FISA court , after all , could still determine whether a warrant application simply sought to invoke foreign intelligence as a pretext for a primarily criminal investigation , in violation of the Fourth Amendment .
The proposed amendment " would simply allow the Department to apply for FISA warrants up to the limit permitted by the Constitution , as determined by the FISA court . "
In other words : it can't hurt to ask .
But
Yoo then veers from his assigned task into what can only be described as a lengthy and unsolicited digression , laying out his view of the primacy of the president in the national security arena , and the scant limits on presidential discretion to order surveillance targeting foreign terrorists .
He writes :
The text , structure and history of the Constitution establish that the Founders entrusted the President with the primary responsibility , and therefore the power , to ensure the security of the United States in situations of grave and unforeseen emergencies .
Intelligence gathering is a necessary function that enables the President to carry out that authority ...
The implications of constitutional text and structure are confirmed by the practical consideration that national security decisions often require the unity in purpose and energy in action that characterize the Presidency rather than Congress ...
As the Commander in Chief , the President must be able to use whatever means necessary to prevent attacks upon the United States ; this power , by implication , includes the authority to collect information necessary for its effective exercise .
Having asserted that the Constitution assigns the president not merely the power but the obligation to act in defense of national security
Yoo then portentously observes that " FISA itself is not required by the Constitution , nor is it necessarily the case that its current standards match exactly to Fourth Amendment standards . "
Breaking the shackles of the Fourth Amendment
The chain of reasoning to this end is a truly spectacular exercise in casuistry , which for purposes of brevity , we might dub the " if you can shoot 'em ... " argument .
But
Yoo was only getting warmed up .
Less than a month later , on October 23 , Yoo would urge the president to cast off the shackles of the Fourth Amendment entirely — jettisoning not only the obligation to seek probable - cause warrants , but even the standard of " reasonableness . "
In an opinion finding that the Posse Comitatus Act 's ban on the domestic deployment of the armed forces was inapplicable to counterterrorist operations ,
Yoo argues that " however well suited the warrant and probable cause requirements may be as applied to criminal investigations or to other law enforcement activities , they are unsuited to the demands of wartime and the military necessity to successfully prosecute a war against an enemy . "
Rather , he writes , " the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military operations designed to deter and prevent foreign terrorist attacks . "
Yoo is quite explicit that the president is " free from the constraints of the Fourth Amendment " with respect to a broad range of activities , explaining that " military action might encompass making arrests , seizing documents or other property , searching persons or places or keeping them under surveillance , intercepting electronic or wireless communications , setting up roadblocks , interviewing witnesses , and searching for suspects . "
The National Security Agency , recall , resides within the Department of Defense .
The chain of reasoning to this end is a truly spectacular exercise in casuistry , which for purposes of brevity , we might dub the " if you can shoot 'em ... " argument .
Omitting the ample footnotes — heavy on precedent from the Civil War and the War of 1812 — it runs roughly as follows .
The Fourth Amendment clearly does n't apply to overseas military operations .
( It has precious little application of any sort overseas , but leave that . )
And on the home front , the military can clearly use deadly force against invading armies or insurrectionist forces .
Moreover , in self defense against a foreign army , the government can even torch private facilities — like fuel reserves — that might be used by an invading force .
Since all of these defensive actions entail more severe deprivations of liberty than mere surveillance , and since none of them require prior approval of a magistrate , Yoo would have us infer that the Fourth Amendment is not merely attenuated in the face of the exigencies of national security , but wholly inapplicable .
Finally , one of the later memoranda , authored by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury in January of this year , summarizes Yoo 's interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as articulated in a February 2002 opinion .
Though that document remains classified , the summary explains
Yoo 's view that FISA must be interpreted as placing no limits on the president 's power to authorize surveillance in the interest of national security .
This is , as Bradbury notes with a certain deadpan restraint , " problematic and questionable , given FISA 's express references to the President 's authority . "
Other OLC memos drawing similar conclusions are described as " not supported by convincing reasoning . "
Indeed , in the waning days of the Bush administration , Justice Department attorneys had occasion to revisit much of Yoo 's legal reasoning .
Though the summary memos prepared in late 2008 and early 2009 say the DOJ has not relied on the disavowed opinions since 2003 , they emphasize , lest there be any doubt , that several of these " doubtful " arguments " should not be relied upon or treated as authoritative for any purpose . "
Such adjectives as " unconvincing , " " not satisfactory , " and " erroneous " are liberally applied .
The " if you can shoot ' em " argument — in the terrifying eventuality that anyone found it superficially plausible — is among the casualties .
With more of that characteristic deadpan restraint , the 2009 memo concludes that Yoo " inappropriately conflates the Fourth Amendment analysis for government searches with that for the use of deadly force . "
In other words , a " highly fact - dependent " self - defense justification may be invoked in particular circumstances characterized by a severe threat of imminent harm — an invading army , or even a homicidal thug brandishing a weapon at a police officer .
This does not , in fact , license a broad inference that whole constitutional provisions cease to apply altogether whenever there is a general state of heightened threat .
Not all of the specious arguments familiar from the early days of the FISA debates are cast by the wayside , however .
The 2009 memo also notes that the OLC 's current view , superseding Yoo 's now disfavored arguments , is that the NSA program was justified because the congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force empowered the president to circumvent FISA .
It is one of Yoo 's former interlocutors , David Kris , who has most decisively dispensed with that argument .
As Kris notes , the PATRIOT Act , enacted nearly simultaneously with the AUMF , itself amended FISA , which contains very limited provisions detailing the special powers the executive branch may exercise in the immediate aftermath of a declaration of war .
This , Kris argues , makes it very hard to credit the notion that Congress intended to create an enormous implicit loophole in the FISA statute , while doing nothing of the sort in a contemporaneous explicit revision of FISA that also reasserted the statute 's privileged status as the " exclusive means " for foreign intelligence collection .
If it is unsettling to contemplate the speciousness of the legal arguments that supported a radical expansion of executive surveillance power , we can at least take some solace in knowing that the most dangerous of these thin rationalizations are finally out in the open — and openly rejected by the Department of Justice .
" Inter arma enim silent leges " may have a noble provenance , but it bears remembering what became of Rome .
Most Americans think it 's high time pot should be legalized .
Fifty - two percent of U.S. voters said they supported marijuana legislation as debate over the illegal plant reaches a fever pitch , according to a new Zobgy poll .
The majority of Americans said they supported the legalization , taxation and regulation of the illegal drug -- though 37 percent opposed it and 11 percent were unsure , according to the poll .
The results of the survey , commissioned by the conservative - learning O'Leary Report , were based on a sample of 3,937 voters that was weighted based on how participants voted in the most recent presidential election -- 54 percent were Obama voters and 46 were McCain supporters .
The 52 percent majority was slightly higher than the 46 percent who said they supported pot legalization in an ABC News / Washington Post poll at the end of April .
" This new survey continues the recent trend of strong and growing support for taxing and regulating marijuana and ending the disastrously failed policy of prohibition , " Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in D.C. , told the Salem - News .
In California , where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the state should study how marijuana legalization works in other countries , the Field poll recently found 56 - percent support for pot legalization .
President Barack Obama fielded a question during an online town hall on March 26 about whether legalization of the drug could help boost the economy out of the recession .
" I do n't know what this says about the online audience , " he said , brushing off the question .

Avigdor Lieberman , the Moldovan night club bouncer , is now foreign minister of Israel .
The world has had a lot of fun laughing at the pronouncements of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who stands falsely accused of threatening to wipe Israel off the face of the map .
But Ahmadinejad has protested that it would be wrong to kill large numbers of civilians .
In contrast , Lieberman has threatened to wipe at least two countries , Egypt and Palestine , off the map .
Monstrously , he suggested bombing the Aswan Dam , which would have the effect of murdering all 80 million Egyptians and sweeping them into the Mediterranean in a vast continental African tsunami .
Lieberman promptly announced on assuming office that the Mideast peace process is dead .
Well , at least we have an outbreak of frankness .
Whereas Ahmadinejad was humiliated by Columbia University president Lee Bollinger on his visit to that university , which provoked public protests , Lieberman ’s acceptance into the Israeli government has been greeted mildly and he was allowed to come to the Brookings Institution and meet with Bill and Hillary Clinton .
Lieberman is a Central / Eastern European ultra-nationalist in the mold of Slobodan Milosevic and Jorg Haider , and it is shameful that he was allowed into the government and more shameful that this travesty has passed without a peep in the civilized world .
The The Electronic Intifada lists “ Some of Avigdor Lieberman ’s infamous statements ” :
‘ # In 1998 , Lieberman called for the flooding of Egypt by bombing the Aswan Dam in retaliation for Egyptian support for Yasser Arafat . #
In 2001 , as Minister of National Infrastructure , Lieberman proposed that the West Bank be divided into four cantons , with no central Palestinian government and no possibility for Palestinians to travel between the cantons .
#
In 2002 , the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth quoted Lieberman in a Cabinet meeting saying that the Palestinians should be given an ultimatum that “ At 8 a m we ’ll bomb all the commercial centers … at noon we ’ll bomb their gas stations … at two we ’ll bomb their banks … ” #
In 2003 , the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Lieberman called for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel to be drowned in the Dead Sea and offered to provide the buses to take them there .
#
In May 2004 , Lieberman proposed a plan that called for the transfer of Israeli territory with Palestinian populations to the Palestinian Authority .
Likewise , Israel would annex the major Jewish settlement blocs on the Palestinian West Bank .
If applied , his plan would strip roughly one - third of Israel ’s Palestinian citizens of their citizenship .
A “ loyalty test ” would be applied to those who desired to remain in Israel .
This plan to trade territory with the Palestinian Authority is a revision of Lieberman ’s earlier calls for the forcible transfer of Palestinian citizens of Israel from their land .
Lieberman stated in April 2002 that there was “ nothing undemocratic about transfer . ” # Also in May 2004 , he said that 90 percent of Israel ’s 1.2 million Palestinian citizens would “ have to find a new Arab entity ” in which to live beyond Israel ’s borders .
“ They have no place here .
They can take their bundles and get lost , ” he said .
#
In May 2006 , Lieberman called for the killing of Arab members of Knesset who meet with members of the Hamas - led Palestinian Authority . ’
Nice .

Update :
The picture on the right is of the seized " bonds " , via Italian site Adnkronos .
They look an awful lot like the bonds pictured in this story , about an age - old scam designed to confused seniors into buying fake bonds .
That being said , there was a period when the Treasury did issue high - denomination bonds up to $ 500 million .
Original post :
This is a totally crazy story .
Asia Times : Italy ’s financial police ( Guardia italiana di Finanza ) has seized US bonds worth US 134.5 billion from two Japanese nationals at Chiasso ( 40 km from Milan ) on the border between Italy and Switzerland .
They include 249 US Federal Reserve bonds worth US $ 500 million each , plus ten Kennedy bonds and other US government securities worth a billion dollar each .
The question now is whether the bonds are real or counterfeit
Karl Denninger , who discovered the story , notes that either way , this is wild :
If they 're real , what government ( the only entity that would have such a cache ) is trying to unload them ?
If they 're fake , this is arguably the biggest counterfeiting operation ever , by a factor of many times .
I 've seen news about various counterfeiting operations over the years that have made me chuckle , but this one , if that 's what it is , is absolutely jaw - dropping .
The cute part of this is that if the certificates are real Italy just got a hell of a bonanza - their money laundering laws provide for a statutory 40 % penalty for failure to declare instruments and cash in excess of $ 10,000 Euros , which means they 'd garner a close - to - $ 40 billion dollar windfall .
We 're leaning towards counterfeit on this one .
Either way , we wanna know more !

ZURICH ( Reuters ) - A new drug from Roche Holding AG helped shrink the tumors of 25 percent of women with HER2 - positive breast cancer , according to data from a mid-stage clinical trial , the Swiss company said on Thursday .
The treatment , trastuzumab - DM1 , is a combination of Roche ’s Herceptin and a chemotherapy agent .
About 35 percent of patients 112 in the trial either saw their tumors shrink , or their disease stabilized for at least six months , Roche said .
The decision issued late Friday by a judge in San Francisco allowing a civil lawsuit to go forward against a former Bush administration official , John C .
Yoo , might seem like little more than the removal of a procedural roadblock .
But lawyers for the man suing Mr. Yoo , Jose Padilla , say it provides substantive interpretation of constitutional issues for all detainees and could have a broad impact .
Mr. Padilla was held as an “ enemy combatant ” in solitary confinement for more than three years in the Navy brig in Charleston , S.C. Mr. Padilla , who was convicted of supporting terrorism and other crimes , demands that Mr. Yoo be held accountable for actions that Mr. Padilla claims led to his being tortured .
During the time Mr. Padilla was held in the brig , according to his filings in the case , he “ suffered gross physical and psychological abuse at the hands of federal officials as part off a systematic program of abusive interrogation intended to break down Mr. Padilla ’s humanity and his will to live . ”
WASHINGTON - With the election of Barack Obama , environmentalists expected to see the end of the " Appalachian apocalypse " -- their name for exposing coal deposits by blowing the tops off of whole mountains .
But in recent weeks , the Obama administration has quietly decided to open the way for at least two dozen more " mountaintop removal " projects .
The decision to clear a path for the controversial projects was never officially announced , but instead conveyed in a letter this month to a West Virginia congressman and coal ally , Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall .
The letter said that the Environmental Protection Agency would not block 42 of 48 mine projects that it had reviewed so far , including some of the most controversial mountaintop mines .
In mountaintop removal , explosives blast away a peak and expose coal seams .
Coal companies say the practice is safer and more efficient than traditional shaft mining .
Critics say the process scars the landscape and dumps tons of waste , some of it toxic , into streams and valleys .
The administration 's decisions are not the final word on the projects -- or on the future of mountaintop removal -- but it removes a major obstacle .
And the decision , coupled with the light it sheds on relations between the mining industry and the Obama White House , has disappointed environmentalists .
Some say they feel betrayed by a president they thought would end or sharply limit the practice .
What makes the issue politically sensitive is the fact that environmentalists were an active force behind Obama 's election , while his standing among Democratic voters in coal states is tenuous .
Halting mountaintop removal could eliminate jobs in those states and put upward pressure on energy prices .
Coal advocates have solicited help from officials as high as White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , and the issue sparked contentious debates among administration officials , including one shouting match in which top officials of two government agencies were heard pounding their fists on the table .
The White House is " searching for a way to walk this tightrope , " said Phil Smith , a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America , whose president , Cecil Roberts , has urged administration officials to allow the procedure .
" They have a large constituency of people who want to see an immediate end to mountaintop removal , and an equally large constituency -- many of them Democrats , I might add -- whose communities depend on those jobs . "
Earlier , Obama had won praise from the green lobby for taking a skeptical view of the procedure .
And the EPA announced in March that it would review mountaintop projects .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
The EPA has the authority to review and ultimately block mountaintop removal under the Clean Water Act , but if the agency raises no objections , the final decision is made by the Army Corps of Engineers .
The corps previously indicated its intention to approve the 48 permits .
A review of Obama campaign statements showed the presidential candidate expressing concern about the practice without specifically promising to end it .
On a West Virginia visit , he said he wanted " strong enforcement of the Clean Water Act " and added , " I will make sure the head of the Environmental Protection Agency believes in the environment . "
And EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said this year that the agency had " considerable concern " about the projects .
She pledged that her agency would " use the best science and follow the letter of the law in ensuring we are protecting our environment . "
Soon afterward , the agency blocked six major mountaintop projects in West Virginia , Kentucky and Ohio .
But this month , after White House meetings with coal companies and advocates such as Rahall and West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin , the EPA gave the green light to at least two dozen projects .
" It was a big disappointment , " said Joan Mulhern , a lawyer for Earthjustice , an environmental law firm that has led court challenges to mountaintop removal .
Mulhern charged that the EPA " blew off " Jackson 's earlier promises that the agency would adhere to science and conduct an open process .
Ed Hopkins , a top Sierra Club official , said that some of the projects that obtained the EPA 's blessing " are as large and potentially destructive as the ones they objected to .
" It makes us wonder what standards -- if any -- the administration is using . "
One hands - on with Project Natal would make for a nice story , but it would n't be complete .
So we 're giving you two full sets of impressions on Microsoft 's motion - capturing E3 bombshell .
Advertisement
Matt Buchanan tested Project Natal today , as did I .
Here is his personal take on the technology right alongside mine .
We did not share our independent experiences before pasting the text below .
Neither of us were allowed to shoot what was happening on screen — hence the crazy pics of our bodily reactions , and that intensely audible racing - game video .
How Natal Works
The test system was an ordinary Xbox 360 , connected to small PC and camera that simulates the final Natal rig .
There are two cameras — one RGB , for face recognition and display video , and one infrared , for tracking movement and depth .
Why infrared ?
The eye does n't see infrared light .
And when you combine an infrared camera with an infrared emitter ( also part of Natal ) , a room is flooded with a spectrum of invisible light that works in the dark .

Natal also has its own internal processing system handling an unspecified amount of the heavy lifting behind Natal 's cleaver image and speech recognition .
It breaks the human body into 48 points tracked in real time , and it can sense your whole body in Z space , or depth .
In fact , on a heat map that measured depth , my hands appeared hotter than my shoulders — because they were closer .
Natal is so smart , in fact , that , if your room is narrowed by a pair of couches , it can signal to a game to narrow the level .
It can see about 15 ' x 20 ' of a room , according to project leader Kudo Tsunoda 's informal estimation .
Breakout

Matt :
My first taste was talking to the father of Project Natal , Kudo Tsunoda and watching as his simple , small hand gestures were mapped perfectly onto the screen .
He started up the ballsmacker demo you might have seen in our liveblog , knocking a swarm of balls into wall with every part of his body .
When Kudo gestured to me try it , I jumped right in and immediately started smacking at balls with my hands and feet and knees and arms and head as one ball exploded into many , like a virus , until I was doing sad white ninja jerking and jumping movements .
Kudo did n't tell me how to " set it up " or what to do .
I just did it .
You have to realize , Kudo towers over me .
I did n't have to calibrate it to my body size , or stand in a weird way for it to adjust .
It just worked .
Well , until I broke it at the end — it froze up after a few rounds and had to be rebooted for Mark .
Hey , it 's an early tech demo , so do n't read into it .
Until that point , it worked remarkably , incredibly well — better than I expected , honestly .
The bright fluorescent lights were turned off and on , and Natal did n't flinch .
My real movements translated exactly how I expected them to — the precise position , velocity — 90 percent of the time , no matter how ridiculously I moved , and some of the other 10 percent might 've just been my own bad timing .
But the result is a remarkable sense of control .
Immersion .

Mark : Microsoft loaded the 3D Breakout demo we saw at their press conference .
I stepped up to a white piece of tape right after Matt , and given that I 'm 4 inches taller , Natal needed to account for my larger size .
Advertisement
After about 10 seconds , the blue , ghost - like figure filled in .
And he was both taller and bigger - handed than Matt 's avatar .
Natal noticed that I 'm a bigger guy .
It made no adjustments for the fact that I 'm also better looking .
The first thing I noticed was a slight lag I had n't intended .
It 's not horrible , but my avatar moved a hair more slowly than I did .
That did n't stop me from reaching up , spiking the imaginary ball at a wall imaginary bricks , and then flailing around to keep up with 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and more spheres flying at me at once .
Advertisement
My avatar recognized both my pitiful kicks and swipes .
And while my avatar never left the ground when I jumped , this turned out to be but an animation limitation within Microsoft 's tech demo .
My wireframe preview image and heatmap did leave the ground .
Besides , this is nitpicking .
On the PS2 I played Nike Kinetic , something a bit similar .
And I always wanted to be having fun .
But on Natal , even in a stuffy windowless room surrounded by Microsoft execs , I was having fun .
( Disregard my stern , focused face in these pictures . )
Burnout Revenge
Advertisement
Matt :
The Burnout racing - game demo was a little more abstract — in one sense , I almost wished I had a wheel to turn , a pedal to press , because I wanted the feedback .
I had trouble getting used to " pressing " the gas , which you do by moving your right foot forward .
I threw myself off - balance by taking a ginormous step toward the Frankenstein 's lab of demo equipment along the wall ( upon which I could see myself represented in infared , covered in boxes like smallpox ) .
But turning my air steering wheel , I felt completely in control .
A lot of that was the software — it registered even the smallest pivots of my elbows that sent my forearms right or left — but the way it responded exactly how I expected it to is what made it feel so natural .
Which is the real key here .
It feels natural .
After I hit full speed on a straightaway , I tried to do a 180 .
I crashed into a wall and died .
Normally , that 'd make me bad .
But I could n't stop smiling that I 'd held the future of gaming control in my hands — and it was simply air .
Advertisement
Mark :
As soon as Matt crashed , I greedily jumped in , asking him if it was OK but not waiting for him to answer .
I wanted to play Natal more , and I 've played a ton of Burnout .
Advertisement
Burnout showcases a few important points for Microsoft .
First , it 's a real game that 's been on the 360 .
So Natal does n't weigh down on the processors so hard that you can't play games .
Second , it requires fine motor control .
I raised my hands in the air , miming a steering wheel .
I had n't given the system any time to scan my body after kicking Matt out , but I stepped by foot forward , signaling the gas all the same .
The car accelerated .
I twisted my arms .
The car turned just the right amount .
Advertisement
Microsoft had clearly tweaked the Burnout code a bit , forcing the car to feel a bit more like a powerful sedan than a street illegal beast out of some Fast and Furious sequel .
And I 'm guessing that Natal 's ever so slight control delay was masked by the feeling of a looser - driving steering wheel that we find in more standard cars .
So I floor it , growing confident as I wave through traffic and slowly build speed .
I reach maximum velocity , throw my foot back to break , cut the wheel and toss the car into a spin .
Yes .
This feels right .
Just right .
Advertisement
Holy shit .
But Natal can't work this well .
It just CAN'T .
I need to break it , teach this Microsoft prototype a little humility .
What if I stand on my tip toes and steer eight feet in the air ?
Advertisement
The car handles fine .
What if I kneel on the ground and steer ?
Yup , it still works , save for a moment when my knee shifted and I tricked the machine — a fair mistake , even by my highly ridiculous dork standards .

Closing Thoughts
Matt : Project Natal is the vision of gaming that 's danced through people 's heads for decades — gaming without the abstraction of controllers , using your body and natural movements — which came more sharply into focus when Nintendo announced the Wii a few years ago .
I have n't been quite this blown away by a tech demo in a long time .
It looked neat onstage at Microsoft 's keynote .
Seeing it , feeling it in person , makes me want to believe that this what the future of gaming looks like — no buttons , no joysticks , no wands .
The only thing left to get rid of is the screen , and even that 'll happen soon enough .
Mark : 2010 ... or maybe even 2011 ... is just too long to wait .
I want Natal now .

How do you know that you 've made Bill O'Reilly feel like a chump ?
When he decides that he 's going to re-run his interview with you , without you there to defend yourself , and then selectively edit the footage and ignore large swaths of actual fact - based information ( as opposed to the largely non-fact - based " reporting " so prevalent to Fox News ) .
Such is the case with Salon.com 's Joan Walsh , who so thoroughly humiliated Billo on Friday that I 'm sure he stewed over it all weekend and decided that he had to reassert his lost manhood by bringing on sycophantic Mary Katherine Ham and Juan Williams to reassure him that Billo was still da man .
Note Bill 's disingenuous framing of the whole interview : it 's all about how the crazed liberals have no regard for the rights of the unborn from being murdered for callous reasons .
Never mind that his producers sandbagged Walsh by telling her that she was on to talk about right wing violence .
Never mind that the procedure that Dr. Tiller performed was not only legal , but highly regulated , and exceptionally rare .
The 60,000 casual late term abortions that Billo cites is pulled from his rather constipated posterior region and does n't pass even the most basic math logic test ( That would mean that Tiller performed 16 late term , casual , abortions every day , 7 days a week , for TEN YEARS ) .
Never mind that Dr. Tiller was acquitted by a Kansas grand jury for not violating the law ( after only deliberating for an hour ) and that the principal expert cited by O'Reilly , Dr. Paul R. McHugh , has his own controversies that call his agenda to question ( McHugh , a former member of Bush43 's Council on Bioethics , is a Vatican witness called to dismiss claims of DID in victims of priest molestation and has publicly scorned transsexuals and called for the end of gender reassignment surgery ) .
Yet for Bill , it 's all about the babies .
These poor , non-existent , viable fetuses that are being thrown out by their mothers ( no doubt liberals ) and enabled by the insidious Dr. Tiller .
Does n't Joan
Walsh understand how wrong it is to blame Bill O'Reilly for his inflammatory rhetoric over completely fabricated and untrue circumstances that may have resonated so much with someone with only a tenuous grasp on ethics that he may have actually taken an innocent man 's life ?
How dare Walsh be so intolerant ?
By the way , Walsh herself had a little fun on Twitter over Billo 's antics :
Fourteen years ago I was stabbed in the throat .
This is kind of a long story and it ’s not the point of this essay .
The point is that after my unsuccessful murder I was n’t unhappy for an entire year .
Winston Churchill ’s quote about the exhilaration of being shot at without result is verifiably true .
I was reminded of an old Ray Bradbury story , “ The Lost City of Mars , ” in which a man finds a miraculous machine that enables him to experience his own violent death over and over again , as many times as he likes — in locomotive collisions , race car crashes , exploding rockets — until he emerges flayed of all his free - floating guilt and unconscious longing for death , forgiven and free , finally alive .
I started brewing my own dandelion wine in a big Amish crock .
I listened to old pop songs too stupid to name in print .
I ’m not claiming I was continuously euphoric the whole time ; it ’s just that , during that grace period , nothing much could bother me or get me down .
The sort of horrible thing that I ’d always dreaded was going to happen to me had finally happened .
I figured I was off the hook for a while .
In a parallel universe only two millimeters away from this one ( the distance between the stiletto and my carotid ) , I had been flown home in the cargo hold instead of in coach .
Everything in this one , as far as I was concerned , was gravy .
My friends immediately mocked me out of my self - consciousness about the nerve damage that had left me with a lopsided smile .
I started brewing my own dandelion wine in a big Amish crock .
I listened to old pop songs too stupid to name in print .
And I developed a strange new laugh that ’s stayed with me to this day — a loud , raucous , barking thing that comes from deep in the diaphragm and makes people in bars or restaurants look over at me for a second to make sure I ’m not about to open up on the crowd with a weapon .
I wish I could recommend this experience to everyone .
It ’s a cliché that this is why people enjoy thrill - seeking pastimes ranging from harmless adrenaline fixes like roller coasters to suicide attempts with safety nets , like bungee jumping .
The catch is that to get the full effect you have to be genuinely uncertain that you ’re going to survive .
The best approximation would be to hire an incompetent hit man to assassinate you .
It ’s one of the maddening perversities of human psychology that we only notice we ’re alive when we ’re reminded we ’re going to die , sort of the same way some of us only appreciate our girlfriends after they ’re exes .
I saw the same thing happen , in a more profound and lasting way , to my father when he was terminally ill , and then to my mother after he died ; an almost literal lightening , a flippant indifference to the silly , quotidian nonsense that preoccupies most of us and ruins so much of our lives .
A neighbor was suing my father for some reason or other during his illness , but if you tried to talk to him about such “ serious ” matters he ’d just sing you old songs like “ A Bird In a Gilded Cage ” in a high , quavering old - man falsetto .
When my mother , who ’s now a leader in her church , sees people squabbling over minutiae or personal politics , she reminds them , diplomatically I ’m sure , to focus on the larger context .
It ’s easy now to dismiss that year as nothing more than a sort of hysterical high .
But you could also try to think of it as a glimpse of grace .
It did n’t last , of course .
You ca n’t feel grateful to be alive your whole life any more than you can stay passionately in love forever — or grieve forever , for that matter .
Time forces us all to betray ourselves and get back to the busywork of living in the world .
Before a year had gone by the same dumb everyday anxieties and frustrations began creeping back .
I ’d be disgusted to catch myself yelling in traffic , pounding on my computer , lying awake at night wondering what was going to become of me .
Once a year on my stabbiversary I remind myself that this is still my bonus life , a free round .
But now that I ’m back down in the messy , tedious slog of everyday emotional life , I have to struggle to keep things in what I still insist is their true perspective .
I know intellectually that all the urgent , pressing items on our mental lists — taxes , car repairs , our careers , the headlines — are so much idiot noise , and that what matters is spending time with people you love .
It ’s just hard to bear in mind when the hard drive crashes .
I was not cheered , a few years ago , to read about psychological studies suggesting that most people inevitably return to a certain emotional baseline after circumstantial highs and lows .
You ’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a major , permanently life - altering experience , but in truth it was less painful , and occasioned less serious reflection , than certain breakups I ’ve gone through .
If anything , it only reinforced the illusion that in the story of my life only supporting characters would die , while I , its protagonist and first - person narrator , would survive .
I ’ve demonstrated an impressive resilience in the face of valuable life lessons , and the main thing I seem to have learned from this one is that I am capable of learning nothing from almost any experience .
I do n’t know why we take our worst moods so much more seriously than our best ones , crediting depression with more clarity than euphoria .
It ’s easy now to dismiss that year as nothing more than the same sort of shaky , hysterical high you ’d experience after being clipped by a taxi .
But you could also try to think of it as a glimpse of grace .
It ’s like the revelation I had when I was a kid the first time I ever flew in an airplane : when you break through the cloud cover you realize that above the passing squalls and doldrums there is a realm of eternal sunlight , so keen and brilliant you have to squint against it , a vision to hold onto and take back with you when you descend once more beneath the clouds , under the oppressive , petty jurisdiction of the local weather .

ARToolKit is a software library for building Augmented Reality ( AR ) applications .
These are applications that involve the overlay of virtual imagery on the real world .
For example , in the image to the right a three - dimensional virtual character appears standing on a real card .
It can be seen by the user in the head set display they are wearing .
When the user moves the card , the virtual character moves with it and appears attached to the real object .
One of the key difficulties in developing Augmented Reality applications is the problem of tracking the users viewpoint .
In order to know from what viewpoint to draw the virtual imagery , the application needs to know where the user is looking in the real world .
ARTool Kit uses computer vision algorithms to solve this problem .
The ARToolKit video tracking libraries calculate the real camera position and orientation relative to physical markers in real time .
This enables the easy development of a wide range of Augmented Reality applications .
Some of the features of ARToolKit include : Single camera position / orientation tracking .
Tracking code that uses simple black squares .
The ability to use any square marker patterns .
Easy camera calibration code .
Fast enough for real time AR applications .
SGI IRIX , Linux , MacOS and Windows OS distributions .
Distributed with complete source code .

SHANGHAI -- Canadian consular officials failed Tuesday to gain access to 23 Canadians forcibly quarantined in northeastern China over the swine flu scare .
In a telephone interview from the Changchun hotel where he is confined , Montrealer Martin Leroy Deslauriers said : “ The consular guy came from Beijing today but he was n’t able to see us .
He stayed for about two minutes .
The Chinese authorities did n’t want him to see us .
“ It is very strange because in the hotel , the employees , they do n’t wear masks or anything .
He could have just worn a mask and seen us , but the Chinese authorities told him that if he did , he had to stay in quarantine , too . ”
The students have been sequestered since last Saturday when they were immediately separated from other airline passengers on arrival in Changchun .
Each had his or her temperature taken and even though all were normal , according to the students , they were told to put on face masks and led to a bus .
Asked if he thought the Chinese authorities were targeting Canadians , Mr. Deslauriers replied : “ Absolutely . ”
Why ? “ I think it is because we have about 100 infected people in Canada ...
The [ Chinese ] government must have their reasons , but honestly , I think it is mostly symbolic . ”
That said , Mr. Deslauriers , 26 , is quick to joke : “ We ’re having a nice quarantine . ”
“ We can go in the yard , we can go outside , we have a ping - pong table , pool , and our teacher is giving us classes . ”
He added : “ The food is very , very good .
I do n’t always know what it is , but there is pork , vegetables , rice , noodles , soup , a lot of choices . ”
The students , mostly from the Universite de Montreal with a few from Laval , in Quebec City , are still jet - lagged from their flight to China and still getting up bright and early , so it makes for long days with only exercise , one class and an ultra-slow Internet connection to break the tedium .
But Mr. Deslauriers says they are getting by fine , so far .
“ They have beer here , so it is easy to pass time with beer . ”
He admits : “ One or two people are very frustrated , but the atmosphere is good for now .
But who knows , maybe in a few days it is going to be different . ”
So far , all of the “ health checks ” during the quarantine have been self - administered .
No doctor has come to the hotel and the students are being asked to take their own temperatures three times a day .
They are supposed to report only if it is elevated , which no one has admitted to so far .
If everyone continues to remain healthy , the quarantine should end this Saturday and the students can begin their classes in earnest .
They are all in East Asian Studies and were supposed to spend 10 - weeks doing an intensive Mandarin language course at a university in Changchun .
Since the students were quarantined , the Department of Foreign Affairs has added a new caution to its website , warning Canadians : “ Travellers entering or exiting [ China ] may be subjected to medical examinations and , in some cases , quarantined for up to seven days for medical observation if they are believed to have come in contact with a suspected carrier of the virus . ”
The Home Office has confirmed there is still no timetable for the rollout of ID card readers , without which carrying out effective ID checks is impossible .
So even though the government is continuing to foist the cards on foreigners , airside workers at City of London and Manchester airports and pilots , there is no way to check the cards are genuine .
Official advice is to flick the cards with a fingernail because they make a distinctive noise .
Home Office minister Phil Woolas told the House of Commons yesterday that there was no schedule for the distribution of ID card readers to police stations , border entry points , job centres or local authorities .
He said : " In time , card readers will be made available so that the cardholder ’s biometric and biographical features can be checked against the card , although a timetable for their introduction has not been established . "
The cards are already being handed to foreign nationals with leave to stay , and the lucky people of Manchester will get the chance to hand over £ 60 to get their hands on a card from later this year .
Wacky Jacqui Smith has previously claimed that people can't wait for ID cards .
The point of the cards was to provide biometric checks of identity .
That information is held on a chip within the card - without a reader there is no way to access this information .
Anyone using the card to identify someone is advised to flick the card to check how it sounds .
If they still have concerns there is a phoneline with further advice .
It emerged in February that the government was pushing ahead with issuing cards despite the lack of readers .
Tory leader David Cameron has promised to scrap the scheme if elected . ®

Today President Barack Obama released a statement about the Iranian government ’s violent actions against its own people .
Interestingly , Obama used a quote from Martin Luther King to voice his support for the Iranian people .
The quote , “ The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ”
Obama said , “ The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching .
We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost .
We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people .
The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected , and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights . ”
The not so subtle point to the Iranian people was sent by Obama through a Martin Luther King quote , “ Martin Luther King once said – “ The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ” I believe that .
The international community believes that .
And right now , we are bearing witness to the Iranian peoples ’ belief in that truth , and we will continue to bear witness . ”

The message that the president was trying to send was that Iranian people have to fight their own battle for basic rights .
This is quite a change from the neo-con tactics of the Bush administration , which would have probably strongly gotten behind the protesters , while contemplating shifting troops from Iraq to Iran .
I ca n’t believe that anyone is still touting the regime change doctrine , while the US is still propping up governments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This statement also signaled to me the beginning of a shift in Obama ’s statements towards Iran .
If the violence continues to increase , I suspect that Obama will become more vocal in his support of human rights .
As the issue surrounding these protests shifts from election fraud to calls for freedom , Obama will be able to more direct with his statements .
The worst thing that could happen for everyone involved except the regime would be a return to cowboy diplomacy .
If Obama meddles in Iran , it would represent a complete contradiction of his stated policies .
Obama is doing the right thing , by staying out of the domestic issues while pressuring Iran on human rights .
Nothing short of threats and bombs will make the neo cons happy , but with the complete failure of all neo con policies , they lack credibility and should not be listened to .
We do n't mean a palm full of ass in a good way — when were you not happy when you had a palm full of ass — but a palm full of something really disgusting .
Yeah , this thing right here .

Sasha Shulgin , Psychedelic Chemist By DENNIS ROMERO
LAFAYETTE , Calif . --
Perhaps it was a sign of things to come when a seven - story Monterrey Pine came crashing down on the property of old Alexander T. Shulgin -- Sasha , they call him -- missing his musty cobweb - entangled drug lab by inches .
It could have been a good sign because the cantankerous 70 - year - old was n't around the back - yard workshop conducting one of his legendary experiments , which have been known to involve him downing any number of the new psychedelic drugs he invents in the name of science .
Imagine losing your mind on some unknown compound with unknown powers ( some of this stuff makes LSD look like Vitamin D ) -- and a tree the length of three buses rocks your world to Richter proportions .
The aliens have arrived !
Maybe , though , it was a sign of nefarious things to come .
Like the DEA guys who came knocking only days later , sniffing around the lab in search of improprieties .
Or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency people who checked out the lab that day last June , taking notes while nosing around the beakers .
( They found everything in order , says a representative . )
The feds have arrived !
To tell the truth , Sasha Shulgin does n't much care anymore what the government thinks .
He 's tippy - toed around the law and the lawmen for long enough - - 30 years now .
Since the mid-'60s , the tall , lanky , silver - haired chemistry professor has quietly invented drugs under the cover of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration license that allows him to analyze contraband so he can give expert testimony in drug trials .
It does n't exactly allow him to invent the stuff , though , and Uncle Sam appears to be getting cold feet about Shulgin 's exploits .
But Shulgin 's life 's work is practically complete and he 's ready to shout it out .
" I feel the need of a public voice with some level of academic background . . . "
His message : " All drugs should be made legal . "
With or without the DEA 's approval , the public is now able to see pages and pages documenting all the world 's known psychedelic drugs -- many of them invented by The Man himself : the compound structures , the lab names , street names and , more importantly , what they do to people or , more precisely , what they 've done to him and wife Ann , his 64 - year - old partner - in - chem .
Part I , a book they call " Pihkal , " was self - published in 1991 .
Part II , to be called " Tihkal , " is due at the end of the year .
The two books provide recipes for almost every mind - bending drug known to humankind .
To Shulgin , the books provide scientific knowledge that proves drugs are a tool for the human mind .
" The track record , " he says , " is that there is great promise . "
No one else on the planet has done more drugs , they say , than Sasha and Ann Shulgin .
He is known for reviving the almost - century - old designer drug ecstasy , earning him the title " stepfather of MDMA . "
" What he almost single - handedly attempted to do , " says psychedelic supporter and Nobel Prize - winning chemist Kary Mullis , " was to chart out this whole area of compounds . "
Says psychedelic godfather Timothy Leary , " I consider Shulgin and his wife to be two of the most important scientists of the 20th Century . "
The Shulgins are legends among some academics -- LSD inventor Albert Hofmann , now retired in Switzerland , is a friend .
But they are little known to the outside world -- they were never a part of the counterculture .
Shulgin's work has put him in the odd position of being a source of information for both the Establishment ( during his decade working for Dow Chemical and his two decades testifying for both the prosecution and the defense in drug cases ) and psychedelic drug advocates ( his science has been used to bolster the cause for legal psychedelic drug research on humans , which is now taking place after a 20 - year hiatus ) .
" There 's nothing wrong with making information available , " he says , legs crossed and drinking iced tea on his patio .
The DEA , which repeatedly declined to comment on the Shulgin case , might disagree .
The agency did confirm in a statement that it is attempting to strip Shulgin of his drug - handling license and that a hearing on the matter has been scheduled for Feb.
13 .
And the U.S. attorney 's office in San Francisco is keeping a file on Shulgin , although no charges have been brought .
No one from that office would comment either .
It 's hard to find anyone with ill will toward Shulgin , although there are those opposed to the philosophy of his ilk .
Psychedelic drugs are dangerous , opponents say - - toxic to animals and dangerous to those who lose their minds and attempt crazy things like trying to fly .
" One of the things psychedelic drug activists promote is that drugs are not a problem -- that we have n't learned to use them properly , " Wayne J. Roques , a retired Miami - based DEA agent and anti-drug activist , said in an interview last year .
" That 's one of the nonsensical things that they say , " Roques said .
" They seem to think it 's a human condition to use psychoactive drugs and that 's simply not so . "
" I first explored mescaline in the late ' 50s , " Shulgin says .
" Three - hundred - fifty to 400 milligrams .
I learned there was a great deal inside me , " he replies .
" That 's a considerable experience , " Ann says , puffing a cigarette and nodding .
Shulgin 's romance with psychedelics started after the war .
He served his time in the Navy and finished school at UC Berkeley , earning a Ph.D. in biochemistry .
" There was no mention of rebellion at that point , " Shulgin says .
" I was all smiles , open . "
In the '60s he did post - doctorate work in psychiatry and pharmacology at UC San Francisco and became a senior research chemist at Dow Chemical Co .
He invented a profit - making insecticide , so Dow gave him a long leash .
But while America 's anti-drug fervor picked up , Dow found itself in the uncomfortable position of holding several patents on psychedelic drugs .
Shulgin left the company in 1965 , built his lab and became , as he puts it , a " scientific consultant . "
That meant teaching public health at Berkeley and San Francisco General Hospital , among other jobs .
It also eventually meant inventing more than 150 drugs in his lab .
" To me , " he says , " having your own lab is a very extreme pleasure . "
Shulgin 's spread sits atop a rolling , rural utopia east of Berkeley .
The old brick lab lies down the path from his boxy white house , which sits on property that has been in the family for more than 50 years .
To this day his lab looks low - tech - - lined with beakers , test - tubes , stills and pumps .
It 's funky but functional , like Shulgin .
He wears handmade huaraches with his tuxedo at special events and drives a ' 73 bug .
Shulgin met Ann at Berkeley in 1979 .
Ann , became Shulgin 's soul mate , a fellow psychedelic explorer with a penchant for Peyote .
( " I 've read all of Castaneda , " she says . )
They were married in Shulgin 's back yard in 1981 .
The man who married them , they say , was a DEA agent .
As Ann put it , " Before ' Pihkal , ' we had a real good relationship with the DEA .
They have few people they can talk to who are on the other side of the fence who are honest . "
Says psychedelic drug activist Rick Doblin , " That was his Faustian bargain - - in order to do his work , he had to be useful to the DEA . "
" It was not a quid pro quo , " Shulgin says .
" I make my research available to the government as much as anyone else . "
Shulgin wrote the book on the law and drugs --" Controlled Substances : Chemical & Legal Guide to Federal Drug Laws " ( Ronin Publishing , 1988 ) , a book that sits on the desk of many law enforcement officials to this day .
" He 's a reputable researcher , " says Geraline Lin , a drug researcher at the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
By the ' 80s , though , Shulgin was n't famous for any books he wrote or any drugs he invented , but rather for a drug he did n't invent .
In the '70s , a friend had suggested he check out a pill that was going around called MDMA , or " empathy . "
He tested it , tried it and wrote a lot about it in academic journals .
For better or for worse , Shulgin rescued the drug ( known in the lab as methylenedioxy - methamphetamine ) from obscurity .
Invented around 1912 , no one found much use for it until Shulgin came along .
He suggested time and again that the stuff was good for therapy .
The drug 's effects are described as lying somewhere between those of LSD and speed .
" I still have n't found anything like it to this day , " Shulgin says .
But the drug found an empathetic audience in the nightclub crowd .
Dealers renamed the drug " ecstasy " for better marketability .
And the U.S. government outlawed MDMA in 1985 .
A young group of scientists led by Doblin tried to preserve the drug 's legality , arguing that the stuff was valuable for unearthing repressed thoughts and memories .
Shulgin assisted the best he could , providing science from the shadows .
But the government found that the drug caused brain damage in animals .
" The one thing that is clear , " says UCLA psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel , " is that there is a lot of damage here with MDMA . "
Shulgin says testing drugs on animals is n't worth dog doo .
" There are real problems involved in testing a rat for empathy or changes in self - image , " he told an English magazine last year .
" In a lot of ways , Sasha was demoralized after MDMA became illegal , " says Doblin , president of the Charlotte , N.C. - based Multidisciplinary Assn. for Psychedelic Studies .
" It was the best candidate for legal therapy out of all the drugs he helped create . "
But there was always Shulgin 's trusty lab , which provided fodder for intimate trips with Ann and friends .
Those times , up at his hilltop home , amid the rosemary bushes and live oak , surrounded by the smells of fennel , rue and bay , were magical , they say .
" Inventing new psychoactive drugs , " Ann says , " is like composing new music . "
Sometimes , the music could be maddening .
One time a friend , testing out a new Shulgin creation he called 5 - TOM , became temporarily paralyzed and completely zombie - fied .
It terrified the Shulgins .
" There 's no experience of this complexity without instances of difficulty , " Shulgin says .
A few drugs Shulgin invented , substances with names such as STP and 2CB , escaped to the streets of San Francisco .
Amateur chemists read Shulgin 's published research and made batches for sale .
Like most of the drugs in his book , they were included on the federal government 's outlaw list of drugs , called Schedule I .
" A lot of the materials in Schedule I are my invention , " Shulgin says .
" I 'm not sure if it 's a point of pride or a point of shame . "
Shulgin 's rebound came in 1991 when " Pihkal : A Chemical Love Story " ( Transform Press ) was published .
For fans of psychedelia , it was an instant collector 's item .
" I think Pihkal , " Leary says , " is right up there with Darwin 's ' Origins . . . ' "
" The history of psychedelic drugs is still being written , " says Siegel , who is respected both by the authorities and legalization activists .
" Even though Shulgin 's observations may not be entirely scientific , they are an important start since he 's the only one who has made some of these observations and taken some of these drugs . "
" Pihkal , " which has sold more than 15,000 copies , covers about half the psychedelic drugs known to humankind -- the " phenethylamines I have known and loved , " as the book 's title suggests .
The phenethylamine group of compounds includes such substances as MDMA and mescaline .
The other half - - a group that includes everything from toad venom to magic mushrooms -- will be included in the forthcoming " Tihkal " - - for " tryptamines I have known and loved . "
To understand the Shulgins is to understand their unwavering belief that these drugs have untold powers and that we , as a society , are ignorant of these powers -- like early man who shied away from fire .
Yet Shulgin 's words are almost always sober : " I 'm very confident that there will come a time when this work will be recognized for its medical value . "
In 1992 he testified before NIDA that psychedelic drug research using humans should once again be made fully legal ( it was all but outlawed in 1970 ) .
Shulgin invoked his own legally questionable research on humans .
At the meeting , says Doblin , who was there , " he describes the work that he 's doing with human beings , in a way that its clear that it 's illegal . "
Even so , Shulgin influenced NIDA 's position that human studies should restart , which they did .
" Shulgin put himself on the line , " says Lin , who chaired the meeting .
" It was a scientific meeting , not a political one , " says Shulgin , understated as usual .
" I was explicit , but not provocative . "
Later , Shulgin makes this much clear : " It 's my stance that what I do is nothing illegal . "
In 1986 , the federal government outlawed research on humans using drugs that resemble banned drugs , called analogs .
Before then , research using designer drugs that were n't expressly outlawed skirted the rules ( using an MDEA compound instead of MDMA , for example ) .
" Since ' 86 , I 've stopped all research in this direction , " he says , i.e. , he does n't test drugs on humans .
He adds that he still invents drugs and feels it 's still legal as long as he has his drug - handling license .
" I synthesize materials for publication , " he says .
This balancing act is in response to the pressure he 's been feeling from the DEA .
It 's ironic , say Shulgin 's supporters :
He has provided science to the government ( most often in cases involving methamphetamine ) and all takers only to be taken to task in the end for that very science .
" Shulgin 's not a criminal , " says Mullis , " he 's a chemist . "
So imagine Shulgin 's consternation recently when he found himself playing a gig ( he plays the viola with a local orchestra for kicks ) at the nearby Bohemian Grove and club guest Newt Gingrich starts talking about . . . drugs .
Normally , this all - male club ( the word exclusive is not exclusive enough to describe its clientele ) is not so serious -- the site of nude rampaging , mock - Druid fire rituals and all manner of back - to - roots male bonding .
Snort - Snort .
So when Gingrich started talking about a topic Shulgin has studied for 30 years , he kept his mouth shut and his ears open .
" He was very correct , " Shulgin says .
" You have two alternatives :
We either have to take Draconian means and break the back of the problem , or legalize drugs .
I believe in the latter choice . "
Tiananmen Square , 1989 The Declassified History A National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book
The Chinese army crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 had an enormous effect on the course of U.S. - China relations .
The deaths of democracy protesters resulted in U.S. sanctions , suspensions of high - level contacts , and a halt in the transfer of military technology .
The controversy continues to this day , as demonstrated by the reaction of many concerning President Clinton 's decision to appear in the square with Chinese leaders during his June 1998 trip to China .

Return to the Introduction
Documents 1 - 6 : Student Demonstrations in 1985 and 1986
The student demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989 were not the first time in the 1980s that Chinese authorities were faced with organized demonstrations expressing dissatisfaction with their rule .
In late 1985 , and again in late 1986 , Beijing and Shanghai were the site of student protests .
Students carried banners with slogans such as " Law , Not Authoritarianism " and " Long Live Democracy . "
In China , a state with significant curbs on free expression , demonstrators have often seized upon politically tolerable causes -- such as anti-Japanese sentiment or the commemoration of a popular Chinese leader -- as vehicles to gather together and express their dissatisfaction with the policies of the Chinese government .
Document 1 , a U.S. embassy cable , suggests possible meanings of a tepid anti-Japanese demonstration in Tiananmen Square following a Sino - Japanese volleyball game on November 20 , 1985 .
Embassy officials note that perhaps " someone wanted to stir up trouble to embarrass the authorities , " and that " the semi- holiday atmosphere among the students at the square ... points to a lack of fear of retribution . "
A subsequent cable ( Document 2 ) reports the arrest of 23 of the students who were suspected " ringleaders " of the November 20 demonstration .
" The authorities , " the cable notes , " knew whom to look for because they had infiltrated both preparations for the demonstration and the demonstration itself . "
Furthermore , " one armed police installation , shortly before last weeks demonstration , looked like it was preparing for a war .  "
Document 3 , a U.S. embassy report from late December 1985 , notes that two student demonstrations had occurred in Beijing in the last several days .
These demonstrations concerned student issues , the presence of the PLA on campus , as well as nuclear testing in Xinjiang province .
The cable comments that " we do find a bit astonishing a demonstration in China ... on nuclear weapons testing . "
The following December a new round of demonstrations , this time explicitly calling for political reforms , sprang up in Chinas cities .
Document 4 , a U.S. embassy cable from December 24 , 1986 , reports on a small student demonstration in Beijing on the evening of December 23 , 1986 .
The cable cites an editorial in the People 's Daily , the state news daily , expressing sympathy with the students but making it clear that " the limits of official toleration were being approached . "
Later in the cable , embassy officials note that " political stability has always been a critical consideration in China .
There can be no doubt that the authorities will crack down , and crack down hard , if stability seems to be being called into question . "
Document 5 , an intelligence summary from U.S. Pacific Command , reports that thousands of protesters filled Tiananmen Square on New Years Day 1987 , and that , " Some 24 troublemakers  reportedly were taken away by the police for education and examination .  "
On January 17 , another intelligence summary ( Document 6 ) reports that noted reformer and Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang had resigned , apparently " a result of the recent student demonstrations . "
This would not be the last time that the fate of Hu Yaobang would be associated with student demonstrations .
His death on April 15 , 1989 proved to be the catalyst that brought about the massive demonstrations in Tiananmen Square .
The demonstration that had begun as an expression of grief over the loss of a popular political figure had , by April 26 , taken on a decidedly political character .
On that day Peoples Daily published an editorial noting that ,
After the memorial meeting , an extremely small number of people with ulterior purposes continued to take advantage of the young students  feelings of grief for Comrade Hu Yaobang ...
This is a planned conspiracy and a disturbance .
Its essence is to , once and for all , negate the leadership of the CPC [ Chinese Communist Party ] and the socialist system ...
All comrades in the party and the people throughout the country must soberly recognize the fact that our country will have no peaceful days if this disturbance is not checked resolutely .

Documents 7 - 11 : On the Brink
On May 20 , the Chinese leadership imposed martial law on the Beijing Municipality and appeared to be moving toward the use of force to clear the square .
2
Nevertheless , U.S. officials were still hoping to see the standoff between the government and the student demonstrators resolved peacefully .
While the documentary record is far from complete , Document 7 , a heavily excised summary transcript of a May 23 meeting in Washington between President George Bush and Wan Li , Chairman of the Standing Committee of China 's National Peoples Congress , indicates that the subject of the student demonstrations did come up at their meeting .
Shortly thereafter , Wan cut short his U.S. visit and , on May 27 , publicly endorsed the governments martial law order .
3
As the crowds continued to gather in Tiananmen Square in the days following the death of Hu Yaobang , hard - liners in the party leadership prepared to move against both the students and the more conciliatory leaders within the party itself .
4 Document 8 , a State Department intelligence summary submitted to the Secretary on the morning of June 2 , notes that hard - liners " remain unable to resolve the leadership crisis or to remove students from Tiananmen Square . "
The next days morning intelligence summary ( Document 9 ) reports on the first use of force on both sides -- with the police firing tear gas on crowds gathered near Tiananmen and the crowds retaliating by stoning the police .
The next two documents report on developments at Tiananmen shortly before the PRC employed force against the protesters .
Document 10 describes the " unorganized retreat " of a first wave of lightly armed soldiers , and notes that it might have been intended " to prove that much stronger force will be necessary to regain control . "
Document 11 , reporting the advance of more heavily equipped soldiers toward the city center , concludes by noting that the fact that the troops are helmeted and are armed with automatic weapons " suggest [s ] that the force option is real . "
Documents 12 - 29 : The Crackdown
It would not be long after the U.S. Embassy in Beijing warned that the use of force was an option that it began reporting the PLA 's attacks on demonstrators .
That reporting , as well as information obtained by other means , is summarized in Document 12 , a cable from the U.S. embassy in Beijing .
The cable notes that troops , using automatic weapons , had advanced in tanks , armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) , and trucks from several directions toward Tiananmen Square .
The cable also reports that the American Embassy believed that the 50 - 70 deaths reported in the foreign media were probably much too low .
It also notes that several American reporters " were severely beaten by Chinese troops on Tiananmen Square . "
As events in Beijing unfolded , the American Embassy provided a near - continuous flow of reporting , based on the accounts of newsmen , residents , and the observations of embassy officials .
The Secretary of States intelligence summary for the following morning ( Document 13 ) reports that " deaths from the military assault on Tiananmen Square range from 180 to 500 ; thousands more have been injured . "
It also describes how " thousands of civilians stood their ground or swarmed around military vehicles .
APCs were set on fire , and demonstrators besieged troops with rocks , bottles , and Molotov cocktails . "
In addition to providing information on the events of June 4 , the cables provide dramatic examples of the kinds of intelligence provided by diplomatic reporting .
Document 14 , an embassy cable from June 4 , reports on confrontations between soldiers and protesters , some of which ended in deaths , and vandalism by military personnel , who one source claimed were breaking the windows of shops , banks , and other buildings .
On the same day , another cable from the U.S. Embassy ( Document 15 ) reports , among other things , the statement of a Chinese - American who had witnessed the crackdown who claimed that , " The beating to death of a PLA soldier , who was in the first APC to enter Tiananmen Square , in full view of the other waiting PLA troops , appeared to have sparked the shooting that followed . "
In addition to these eyewitness accounts of the crackdown , other cables ( Document 16 ) also provide information on PLA troop positions and casualty estimates .
One section of the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 5th ( Document 17 ) , titled " After the Bloodbath , " focuses on developments in Beijing .
It reports that " troops continued to fire indiscriminately at citizens in the area near Tiananmen Square . "
It also notes the destruction of a large number of military vehicles , threats to execute students , and the potential for violent resistance by students .
The intelligence report also provides details on the worldwide reaction to the massacre , noting the unanimous condemnation of the " bloody repression " by foreign leaders , " regardless of ideology . "
After the square had been cleared Chinese Army troops continued to occupy the city5 , with continuing reports of sporadic gunfire and interfactional fighting among PLA units .
The possibility that units of the PLA would turn on each other was raised in the June 6th edition of the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary as well as embassy cables from June 5 - 6 .
An embassy cable from June 5 ( Document 18 ) reports that armored units from the PLA 's 27th Army " seem poised for attack by other PLA units , " and notes that a " western military attaché " largely blames the 27th for the June 3 massacre , and says that the 27th " is accused of killing even the soldiers of other units when they got in the way . "
The June 6 edition of the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary ( Document 19 ) states that the 27th Army is " being blamed for the worst atrocities against civilians during Saturday night 's attack on Tiananmen Square , " and also notes that " some clashes between military units reportedly have occurred . "
Document 20 , an embassy cable from June 6 , refers to " persistent rumours of splits among the military and fighting among military units . "
Meanwhile , as embassy officials continued to report on the events on the ground , the State Department went to work assessing the political ramifications of the crackdown .
Document 21 , the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 7 , discusses the reaction of Asian leaders to the violence , and reports rumors " that at least some leaders may have envisioned an outcome that would blame most atrocities on the 27th Army , relieve its top commanders , and remove senior officials who ordered armed action against civilians . "
The June 7 summary also reports that PLA troops had fired shots in the direction of U.S. embassy apartments , an incident covered in greater detail in Document 22 , an embassy cable from June 7 .
It reports that as a PLA troop convoy was passing near the embassy residence , " Heavy automatic weapons fire ... was heard ... Emboffs [ U.S. Embassy officials ] reported bullets shattered the windows of many apartments in the Jianguomenwai diplomatic compound . "
An " Uneasy Calm " returned to being by June 8 , according to the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 9 ( Document 23 ) .
It reports on missing dissidents , police actions at universities , martial law directives , and the first public appearance of Premier Li Peng since the massacre .
Shortly thereafter , the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research published an Intelligence Brief titled " Current Situation in China : Background and Prospects " ( Document 24 ) .
The document observes that " at the heart of the crisis in China is the power struggle for the succession to Deng Xiaoping , " and goes on to analyze the various elements of that struggle .
The first appearance of Deng Xiaoping since the crackdown was reported in Document 25 , the Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 10 , noting that " Deng Xiaoping s public appearance yesterday ... signified his endorsement of martial law and the militarys action against the population . "
The Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 14 ( Document 27 ) reports on the efforts of the Chinese leadership to demonstrate unity and portray a return to normal government operations , even while continuing the crackdown on the alleged leaders of the demonstrations , reports of which were then appearing in the Chinese press .
By June 21 , the Morning Summary ( Document 29 ) was reporting that , " More than 1,500 have been arrested ... including at least six of the 21  most wanted  student leaders . "
The June 14 Morning Summary and the one for the following day address one of the many problems in U.S. - Chinese relations that resulted from the Tiananmen crisis -- the U.S. Embassy 's decision to provide sanctuary for Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi in the days following the crackdown .
The June 15 Morning Summary ( Document 28 ) notes that the treatment of the issue in the Chinese media indicates that it represents an important conflict of interest with the United States .
Arrest warrants for Fang and his wife had been issued by Chinese security forces on June 11 and an embassy cable sent on that day ( Document 26 ) reports that Chinese radio and television announcers had read a " letter " on the air " which accused the US government of supporting rebels and providing refuge for the criminal who created this violence .  "
Documents 30 - 35 : The Aftermath
As the day - to - day crisis atmosphere faded , the U.S. sought to come to a precise understanding of the events and determine how they would affect China 's future and U.S. - Chinese relations .
Reports based on the accounts of eyewitnesses ( Document 30 and Document 31 ) represent an effort by the American Embassy in Beijing to provide a concise description of the events that led up to the deaths at Tiananmen Square and to " set the record straight . "
Document 31 is based on the eyewitness accounts of embassy officials , western reporters and diplomats , and U.S. students present on or near Tiananmen Square .
In its introduction it notes that while civilian casualties probably did not reach the figure of 3,000 used in some press accounts , " they surely far outnumbered official figures . "
The body of the cable consists of three parts : a précis of events , an analysis of the extent and causes of military and civilian casualties , and a chronology of developments from 3 p.m. on June 3 to shortly after noon on June 4 .
A final note states that " Sporadic killing continued at least through Wednesday , June 6 . "
In the days immediately following the crackdown , U.S. and Chinese officials were already sensitive to how recent events would impact the bilateral relationship .
On June 5 , President Bush had announced the imposition of a package of sanctions on China , to include " suspension of all government - to - government sales and commercial exports of weapons , " and the " suspension of visits between U.S. and Chinese military leaders . "
Document 32 , an embassy cable sent three weeks later , notes that a military official had lodged a formal complaint that " strongly protested recent U.S. military sanctions , " and had canceled the planned visits of U.S. military officials .
Embassy officials felt this to be a " measured response to U.S. sanctions , " indicating that the official " did not adopt a confrontational attitude and emphasized that both sides should take a long - term view of the military relationship . "
Two days later , on June 29 , the State Department prepared " Themes , " ( Document 33 ) , in support of Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft , who were to leave the next day on a secret trip to China to meet with Deng Xiaoping .
" Themes " provided the framework for the discussions the two emissaries would have with Deng .
It focused on the global strategic benefits of the U.S. - PRC relationship for both sides , the impact Chinese " internal affairs " could have on the relationship ( characterizing the American people as being " shocked and repelled by much of what they have seen and read about recent events in China " ) , Bush 's view of the importance of the long - term relationship between the US and PRC , and the impact that further repression could have on US relations with China .
As Scowcroft later remembered , " The purpose of my trip ... was not negotiations -- there was nothing yet to negotiate -- but an effort to keep open the lines of communication . "
6
By late July INR analysts continued to update the situation in China under martial law and also had the opportunity to address the impact of the crisis on China .
Document 34 , a July 26 status report discusses developments since the crackdown .
An intelligence research report ( Document 35 ) asks " how did China get to this point ? , " explores the impact of the crisis on China 's domestic and foreign policy , and measures the international reaction to the crackdown .
Among the judgments reached is that the situation in China would remain unsettled " at least until Deng Xiaoping and other party elders die . "
Scowcroft and Eagleburger returned to Beijing in December 1989 to brief Chinese leaders on President Bushs summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Malta and to " explore the possibility of developing a road map toward better relations . " 7
In the interim , Bush -- in a concession he hoped would elicit a positive response from the Chinese government -- had vetoed legislation permitting Chinese exchange students to remain in the US until the Chinese government improved its human rights record .
8
Despite these concessions , the Bush administration soon realized that their efforts had not borne fruit .
Scowcroft later recalled their disappointment :
After the Chinese released only a handful of dissidents ... it became apparent that the entire , slow process was grinding to a halt -- and we had no significant steps to point to in order to justify any normalization of our strained relations ...
It is my sense that one of the most dramatic upheavals in Eastern Europe -- the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu - - was the main reason .9
Postscript 1999 : Ten Years After
In the months preceding the ten - year anniversary of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations Chinese government and party officials have reexamined and often revised the official version of the military crackdown .
In April 1999 , Zhu Muzhi , the president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies ( a government think tank ) observed that , " If the way we handled the Tiananmen crisis was incorrect , we would not have todays prosperity .
China would be in chaos .
The people would have risen and resisted the government . "
He added that , " At that time , the police were poorly equipped ...
They had never witnessed such large - scale protests ...
They did not have rubber bullets then nor gas masks ...
The only weapons they had were their guns .
"
12
In a slightly more conciliatory gesture during his U.S. tour , President Zhu Rongji told reporters that , " The episode in 1989 [ happened ] because they wanted democracy but they didnt want the rule of law .
That s why it happened . "
Zhu -- who as mayor of Shanghai in 1989 was credited with peacefully resolving the demonstrations there -- thus became the first senior Chinese leader to acknowledge the democratic aspirations of the demonstrators .

Document 1 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , A Student Demonstration of Sorts in Tiananmen Square ( November 21 , 1985 )
In China , a state with significant curbs on free expression , citizens have often used " legitimate " causes to express dissent in socially acceptable terms .
One notion that often has official support is the expression of anti-Japanese sentiment .
So it was in November 1985 , when anonymous flyers appeared urging Beijing students to stage a rally at the conclusion of a Sino - Japanese volleyball match .
While nationalistic in tone , the flyer decried the Japanese " economic invasion " of China and also those Chinese " princes " ( a clear reference to members of the Chinese Communist Party ) who have risen to power during this time of " uneven development . "
Although the demonstration was apparently rather tepid , this document points to the possibility that " someone wanted to stir up trouble and embarrass the authorities . "
Embassy comments also note the curious fact that although the flyer was " not very complimentary toward the Communist Party the authorities , who clearly know about the call for a demonstration in advance let it proceed . "
Document 2: Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , Government Arrests Student Demonstrators ( November 25 , 1985 )
While the first document downplays the importance of the November 20 demonstration , another cable , reporting the reaction of Chinese authorities in the subsequent five days , draws more significant lessons .
In the cable , Embassy officials report information gleaned from an unidentified source that Chinese security forces have detained more than 100 students and arrested 23 suspected " ringleaders " involved in the demonstration .
According to the source , " The authorities knew whom to look for because they had infiltrated both preparations for the demonstration and the demonstration itself . "
The fact that the authorities had been so concerned about controlling the demonstration , the cable concludes , " reflects the extent to which the Communist Party has lost the initiative on campus . "
Document 3 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , More Student Demonstrations ( December 23 , 1985 )
Demonstrations again sprang up in December 1985 , and students were increasingly bold in their expressions of dissatisfaction with various government policies .
In one of the demonstrations , at the Beijing Agricultural University , students decried the stationing of a PLA unit on the university campus .
The document also reports another incident , that the cables authors call " astonishing , " which involved several hundred students from the Bejing Central College of Nationalities who were protesting the nuclear weapons testing program in Xinjiang Province in western China .
Document 4 : From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , Student Demonstrations Update ( December 24 , 1986 )
Demonstrations again occurred in late - 1986 , and Embassy reports were increasingly fearful that Chinese authorities would crack down on the students and set back the pace of political reform .
The cable notes how the recent spate of demonstrations provoked criticism from the Chinese government who warned that the adoption of " overly energetic methods " to express views could affect stability and interfere with societal functions .
The cable also reports the views of several different sources , whose identities remain classified , warning about the possible repercussions for the cause of freedom in China if the students do not proceed more cautiously .
One source reportedly told U.S. officials that " the senior leadership was fully focusing on the demonstrations , " and that " they had multiple sources of information , including both party and government channels . "
Another source , in a dinner conversation with U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord , warned that " opponents of political liberalization in the leadership would use the protests to underline the dangers of democracy . "
The document warns that if the demonstrations become too strident , and particularly if they are staged in Beijing , " then the entire affair could become a net liability for reform with seriously negative policy consequences . "
" A severe crackdown , " the cable ominously concludes , " would be inevitible . "
Document 5 : IPAC Daily Intelligence Summary 1 - 87 , China : Student Demonstrations ( January 2 , 1987 )
Demonstrations continued into January 1987 when 3,000 students defied a government ban and staged a protest in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square in Beijing .
This intelligence summary from U.S. Pacific Command notes that 24 " troublemakers " associated with the illegal protest were apparently detained by police for " education and examination . "
Document 6 : IPAC Daily Intelligence Summary 10 - 87 , China : Hu Yaobang Resigns ( January 17 , 1987 )
Later that same month , on January 17 , 1987 , another Pacific Command intelligence summary reported the resignation of Hu Yaobang , from his post as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party .
An advocate of both economic and political reforms , the summary notes that Hus resignation " is probably the result of the recent student demonstrations . "
After his death in April 1989 students gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn the loss of a respected leader .
What began as a profound expression of sorrow , however , would soon develop into the massive pro-democracy demonstration that occupied Tiananmen Square in the period preceding the crackdown of June 3 - 4 , 1989 .
Document 7 : Memorandum of Conversation , [ George Bush ] Meeting with Wan Li , Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress and Member of the Politburo , Peoples Republic of China ( May 23 , 1989 )
By May 20 , 1989 , with no peaceful resolution of the crisis in sight , the Chinese government declared martial law in Beijing , hoping to intimidate the protesters to clear the square .
Nevertheless , U.S. officials were still hoping to see the standoff between the government and the student demonstrators resolved peacefully .
Three days after the declaration , U.S. President George Bush met with the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress , Wan Li , in Washington .
While the documentary record is far from complete , this document , a heavily excised summary transcript of their conversation , indicates that the subject of the student demonstrations did come up at their meeting .
" The President , " the transcript shows , " asked how the Chairman sees the present situation playing itself out . "
Wans reply has not yet been declassified , but he apparently commented on some aspect of the demonstrations , prompting Bush to ask " if this was just a handful of all those demonstrators .
"
Shortly thereafter , Wan cut short his U.S. visit and , on May 27 , publicly endorsed the governments martial law order .
Document 8 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 2 , 1989 , China : Stalemate Continues
On the day before the crackdown began , the Beijing city government tightened restrictions on the foreign media reporting on the Tiananmen Square demonstration , and the Chinese leadership was becoming increasingly frustrated with the persistence of the student demonstrators and their refusal to clear the square .
This document , a morning intelligence summary prepared that day by the State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research for Secretary of State James A. Baker ( the first of several included in this Briefing Book ) , discusses these issues and also the leadership crisis facing the Chinese government in the midst of the demonstrations .
The summary notes that students expect that the " Goddess of Democracy " statue they erected in the square would " anger top leaders and prompt a response . "
" The students , " the document continues , " may hope an overreaction by authorities will breathe new life into their flagging movement . "
Document 9 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 3 , 1989 , China : Police Use Tear Gas on Crowds
The initial moves against the students suggested to many that the Chinese leadership was still , as of the morning of June 3 , committed to a relatively peaceful resolution to the crisis .
This document describes two incidents that in retrospect may have convinced Chinese authorities that the use of force was necessary .
The document reports , according to various sources , that " approximatley 5,000 unarmed troops were turned back by students and citizens as they attempted to advance on foot to Tiananmen Square . "
Later in the day Beijing police fired tear gas on crowds gathered near the Zhongnanhai leadership compound , but the report suggests that this was an " accidental rather than a premeditated effort to escalate the level of force beyond that used unsuccessfully earlier in the day . "
With respect to the disorderly withdrawal of the military units earlier in the day , the summary notes that " the obvious confusion of many of the soldiers suggests they were unprepared for the outpouring of opposition their movements triggered . "
Document 10 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 27 : Martial Law with Chinese Characteristics ( June 3 , 1989 )
This cable provides fascinating eyewitness accounts of the disorganized and confused retreat of PLA soldiers from the center of Beijing after their advance on Tiananmen Square was halted by crowds of demonstrators on the morning of June 3 .
The document describes how the soldiers were ridiculed by Chinese citizens and scolded by elderly women who called them " bad boys " and " a disgrace to the PLA . "
One U.S. official quoted in the document described the events as " a Chinese version of Napoleans retreat from Moscow . "
Embassy officials speculate that the soldiers were to have been used to cordon off the square while regular police units would have moved on the crowds with clubs in an effort to clear the square .
The document suggests that the episode galvanized the demonstrators , encouraging them to resist further attempts to move them from the square .
Document 11 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 28 : Ten to Fifteen Thousand Armed Troops Stopped at City Perimeter by Human and Bus Barricades ( June 3 , 1989 )
The tension in Beijing had increased sharply by the late afternoon of June 3 when ten to fifteen thousand fully equipped troops in large truck convoys moved toward the city center .
Unlike the previous units , these troops were helmeted and armed with automatic weapons suggesting , as this cable does , " that the force option is real . "
The document describes the movement of these troops toward the vicinity of Tiananmen Square from several different directions , noting that , " The population appears hostile to PLA movements into the city . "
Document 12 : Cable , From : Department of State , Wash DC , To : U.S. Embassy Beijing , and All Diplomatic and Consular Posts , TFCHO1 : SITREP 1 , 1700 EDT ( June 3 , 1989 )
By the evening of June 3 the crackdown had begun in Beijing , and the State Department created a special task force in Washington , designated by the heading " TFCH01 , " to coordinate information on the situation in China .
This document , the first in this series of SITREPs , updates U.S. embassy and consular personnel around the world on the first violent clashes with demonstrators as PLA troops " using automatic weapons advanced in tanks , APCs [ Armored Personnel Carriers ] , and trucks from several directions toward the city center . "
Casualties , according to the estimates of U.S. Embassy personnel , appear high .
The cable also notes that Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmitt had called on PRC Ambassador Han Xu to express " deep regret at the use of force . "
Document 13 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 4 , 1989 , China : Troops Open Fire
The violence that occurred on the night of June 3 - 4 is summarized in this State Department morning intelligence summary for June 4 .
" Two weeks after martial law was declared , " the report observes , " the government again controls the symbolic center of the country . "
The document describes how civilians turned out in massive numbers and fought for seven hours to prevent the troops from advancing on the square .
In the face of overwhelming numbers of heavily armed troops , the summary notes , " thousands of civilians stood their ground or swarmed around military vehicles .
APCs were set on fire , and demonstrators besieged troops with rocks , bottles , and Molotov cocktails . "
Document 14 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 32 : The Morning of June 4 ( June 4 , 1989 )
The crackdown continued through the night , and by early morning June 4 , as this cable reports , the PLA was in control Tiananmen Square .
Based on eyewitness accounts of the violence , this SITREP is the Embassy 's initial effort to provide some detail on the final PLA assault on the approximately 3,000 demonstrators who had not yet left the square .
" Some 10,000 troops , " the document says , formed a ring around the square , and " a column of about 50 APC , tanks , and trucks entered Tiananmen from the east . "
Demonstrators shouted angrily , the cable states , and " PLA troops in Tiananmen opened a barrage of rifle and machine gun fire . "
Another column of military vehicles entered soon thereafter , and more gunfire ensued , " causing a large number of casualties . "
The document also describes violent PLA clashes with demonstrators on Changan Boulevard , the main thoroughfare in the Tiananmen area , and in other parts of Beijing .
Embassy officials also report conversations with angry citizens , some " claiming that more than 10,000 people had been killed at Tiananmen . "
One woman claimed to have witnessed a tank running over 11 people .
She also told Embassy officers that she had seen PLA troops " breaking the windows of shops , banks , and other buildings . "
Document 15 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 33 : June 4 Afternoon and ( June 4 , 1989 )
As the PLA moved to consolidate its hold on the city center in the immediate aftermath of the crackdown , Embassy officials watched closely as tanks , APCs , and trucks passed by the U.S. diplomatic compound , moving west toward Tiananmen Square , reporting these movements back to the State Department .
In the space of one hour on the early morning of June 5 , this cable reports , " more than seventy tanks moving at a fast speed passed the diplomatic compound heading toward the square . "
Sources also report the presence of large numbers of burned out military vehicles scattered around the city .
The document forwards some early casualty estimates , and also reports on the release of ten foreigners who had been detained by Chinese public security , including several journalists .
Most intriguing , however , is a report , attributed to a Chinese - American who witnessed the Tiananmen Square violence , claiming that , " The beating to death of a PLA soldier , who was in the first APC to enter Tiananmen Square , in full view of the other waiting PLA soldiers , appeared to have sparked the shooting that followed . "
Document 16 : Cable , From : Department of State , Wash DC , To : U.S. Embassy Beijing , China Task Force Situation Report No. 3 - Situation as of 1700 EDT , 6/4/89 ( June 4 , 1989 )
As reports flowed in from the embassy in Beijing , the State Department 's China task force was busy updating other diplomatic and consular posts around the world on the situation in Beijing .
This SITREP reports the current situation in Beijing where , " The PLA is mopping up isolated resistance , " and notes that " casualty estimates vary from 500 to 2600 deaths , with injuries up to 10,000 . "
The cable also discusses the foreign reaction to the recent events , noting especially that , " Taiwan 's President Lee Teng - hui called in AIT [ American Institute in Taiwan ] chief David Dean in Taipei to hear his appeal for the US to join in condemnation and consideration of sanctions . "
Document 17 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 5 , 1989 , China : After the Bloodbath
By the morning of June 5 ( Eastern Standard Time ) the " severity of the assault " had become clear to U.S. officials .
This intelligence summary , prepared by the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research , reports that , " Troops shot indiscriminately into crowds of unarmed civilians , including women and children , often with automatic weapons Foreign journalists report seeing fleeing protesters shot in the back . "
The document notes the large number of destroyed military vehicles littering the Beijing streets , and reports that an undisclosed entity had " secured a university campus where students had captured an armored personnel carrier , and issued a warning that executions of students would begin tonight . "
Document 18 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 35 : June 6 , 0500 Hours ( June 5 , 1989 )
Two days after the crackdown , this report from the U.S. Embassy stated that a western military attaché had told the U.S. military representative that one PLA unit , the 27th Army , " was responsible for most of the death and destruction at Tiananmen Square on June 3 . "
The 27th , the cable notes , was commanded by the nephew of PRC President Yang Shangkun , a noted hardliner , and was even accused of killing " soldiers from other units run over by the 27th APC 's and tanks . "
The document also indicates that a large contingent of soldiers from the 27th had taken up position on a highway overpass , " and seem poised for attack by other PLA units . "
Document 19 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 6 , 1989 , China : Descent into Chaos
By the morning of June 6 , it appeared to some in the State Department that the situation in Beijing was teetering on the brink of political chaos or even civil war .
This Department of State morning summary describes clashes among different PLA units , with sources claiming that in many cases the soldiers were sympathetic with the demonstrators and often complicit in the destruction of their own military vehicles .
" At least some of the troops still entering Beijing , " the document notes , " are arriving without authorization and are intent upon attacking the 27th Army . "
The document also appears to be anticipating an intensification of the current leadership crisis , reporting rumors that senior leader Deng Xiaoping has died or is near death , and an attempt on the life of Premier Li Peng by one of his own security guards in the Great Hall of the People .
Moreover , Shanghai also appeared to be heading toward some kind of violent military crackdown as PLA troops assembled outside the city , ready to move on striking citizens if necessary .
Document 20 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , TFCH01 -- SITREP No. 37 : June 7 , 0500 Hours Local ( June 6 , 1989 )
In this document , Embassy officials report continuing large - scale troop movements around Beijing amid persistent but unconfirmed rumors of splits and clashes among Chinese military units near the Nanyuan Airport .
The cable also reports the harassment of citizens by troops trying to enforce martial law .
Document 21 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 7 , 1989 , China : Tense Standoff Continues
By the time the State Department had put together this intelligence summary for the Secretary on the morning of June 7 , many of the rumors generated in the past two days we refuted .
" Despite numerous reports alleging or predicting clashes between military units in Beijing , " the summary begins , " available evidence suggests that few if any significant engagements have occurred . "
Reports of Dengs death also appear to have been fabrications .
The document also mentions that Chinese troops had fired their weapons in the direction of the U.S. diplomatic compound , shattering windows in three of the apartments , and reports rumors that " some leaders may have envisioned an outcome that would blame most of the atrocities on the 27th Army , relieve its top commanders , and remove senior officials who ordered armed action against civilians . "
Document 22 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , TFCH01 -- SITREP No. 38 : June 7 , 1900 Hours ( June 7 , 1989 )
This intriguing cable describes a sequence of events that occurred as a large convoy of troops from the 27th Army passed near the Jianguomenwai diplomatic compound and U.S. embassy residences on their way out of the city as part of a major troop rotation .
In what was later explained as a search for a sniper , the troops sprayed the compound with automatic weapons fire .
One witness , the document notes , " said the unit was from Shenyang and that they had been on the square on the night of June 3 - 4 . "
The soldiers appeared to be aiming " at or above rooftops , but soldiers lowered their sights ( but did not fire ) at any spectators who did not cower immediately behind nearby protective cover . "
The cable explains that the military had apparently chosen to replace " the much - hated 27th Group Army unit " with the 20th in a move " apparently intended to improve relations between the military and the residents of the city . "
The incident has provoked speculation that the shootings may have been staged as a response to the package of sanctions against China announced by President Bush in June 5 , or the decision to grant refuge to dissident Fang Lizhi , an outspoken critic of the Chinese regime , in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing .
Document 23 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 9 , 1989 , China : Uneasy Calm
Five days after the violence , this intelligence summary indicates that , " Numerous arrests can be expected , " and that the military appears poised to take over the university campuses .
The document suggests that Chinese leaders have initiated a defensive campaign combining mass arrests and detentions with vehement denials that there were heavy civilian casualties during the military crackdown , " focusing instead on attacks and atrocities against the police and soldiers . "
With regard to the brewing leadership crisis , the report cites a " reliable source " who says that " Zhao [ Ziyang ] is still in Beijing and in the custody of the hard - liners . "
Document 24 : Department of State Intelligence Brief , " Current Situation in China : Background and Prospects " ( Ca. June 10 , 1989 )
One week after the bloody crackdown of June 3 - 4 , State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research issued this brief , explaining the current situation within the context of the Chinese leadership crisis that had been broiling for two years and especially " the power struggle for the succession to Deng Xiaoping . "
The document suggests that only Communist Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang " seemed to understand the depth of public grievances and the urgent need to address them in some realistic fashion , " and that hard - liners in the leadership saw the crackdown as an opportunity to undermine his leadership and restore a more authoritarian government .
Thus Deng split with Zhao , his protégé , and " gave carte blanche to Yang Shangkun and Li Peng to enforce martial law and quash the demonstrations . "
Commenting on prospects for future political reforms , the document asserts that , " There is probably little residual faith that the government can be counted on to move forward on demands for political freedoms , an open and accurate press , and an end to official corruption . "
Document 25 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 10 , 1989 , China : Mixed Signals on Purge
On June 9 , Deng Xiaoping made his first public appearance since May 16 , expressing his support for the military measures imposed on the demonstrations .
This document explores the meaning of his speech , and also reports that Chinese authorities continue to round up suspected " counterrevolutionaries " and search for evidence to use against those responsible for the turmoil .
The authors comment that although most Chinese leaders blame a small number of instigators for stirring up the population , " that tiny group is likely to include thousands of bureaucrats , intellectuals , students , and labor activists . "
Document 26 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , SITREP No. 49 , June 12 , 0500 Local ( June 11 , 1989 )
As it became apparent that the U.S. Embassy had no intention of handing over dissident Fang Lizhi , who had taken refuge their on the night of June 5 , the Chinese government , in the words of this cable , " stepped up its anti-US rhetoric . "
Chinese authorities had issued an arrest warrant for Fang and his wife , Li Shuxian , the day before , charging them with " crimes of counter - propaganda and instigation before and during the recent turmoil . "
The U.S. Embassy was accused of harboring the " criminal who created this violence , " and was warned of the potentially harmful consequences for U.S. - China relations .
Document 27 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 14 , 1989 , China : Back to Business , But Crackdown Continues
Ten days after the crackdown Chinese leaders appeared to be trying to portray a return to business as usual in Beijing , despite the continuing widespread arrests of students and political activists suspected as instigators of the Tiananmen demonstrations .
This document describes the sudden public emergence of many top Chinese officials including some associated with ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang in an apparent show of support for the military crackdown .
The report also comments that " Beijings efforts to sell the official version of recent events and win bureaucratic compliance with the new hardline regime conflict with US attempts to limit repression and honor Fang Lizhis request for protection . "
Document 28 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 15 , 1989 , China : Accusation over Fang Lizhi
Policy makers in Washington were clearly concerned as the Fang Lizhi episode threatened to further disrupt Sino - American relationship beyond its current strains .
This morning intelligence summary leads of with a discussion of Chinese media reports about the affair , noting that " the article takes care to limit blame to ' certain US personages , ' 'a handful of people in the United States , ' ' some US media , particularly the Voice of America , ' and the ' US Embassy in Beijing . ' "
The document also reports on fears in Hong Kong over how the colony will be governed after returning to mainland Chinese rule in 1997 .
" Locals are worried that Beijing could in the future limit civil rights in Hong Kong by declaring martial law or a state of emergency . "
Document 29 : Secretary of State 's Morning Summary for June 21 , 1989 , China : Swift Justice
Washington policy makers also kept close tabs on the continuing crackdown and arrest of persons associated with the demonstrations .
This intelligence report leads off with a discussion of recent arrests and executions , noting that , " More than 1,500 have been arrested including at least six of the 21 ' Most Wanted ' student leaders . "
The document also anticipates a Communist Party Central Committee plenum that will ratify the removal of party secretary Zhao Ziyang , and name a new leader .
Document 30 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , Eyewitness Account of June 4 PLA Tank Crushing 11 Students and Related Early Morning Events in Tiananmen Square ( June 22 , 1989 )
This extraordinary document provides the detailed account of a source who witnessed firsthand the violence at Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3 - 4 .
The source indicated that the students had believed that the soldiers would be firing rubber bullets and that " he had a sickening feeling when he noticed the bullets striking sparks off the pavement near his feet . "
His and other eyewitness descriptions represent an effort by diplomatic reporters to gather evidence about the crackdown and get the story straight .
Most impressive in the account is the sources graphic description of a PLA tank crushing 11 students under its wheels on the morning of June 4 .
Comments at the end of the document indicate that the sources version dovetails with the comments of other sources , concluding that , " We find his account of that episode credible .
His accounts of other incidents are worth recording as other evidence becomes available . "
Document 31 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , What Happened on the Night of June 3/4 ? ( June 22 , 1989 )
This document , as its authors state in the outset , " attempts to set the record straight " about the events of the night of June 3 - 4 .
Contrary to earlier reports in the western media , the cable asserts that many if not most of the deaths associated with the crackdown occurred on Changan Avenue and other streets surrounding the square , rather than on Tiananmen Square itself .
The document calls the notion that the military could have suffered more casualties than civilians " inconceivable , " but holds that " civilian deaths probably did not reach the figure of 3,000 used in some press reports , " but believes that the figure put forward by the Chinese Red Cross of 2,600 military and civilian deaths with 7,000 wounded to be " not an unreasonable estimate . "
The cable concludes with a detailed , hour - by - hour chronology of the events of the night of June 3 - 4 .
Document 32 : Cable , From : U.S. Embassy Beijing , To : Department of State , Wash DC , TFCH01 : SITREP No. 65 , June 27 , 1700 Local ( June 27 , 1989 )
This Embassy cable sent three weeks after President Bush announced a package of sanctions against the PRC , informs that a Chinese military official had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. defense attaché that " strongly protested recent U.S. military sanctions . "
The document notes that , in response to the military sanctions , the official had canceled the planned visits of U.S. military officials and the discontinuation of exchanges of military personnel and the suspension of visits with the U.S. defense attaché .
Embassy officials felt this to be a " measured response to U.S. sanctions , " indicating that the official " did not adopt a confrontational attitude and emphasized that both sides should take a long - term view of the military relationship . "
Document 33 : State Department document entitled " Themes " ( June 29 , 1989 )
On June 30 , National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger embarked on a secret mission to Beijing that , according to Scowcroft , was meant to " keep open the lines of communication " between the U.S. and China .
This extraordinary document is a list of themes prepared for their meetings with Chinese leaders .
The document shows that the administration stressed his personal interest in the maintenance of good relations , and the interest of both countries in continuing strategic cooperation .
The Bush administration wanted to make clear that a harsh crackdown a dissidents would make the broader relationship more difficult to manage in the U.S.
Although the way in which the PRC deals with those of its citizens involved in the recent demonstrations is " an internal affair , " the document stresses that how American people view and react to that behavior is also " an internal affair . "
Emphasizing the importance of the long - term relationship , the document notes that the president " wants to manage short - term events in a way that will best assure a healthy relationship over time . "

Document 34 : State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research , " Status Report on Situation in China as of July 26 , 1989 "
Nearly two months after the crackdown of June 3 - 4 martial law still prevailed in Beijing with , according to this brief status report , " between 100,000 and 200,000 troops " remaining in the area .
This document provides a broad sketch of the bleak situation in China , covering martial law , arrests and executions , the leadership crisis , the mood of the Beijing population , the faltering economy , and China 's foreign relations .
" Rivalries within the Politburo , " the report suggests , " are likely to heighten as the economy worsens and Deng and other party elders sicken or die . "
Document 35 : State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research , " China : Aftermath of the Crisis " ( July 27 , 1989 )
This document , an intelligence research report , asks : " How did China get to this point ? "
The report explores in detail the impact of the crisis on China 's domestic and foreign policy , and measures the international reaction to the crackdown .
The report also provides brief biographic sketches of China 's new leaders including Jiang Zemin , Song Ping , Li Ruihuan , and Ding Guangen .
Among the judgments reached is that the situation in China would " remain unsettled at least until Deng Xiaoping and other party elders die . "
The Arctic island of Greenland is assuming self - rule , in the latest step towards independence from Denmark .
The move follows a referendum on greater autonomy in November .
It will see Greenland take a greater share of revenues from its natural resources .
The local government is taking control of the police and the courts .
Greenlandic - or Kalaallisut - becomes the official language .
Denmark has the final say in defence and foreign - policy matters .
Copenhagen has ruled Greenland for three centuries .
It granted the territory limited sovereignty in 1979 .
But the new self - rule system takes the Arctic island and its 57,000 inhabitants closer to independence .
Greenlanders - most of whom are native Inuit - will be treated as a separate people under international law .
Greenland Prime Minister Kleist has promised to focus on social problems
Much of the oil , gas , gold and diamonds the island holds has been inaccessible because of the Arctic ice covering most of the land mass .
But US experts believe it will become easier to exploit the island 's mineral wealth as global warming melts the ice sheets .
Independence advocates hope the expected increase in revenues from minerals will help fund a final breakaway from Copenhagen .
But analysts say any push for independence is likely to be put on the backburner by Greenland 's new leftist government .
Newly elected Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist has vowed to concentrate on tackling big social problems , such as alcoholism , domestic violence and a high suicide rate .
Greenland currently relies heavily on subsidies from the Danish government - which provide 30 % of its GDP .

Exuding the intellectual curiosity of a decapitated chicken , Kendra walked around the Play Boy mansion semi naked for most of the show talking mostly about herself and jewelery .

PREFACE
A gospel - preaching church with 1,300 years of missionary experience deserves our attention .
It is the purpose of this book to focus on that great missionary effort .
Only a part of the story , however , of the Church of the East 's missionary enterprise , from the second century to the end of the fourteenth , can be told here .
The main focus will be the mission to China during the last 800 years of that period .
Research materials for writing on this subject are available , although they are scattered over half the earth and are in various languages .
Little , however , is written for the reader who is not pursuing advanced studies .
English speaking Christians have been interested in the western expansion of Christianity -- in history that involves their own origin and development - and little is accessible to them concerning the amazing missionary effort of the Church of the East .
That the gospel of Christ 's kingdom did confront the masses of Asia long ago , when the world 's population was the densest there and civilization the most advanced , is today little appreciated by western Christians .
How it fared in that confrontation is almost totally unknown .
The result is that when someone asks , " Where was the evangelical church of Christ during those long ` Dark Ages ' of Europe when the Church of Rome usurped the place of the Holy Spirit ? " there usually follows a notable silence .
The Iona colony of Scotland may be mentioned , or the later Waldenses of the Italian Alps , both involving small numbers .
There is a better answer to the question , however , and the following narrative seeks to shed some light on it .
The story of the Church of the East 's mission to Asia is one that needs to be told to today 's church .
It is the story of a dedicated missionary effort and the ever expanding witness of Christians from Antioch to Peking , nearly 6,000 miles by foot , until multitudes of Christians lived from the 30th to the 120th longitude in medieval times .
The facts and analyses that follow concerning the church 's great epic of eastward advance , it is hoped , will bring encouragement , edification , and perhaps warning to our contemporary churches in their present mission to the unreached .
Here is evidence that God gives strength and conversions in the direst and seemingly most impossible circumstances .
Here also is evidence that pitfalls to the church 's mission always exist .
Common examples are such things as an inadequate appreciation of the spiritual deadness of the natural man , failure to recognize the necessity of heart repentance and the meaning of baptism , the temptation to consider external acts of piety as necessarily representing inner holiness , the acceptance of liturgy and form in the place of justification by faith alone and identification with Christ , compromise with the world 's secularism and other people 's religious practices , sacramentalism , over - identification with a particular political regime , and concern with the elite that leads to failure to reach out to the common people .
As troublesome a problem as any , however , to those desiring to bring the gospel by word and deed into a foreign culture , deeply concerned to make the love and salvation of Christ understood , is the difficulty of adequately contextualizing the gospel without compromising its true meaning and uniqueness .
The contextualization takes place not necessarily when the missionary succeeds in crossing the barriers of culture and language , so as to enable the listener to feel he understands the westerner 's gospel , but when this new understanding is genuinely reflective of the New Testament message of Christ 's redemptive love and mercy and involves a heart commitment to Him .
The lesson of the gospel in the Near and Far East during the Middle Ages is that such failures as are referred to above can cause Christian communities where churches once flourished to disappear so completely that later generations not only do not know what the gospel is but are not even aware that it was ever present in their midst .
In those cases the only witness to the living may be the testimony of the dead , written on tombstones .
An illustration of such a voice out of the past is that of a ninth century Christian in a central Asian cemetery , where the gentle words still whisper , " This is the grave of Pasak - The aim of life is Jesus , our Redeemer . "
The lessons of history need to be studied for , as one sage noted , " Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat its failures in the future . "
INTRODUCTION
In the year 635 A.D. , a party of foreigners from the distant West , a vague area known to the Chinese for many centuries as Ta Chinn , reached the capital city of the Great Chinese Empire , Ch'ang - An , later called Hsian - fu .
It was in the early years of the T'ang dynasty .
They indicated that theirs was a religious mission to bring to the empire knowledge of the doctrines and salvation of Jesus Messiah .
The emperor gave them permission to practice their religion which he officially named the Ta Ch'in Chiao , the Ta Chinn religion .
They themselves used the name Ching Chiao , Luminous Religion ( or Illuminating ? ) , and referred to their home church as The Church of the East .
The Church of Rome , however , called them " Nestorians , " and its thirteenth - century envoys and missionaries to the Far East always referred to the churches of these early missionaries from " The Church of the East " as " Nestorian " churches .
1
Who were these early missionaries ?
Where did they come from ?
Were they holders of the " Nestorian " doctrine condemned as heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 431 ?
Did Nestorius himself hold it , and what was their attitude toward him ?
What do the nine Chinese and two Syriac manuscripts , discovered in north China this century , and the famous " Nestorian " monument inscription , discovered in 1625 by Jesuit missionaries near Ch'ang - An , reveal about their mission , theology , and particularly their christology ?
Was there anything unique in their theology or christology which motivated this great missionary zeal ?
And why did this tremendous missionary effort end in failure ?
These are questions which need investigation and which are pursued in the following chapters .
Part I traces the main details of the eastward expansion of the gospel from Antioch to Syria , across Persia and Mongolia , and on into north China by the ancient trade routes , noting the evidence of the Christian missions ' activity .
Part II examines the christological controversy of the fifth century to ascertain what the church understood " Nestorianism " to be and what Nestorius 's own presentation was , in order to come to an understanding of the theology of Nestorius and " Nestorianism . "
Those not desiring to follow the christological study of chapter six , with its linguistic considerations , may find the conclusion at the end of the chapter an adequate summary .
Part III examines the ten Chinese and two Syriac documents found in north China , considered to have been written by Christian missionaries between the seventh and eleventh centuries , to learn in what sense these missionaries were " Nestorians , " and what relation , if any , this connection had to their missionary zeal and subsequent failure .
Much of the material of the latter two parts was prepared during studies at Calvin Theological Seminary when writing on the theme , " The Theology of the Nestorian Missionaries in China from 600 - 1000 A.D. , " for a master of theology dissertation .
The writer is much indebted to the very able assistance of Dr. Fred Klooster , professor of systematic theology at that institution , under whose direction the paper was written .
We shall begin , then , by tracing the history of the expansion of the Christian church eastward and the entrance of its missionaries into China .

PART I
THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE FIRST CHRISTIAN MISSION TO CHINA
Chapter 1
The Early Centuries
By the year 800 there were more Christians east of Damascus than there were west of that city .
This statement may seem astonishing , if not incredible , to the average Western reader who knows almost nothing about Eastern church history .
Students of the early growth and spread of Christianity in the Eastern lands , however , will recognize it not only as entirely factual but also as only one of many facts testifying to the remarkable missionary zeal of the eastward bound Christians .
It all began with the fulfillment at Pentecost of Christ 's promise of an outpouring of His Holy Spirit for the empowering of a witness to Him throughout the world in the new international age of the gospel .
" Parthians and Medes and Elamites , and residents of Mesopotamia " 2 were there , their lives set ablaze with a new dedication to return to their homelands to proclaim the good news that Messiah had truly come for man 's eternal salvation .
The planting of the church in Antioch was an immediate result .
The New Testament presents something of the history and significance of that church 's missionary effort in its westward movement .
But history records also an eastward expansion of the gospel with churches planted in Damascus , Edessa and Mesopotamia , in Media , Elam and Parthia ( the later Sassanian empire of Persia ) and in India .
The church resulting from all this Eastern missionary activity came to call itself the Church of the East .
The Church of the East , considering itself distinct from the Western ( Roman ) or Eastern ( Byzantian ) Churches , holds its origin to have been in Edessa , modern Urfa of Turkey , the capital city of the little Kingdom of Osrohene in northern Mesopotamia ( between the rivers ) .
Their tradition claims that King Abgar , son of Na'na , on hearing of Christ and His remarkable miracles , wrote to Him inviting Him to come to minister to his people .
Our Lord received the message , so the story goes , shortly before His crucifixion , so Thomas undertook to send Addai ( Thaddeus ) one of the seventy who had been sent out to evangelize .
From this disciple 's ministry the gospel was planted in Edessa , considered the first Church of the East , its eastward expansion beginning from that city .
3
Whether one accepts this story or not , we do know that there was a church in Edessa early in the second century and that the bishops of Edessa traced their succession to Serapion , Bishop of Antioch from 190 to 203.4
Also the coins of Edessa from 180 - 192 show a cross on the king 's headgear .
There is a Syrian tradition , however , that the apostle Thomas was their first patriarch .
In a book called Eclesiastike , purporting to contain the preaching of the apostles , the writer , Bar Aurai , maintains that the apostle Thomas preached Christ in the East in the second year after His ascension .
Thomas was on his way to India , he ' states , and " We have reason to believe it true , what the Syrian writers sand fathers say , that they regard St. Thomas to be their first patriarch , and accordingly they called themselves St. Thomas Christians .
"
5
The Mar Thoma Church of south India holds to this day that Thomas came to them to preach the gospel and to found their church .
It is in the early literature of the Syrian church , however , that we see most clearly its antiquity and independent nature .
Their language was the Aramaic , considered by many to be the language of our Lord , but in the eastern dialect of Edessa , while the written language was the old Syriac , Biblical Aramaic ( Chaldee ) .
6
Tatian , born in Edessa , in 150 , composed a gospel harmony in continuous narrative form , called the Diatesseron , which for well over a century was the only gospel known by Persian Christians .
About 350 a Syriac New Testament , the Peshitta ( simple ) appeared -- but Burkitt claims that it was not a new translation , only a revision of an Old Syriac ones .
7
The Syriac Old Testament , Burkitt holds , is even older than the name Peshitta .
It is quoted both by Aphraates ( 337 A.D. ) and in the Acts of Thomas ( first century ) , he contends .
Specifically he states , " The Peshitta is a direct translation from the Hebrew , in all essentials , from the Messoretic text . " 8
Such a translation was inevitable , he feels , both because Edessa 's independent civilization would require a vernacular version and because the Jewish converts in the church would insist on a translation from the Hebrew .
Although Burkitt places the Creed of Aphraates at about 337 , he holds that the Acts of Thomas was written by Judas Thomas himself , the brother of our Lord .
His comment on this is most interesting .
" I believe most firmly that it was originally composed in Syriac , not Greek ... a doctrinal work cast in narrative form ... it is as truly a book of religious philosophy as the Pilgrim 's Progress , and it demands from us serious study . " 9
Thus he would give strong support to the early origin and independent nature of the church in Edessa .
Edessa -- the capital of the small kingdom of Osrohene , lying between the outer edges of the two great empires of Rome and Parthia - - sometimes a tributary of Rome ( 116 A.D. ) and sometimes under the suzerainty of Parthia - - became a Roman military colony in 216 .
The Sassanian dynasty of Persia , farther south , conquered Parthia in 226 and throughout that century was at intermittent war with Rome .
In 258 , the Sassanian king , Shopur I , captured Antioch and brought many learned scholars and doctors , among whom were Christians , back to Beth Lapat of Khuzistan , near Susa .
Here they were ordered by the king to build a new city , Djondishapur , the future Eastern cultural , academic and medical center of learning .
It was here that many of the east bound missionaries received their training in theology and medical lore .
Later some of them were to testify that like Abraham they had left the land of Ur to bear witness for God .
The Romans recovered their losses and finally in 303 signed a treaty of peace with the Persians making the Abaros River , a tributary of the Euphrates , the boundary between the two empires .
The Roman backed king , Terdat , had been restored to the throne of the Osrohene Kingdom of Lesser Armenia , a small country of northern Mesopotamia , and in 301 he declared his kingdom a Christian state , the first in history , with Gregory the Illuminator as the Church 's head .
After King Terdat embraced the gospel his people became Christians .
With the death of Constantine in 327 and of Terdat in 342 , however , the Persian king launched an attack to regain the lost western territories .
The Christians of Armenia were identified with the Roman enemy , whose emperors were now Christian , and violent persecution was carried out against them , including the burning of their churches .
The Persian Zoroastrian priests were greatly concerned at the headway the Christians were making under the toleration of the treaty conditions .
They finally succeeded in stirring their king to pass discriminatory laws against the Christians , which led to a renewal of persecution , on the grounds the Christians were friends of the Romans , sharing the sentiments of their enemy Caesar .
Many Christians chose to flee the country at this time , some going to Nisibus ( under Rome ) where a theological college had been begun in 326 by a bishop just returned from the Nicene Council .
In 363 , however , Nisibis was recaptured by the Persians and the college fled to Edessa .
In 399 , a more tolerant Persian king , Yezdegerd I , came to the throne and the Romans again sought peace by sending an embassy seeking a treaty .
An edict of toleration was signed in 409 giving toleration to Christians in the Persian Empire and the same to Zoroastrians in the Roman Empire .
The next year a synod was called for the whole area .
It met in Selucia - Ctesiphon , on the lower Tigris , with some 40 bishops present , and was under the leadership of that city 's chief bishop , who had the title of Catholicos .
They adopted the Nicene Creed and defined the boundaries of some of the sees .
A new and special title was given to the catholicos of " Grand Metropolitan and Head of all Bishops . "
With the death of the peace - minded Yezdegerd I in 420 , persecution of Christians broke out again and for many of the same reasons as before .
Warfare with Rome also was renewed on the frontier but peace was concluded in 422 .
The immediate effect on the churches of the Armenian - Mesopotamian area was to convince them that they must by all means disassociate themselves from the Roman Church 's jurisdiction ( they were under the patriarch of Antioch ) to escape future persecutions for political reasons .
In 424 another Council was called , this time at Markabta , with six metropolitans and 31 bishops attending .
They declared their independence from the patriarch of Antioch and made their own Catholicos their new patriarch .
They further agreed " that no appeal should be made from his decrees to ' western patriarchs ' .
" 10 Although no doctrinal difference was declared to exist between the Church of the East and Rome , the Council did proclaim its Church to be independent in government and , in the words of Wigram , " it did as much as a Council could do to set an Oriental papacy over itself .
" 11 It was the first major crack in the structure of the Christian Church 's organizational unity .
In the next act of separation from the Western church , however , doctrine was involved .
The sympathies of the Eastern churches were with the Antiochene theology as we shall see later .
Many of the leaders of their churches and of their theological college in Edessa , as well as the founders of the school of theology in Djondishapur , had been trained at the Antiochene theological seminary .
Thus they opposed the decision of the Ephesus Council of 431 and supported the deposed Nestorius .
The christological controversy raged in the Edessa theological college itself for many years until in 488 the Roman Emperor Zeno closed the college , had it torn down and on the site erected a church dedicated to Mary with the controversial title theotokos .
12
Most of the students and faculty moved east to Nisibis to reopen a theological school there , one which eventually became very large and influential .
Chapter 2
The Church of the East Establishes Its Independence
Prior to Emperor Zeno's closing of the Edessa " Nestorian " work in 488 , a very significant event in the history of the Church of the East took place in Beth Lapat , near the ancient Ur of the Chaldees .
An important theological event had just occurred in the West .
Zeno had addressed his famous Henotican ( instrument of union ) to the patriarchs of Constantinople , Alexandria and Antioch , and all three had adopted his formulation of the heretical monophysite christology .
In 484 the Church of the East called a synod to meet in Beth Lapat to adopt what Rome called a " Nestorian " confession , in response to the Increasing monophysite takeover .
They did not oppose the Chalcedonian formula of 451 , but resented that Council 's confirmation of the repudiation of Nestorius .
Within the churches east of Antioch , by then , there were three distinct parties centering around each 's particular christology , and each had its scholarly defenders .
1 ) There were the followers of Cyril of Alexandria 's doctrine that Christ had two natures , one divine and one human , in one person .
13 ( Most of the monks of his see , however , held that the human nature was divinized by the logos and therefore , to all intents and purposes , did not exist after the hypostatic union . )
2 ) The Church of the East was most amenable to Nestorius 's doctrine that Christ had two natures and two kenume ( the set of personal characteristics of each nature ) in one person .
3 ) The followers of the doctrine of Eutyches of Alexandria , however , held a view that was gaining increasing support in the east , the monophysite heresy that Christ had only a divine nature in His person after the ascension , the human nature having been divinized .
By the time of the Beth Lapat synod , the churches of Edessa and Upper Mesopotamia had been captured by the monophysite heresy .
To make a sharp break with this error of the upper Mesopotamian churches , which were still considered a part of the western church , and to escape further controversy over the christological formulation , the synod decided to separate the Eastern church not only from the Western church 's ecclesiastical jurisdiction ( as in 424 ) but from its doctrinal confession as well , particularly with regard to its adoption of the Alexandrian monophysite heresy .
Thereafter they considered themselves to be a different church , the Church of the East .
The crack had widened into a complete break .
From then on not only in practice but in fact there were two independent Christian churches in the world , each with its own government and doctrinal position .
It was not that the Roman Church and the Byzantian Church held the same christology , for Rome was duophysite and the Byzantian eastern churches had become monophysite .
But they were still one church , the Western , Roman Church .
The Church of the East too was duophysite , with a slightly different way of expressing it , but definitely not holding the view condemned at Ephesus as " Nestorian " ( making Christ appear to be two persons ) , as we shall see later .
But the Church of the East no longer considered itself a part of the Roman Church , and the Roman church retaliated by labeling it " Nestorian " after the deposed " heretic , " Nestorius .
14
In 499 another synod of the Church of the East rejected the doctrine of the celibacy of the clergy ( though a later act required the highest clergy to be celibate , a rule sometimes ignored in different times and places ) .
This rejection of the highly honored Roman rule made the Church of the East even more disdained by the Roman clergy .
These Eastern or " Nestorian " Christians were versatile and diligent propagators of their faith .
With the flight of the Edessa theological school to Nisibis , outside the farthest borders of the Roman Empire , and the opening of another in Djondishpur , with a hospital also in the latter city , many Syrian Christians began to move eastward into Persia and to revive the spirits of that harassed Church .
Zernov writes that " The Nestorians were renowned doctors .
Some of them exercised considerable political influence , being confidants and advisers of such Califs as Harum al Rashid ( 785-809 ) and his successors .
The third center of Christian scholarship was Merv , where many translations were made from Greek and Syriac into languages spoken in Samarkand and Bokhara .
"
15
The influence these centers of learning had on the Arabs was also very great .
Schaff , in a very interesting footnote , states his wonder that the " Nestorians " should have had such an important influence on the geographical extension of knowledge , even on the Arabs before they reached the learned Alexandria .
They received their first knowledge of Greek literature through the Syrians , he wrote , and learned of medicine through the Greek physicians and those of the " Nestorians " at Edessa .
Then he adds , " Feeble as the science of the Nestorian priests may have been , it could still , with its peculiar and pharmaceutical turn , act genially upon a race ( the Arabs ) which had long lived in free converse with nature , and had preserved a more fresh sensibility to every sort of study of nature , than the people of Greek and Italian studies . . . .
The Arabians , we repeat , are to be regarded as the proper founders of the physical sciences , in the sense we are now accustomed to attach to the word .
"
16
The " Nestorians " were firm believers in Christian education .
Every bishop endeavored to maintain a school in connection with his church , realizing the necessity of such education in a land where all government education was pagan .
" The chorepiscopos of every diocese , " Wrote Wigram , " appears to have had education as his special charge . "
Then he went on to write :
Scribes and doctors were highly honored .
The school ( of Nisibis ) form ( b a self - governing corporation , which could own property , and was extradiocesan , its head being apparently subordinate only to the patriarch .
It was quartered in a monastery , the tutors being brethen of the same ....
Education was free , but students were expect -d to maintain themselves ....
Begging was forbidden ; but students might lend money to One another at one percent , and the steward had a number of bursaries in his gift .
The Course was purely theological , the sole textbooks being the Scriptures , and more particularly the Psalms ....
The Church services also formed a part of the regular course ; and no doubt all the approved theological works of the Church were to be found in the library .
The students lied in groups of five or six in a cell , where they ate in common ....
The college in Sabr - Ishu 's day contained eight hundred pupils .17
During the year preceding the Mohammedan conquest Babai was the leader of the church in Persia , though there was no patriarch at the time as the king wanted a " Jacobite , " a monophysite .
Babai was an aggressive spiritual leader , and under him schools in sixty places were restored or built .
Many books were translated or written to supply these schools , and missionaries and traveling evangelists were sent to Many places .
The statement has been made that more than 2,000 books and epistles or letters , written by prominent leaders of the time , were circulating among the Christians .18
By the year 424 , as the missionaries planted churches northwards , Merv , Nishapur and Herat , south of the Oxus River , all had bishops while their monks taught the converts how to read and improve their vegetable growing .
19
In a day when there was little understanding of the importance of fresh fruit or vegetables to maintain health , the " Nestorian " physicians with this knowledge brought healing to many
With the medicinal use of a " sherbet " of fruit juices and with the use of rhubarb , making both famous throughout the Orient .
In 503 a bishop 's seat was established in Samarkand .
The missionaries kept Moving northward , with perhaps their greatest success being the great Kerait conversions of the eighth century , with 400,000 families converted .
The Onguts and Uigurs also were largely converted .
Their historian Malech has reported :
During the patriarchate of Mar Ishu Jahb II , 636 , Syrian missionaries went to China , and for 150 years this mission was active ....
109 Syrian missionaries have worked in China during 150 years of the Chinese mission ....
They went out from Beth Nahrin , the birthplace of Abraham , the father of all believers .
The missionaries traveled on foot ; they had sandals on their feet , and a staff in their hands , and carried a basket on their backs , and in the basket was the Holy Writ and the cross .
They took the road around the Persian Gulf ; went over deep rivers and high mountains , thousands of miles .
On their way they met many heathen nations and preached to them the gospel of Christ.20
During the early years of the Mohammedan regime , the Syrian Christian churches had more freedom and peace than under the Persian kings .
A concordat was signed with Mohammed whereby the Christians would pay tribute , in time of war shelter endangered Muslims and refrain from helping the enemy .
In exchange they were to be given religious toleration , though they were not to proselytize , and they would not be required to fight for Mohammed .
21
He had reason to befriend the Christians for a " Nestorian " had been Mohammed 's teacher at one point and , in some early battles , certain Christian communities had actually fought on his side against pagan tribes .
22
So much Christian influence , though highly distorted , is apparent in his teaching that Islam has been called a Christian heresy .
By the end of the eighth century the Church of the East had expanded to great distances with at least 25 metropolitans and one hundred and 50 bishops .
Six bishops were the minimum to support a metropolitan .
They were all under the patriarch of Bagdad , who had moved from Ctesiphon - Selucia in 763 to the newer city a few miles up the Tigris .
So vast was this patriarchate that metropolitans in the outer regions were not required to attend regular synods and had to report in writing only every six years .
23 Zernov describes as one of the patriarch 's activities that " He sent out missionaries to Tibet and to various nomadic tribes and consecrated bishops for them who moved with their flocks over the vast open spaces of central Asia .
"
24
The location of some of these 25 metropolitans is pointed out by Stewart , who cites the Synodicon Orientale , translated by J. B. Chabot .
There the metropolitan of the Turks is placed tenth in the list and is followed by those of Razikaye , Herat , Armenia , China , Java , India and Samarkand .
He also cites information , concerning the spread of the gospel in this period to the Turko - Tatar tribes , from a new manuscript translated by Mingana .
This material is in the form of a letter from a Mar Philoxenus , of the eighth century , to the governor of Hirta , and makes frequent reference to Christian Turks throughout the area south of Lake Baikal .
Mingana gives evidence to support his belief that the manuscript really has two parts , the latter written sometime between 730 and 790 .
It is this section that speaks of the many Christian Turks in central and eastern Asia .
The writer states they were divided into strong clans , living nomadic lives with tents , though very wealthy , and that they ate meat , drank milk , had clean habits and orthodox beliefs .
They used a Syriac version of the Bible but in their worship services translated into the Turkish language so that the people could understand the gospel .25
The manuscript also mentions that these Turko - Tartars had four great Christian kings who lived at some distance from each other .
Their names are given as Gawirk , Girk , Tasahz and Langu .
Mingana believes that they were the heads , or Khakans , of the four tribal confederacies of the Keraits , Uigurs , Naimans and Merkites .
The populace of each king is said to have been over 400,000 families .
If there were five persons to a family , this would mean two million per king for a grand total of eight million .
26
If only half that many represented the actual population , it would still represent a Christian community so great it would be a tremendous witness to the zeal of those early missionaries .
Mingana declares that the credit for carrying the gospel of Christ to these tribes of central and eastern Asia belongs entirely to
the untiring zeal and the marvelous spiritual activities of the Nestorian church , the most missionary church that the world has ever seen .
We cannot but marvel at the love of God , of man , and of duty which animated those unassuming disciples of Christ ... ( who ) literally explored all the corners of the eastern globe " to sow in them the seed of true religion as it was known to them . "
27
A final witness to the great extent of " Nestorian " Christianity by the beginning of the ninth century can be taken from Gibbon .
Of their church he said , " their numbers , with those of the Jacobites , were computed to surpass the Greek and Latin communions .
"
28
Chapter 3
The Christian Mission to T'ang China
During those early centuries of the Christian era , as the missionaries of the Church of the East were working their way eastward , the great Chinese Empire had not been inactive in making western contacts .
Hirth , in his compilation of all the references to the Western nations in the Chinese historical annals begins with a quotation from 91 B.C .
When the first embassy was sent from China to An - Shi ( Parthia ) , the king of An - Shi ordered 20,000 cavalry to meet them on the eastern frontier ....
After the Chinese embassy had returned they sent forth an embassy to follow the Chinese embassy to come and see the extent and greatness of the Chinese Empire .
They offered to the Chinese court large birds ' eggs , and jugglers from Li-kan.29
Another quotation , of 120 A.D. , speaks of another embassy going to Ch'ang - An , the capital of China , and offering " musicians and jugglers ....
They said of themselves : ' We are men from the west of the sea ; the west of the sea is the same as Ta - ts ' in ' , " 30 ( the sea being the Gulf of Persia ) .
From then on the designation Li-kan is seldom used , and Ta-ts'in , with a later spelling of Ta - Ch'in , becomes the usual designation .
Since the early Christians in China , as the famous Monument inscription of 781 indicates , were called Ta - Ch'in Chiao , Ta Ch'in Religion , as we shall see shortly , it is important to determine where Ta - Ch 'in was .
One of the early Chinese records is worth quoting at some length :
The country of Ta-ts 'in is called Li-chien ( Li-kin ) and , as being situated on the eastern port of the sea , its territory amounts to several thousand li .. . .
Their kings always desired to send embassies to China , but the An - Shi ( Parthians ) wished to carry on trade with them in Chinese silks , and it is for this reason that they were cut off from communication .
This lasted till ... ( 166 A.D. ) when the king of Ta-ts 'in , An - tun , sent an embassy who , from the frontier of Jih-nan ( Annam ) offered ivory , rhinoceros horns , and tortoise .
From that time dates the direct intercourse with this country .
31
The country of Fu-lin , also called Ta -ts 'in , lies above the western sea .
In the southeast it borders on Po-ssu ( Persia ) ....
The emperor Yang - ti of the Sui dynasty ( A.D. 605-617 ) always wished to open intercourse with Fu-lin , but did not succeed .
In ... ( 643 ) the king of Fu-lin , Po - to - li , sent an embassy .
[ Then mention of embassies in 667 , 701 , and 719 are followed by this statement . ]
A few months after , he further sent ta - to - sheng [ great - virtuous - priests , a term like Reverend , doubtless for Nestorians who arrived then ] to our court with tribute .
32
Saeki identifies An-tun with the Roman emperor Marcus Antonius .33
Hirth states , " We may say , in a few words , Ta-ts 'in was Syria as a Roman province ; Fu-lin was Syria as an Arab province during the T'ang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , and as a Seldjuk province during the Sung dynasty ( 960 - 1280 ) .
" 34 Saeki believes that the etymological derivation of Fu-lin is from E - fu-lin for Ephraim , between Jerusalem and Samaria .35
This opinion is corroborated by the reference in the first Chinese Christian document of 638 , " The Jesus Messiah Discourse , " of which we will take note later , in which we read , " Just about that time , the One ( Jesus Messiah ) was born in the city of Jerusalem in the country of Fu-lin ( Ephraim ) .
" 36 Hirth also states it is his view " that all the first embassies sent from Fu-lin during the T'ang dynasty were carried out by Nestorian missionaries .
The Nestorians enjoyed a great reputation in Western Asia on account of their medical skill . "
37
The Chinese records give a graphic picture of the long trade routes across their country , around the south of the Gobi desert , to the Oxus River , into Parthia and on to Mesopotamia .
An alternate route was by sea from Canton , around the Malay peninsula , past the southern tip of India and into the Persian Gulf .
Yule writes , " At this time , ( early fifth century ) the Euphrates was navigable as high as Hira , a city lying southwest of ancient Babylon ... and the ships of India and China were constantly to be seen moored before the houses of the town .
"
38 The Chinese either turned their goods , chiefly silks , over to the Arabs here , or over to the Parthians at the Oxus River , the latter then bringing them to Hira .
There they were transshipped around the Arabian peninsula , up the Red Sea to Solomon 's Ezion - geber or the Aelana ( modern Akabah ) of the Romans ; from there caravans carried them to Petra , the great market city , to sell them to the western traders .
Of Petra Hirth writes :
During the first two centuries A D. , Petra or Rekem , was the great emporium of Indian ( and , we may add , Chinese ) commodities , where merchants from all parts of the world met for the purpose of traffic ....
Under the auspices of Rome , Petra rose , along with her dependencies , to an incredible opulence ....
This prosperity was entirely dependent upon the caravan trade , which at this entrepot changed carriage , and passed from the hands of the southern to those of the northern merchants .
39
It was not until the seventh century that two events brought about the demise of this great trading center .
The first was the smuggling of silkmoth eggs into Syria , concealed in a bamboo cane , the presumption being that it was done by " Nestorians , " 40 with the result that " by the end of the sixth century ( Syria ) appears to have been meeting the west 's demand for the raw material .
" 41 The other was the fall of Petra to the Mohammedans after 640 .
It was without doubt through these early oriental traders that the Syrian Christians of " Ta - Ch'in " first heard of the greatness of the Chinese Empire and determined to take the gospel there .
It is even very likely that they arranged to go with returning merchants .
We know that the time was early in the T'ang dynasty , when the empire had its widest extent , its soldiers governing 811 the way to the Oxus River , for the Nestorian Monument declares the year of their arrival at the capital of Ch'ang - An ( or Hsi - an - fu ) to be 635 A.D .
Evidence of Christian Activity in China , 635-845
Of all the evidence of the activity of the Christian missionaries in China which have come to light in the era of modem history , none has been more dramatic than the report of the discovery of the " Nestorian " stone Monument by a Jesuit priest in 1625 .
It had actually been dug up by Chinese workmen , under an old wall , two years earlier " at a certain place in Kuan - chung " 42 which Saeki identifies as the site of a " Nestorian " monastery and church near Chouchih , about 30 miles from Hsi - an - fu , the modern name for the old capital , Ch'ang - An .
When Trigault , the first Roman Catholic missionary to see it , took rubbings it had been moved to Hsi - an - fu , probably late in 1624 .
It is still there today , while an exact replica exists in the Vatican museum , with still another in Japan at the Shingon ( True Word ) Buddhist Temple on Koyasan .
When announcements of it were first made in Europe some doubted Its authenticity , claiming it was a " pious fraud " of the Jesuits to show the antiquity of their Church 's missionary efforts .
43
Of this Gibbon has written :
The Christianity of China , between the seventh and the thirteenth century , is invincibly proved by the consent of Chinese , Arabian , Syriac , and Latin evidence .
The inscription of Hsianfu , which describes the fortunes of the Nestorian church , from the first mission , A.D. 636 , to the current year 781 , is accused of forgery by La Croze , Voltaire , and others , who become the dupes of their own cunning , while they are afraid of a Jesuitical fraud .
44
One of the criticisms of it was that the style of writing " is too modern to be credited with a thousand year 's age .
" 45 Of this Hirth says it " is utterly baseless ....
A Chinese connoisseur , who had never heard of the Nestorian Tablet , and to whom I showed a tracing of it , declared it at once as ' T ' ang - pi , ' i.e. , written in the style of , and containing the slight varieties adopted during , the T'ang dynasty . "
46
The stone itself stands over nine feet high , three feet wide , and one foot thick , with two dragons carved over the top edge , a small " Nestorian " cross near the top center , and nine large Chinese characters below it reading , " A Monument Commemorating the Propagation of the Ta - Ch'in Luminous Religion in the Middle Kingdom ( China ) . "
It is stated to have been composed by a Persian presbyter named Adam and erected on " the 7th of the First Month of 781 A.D. " by one " Lord Yazedbouzid " chorepiscopos of Hsi-an .
Adam 's Chinese name is given as Ching - ching , and in Syriac , Saeki says , it is stated on the stone , " Chorepiscopus , and Papash of Chinestan . "
47
The names of some 70 missionaries are given in Chinese and Syriac at the end of the 2000 - word inscription .
The inscription describes how the missionaries arrived in 635 , were welcomed by the emperor , and instructed to put some of their writings into Chinese .
( A later document , " The Book of Praise , " indicates that there were then 530 Christian manuscripts at hand . )
48
They were given permission by proclamation in 638 to stay and teach , and a monastery was built for them outside the city in the I - ning ward .
The names of the T'ang emperors are mentioned and praised as benefactors , some sending their portraits to be hung in the monastery and providing generous patronage .
In return , the priests prayed for them and their ancestors daily .
The arrival of 17 reinforcements from TaCh 'in in 744 is mentioned which is in harmony with a Syrian church record of the departure then of these 17 missionaries49 Comment on the doctrinal portion of the inscription will be made later .
A Japanese scholar , Dr. Takakusa , while studying " The Catalogue ( of the books of ) teaching of Chakya ( Buddha ) in the period of Chanyuan " ( 785-804 A.D. ) , discovered a passage referring to the Christian presence in Hsian , and particularly to that of Adam Ching - ching .
The passage referred to Prajna , the Indian Buddhist scholar who came to China in 782 .
It stated : " He translated together with Ching - ching , Adam , a Persian priest of the monastery of Ta - Ch'in , the Satparamita sutra from a Hu ( Uigur ) text , and finished translating seven volumes .
" 50 The Catalogue writer went on to complain that Prajna knew neither Uigur nor Chinese and that Ching - ching knew no Sanskrit nor understood Buddhism , but both were seeking vainglory .
He further mentioned that " They presented a memorial ( to the Emperor ) expecting to get it propagated " but that the Emperor ( Tetsung , 780 - 804 ) was wise and after examining their work determined that it was poorly done , " the principles being obscure and the wording vague .
The emperor then declared that the Ta - Ch'in religion and Buddhism were entirely opposed to each other ; Ching - ching handed down the teaching of Mi-shih - ho ( Messiah , using the same three Chinese characters as were used on the Nestorian Stone ) while ( Prajna ) propagated the sutras of the Buddha .
It is wished that the boundaries of the doctrine may be kept distinct .
" 51 With that the emperor forbade the two from working together further .
The nine Chinese manuscripts and two Syriac ones found in China - - some of them found in a cave sealed in 1036 in Tun-huang52
With one claiming that it was 641 years since Jesus Messiah was born and another giving the Chinese dating corresponding to 717 - - are also strong evidence of the presence of the Christians in China .
These manuscripts will be described and examined for their theological content later .
Striking evidence of these early Christian times is presented by the remains of the monastery built at Chou- chih where the Monument vas found .
The building has long since crumbled away , but eleventh century Chinese poets have mentioned it in their poems by the name of Ta - Ch'in Ssu ( temple ) , and in 1933 a famous tower on the property was still standing while the people of the area still called the place Ta - Ch'in Ssu.53 Further , tombstones with " Nestorian " crosses on them , in areas where the local records indicate they date from the Tang era of the eighth and ninth centuries , have been found in different places in China .
54
Farther west , in the area of the salt sea in Turkestan called Lake Issyk - kul , over 600 tombstones with crosses on them were found in two ancient cemeteries .
The oldest date was 858 and the latest 1342 .
The inscriptions on many were in the Syriac script but the names indicate that these people were native converts .
One inscription reads , " This is the grave of Pasak -- The aim of life is Jesus , our Redeemer . "
Another states , " This is the tomb of Shelicha , the famous Exegete and Preacher who enlightened all the cloisters with Light , being the son of Exegete Peter .
He was famous for his wisdom , and when preaching his voice sounded like a trumpet .
" 55 Among the names are those of " nine archdeacons , eight doctors of ecclesiastical jurisprudence and of biblical interpretation , 22 visitors , three commentators , 46 scholastics , two preachers and an imposing number of priests .
" 56 A chorepiscopus is also buried there with mention that he came from a nearby city .
This last resting place of the saints of 700 years ago is mute witness of a past genuine Christian presence .
As Stewart says of it , " Only in the grave stones from Semiryechensk ( its Russian name ) do we find evidence of the rich and varied Christian life which prevailed in one tiny corner of these extensive areas , filled as they once were with Christian communities .
"
57
The Tun-huang cave of western China , sealed , as mentioned earlier , in 1036 and not opened until about 1900 , contained over 2,000 manuscripts , including some Christian ones .
Also it had a painting on its walls of a Christian bishop on horseback , carrying a bishop 's rod with a " Nestorian " cross on the end .
In addition there was in the cave a silk screen painting of a robed man wearing a crown with a gold cross , with two other crosses around his neck , holding a bishop 's rod .
This painting was acquired by the Sir Aurel Stein expedition in 1908 , and is now in the British Museum in London .
58
It seems to be beyond doubt a painting of an Oriental Christian bishop of the pre-1000 A.D. era .
( See back cover painting . )
One of the intriguing aspects of the painting is that the right hand is held up with the thumb touching the tip of the second finger .
The " Nestorians " were well known for their fondness for symbols .
Was this posture a double witness to the Trinity with its triangle of thumb and finger and the remaining three fingers pointing upwards ?
Buddha images and paintings of earlier centuries usually show him with hands clasped in his lap or an upraised hand with open palm .
In later centuries , however , it is not uncommon to see Buddha figures with the right hand raised in the posture of this painting of a Christian bishop .
The question as to who used this symbol first is not answered , but it does seem to have more significance as a Christian Witness .
A tomb excavated in Manchuria in 1927 contained crosses and coins of the early eleventh century .
Historical records show that those buried there were Uigurs , a Tatar tribe converted by the early missionaries .
59 Saeki feels that the Syriac script still found in some places in Manchuria today , which this writer has seen himself over some building entrances , is " nothing but the greatest Nestorian relics of all .
"
60
In addition , numerous references to the Persian missionaries in the land appear in the Imperial historical annals of China .
For instance , the full proclamation of permission , issued in 638 and referred to on the Monument , appears with " the Persian monk A - to - pen ( Abraham ) bringing scriptures and teaching from far " specifically mentioned .
61 Again , " In the ninth month of the twentieth year K'ai - yuan ( October 732 ) the king of Persia sent the chief Pan - na - mi ( Barnubi ) with the monk of great virtue , Chi-lieh ( Cyriacus ) as ambassadors with tribute . "
62 But these casual references are too numerous to mention further .
The evidence of the presence of the " Nestorian " missionaries in China during the T'ang era is incontestable .
On the basis of the Chinese records alone Hirth states dogmatically , " all the first embassies sent from Fu-tin during the T'ang dynasty were carried out by Nestorian missionaries . "
63
In Japan and Korea also , evidence of a past early Christian presence survives .
Two beams of an ancient temple , dating from the late seventh century , with crosses on them and having inscriptions identified by professor Sayce as being " in an alphabet akin to Syriac , " 64 are in the Tokyo National Museum .
In northwest Japan is a large tomb , dating from about the same time , known to the local people as " the tomb of Jesus . "
In all probability it is the tomb of a " Nestorian " Christian who preached Jesus , perhaps even bore
His name , who was buried there in the tomb period .
The Shoku - Nihongi , published in 797 , refers to the return from China in 736 of an envoy who brought with him " a Persian by the name of Limitsi and another dignitary of the church of the Luminous Religion ( Kei Kyo- Chinese , Ching Chiao ) called Kohfu .
" 65 Elsewhere in Japanese history the Persian is referred to as Rimitsu , the physician .
The Empress Komyo was very much influenced by his teaching and later built a hospital , an orphanage and a leprosarium , works of mercy typical of the " Nestorian " practical Christianity , but not of the Buddhism of that day .
One of the most sacred objects of the Shingon sect of Buddhism at the Nishi- Honganji Temple in Kyoto , founded by Kobo Daishi after he returned in 806 from China 's capital and contact with the " Nestorian " monastery there , is a copy of the early missionary manuscript , " The Lord of the Universe 's Discourse on Almsgiving , " a commentary on the Sermon on the Mount and other Matthew passages .
It is said that Shiriran spent hours daily studying this Christian document .
The oldest structure in ancient Kyoto is the Lecture Hall of the Koryuji Buddhist Temple , rebuilt in 1165 .
According to Teshima , the original building was not Buddhist but Christian , erected in 603 .
This building burned down and was rebuilt about 818 as the Koryuji Buddhist Temple .
When this writer visited it in 1976 , he was given a pamphlet describing something of the temple 's history but nothing of its possible Christian origin .
Amazingly , however , the pamphlet had on the cover page as the first two of five Chinese ideographs the characters Tai Shin , the same being the first two on the famous Nestorian Stone ( in Chinese Ta Ch'in ) indicating the Mediterranean - Mesopotamian area homeland of the missionaries .
Immediately following the Tai Shin , in parentheses , was uzu masa in Japanese hira gana script .
Saeki claims that the ethnic origin of these two , non-Japanese words ( the meaning of which Japanese scholars can only speculate ) is the Aramaic Yeshu Meshiach , Jesus Messiah .
Remarkably the temple thus bears the names of its original identity , Tai Shin , the place of origin of the religion and the missionaries who brought it , and of Jesus Christ , the One once worshipped at that ancient church .
Further identity of uzu masa is in a song of 641 recorded in the ancient history text Nihonshoki : " O Lord , our Uzu Masa , How majestic is your name in all the earth !
You are truly God of gods .
" 66 The identification of Uzu Masa with the God of gods and Lord of the earth could not be clearer .
The most revered object in the Koryuji Temple is the pine carving of a sitting Miroko ( Maitreya ) Buddha , brought over from North Korea in the ninth century .
The features , including a large , thin nose , are Semitic , not Far Eastern .
This is the Buddha of the next coming , whose return to earth will bring marvelous deliverance to all living beings , a concept that arose in Buddhism about the beginning of the fourth century A.D. in India , at a time when Christianity had made great progress there .
Maitreya is held to be the Hindi version of the Greek word Metatron , change of time , denoting the time of the coming Messianic deliverance and new age .
Interesting also is the fact that the figures of the right hand of this Buddha of the future coming are in the same posture of three upright fingers , with thumb and one finger forming a triangle , similar to the posture of the bishop 's hand in the painting of the " Nestorian " bishop of China .
In southwest Korea there is a cave with an entrance said to be in the pattern of the Christian cave - churches of Syria .
Some 16 stone plaques are built into the walls with figures and implements carved on them which do not represent Koreans or their culture but rather seem similar to Syrian Christian scenes .
The cave was built in the seventh century in honor of a " black monk " who is believed to have come to Korea the previous century .
67 Dr. J. G. Holdcroft , for many years a missionary in Korea , who describes this cave , also speaks of interviewing Dr. J. S. Gale , an American scholar of Korean antiquities , concerning the possibility of an early Christian presence in the Orient .
Dr. Gale replied : " Oh , yes , all of Asia had the Gospel but lost it . "
Dr. Holdcroft continued , " He stated also that in the ancient Korean literature , which is all written in the Chinese character , there are even references to God ( Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) .
` But , ' said he , ` I have never found any Korean scholar who knew where those quotations came from ' .
" 68 The Korean alphabet , a very simple one to learn , is held to have been a gift of Christian missionaries over a millennium ago , to have been revived by a Korean king some 500 years ago and then discarded , only to have been revived again by Protestant missionaries for the gospel 's propagation during the past century .
69
In the providence of God , the gospel was indeed preached throughout Asia but through compromise , ignorance of Scripture , and distortion , it became so perverted as to become almost indistinguishable from paganism and was lost to the peoples to whom it came .
Decline o f the Christians in China from 845
In the year 845 , a great disaster befell the Christian cause .
An act of proscription was promulgated by the emperor .
The Christians were not the prime targets but were definitely included .
The act was directed against the many Buddhist monasteries and temples by the emperor , " hating the monks and nuns because ( like moths ) they ate up the Empire .
He decided to have done with them , " as one report puts it .70
The act is referred to in the Chinese historical records with specific reference to the Ta - Ch'in religion , Christianity .
When Wu Tsung was on the throne he destroyed Buddhism .
Throughout the Empire he demolished 4,600 monasteries , 40,000 Refugees , settled as secular subjects 265,000 monks and nuns , and 150,000 male and female serfs , while of land ( he resumed ) some tens of millions of ch'ing .
Of the Ta - Ch'in ( Syrian Christian ) and Mu-hu Hsien ( Zoroastrian ) monasteries there were over two thousand people .
71
A further report states :
The rest of the monks and nuns , along with the monks of Ta - Ch'in ... all were compelled to return to the world .
A period was fixed for the demolition of those monasteries which were not to be allowed to remain .
( A few were to be designated objects of art . )
Materials from the demolished monasteries were to be used for repairing yamens and post -, stages .
Bronze images , mirrors , and clappers were to be melted down for coinage .
72
Although this act was withdrawn two years later , the damage was done .
Buddhism never recovered from the blow , which may account for the fact that it never became the dominant force in China that it became in Japan.73 Further , the Christian work definitely went into eclipse .
The troublous times which followed the disintegration of the Tang dynasty , with the sacking of cities and slaughter of the inhabitants , as occurred in Canton where many foreigners died , 74 must have been also a contributing factor to the eclipse of Christian churches begun over 200 years earlier .
Foster gives the report of an Arabic record , written in Baghdad about 987 , which tells of the writer meeting with a Christian monk who had seven years earlier been sent to China by the patriarch , with five others , " to bring the affairs of Christianity in that country to order . "
This young man told the Arab writing the account , " that Christianity had become quite extinct in China .
The Christians had perished in various ways .
Their Church had been destroyed .
" 75 The Christian monk had then returned to Baghdad .
Whether this delegation had really made an adequate tour is problematical .
Saeki has given evidence to show that the monasteries and churches in Chouchin and Hsi-an continued in existence long after this time .
Also in 1093 the patriarch Sabrisha III appointed a bishop George to Cathy .
76 Nevertheless the evidence is that the progress of the Christian churches in China went through a noticeable decline during the eleventh and twelfth centuries .
Saeki reports that the famous Taoist scholar , Chia Shang - hsiang , who compiled the life of Lao - tze about 1100 A.D. , apparently was unaware that the Christians had ever been present , for he classified " the remnants of the Chinese Nestorians among the 98 kinds of heretical cults or religions then known to the Taoists .
He named it ` The Messiah Heretics ' and put it in the 49th of the 98 heretical cults or religions prevailing in the 81 countries around Liu-sha and its neighborhood .
"
77
A remarkable example of the influence of Christianity on pagan religion can be seen in various concepts and rituals of the " Nestorians " being adopted , in a distorted form , by Buddhists , thereby radically affecting their tradition ,78 as witnessed by the development of the Lama sect in Tibet .
Buddhism reached Tibet in 640 , sometime before Christian missionaries did , but by the end of the first millennium , as striking resemblances show , Tibetan Buddhism had incorporated the Far Eastern " Nestorian " clergy 's increasing preoccupation with demons , holy water , prayers for the dead , confession and red vestments as well as their traditional monastic system and hierarchy topped with a patriarch - in Lamaism 's the Delai ( All Embracing ) Lama .
Although indications seem to warrant the conclusion that the curtain had fallen , finally , at the end of the tenth century , on the drama of Christianity in China , a story which opened so auspiciously at the beginning of the seventh , it was not to be so .
The evidence of its great revival three centuries later will be given in the next chapter .
Chapter 4
The Mission Under the Khans
We have already observed that during the seventh and eighth centuries the missionaries began to take the gospel into the northern tribes of that vast area of plains later known as Mongolia .
An interesting witness to the extent of the conversion of many of the southern tribes is given in the report of Benedict the Pole who accompanied Friar John of Plano Carpini on his mission from the Pope to the Khan 's court in 1245 .
As they journeyed north of the Black Sea and crossed the Don River , Benedict wrote , " next the Alans who are Christians and then the Khazars who are likewise Christianà .
After , the Circassians , and they are Christians .
And finally , the Georgians , also Christians . "
79
The first of the northern tribes to be almost completely converted were the Keraits south of Lake Baikal .
It was a later chief , the uncle of Genghis Khan , who became famous to the western world as the almost legendary Prester John.80 From the Keraits the gospel reached the neighboring Naimans to the west and the Uigurs ( ogres to Europe ) to their west .
The Manichean sect also succeeded in penetrating the latter tribe and converting a portion of it .
By then , during the eighth century , the Uigurs had replaced the East Turks as the strongest power of the area .
The Onguts north of the big bend of the Yellow River became Christians , but the Mongols and Tatars east of the Keraits were more resistant .
The Uigurs were open to civilizing influences and became a literate people through a script worked out for them by the Christian missionaries , the alphabet being the Syriac with additional letters for the new sounds .
The later Mongols , under the Khans , adopted this Uigur script for writing their own language .
The Christians , at their linguistic headquarters in Merv , sought to have the languages of all the tribes put into writing that they might have constant access to the gospel .
The effectiveness of their mission is testified to by an inscription , found at Kara - Balsaghun in this Uigur writing , attesting an astonishing transformation brought about through the conversion of the Uigurs .
It states , " This land of barbarous customs , smoking with blood , was transformed into a vegetarian state , and this land of slaughter became a land devoted to good works .
" 81 Throughout the reign of the Khans , the Uigurs were used as their secretaries .
Saeki has given a translation of an interesting inscription that shows the influence of the Uigurs and their religion in China just before the Khan conquest .
The inscription is on a stone monument erected on the side of the avenue leading to the tomb of the honorable Ma , the governor of Heng - Chow .
It states that when the Chin emperor had conquered Liaotung ( north of Peking ) he had the Uigurs of western Kansu moved there .
During the reign of the Emperor T'ai - tsung ( 1113 - 1134 ) , he heard of the image ( lit. , portrait ) worshipped by the Uigurs , and requested to see it .
The inscription states that it was taken out of " the House where the Uigurs meet and sing their hymns " 82 to be shown the emperor .
He was so impressed that he emancipated all their slaves and gave them presents of money and land .
Less than a century later one of their leaders , Ma Hsi-chi - ssu , ( a corruption of the Syriac Mar Sargis ) became the famous General Ma Ch'ing - hsiang and governor of Heng - Chou .
In the genealogical table of the Ma family , an excerpt of which Saeki translates , appears the following statement : " The ancestors of the Ma family were the descendents of the Niessuto ' o - li ( i.e. Nestorian ) noble family of the Western lands . " 83 This seems to be one of the few times the " Nestorians " are referred to in the Chinese records by a transliteration of that name rather than by the name Ta Ch'in , a reference to their land of origin ..
For four centuries Christianity spread through these primitive tribes , although in many instances it was weak through ignorance and compromised by the superstitious fear of and belief in the shaman , the soothsayers .
It was not until the coming of Genghis Khan , with his conquest of all the tribes and amalgamation of them into the Mongol Empire , including his conquest of China , that the Church of the East came to its greatest influence and extent in the Far East .
Genghis , whose original name was Temuchin , was born in 1167 , a son of the chieftain of the Mongol tribe , one of the smaller clans east of the ruling Keraits .
His father named him Temuchin ( Finest Steel ) after a defeated warrior he admired .
In subsequent battles with their hereditary enemies to the east , the Tatars , the father was killed .
Temuchin then made a treaty with the Kerait leader , a Christian with the title Prester ( Presbyter ) John .
Gradually together they conquered the neighboring tribes and through generous terms won them over .
But leaders of the aging Prester John foolishly moved him to attack the Mongols , resulting in the defeat of the Keraits and his death .
By 1205 Genghis was the sole suzerain of all the tribes , the ruler of the Mongolian plains .
The next year he called for the leaders of the tribes to assemble for a general kuriltai ( diet ) and at this council they elected him their emperor with the new name Genghis Khan , Emperor of All Men .
In 1211 the new emperor began his great war with China .
It was then a divided kingdom , with the Manchu Chin dynasty ruling north of the Yellow River , and the Sung dynasty south of the river .
Genghis conquered all the way across north China , destroying cities that withstood his thousands of horsemen ( each of whom led four horses in addition to the one he rode ) until he laid siege to Yen Ching , the capital , near the present Peking .
The city fell and the undefeatable Khan turned his armies home to his capital , Karakorum , and then on to a great southern campaign .
Before reaching home he carried out what became a common practice before each winter ; he had his soldiers slaughter the vast mass of conquered people he had used as slave workers during the campaign .
Concerning this practice , Lamb has made the following comment :
It appears to have been the custom of the Mongols to put to death all captives , except the artisans and savants , when they turned their faces homeward after a campaign .
Few , if any , slaves appear in the native lands of the Mongols at this time .
A throng of ill - nourished captives on foot could not have crossed the lengths of the barrens that surrounded the home of the nomads .
Instead of turning them loose , the Mongols made an end of them - as we might cast off old garments .
Human life had no value in the eyes of the Mongols , who desired only to depopulate fertile lands to provide grazing for their herds .
It was their boast at the end of the war against Cathay that a horse could be ridden without stumbling across the sites of many cities of Cathay ( China ) .
84
On the southward march , Genghis Khan 's armies defeated the last of the nomad tribesmen of " the Roof of the World " and then crossed the T'ien Shan range to face the great Muslim power of the Shah of Kharesm .
At this time Islam was at the height of its martial power .
The crusaders had been driven back to their coastal forts and the western Turks were pushing the enfeebled Greek empire out of Asia .
The great army of the Shah was equipped with superior armor - steel swords that could be bent double , chain mail , light steel helmets , gleaming shields and even some guns .
They also used Greek fire and understood flaming naphtha and the use of catapult machines .
This was the greatest military power Genghis had yet faced .
But he totally overthrew it .
As Genghis remained behind to reduce the great cities of the Kharesm empire , he sent two of his generals , with 20,000 cavalry , to pursue the fleeing emperor .
They followed him to Baghdad , then north into Georgia , and , following news of his death , they crossed the Caucasus Mountains , defeated a Russian army of over 80,000 and returned to their Khan by way of circling the Caspian Sea .
It has been called an amazing march , " the greatest feat of cavalry in human annals .
" 85 Meanwhile Genghis reduced city after city -- Kashgar , Balasaghun , Samarkand , Bokhara , Herat , Merv , Balkh , Nishapur - - some of the greatest cities in the world , with all their wealth , culture , industries , libraries , and ancient art were destroyed .
Some descriptions of the extent of these destructions -- with many of the cities being centers of strong Christian communities - have been given .
When Herat fell , 1,600,000 people were taken out of the city and killed , this once magnificent capital eventually reduced to 40 persons .
Kharesm 's population was divided up with each Mongol soldier being given 24 people to kill , until the population of 1,200,000 were exterminated .
86 Merv , the great educational and translation center of the Christians , had its population of 1,300,000 divided into three masses of men , women and children ( excepting only 400 craftsmen whom the Mongols wanted ) , who were then forced to lie down while they were strangled or slashed to death .
87 Nishapur , another Christian center , had its population of 1,747,000 also put to death .
Muslim and Christian alike suffered terribly in this first invasion of the Mongolian hordes .
When it was over , Genghis Khan ruled from Peking to Mesopotamia , from the Knieper River to the Indus , an area covering eight longitude .
In all of this " he succeeded in destroying a larger portion of the human race than any modern expert in total warfare .
"
88
In 1222 Genghis returned to Karakorum for a few years rest , but in 1225 he was on the march again , southeastward , to conquer the Sung dynasty of south China through Kansu , the center of the Tibet kingdom .
Here he died in 1227 .
The escort that accompanied the funeral death cart to Karakorum had orders to strike down every individual met so no word of the Khan 's death could leak out in China .
Genghis had called himself " The Scourge of God , " believing , as his great seal declared him to be , " The power of God on Earth ; the Emperor of Mankind . "
In spite of his frightful behavior towards his fellow men , he constantly affirmed that he believed in one God whose will he was carrying out .
His yasa or code of laws regulating Mongol life began with the statement : " It is ordered to believe that there is only one God , creator of heaven and earth , who alone gives life and death , riches and poverty as pleasures Him - and who has over everything an absolute power . "
The influence of the Christianity of the Keraits , Genghis ' strongest tribe , is without a doubt apparent in this statement with its witness to the sovereign God of creation and providence .
The next rule of the yasa shows his sense of religious toleration , a mark of all the Khans .
" Leaders of a religion , preachers , monks , persons who are dedicated to religious practice , the criers of mosques , physicians and undertakers are to be freed from public taxes and charges .
"
89
Genghis Khan 's rule introduced the pax Tatarus .
It was completely safe to travel from the Pacific to the Black Sea with a Mongol safe conduct .
He set up a pony express , with way stations every 25 miles for a change of horse , and lodging every 100 miles .
The envoys from the pope in 1245 , led by John Plano Carpini , and from King Louis of France in 1253 , led by William of Rubruck , tell of traveling by this highly efficient route , month after month , the more than 6,000 miles from their homelands to Karakorum .
Genghis gathered excellent Chinese and Christian administrators and scribes about him who organized his conquered domains efficiently .
He required the Uigurs to give the Mongols a written language , and Carpini has written , " These people , ( the Uigurs ) who are Christians of the Nestorian sect , he also defeated in battle , and the Mongols took their alphabet , for formerly they had no written characters ; now however they call it the Mongol alphabet .
" 90 This Mongol script from the Uigur alphabet ( gift of the early Christians ) became the usual medium of writing throughout the vast area of the Mongol empire and , as Stewart says , " the parent of alphabets made use of by other more backward tribes such as ... the Manchus . "
As an illustration he speaks of an ancient Uigur manuscript existing which " supplies us with a specimen of the Nestorian alphabet as adapted to the use of the Ugro - Altaic tribes .
It shows the connecting link between the Nestorian writing and the various Mongolian alphabets . "
91
The Mongol emperors kept physicians in their courts who were available to the people .
Among them the Christian physicians , with their knowledge of the use of rhubarb and sherbet , were the most respected .
Rubruck mentions seeing rhubarb used at Karakorum while Saeki translates a Chinese description of a Christian physician using sherbet at the court of Kublai Khan .
The writing speaks of physicians who were of the Yeh - li - k 'o - wen religion ( the religion of Christian priests ) who made sherbet from fragrant fruits by boiling them and mixing with honey .
She - li - pa - ch 'ih ( a man of sherbet ) is the name of his office .
His Excellency had the hereditary skill ( to make sherbet ) and it often had miraculous effect .
The Emperor specially granted to him a gold tablet and made him devote himself solely to the office .
" 92 The missionaries ' knowledge of the value of fruit and vegetables for the sick and their physicians ' effective use of that knowledge was well known in the Khan empire .
In 1236 the Mongol armies were on the move again , under their new suzerain , Ogotai , and his chosen generals Batu and Subutai .
Batu divided his " golden Horde " of some 40,000 men into four army corps and moved west from the Volga into Europe .
Kiev fell and the population was massacred ; the German and Polish army was destroyed near Leignitz and that city too was massacred .
The Hungarian army of 100.000 was wiped out as Subutai joined his forces with Batu's , and the Templers died to a man as the Teutonic Knights had at Liegnitz .
Pesth ( Budapest ) was captured and the victorious armies of Batu and Subutai marched into Austria to Nieustadt , southwest of Vienna , with no army left to stop them .
The European armies , mostly afoot , were slow and poorly led by their kings .
In less than two months of 1241 the Mongols had destroyed three of their great armies and many small ones as the Mongol cavalry captured all their great cities .
The Mongols were in the process of overrunning all the country south of Vienna in their ruthless manner when news suddenly arrived that Ogotai Khan had died , poisoned by a mistress , and that they were to return for a council meeting to elect a new Khan .
By that providence of God , Europe was spared from further invasion .
A thoroughly alarmed Christendom , however , now began to take steps to send envoys to the Khans to see what could be done to prevent such further devastating incursions .
To Europeans the Mongols were usually referred to as Tatars ( their neighboring tribe ) or Tartars , for they liked to say they came from Tartarus ( hell ) .
The first envoy , from Pope Innocent IV in 1245 , was John of Plano Carpini .
Carpini wrote a fascinating " History of the Mongols " in which he described the strange culture he was plunged into during his long trek to Karakorum .
There he was present for the election to the Kha Khanship of Ogotai 's son , Guyuk , whom Stewart , quoting a certain Bar Hebraeus , holds to have been a Christian .
The latter stated , " He was a true Christian and in his days the prestige of the numerous Christians bodies in his dominions was very high .
His camp was full of bishops , priests and monks .93
Many of his advisers and ministers were Christians , including the Chinese son of Genghis ' chief minister , Ye Liu Chutsai .
This son had a chapel with a cross on it built before his tent .
Guyuk 's mother was a Christian as were many of the wives of Khans .
Because the Keraits , for a number of centuries Christians , were more advanced in civilization the khans usually took their chief wives from their tribes .
Dawson speaks of the fame of Baigi , wife of Tuli and mother of the Great Khans Mangu and Kubilay , and of the II Khan of Persia , Hulagu , as a Christian and adds that the chief wife of Hulagu " Dokuz Khatun , is described by the Armenian chronicles as a second St. Helena .
" 94 Rubruck speaks of seeing the wife of Mangu Khan come to the " Nestorian " chapel with all her children for Christian services , and of an occasion when Mangu also came .
One of the hymns sung at such services is preserved to us .
It begins " the Son of Mary is born to us " and is written in alternate strophes , one in Syriac and one in Mongolian.95
Guyuk 's reply to the pope through Carpini was conciliatory but contains some interesting theology .
The contents of your letters stated that we ought to be baptized and become Christians
... you wonder at so great a slaughter of men , especially of Christians and in particular Poles , Moravians and Hungarians ....
Because they did not obey the word of God and the command of Genghis Khan and the Khan , but took council to slay our envoys , therefore God ordered us to destroy them and gave them into our hands .
For otherwise if God had not done this , what could man do to man ?
But you men of the West believe that you alone are Christians and despise others .
How can you know to whom God deigns to confer His grace ?
But we worshipping God have destroyed the whole earth from the East to the West in the power of God . "
96
The Western attitude , and the charge against it , do not seem to have changed much in 700 years .
Guyuk 's favoritism to the Christians can be seen in an edict he issued concerning treatment of them in Muslim lands .
" We have come with authority and power to announce that all Christians are to be freed from servitude and taxes in Muhammadan lands , and to be treated with honor and reverence .
No one is to molest their gods , and those of their churches which have been destroyed are to be rebuilt and they are to be allowed to sound their plates .
" 97 Carpini in his report wrote of Guyuk , " he maintains Christian clerics and provides them with supplies of Christian things ; in addition he always has a chapel before his chief tent and they sing openly and in public and beat the board for services after the Greek fashion like other Christians , however big a crowd of Tartars or other men be there .
The other chiefs do not behave like this .
" 98
It was doubtless this strongly pro-Christian position that led him to try to restrict the voracious campaigning of sub -Khan Batu , who then retaliated by arranging to have Guyuk poisoned in 1248 .
Guyuk 's mother served as regent for three years when Tuli 's son , Mangu , was elected the new Kha Khan .
Mangu 's mother too was a Christian ( a niece of Prester John ) , as was also his wife .
Rubruck , as mentioned , reported that he saw this first wife and her children worshiping in the " Nestorian " chapel , that her daughter was a devoted Christian , and that the oldest son seemed to be also .
Mangu had Christian advisers , his chief secretary being one , and provided one of their scholars to be the teacher of his oldest son .
Rubruck describes how at the services the Christians " proffered their right hand to all present in the church , for this is the custom of Nestorians on entering the church .
" 99
He also mentions visiting " a completely Nestorian village " and states that at Mangu 's headquarters during Quinquagesima , the Lent of the Easterns , great crowds of Christians streamed every day of the first week to the church , the archdeacon of which was " a well - educated man . "
He adds , " On Easter Eve the Nestorians baptised in the most correct manner more than 60 people , and there was great common joy among all the Christians . "
He also mentions that " Nestorians " were living in China : " There are Nestorians in 15 cities in Cathay and they have a bishopric there in the city called Hsi-chin ( near Peking ) .
" 100
During Mangu 's reign Hulagu , his brother , founded the 11 Khan dynasty in Persia and ruled in Baghdad until he died in 1265 .
Stewart has written of his wife :
Dokuz Khatun is described as " the believing and true Christian queen . "
She exercised a great influence for good on her husband .
When Baghdad was taken by the Mongols , the Christians , as Bar Hebraeus tells us , were spared death and torture because of " the magnanimity , the wisdom and the marvelous high character of Hulagu . "
In 1265 Hulagu and his wife died .
" The Christians of the whole world greatly mourned the loss of these two great luminaries and protagonists of the Christian religion , " Bar Hebraeus concluded .
101
A Muslim writer later wrote that when in 1259 Hulagu proclaimed religious freedom of worship , with no Muslim interference , " On that day there was no single Christian of the common people or of the highest who did not put on his finest apparel . "
Two decades later Il Khan Arghun ordered that Christian churches destroyed in the previous wars were to be rebuilt .
From the time of Muhammed in the seventh century , Christians from Syria to India never had more freedom nor prestige than in the thirteenth century under the Il Khans .
Following Mangu 's death in 1259 , his brother Kubilay was elected Kha Khan the next year .
In 1267 Kubilay moved his capital to Khanbalik ( Khan capital city ) , a city he founded on the edge of what is now Peking , and established the Yuan dynasty of China .
Marco Polo , who spent nearly 25 years serving him , has given with elaborate praise many vivid descriptions of his empire - the efficiency of his administration , the magnificence of the paved highways covering China , the humaneness with which he governed his people and the splendor of his court .
A modern historian gave this appraisal of Kubilay 's reign : " He ruled over a wider extent than any Mongol or indeed any other sovereign .
He was the first to govern by peaceful means .
The splendor of his court and the magnificence of his entourage easily surpassed that of any Western ruler .
" 102
Marco Polo also frequently refers to the many " Nestorian " Christians he found throughout China on his travels for the emperor .
He especially singled out " the beautiful Church of Nestorian Christians in Hangchow , " the capital of the southern Sung dynasty , which Kubilay Khan captured in his conquest of all China .
Remnants of this church , according to Saeki , stone relics , are still there , while the street it was on , Mao Lao Hsiang , he suggests , is a survival of the Syriac Mura ( meaning church ) Lane .103
Polo speaks of seeing three churches in Kanchou in the far west where Christianity was strong and the government of the province was in the hands of Christians .
Saeki also tells of discovering in the imperial history of the Yuan Dynasty the record of Ai-hsieh , a high minister of Kubilay Khan 's court , " a man from Fu-lin ( Ephraim ) in the Western Lands , " whom the emperor greatly honored and valued for his integrity and forthright , uncompromising advice , even though it frequently differed from the emperor's .
This man seems without question to have been a Christian , with the names of his children being given as Elijah , Daniel , Isaac , George , and Luke .
His wife 's name was Sarah .
Chinese records frequently associate men from Fu - 1in with the Ching Chiao religion , Christianity .
104
A fascinating testimony to the virility of the Christian witness in China during this time is the story of two young Christian leaders who , in 1278 , set out from Kahnbalik to see Jerusalem .
Both were Orientals , Rabban Sauma an Ongut Turk born in the capital , and Rabban Markos his fellow countryman .
105
While they were still in Mesopotamia the patriarch of the Church of the East died and in 1281 Markos was elected to take his place .
Three years later , together with the Il Khan Argun , Markos sent his friend Sauma to the Western powers , asking for joint action against the Muslims to regain Jerusalem .
He visited Philip IV of France , Edward I of England , and the new pope , Nicholas IV , conducting Christian services with them .
Dawson has given us the following report :
Thus when the cardinals expressed surprise that a Christian priest , attached to the patriarchate ( at Baghdad ) should have come as an envoy from " the king of the Tartars , " Rabban Sauma replied : " know ye that many of our fathers in times past entered the lands of the Turks , the Mongols , and the Chinese and have instructed them in the faith .
Today many Mongols are Christians .
There are queens and children of king : ; who have been baptized and confess Christ .
The khans have churches in their camps .
They honour Christians highly and there are many faithful among them .
And as the King is united in friendship with the Catholics ( patriarch ) and purposes to take possession of Syria and Palestine , he asks your aid for the conquest of Jerusalem .
106
Edward I , tremendously impressed with what he had heard , replied to Rabban Sauma , " We have seen a thing than which nothing is more wonderful , that is to say that in the countries of the Franks there are not two confessions of Faith , but only one confession of Faith , namely that which confesses Jesus Christ ; and all Christians confess it .
" 107 Since it was clearly understood that Rabban Sauma was a " Nestorian " Christian , representing his Church as an envoy of the patriarch , Edward 's words were a striking testimony to the fact that the Church of the East 's christology was not now being held suspect of the heretical doctrine for which Nestorius was accused and condemned in 431 .
Sauma used the East Syrian liturgy but both Edward I and the Pope received communion from him .
In the summer of 1274 , at the Council of Lyons , an Act of Union had been subscribed to by the Eastern and Western Churches , with the envoys of Abaga Il Khan present .
Apparently the new spirit of detente included the Church of the East , long called " Nestorian , " and a more objective realization that it had not really been christological doctrine which had divided them in the past .
The pope sent back a reply with Rabban Sauma to Markos , who ruled under the patriarchal name of Mar Yaballaha III , in which he confirmed the latter 's " patriarchal authority over all the Orientals . "
For one brief period of history sovereigns either espousing Christianity or friendly to it reigned from the Atlantic to the Pacific across Europe and Asia .
A politically divided Europe was not able to rally around the Mongol request for united action against the Saracen hold on Jerusalem .
Edward I was deeply convinced of the significance of the opportunity before them but could not raise support for united action .
The powerful Mameluk sultanate of Egypt gradually pushed the Christians and Mongols out of Palestine and Syria .
Argun 's own son became a Muslim in 1291 , in spite of his baptism , and the opportunity for continued religious toleration for Christians from the Atlantic to the Pacific under sovereigns friendly to Christianity was lost .
In the century that followed , the advance of the gospel was politically and religiously resisted throughout Asia .
Kubilay Khan 's benevolent reign was coming to an end at this time .
He was the first Mongol ruler of a united China and twice ( 1274 , 1281 ) he had tried to add Japan to his domains with great invading fleets .
The second attempt was a total disaster as a great typhoon struck ( called by the Japanese kamikaze , a divine wind ) destroying the fleet .
One of the relics of that invasion is preserved in the Nichiren Mongolian Invasion Museum of Fukuoka , an iron helmet with a " Nestorian " cross inlaid in silver within a heart design .
Spears , swords , and even two hand guns used in the 1281 invasion are also there .
From then on Kubilay Khan limited himself to more peaceful enterprises .
His system of roads and canals was unsurpassed anywhere .
He maintained a postal service throughout the twelve provinces into which he divided China .
He produced paper currency , printed by woodblock printing .
When Francis Bacon described the three Chinese inventions of printing ( improved to movable type in Kubilay 's era ) , gunpowder , and the magnetic compass , all of an earlier period but all improved under the Yuan , he declared they " changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world .
" 108 In 1266 Kubilay had sent the uncles of Marco Polo home to the Pope with a request to bring back a hundred men of learning , devoted to Christianity , who would be capable of " proving to the learned of his dominions by just and fair argument that the faith professed by Christians is superior to and founded on more evident truth than any other . "
The Pope replied by sending John of Monte Corvino , who began an active center of Mongol Catholicism .
Kubilay Khan died in 1294 .
His dynasty continued until 1369 when the Ming revolution ousted it and a new dynasty began .
The Mings took a strong position against all forms of Christianity and within a decade brought about the suppression or extirpation of all churches and the expulsion of Christians from Peking and all government offices .
Vigorous persecution broke out against the Christians .
Stewart points out that they had to flee the country , abjure Christianity or hide their identity in a secret society , of which many new ones sprang up .
109
The persecution of the Ming dynasty was even surpassed by that of the new ruler of the former domains of the 11 Khans .
Tamerlane ( Timour the lame ) , born near Samarkand in 1336 , the son of a Turkish tribal chief , began a series of conquests that made him one of the greatest conquerors and destroyers of men and their civilizations in history .
From Moscow to the Ganges , from the borders of China to the Aegean Sea , he conquered all .
He was a Muslim who combined the savage bigotry of the Holy War with the ruthlessness and skill of Genghis Khan .
The pax Tatarus had brought open highways and 7,000 miles of peaceful interchange of commerce ; the new rule of the Muslims turned fair lands into deserts , closed the door to the distant merchant and the missionary , and erected an iron curtain between the East and the West .
Tamerlane destroyed cities without mercy .
After taking Isphahan , he ordered each of his soldiers to bring in a required number of heads until he had a pile of over 70,000 .
On the ruins of Baghdad , 90,000 heads were piled up .
Delhi fell to him in 1398 with the slaughter of immense numbers , including the execution of over 100,000 prisoners he had collected to help in the labor of the invasion .
His final expedition was to conquer China , and he gathered an army of 1,800,000 to march north from Samarkand in 1405 .
He declared , " I mean to exterminate the idolators of China .
We will proceed to this holy war .
We will slay the infields , and mosques shall everywhere rise on the ruins of their vile temples .
" 110 His death that year saved China from a frightful invasion .
Under Tamerlane Christianity was ruthlessly extirpated throughout the vast portions of Asia he ruled .
Stewart declares : " When he invaded Georgia ... the Christians who resisted were slaughtered , their churches destroyed and all sacred vessels and furniture given to the flames . "
Again , concerning a later expedition , he says of Tamerlane : " He did not omit to perpetuate the recollection of his ' immitigable hatred ' of Christianity by the destruction of every monastery and every church in the districts on the line of march .
Seven hundred towns , hamlets and monasteries , and every church built of stone and probably those built of other material as well , were levelled to the ground in another province .
The wretched inhabitants were hunted to their retreats , dislodged and finally slaughtered .
" 111 An explorer of the last century , describing what he found in central Asia , says of Tamerlane , " Having laid waste thousands of towns and destroyed countless numbers of men he left a great part of Asia a desert , covered with human bones and bloodstained ruins .
" 112
In India the Christian mission of the Church of the East had been very successful in the northern and southwestern regions .
A mark of its success was that by the eighth century the Brahmins apparently felt compelled to create a divine figure to compete with that of Christ .
Of this Stewart has written , " The fabrication of the incarnation and birth of Krishna was no doubt meant to answer a particular purpose of the Brahmins who were sorely vexed at the progress that Christianity was still making and were afraid that if it were not checked they would lose both their influence and emoluments .
" 113 He points out that a study of the horoscope of Krishna fixes the date 600 A.D. as the earliest possible date for the invention of the Krishna legend .
He footnotes outstanding scholars who consider the eighth century the probable time for the origin of the Krishna story .
114
It was not the tricks of the Brahmins , however , but the invasion of Tamerlane 's Muslims which did the greatest damage to the Christian cause .
In spite of both , one portion of the Christian church , the Mar Thoma church , has survived to the present day .
Nonetheless , by 1400 , through the Mings of China and the Muslims under Tamerlane , the Christian church was virtually blotted out of Asia .
In the two centuries from Genghis to Tamerlane , the Khans succeeded in destroying something like 20 million people .
It was not until the modern ruler of China , Mao Tzu Tung , with his estimated 45 million executions , including 200,000 Christians , 115 appeared in history that anyone was again responsible for a comparable slaughter of his fellow men .

The Uniform Bonding Code – ( UBC )
Modern Bonding Practice
With the advent of powerful computers has come the responsibility of analyzing data much more quickly and thoroughly and in terms of the general economic principles of Leontief Input - Output Matrix Analysis .
( See Wassily Leontief , Studies in the Structure of the American Economy , and Wassily Leontief , “ The World Economy in the Year 2000 , ” in Scientific American , September 1980 .
Wassily Leontief was the 1973 Nobel Prize winner in Economics . )
In the modern system of wagering , as applied to insurance and malpractice bonding , several political - legal - economic factors including Legislation , Judication , Execution ( enforcement ) and the behavior of the general public are treated mathematically as separate industries within the legal system , with the result that these industries can be interrelated b a system of feedback equations and computations , the individual workings and behavior of each industry can be much more closely monitored , and the behavior of the government and public can be predicted and manipulated .
This amounts to the application of feedback computing to reliable gambling on the economic success or outcome of any given statute or legal process .
It results in a scientific bonding system , and results in the transfer of the power and authority of government over to the bonding companies where it belongs if governments do not want to behave themselves .
( Money talks , bonding controls . )
The Bonding Problem
As human population increases and mutual human tolerance decreases , municipal corporations tend to become less sensitive to individual human needs and tend to become more antisocial toward the public .
It has been put crudely that municipal corporations become slaughterhouse operations with law enforcement officers running the sledgehammer department .
Judges ignore the rights of the people and legislators generate heaps of laws , without perfecting the ones already existing to make them fit for bonding .
Defective statutes and defective legal processes become an invitation for every sort of official malpractice and malfeasance including economic oppression , and the public , in retaliation , begins suing for every injury , putting the heat on the bonding companies .
The Solution
In order to survive in the commercial marketplace , the smaller bonding companies have had to become more selective and scientific in their bonding practice .
In the past , bonding was based on marketing a bond which covered a broad aggregate of “ bondable ” objects , acts and persons .
When a large claim was made against a small bonding company , the claim could bankrupt the small company , especially if the company could not collect its corresponding funds from the parent bonding underwriter .
By partitioning the coverage better , and be excluding persons of an antisocial disposition , the claims could be minimized , thus favoring solvency of the bonding company .
In the old aggregate system , an antisocial enforcement officer operating on an unbounded statute using an unbonded enforcement process could create a monstrous civil rights or constitutional claim against the bonding company which was underwriting the general bond on the municipal corporation for which the officer worked .
In order to maintain credibility in the bonding marketplace , the bonding company would have to pay off the claim against the bond even though the official act was criminal instead of civil .
( Birds of one feather .)
If in addition , the municipal corporation was operated by an antisocial office staff , it would tend to support , and retain in employment , the antisocial enforcement officer rather than the more civilized officers on the staff , if for no other reason than because an antisocial officer was more likely to bully the public into dropping malpractice suits and paying revenue into the corporate coffers , and thereby keep the corporate paychecks coming .
When such an antisocial corporation would get sued , as inevitably would happen , the bonding company working under the old system of aggregate bonding , would get ripped to shreds , perhaps even bankrupted .
Of course , the injured bonding company would tell the municipal corporation to take its business elsewhere , and the next bonding company , being somewhat more cautious , might refuse to bond the corporation , or ask a larger premium to cover the gambling risk .
Ultimately the municipal corporation would not be able to buy a bond due to its “ track record ” and the consequent high cost of bonding , with the result that the municipal corporation would resort to what is called “ self - bonding . ”
In the past , the state incorporation laws have required all corporations engaged in business potentially hazardous to the public safety , health and welfare , to be bonded against public accident and the malpractice of their officers , but more recently “ self - bonding ” has become a state - condoned option extended to municipal corporations to insulate them against prosecution for violation of the general state incorporation laws which demand public hazard licensing and bonding for all corporations .
A corporation that is “ self - bonded ” is a limited corporation ( ltd. ) with a low ceiling of limited liability .
The term , “ self - bonded , ” is a fraudulent misrepresentation of the corporate liability status .
It says in effect that the payment of the commercial debts of the corporation will take second place to the payment of the malpractice obligations of the corporations .
Furthermore , “ self - bonding ” cannot possibly be expected to cover the anti-civil rights and anti-constitutional malpractice potential of today ’s modern antisocial municipal corporations .
Simply put , “ self - bonding ” is “ no - bonding ; ” it is corporate limited liability misrepresentation and fraud .
( Bonding is valid only when it is provided by an independent third party money wagering pool with no conflict of interest and no possibility of the bonded party dipping into the till . )
In order to pull out of the municipal corporate bonding rat race , the smaller bonding companies have had to adopt a set of bonding policies aimed at segregation , partitioning , and making more certain , their liabilities in the bonding marketplace .
The following excerpts from the Uniform Bonding Code contains a presentation of those policies .
Claims Access Pursuant to Civil Rights Law
Improper enforcements which run counter to the U.S. Constitution can involve as many as thirty - five ( 35 ) violations of the provisions of the United States Constitution valued per 18 USC 241 at $ 10,000 per constitutional violation , per offense , per officer , per injured party when the officer is acting as a part of a law enforcement agency effort .
The civil value is therefore approximately $ 350,000 per enforcement offense , per enforcement officer , per injured party .
The statutes enabling the suit and civil claim are part of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871 .
( 42 USC 1983 , 1985 , 1986 . . .)
These statutes guarantee , among other things , the equal protection of the law for racial minority groups .
Although the argument is commonly raised that these statutes apply only to racial minority population groups , they actually apply to racial discrimination regardless of the race and regardless of the population of the group .
The application of these equal protection statutes to only racial minority population groups would create a racial discrimination against racial majority population groups , and hence impose a “ justice minority ” situation upon the racial majority population groups .
But this would make the racial minority statutes applicable to a majority race , because the intended purpose of the statute is to eliminate the prejudicial discrimination of the law and its enforcement , not to favor any specific race , color , creed , religious faith , sec or population group ( be it small or large ) .
The issue can be made even clearer by a second very appropriate example .
The legal profession ’s labor union , the Bar Association , was established immediately after the Civil War to substitute a system of general slavery to replace the old system of black slavery , by guaranteeing a monopoly of the courts for attorneys , judges and municipal corporations ( city , county , state ) .
This labor union , the Bar Association , has forbidden anyone but union ( Bar ) attorneys to give legal advice , and has prevented anyone from being assisted in court by a non-union lawyer or by a non-lawyer , thus converting the courts into closed union shops .
This corresponds to pre-Civil War United States wherein blacks were not taught to read and were not allowed to get a public education lest they become strong enough persons to speak out against their repression and overthrow their slavemasters .
The unionization of the legal system by the Bar Association makes the people individually , and the public as a whole , a legal justice minority group with access to the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and to 42 USC 1983 , 1985 and 1986 .
The bar association act in violation of anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws of the U.S .
Organized Crime in Government
Government officials maintain control of the courts by “ licensing lawyers ” and by forbidding the common citizens to “ practice law ” or give “ legal advice , ” three phrases which have never been adequately defined for any statute .
To protect government dominance , “ law schools ” are the only schools allowed to teach law , and specifically “ safe law ” ( attornment ) .
To protect malfeasance , attorneys are forbidden to file criminal complaints against malfeasance officials , officer and clerks and against officers of other corporations .
If they disobey , they lose their “ license to practice law . ”
Similarly , when the citizen files a criminal complaint against a public official , the prosecutor is expected to protect the public official from prosecution for official malfeasance by exercising some mystical doctrine of “ selective prosecution ” ( an act of misprision of crime ) which is nothing more or less than an excuse for legal prejudice to issue from the prosecutor ’s office calculated to overthrow the public ’s legal redress against official malfeasance .
Bonding of Governments in General
Conclusion
A government ( its officials , its officers , and its clerks ) will not be bonded :
if it does not eliminate its own internal malfeasance with the same diligence that it pursues civilian felons .
( In other words , a government shall clean its own nest thoroughly ) , if it rules by force without reason and / or without the consent of the people which it governs .
In such a case it shall be deemed a criminal government and its officials , officers , and clerks shall be deemed criminally malfeasant , if it behaves wirh malice or with deliberate contempt or rudeness towards its citizens .
“ Let us contemplate our forefathers , and posterity and resolve to maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former , for the sake of the latter .
The necessity of the times , more than ever , calls for our outmost circumspection , deliberation , fortitude and perseverance .
Let us remember that ‘ if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty , we encourage it , and involves others in our doom . ’
It is a very serious consideration . . . that millions yet unborn may be the miserable shares of the event . ”
Samuel Adams

1.0 LEGISLATIVE INPUT
Input Definitions and Principles
Words called terms are used to construct the ships of state called statutes .
When the terms are not properly defined , the statutes become like ships without rudders .
They move easily in any direction and do all manner of damage on the rivers of life .
TERMS WITHOUT DEFINITIONS ARE THE DAGGERS OF LAW
The Input / Definitions and Principles of Legislation will be bonded only if the bonding company finds that :
all “ common terms ” in the stated principles are used according to their common dictionary definition , all special terms in the states principles are exhaustively listed , and defined using “ common terms . ”
The “ Principles ” are universally accepted as true --- also called “ Axioms of Law . ” Or “ Maxims of Law . ”
A simple example of an Axiom or Maxim of Law would be :
( Definition : “ Hire ” = a wage or reward for work . )
( Axiom / Maxim : [ A workman is worthy of his hire . )
1.1 BONDING AND DEFINITIONS
GENERAL CONCEPTS
-- COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
-­
( Definitions , Principles , Axioms , Maxims )
The bondability of a statute .
( Legislative ) , the bondability of the process created and used to enforce a statute ( Judicative ) , and the bondability of the act of enforcement and of the enforcement officer ( Executive ) all rest primarily and absolutely upon the ability to write a binding contract in very definite terms between the bonding company and the bonded party or parties .
No bonding company will enter into a bonding agreement unless the definitive terms of the bonding contract are laid out to the precision that is likely to be tested by public claims against the bond .
The Legislative Bond : A statute , in order to be bondable , must satisfactorily define the terms and concepts used or involved in the construction of the statute .
( A statute shall not be bonded if the terms and concepts of the subject matter of the statute are not both exhaustively listed and clearly defined . )
Definitions ( ordinary )
Malfeasance :
- Unlawful or wrongful act .
- Wrongdoing in general .
Malpractice :
- Improper or illegal treatment ( Med ) .
- Improper or immoral conduct .
Crime :
-(A ) An act that subjects the doer to
legal punishment .
-( B ) The commission or omission of an act
specifically forbidden or enjoined by public law .
-(C ) Any grave offense against morality or social order .
Criminal :
- Penal law vs. criminal law .
- Implying crime or heinous wickedness .
Civil :
- Citizen rather than ecclesiastical or military .
Civil Law :
- Legal relations between citizens or between citizen and state
- legal rights .
Slander :
- Oral malicious falsehood .
Libel :
- Written slander .
1.2 BONDING AND PRINCIPLES / MAXIMS
Statutes are the motor vehicles of government .
They are used to collect revenue , to collect power and to provide public service .
Properly constructed statutes serve the public properly , poorly constructed statutes poorly , or destructively .
A defective statute is easily misused .
The easy misuse of a statute is an invitation to a rampant misuse of the statute .
If a statute can be misused to get money or power , its misuse is likely .
If a statute can easily be misused to get money or power , its misuse is virtually certain .
Defective statutes invite the deliberate misuse of the statutes .
Deliberate misuse ( misapplication ) of a statute is a criminal act .
The lack of job insurance / bonding makes people personally more cautious , causing a decrease in accidents , negligence , malfeasance and crime .
The cost of bonding premiums discourages negligence .
The bonding of negligence encourages the commission of negligence on the part of the people who do not pay the premium .
A bonding company shall not bond negligence .
No statutes are bonded against deliberate misuse , i.e. , criminal use .
If malfeasance ( criminal malpractice ) were to be bonded , that bonding would encourage malfeasance .
Malfeasance if unchecked will multiply .
Therefore , a bonding company shall not bond malfeasance or criminal malpractice .
Criminal acts include acts committed in violation of a citizen 's constitutional rights and in violation of guarantees of equal protection of the law ( civil rights ) .
Statutes which encourage criminal acts in order to enforce the statutes are not bondable statutes .
The bonding of criminal acts would encourage the commission of criminal acts , hence criminal acts ( crimes ) can not be bonded .
Bonding companies are not required to bond what they do not want to bond .
A bonding company only pays claims for damages against a bond which it sells / issues .
A bonding company must pay a claim on a bond which it has sold if the condition of the bond claim is satisfied .
A bonding company will not bond a defective statute because it does not want to pay the claim on the misuse of the statute .
Bonding a defective statute is an invitation to bankruptcy .
2.0 LEGISLATIVE CONTROL
The control / logic of legislation will be bonded only if the bonding company finds to its satisfaction that :
the definitions of the terms used in the logic are bonded .
the principles used in the logic are bonded .
the logic being used to design the statute tests , and the conclusions obtained represent , all of the possible combinations of principles and applications ( situations ) for which the specific statute is being designed , and none of the conclusions derived from the cited tested combination of principles and applications contradicts any condition .
or condition known to be wholesome to the civilization .
if a conclusion logically derived from the cited tested combination of principles and applications contradicts any condition known to be wholesome to civilization , then the reason for the contradiction has been pursued relentlessly until the cause of the contradiction has been understood perfectly , lest the definition , the principles , the logic or the understanding of the application be faulty .
a complete record has been kept of the definitions , principles and logic underlying the design of the statute and that record is publicly available .
2.1 - BONDING PUBLIC EDUCATION
RE : Right vs. Wrong
It is said that ignorance of the law is no excuse for wrong action ; that all persons are presumed to know the difference between right and wrong , hence know the law .
If that is true :
there would be no reason for public education and the practice of law , then there would be no reason to have law schools ,
Then there would be no reason why citizens could not " practice law without a license , " then there would be no reason why a citizen should not or could not sit beside a friend in court and counsel him or her .
Thomas Jefferson put it well when he said , " I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves : and if we think them
not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a ( wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them , but to inform their discretion . "
Thomas Jefferson 's Letter , September 28 , 1820 .
( Source ? ? )
What he said was that the common public should be able to " practice law without a license " and to be able to do so , they should be given a public education in law .
The public and the bonding companies would both benefit from such a situation .
It would eliminate the professional law conspiracy which preserves the malfeasance of public officials , injures the public , and precipitates most of the claims against bonding companies .
Therefore , bonding companies shall engage the policy that they shall not bond ( insure ) public schools which do not teach their student body law and " the practice of law , " and specifically shall not bond public schools which do not teach :
the Declaration of Independence , the United States Constitution , the method of writing an event log for a court case , the method of compiling a document log , the method of compiling a document analysis log , the method of analyzing legal briefs , civil complaints and criminal charges , the method of writing affidavits , the method of writing and filing U. S. criminal complaints , the method of writing a quality contract , the method of composing expository information for distribution on the street , the method of distressing and liening property , and several other processes valuable to citizens for securing their rights against , and overthrowing the malfeasance of public officials .
A public official , clerk or servant shall lose his bond :
if he interferes with the education of the public in matters of law and the " practice of law , " if he refuses to give to a citizen legal advice about a process with which he isfamiliar or if he refuses to give to a citizen legal advice which he is qualified to give because of his familiarity with and pertaining to the normal course of his public service .
But no public servant or citizen shall be held legally liable for any information which he shall give when it is given upon demand , pursuant to a citizen 's written or spoken writ of mandamus ( an order to come to one 's aid ) , pursuant to 42 USC 1986 , the brother 's keeper statute of the United States .
if he injures or oppresses any citizen who is acting in good faith and good behavior with a genuine and honest intent to practice law and / or to give legal counsel or assistance to other , if he tries to get a citizen prosecuted for " practice of law without a license " where there is no clear evidence of false advertising , fraud or injury to the party being counseled , if he tries to get a citizen prosecuted for " practice of law without a license " in order to eliminate competition in a litigation , a legal process or the legal industry generally , if he operates a court of the legal system as a facility of a legal labor union ( bar association ) reserved for state licensed attorneys only , that is as a closed union shop .
2.2 - Bonding Taxation Statutes
Just Compensation vs. Fraudulent Taxation
A government / public trust is supposed to operate on taxes , and if a government operates commercial enterprises using tax money in competition with a free enterprise public , then the money of the citizens is being used in competition with the citizens , and that will discourage the payment and collection of taxes .
It will cause tax rebellion .
( Conflict of interest )
Therefore , all revenue raised by a government 's offices of public trust must be obtained by the performance of public service not provided by ordinary free enterprise businesses .
Public service is the only sort of business in which a government is supposed to be employed .
( " Nor shall private property [ taxes ] be taken for public use without - Lust compensation [ valuable , publicly needed and publicly wanted service rendered by government ] " ) .
- The 16th so - called amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not base the assessment of taxes on services rendered by the government for the public but rather upon the services rendered by public citizens for third parties , hence , the 16th so - called amendment of the U.S. Constitution violates the 5th so­called amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
Essentially , the only lawful personal tax assessable for operating a government is a per capita_ tax determined by dividing the cost of operating the government by the number of emancipated citizens ( or persons of majority age - eighteen years old or older ) .
( A U.S. constitutional 5th so - called Amendment system of taxation based on just compensation requires a per capita tax . ) ( uniform )
A legislator will not be bonded if he legislates or attempts to legislate a law to create a source of revenue without providing an equally valuable public service which the public needs and wants .
( Just compensation )
In the U.S. constitutional 16th so - called amendment deduction system of taxation there are three economic industries :
capital , goods , and services ( labor ) .
Each has a one hundred per cent ( 100 % ) deductibility of overhead .
Therefore , the common man who works to support his family can deduct all of his household expenses for his part of providing the labor force of the nation .
There would be nothing left to tax .
Originally , the U.S. 16th so - called amendment applied only to corporate income .
Since its beginning , its wording , " Taxation on income from whatever source derived . " has been applied by the I.R.S. :
to the common laboring household although it is 100 % deductible , to gifts and inheritance to which the government has contributed no valuable , service , - which funds are , therefore , being taxed twice , to collecting taxes on crime , namely , bank robbery , organized crime and hard drug sales ( 25 % excise tax ) , making the government a beneficiary of , hence favorable toward , the commission of paying crime .
Furthermore , the Social Security System of the I.R.S. operates a fraudulent insurance / bonding scheme in competition with honest free enterprise insurance / bonding companies , as follows .
If a husband and wife both pay into the Social Security insurance system out of their common social and commercial conjugal relationship , and if one dies , the other gets the payment of the Social Security benefit on only one person .
This is a mutual financial sacrifice of two people joined as one social commercial unit , paid back only partially to the surviving person .
That is blatant insurance fraud on the part of the Social Security insurance system , and the Social Security system finances so many social service programs which it was never intended for , that it is in constant financial trouble .
A sales tax is no better .
Federal Law ( Title 42 of the U.S. Code ) includes an anti-peonage law which declares that no natural person ( citizen ) can be compelled to work for free ( not even to collect taxes or do bookkeeping for the I.R.S. or the state sales tax commissions ) .
Even if the government agrees to pay for the collection of the taxes , the law allows that a citizen can refuse to work for any specific person or organization .
Also , many persons do not believe it to be patriotic to pay taxes to the I.R.S. The I.R.S. is a Rothschild enterprise , not a part of the U.S. government , and there has been a movement in government to brand as right wing anti-Semites , those Patriots who point out the fact that the I.R.S. , the Federal Reserve , and the FDIC are all well known financial enterprises of the Jewish Rothschild family of Europe .
In fact , much of the tax protest movement , and much of the civil rights violations heaped on citizens by the legal establishment because of tax rebellion , arise out of the now common knowledge that the " national debt " has been created by a sequence of wars financed on both sides by the Rothschild family to force the U.S. to borrow money from Rothschild banks , creating an attachment of all U.S. property as collateral to pay off Rothschild war loans .
The vociferates of anti­-Semitism are not coming from common Jews , but from the Rothschild banking system which detests having the burglar 's mask ripped off its face , and which uses anti-Semitism as a decoy .
( It should be clear that it is pure financial insanity to bond any statutes , processes or enforcements connected with any form of tax collection other than those based upon a per capita tax . )
2.3 - BONDING EXIGENCY STATUTES
Statutory Fraud
( Emotional Urgent Necessity Statutes )
A legislator is said to be engaging in the confidence game of statutory fraud when he by the legislation of statute (s ) creates a false problem for , or artificial or fraudulent need in , any citizen or group of citizens in order :
to justify the creation of the capacity to offer a solution for the false problem created , or to justify the collection of taxes or revenue to finance the solution of the problem created .
A fraudulent need or want is a need or want which :
has not been solicited by the public , or has been pawned off on the public by coercive suggestion by lack of representation , or by misrepresentation of its consequences for the good of the many at the expense of individual liberty or property , or for the good of any one at the expense of the freedom of many ( lottery ) , and which is not a valuable service to the public generally .
A legislator is said to be engaging in statutory fraud when he creates a false source or apparent source of supply ( a false solution ) for any citizen or group of citizens in order
to create , for the government , the capacity to create problems for the public , or to create , for the government , a source of revenue ( e.g. , the lottery ) .
BONDING vs .
LOTTERY
Responsible Wagering versus Non-Responsible Wagering
Taxation Without Representation
An Example of the creation of a fraudulent need or want or an apparent source of supply is the operation of a state lottery .
Such a system is solicited by the public , because a large portion of the public likes to , hence wants to , gamble .
However , the consequences of a state lottery are not honestly represented to the public by the state , and the lottery does not render a valuable service for the public .
Money from the lottery gives state high officials a sense of independence which makes them feel that they can do without bonding and can risk malfeasance because they have adequate funds with which to manipulate inferior officers , clerks and the public .
Although bonding is wagering - you might call it insurance - set free from the behavioral restrictions of bonding by its monetary wealth , the state will degenerate to an organized crime syndicate and resort to the seizure of substance ( real estate , etc. ) and the means of the conveyance of substance ( waterways , etc. ) , by condemnation ( eminent domain ) , and by issuing letters of marque and reprisal ( orders to march and seize ) to mercenary law enforcement officers / UN troops .
Legislators who legislate a potentially publicly hazardous statute , must themselves be bonded against the possibility of being sued for any misuse of that statute which could arise as a consequence of the defective construction of the statute .
A legislator will not be bonded if he legislates or attempts to legislate a law to create a source of revenue without providing an equally valuable public service which the public needs and wants ( just compensation ) .
A Solution in Need of Problems - Environmentalism
Governments create causes and problems in order to justify taxation and political domination .
They always need a credible enemy to create the urgent necessity to ask for more money and to make more laws for " the good of the public " and " in the interest of national security . "
To obtain the " consent of the public , " governments create problems , or scenarios of problems , so that they will be able to offer solutions which an ignorant and somewhat gullible and self - serving public will buy .
The classic political example is the now publicly known strategy by which President F. D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill maneuvered the Japanese into attacking the U. S. fleet at Pearl Harbor , December 7 , 1941 .
[ footnote : Theobald , Rear Admiral Robert A. , The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor , Publisher , date .
and Barnes , Harry Elmer , Pearl Harbor After A Quarter of A Century , Publisher , Date . ]
Although there are many very real environmental problems , environmentalism as a political lever is the latest trick to obtain the " consent of the public . "
It is legally known as The New World Order ; it is economically known as Globalism .
" Environmental " statutes must be closely examined for exigency fraud .
[ Footnote : Hage , Wayne , Storm Over Rangelands , P.O. Box 1085 , Tonopah NV 89049 . $ 15 . ]
Some of the exigency statutes of present day governments are designed by banking and military war games computers .
The economic war games computers are the new guns of governments , firing statutes and economic and social situations as bullets .
[ Footnote : Lewin , Leonard C. , A Report From Iron Mountain , Pub ?
Date ? and " Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars , America 's Promise Newsletter , P.O. Box 30,000 , Phoenix AZ 85046 ]
2.4 - BONDING INSURANCE STATUTES
Compulsory Insurance
The bonding of statutes which require natural persons ( non-incorporated persons ) to purchase insurance , must be very carefully analyzed , and be regarded with the utmost caution .
As a general rule , it is against the law for any entity to compel any citizen to pay any wager or premium for the privilege of not being injured or for the privilege of not being threatened with injury ( Protection Insurance Racketeering ) .
[ Footnote : U.S. R.I.C.O. Laws ]
Corporations may be required by the state in which they are incorporated , to purchase public hazard insurance because the corporation , being an artificial / paper person ( a legal fiction ) , is regarded as having no conscience other than the state , making the state as a silent partner of the corporation , financially responsible for the acts of the corporation .
( That which the liege - lord giveth , the liege - lord taketh away . )
When the benefit which the state gives to the corporation is limited liability , which is a limited commercial responsibility to the commercial public , to a reasonable extent , then the state must protect the commercial public to a reasonable extent from a potential lack of commercial responsibility of the corporation or from a tendency toward a potential lack of commercial responsibility of the corporation , by requiring the corporation to purchase hazard bonding .
This requirement protects the public from some losses , and protects the state from some civil liability , by a showing of commercial good faith action .
Compulsory Motor Vehicle Insurance
Citizens are required to surrender the ultimate title of ownership of their motor vehicles ( the manufacturer 's statement of origin / MSO ) to their respective states in exchange for a certificate of title of ownership and license plates .
The state owns the vehicle because it hold the ultimate title to the motor vehicle .
The citizen has the permission to use the vehicle .
The permission can be revoked at any time by the state .
[ Tennessee Department of Revenue Operations Supervisor , Denise Rottero , before Judge Greer .
She explained Tennessee 's auto registration process . ]
The vehicle can be seized and auctioned off to provide revenue for the state .
For example , the state of Oregon seizes and auctions citizens ' motor vehicles as a penalty for soliciting a prostitute ; proving that the auto belongs to the state .
Because the state has the ultimate ownership of all of the vehicles used by all of its citizens , the state also has the ultimate liability for all accidents in which those vehicles become involved .
This is a potential reason for the state to compel citizens to purchase motor vehicle insurance .
Another reason is obvious .
The state is a silent partner in every insurance corporation incorporated in that state , and so , many of the insurance companies within the state are mere alter egos or " second selves " of the state .
In this insurance scheme the state makes it mandatory for the citizen to buy a product which the state is selling .
The individual state will get part of the insurance business ; the interstate insurance companies , regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission , will get the remainder of the insurance business .
Also , states need civil malpractice insurance .
This sort of insurance comes from " above " , from interstate insurance companies and international maritime insurance companies such as Rothschild , so , some states prostitute their legislative power as an inducement to get insurance companies to give them a better payment rate for their own malpractice insurance coverage premiums for their own corporate activities , by compelling citizens to purchase motor vehicle insurance .
In any compulsory motor vehicle insurance scheme , a citizen 's purchase of motor vehicle insurance is guaranteed by a threat of injury in the form of a suspension of the driver 's license , seizure of the vehicle , fines and imprisonment if the citizen does not comply with the state 's mandate .
This creates the basic fabric of a protection insurance racket , hence a very real credibility problem for insurance and bonding companies .
The bonding problem gets really nasty when a judge compels a citizen to either buy auto insurance or to quite driving " his " ( the " citizen's " ) car .
Because a bond or insurance is only a promise to pay and not a tangible product , a citizen can lawfully and rightfully argue that , like a savings and loan or a bank , an insurance bonding / bonding company might not be around when damage is done and it is time for a claim payoff .
Therefore the citizen can lawfully guarantee the auto insurance policy by putting a common law lien on enough of the property of the law enforcement officer and the judge to cover the face value of the insurance policy .
" This commercial lien can not be removed . "
" A federal R.I.C.O. action against the enforcement officer and the judge can also compel them to pay all of the premiums for all of the persons whom they have compelled to buy insurance . "
The voluntary purchasing of motor vehicle insurance is smart .
It is a good investment .
But compulsory purchase of any sort of insurance in order to continue the daily act of living is protection insurance racketeering .
Any bonding company which bonds compulsory motor vehicle insurance statutes is going to have big unresolvable problems , and any officer or judge who enforces compulsory motor vehicle insurance statutes is laying himself wide open to economic ruin .
3.0 - LEGISLATIVE OUTPUT
The Output Conclusion of legislation will be bonded and become a valid and lawful statute thereby , only if the bonding company finds that :
the definitions of the terms used in the conclusion are bonded , the principles used in the conclusion are bonded , the logic used in the conclusion is bonded , the conclusion has been presented to the public , has been negatively criticized because of its construction or effect , then , the conclusion has been returned to the analysis and logic stage to test and justify its construction and effect , and the legislated conclusion , after it has been subjected to public scrutiny and further analysis , is economically feasible for a wager on its public application .
If it survives this last step , the conclusion is said to be perfected for legislative bonding , and becomes a judiciable statute [ FN : " A legislative conclusion becomes a valid and lawful statute only if it is legislatively bonded . " ]
4.0 - JUDICATIVE INPUT , GENERALLY
An official , officer or clerk will not be bonded :
if he uses the power of his public office , or his position in that office , or his power of enforcement to harass or to oppress a citizen , or to create , obstacles to prevent a citizen from exercising his remedies by the due course of law .
if he deprives or hinders a citizen in the free exercise of rights guaranteed or of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the constitution of the state by which the officer is employed , or guaranteed by the National constitution or of the state into which the officer 's work takes him .
if he interferes in a citizen 's U.S. constitutional first ( so - called ) amendment legislative rights of freedom of religion , Judicative rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press ( the right to access the court of public opinion ) , and / or Executive rights to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances ( i.e. , file civil and criminal complaints - especially against malfeasant public officials ) .
FN
" If he will not file or receive the filing of a criminal " complaint [ no filing fee is required ] against a public official .
which such is necessary to curb the malfeasance of that official . "
( See also - Bonding of District Attorneys , infra . )
4.1 - Judicative Input , Specifically
The process of receipt of date input / allegations for judication by the government will be bonded only if the bonding company finds that no act was committed by any official , officer or clerk :
to ridicule , harass , oppress , injure or punish the citizen for submission or attempting to submit affidavits , allegations , arguments , claims , criminal complaints and / or damages for consideration , litigation or prosecution , or hinder or prevent the composition ( writing ) , receiving , filing or processing of the citizen 's affidavits , allegations , arguments , considerations , claims , criminal complaints and / or demands .
This rule also applies to the composition , receiving , filing and processing of affidavits , allegations , arguments , claims , criminal complaints and demands of prisoners .
For example , the enforcement process of an enforcement officer will not be bonded if the judicial process of receipt of data input / affidavits . . . is not bonded , or is not bondable .
Example :
Translation
( If it is found that an accused person was not allowed by an official or clerk to file a counter complaint with the prosecuting attorney , then the official process of the complaint against the accused party , and all official processes thereafter will not be bonded unless and until this defect of process is rectified and the accused party has had adequate time and opportunity to recover from the damage caused by being denied the opportunity to file the said counter complaint . )
An officer sued for false imprisonment for violation of the equal protection of the law ( here the prisoner 's right to counter complaint ) because of an unbondable judicial process of failing to receive data input , will pay for the damage out of municipal .
corporate property or his own personal property .
5.0 - JUDICATIVE CONTROL
The court rules , jurisdiction , and the processes of consideration of affidavits and other filings , litigation , and prosecution will be bonded only if the bonding company finds that :
Court Rules
The general rules or local rules of the court contain an explanation of the purpose for existence of each and every rule so that the purpose of the rule will take priority over the wording of the rule , and so that substance will take priority over form .
The general rules or local rules of the court contain common terms and plain wording and are of such simplicity that the common citizen can easily understand and easily and quickly make use of the rules without the need of a counselor .
Jurisdiction
The setting of the case is proper , the parties to the action are all truthfully stated , and all civil and criminal elements are clearly identified and segregated into their own jurisdictional categories .
A criminal case brought in behalf of the peace and dignity of the state : has been brought ex rel accusers , that is , " on the telling or relation / story of the accuser " with the accusation being related to the prosecuting attorney by the accuser , has named the accuser in the setting of the case , and contains the signed and notarized affidavit of the accuser in the body of the complaint .
Otherwise , the state would become the plaintiff / accuser , the case would become federal , and the bonding company would become potentially liable for an agent 's false accusation and false imprisonment of a party to the case .
In the U.S. constitutional 7th ( so - called ) amendment , civil elements of answering , discovery , deposition , interrogatories , etc. , have been put on temporary hold as a U.S. constitutional 6th ( so - called ) amendment protection against self - incrimination pending a U.5. constitutional 6th ( so - called ) amendment prosecution .
The U.S. constitutional 6th ( so - called ) amendment processes have been carried out before the U.S. constitutional 7th ( so­called ) amendment processes have proceeded , and these 6th ( so - called ) amendment processes have proceeded without delay .
Consideration of Affidavits
All affidavits have been considered , answered and affirmed or denied categorically , point­for - point in writing .
Litigation and Prosecution
All officials , officer and clerks involved in the processes of litigation have obeyed the Constitution of the United States of the state wherein they are employed , so that ; the citizens involved have receive equal protection under the laws , and the citizens ' remedies by the due course of law have been protected and guaranteed , the officials , officers and clerks involved in the processes did not operate the court and / or the judicial process as a closed union shop , that is , did not exclude or hinder non­union lawyers , non-union counsels , non-union para - legals , non-union laborers or any other non-union citizens from exercising the equal profession , the equal practice , the equal performance , the equal perfection and the equal protection of the law , .
The officials , officers and clerks involved in the processes did not act in concord , ( agreement ) union or conspiracy to interfere with or minimize the citizens ' creative access to discovery , evidence , counsel and / or remedy by the due process of the law .
Service of Legal Process
No party to the case , nor the court , has been allowed to use the U.S. mail to " serve " papers which are required by law to be " served , " not " sent . "

5.1 Bondability of Lawyers and Attorneys
( Lawyer and Attorney Are Not Synonymous )
Attorn - Law :
- To agree to recognize a new owner of a property or estate and promise payment of rent to him .
Feudal Law :
- to consent to the transfer of land by the Lord of the fee , and to the continuance of one 's own holding under the new Lord ; also , to accord homage to a Lord .
Attornment - Feudal Law :
- The acknowledgment by the tenant of a new Lord on the alienation of land ; also , the acknowledgment by a bailee that he holds property for a new party .
Funk and Wagnall 's Practical Standard Dictionary
Attorn - Law :
- To turn over ; to transfer to another money or goods ; to assign to some particular use or service .
To consent to the transfer of a rent or reversion .
To agree to become tenant to one as owner or landlord of an estate previously held of another , or to agree to recognize a new owner of a property or estate and promise payment of rent to him .
Attorn - Feudal Law :
- To turn over ; to transfer to another money or goods ; to assign to some particular use or service .
Where a Lord aliened his seigniory , he might , with the consent of the tenant , and in some cases without , attorn or transfer the homage and service of the latter to the alienee or new Lord .
Attornment :
- In feudal and Old English Law - A turning over or transfer by a Lord of the services of his tenant to the grantee of his seigniory .
( Lordship title : seignior , sir )
The doctrine of attornment grew out of the peculiar relations existing between the landlord and his tenant under the feudal law , and the reasons for the rule never had any existence in this country , and is inconsistent with our laws , customs and institutions .
Black 's Law Dictionary Revised Fourth Edition
We need to take a very close look at these words in order to understand the role of an attorney .
The setting is old England , the aristocracy held the land .
The lower class tilled the land as tenants .
When the land changed hands from one aristocratic Lord to another aristocratic Lord , a treaty was made between the tenants and the new Lord lest civil war break out between the tenants and the new Lord .
This transfer of power with treaty was called attornment .
Attornment was the method of peacefully passing land from one aristocrat to another aristocrat without disturbing the class structure .
It consisted of a peaceful method of maintaining a noble class off citizens acceptable to the common people .
This does not mean that the common people liked the situation , but they suffered evils while evils were sufferable , and made their treaties of attornment .
Therefore , in English Law attornment was a method of guaranteeing an unequal protection of the Law for the rich and the poor , but one which was at least tolerable for the poor .
It was a " peaceful " maintenance of the class structure .
An attorney 's role in this system was to provide the ceremony of the acquiescence of the poor , and to do so in such a manner ( modus operandi - MO ) as to preserve and maintain the class structure .
The peaceful unequal protection of the Law .
It is eminently clear that an attorney 's role has not changed .
Attorneys practice attornment .
Lawyer :
- A person learned in the law .
One who understands law and who loves law for its capacity to rectify the evils of society .
One who professes and practices " Liberty and Justice for all , " and therefore the equal protection of the Law .
Lawyers " practice " law .
The U.S. Constitution provides over thirty guarantees of the equal protection of the law .
A lawyer supports those provisions of guarantee ; an attorney opposes those provisions .
In America , a lawyer obeys the U.S. Constitution , the Supreme Law of the Land .
An attorney does not obey the U.S. Constitution .
Therefore , technically , a lawyer is bondable and an attorney is not bondable .
State bar associations , which deal with both extremes , must therefore rely upon " self - bonding . "
Testing and Counsel
There are both good and bad counsels .
In reality , many so - called " lawyers " practice attornment , and many so - called " attorneys " practice law .
Most persons thing the terms " lawyer " and " attorney " mean the same thing , and would not even know how to distinguish one from another .
Even the professionals call themselves , " attorneys - at - law , " a contradiction of terms which shows the confusion which prevails in law .
For the present purposes of the Uniform Bonding Code , the counsels will not be discriminated against because of the term they use to identify their occupation .
Only their behavior and " track record " will be used to determine their bondability .
" You know a tree by the fruit which it bears . "
An apple tree does not grow cherries , and a cherry tree does not grow apples .
To cite an extreme example : a lawyer will file criminal charges against a judge for failure to protect a citizen 's U.S. constitutional rights ; an attorney will not .
There are many such tests , and contracts of specific performance can be provided to would - be counsels to find out what they are actually ready , willing and able to do .
When it is necessary , a lawyer will act as a substitute and go to jail for a cause in which he believes , whereas an attorney will only dabble at " law , " will ask to be removed from a case when the going gets rough and becomes a battle , will run in the face of the enemy , and therefore deserves a summary court martial .
5.2 -- Bonding of District Attorneys
A city , county , state or federal district attorney ( including a U.S. district attorney called a " U.S. Attorney ' ) shall lose his bonding and shall not be bonded :
if he refuses to properly identify himself to the citizen when asked to do so , including giving the citizen the name and address ( or telephone number ) of his bonding company and his bond policy number ( bond number ) , if he fails or refuses to receive , for filing , a criminal complaint from a citizen against a citizen or an official , if he refused to mark or stamp the citizen 's confirmed ( compare with original ) copy of the citizen 's complaint with any of the following " Received " name of receiving office date time signature or initial of receiving clerk or official , so that the citizen can have an official receipt for delivery of his complaint ; if he fails or refuses to make a reasonably diligent effort to process the citizen 's complaint ( 42 USC 1986 ) , if he fails or refuses to see to it that the citizen 's complaint is placed in the right hands for processing and / or answering , ( return ) if he does not make every effort to make sure that the complaining party knows of the status or location of the complaint in the legal system , and does not give the complainant written notice of the same when it is possible .
5.3 - The Bonding of Prosecuting Attorneys
A prosecuting attorney shall lose his bonding , shall not be bonded , and shall be deemed unbondable :
if he refuses to prosecute a complaint when it is possible to do so , regardless of whom the complaint is against , if he resorts to " selective prosecution , " i.e. , any excuse of immunity for an official in order to protect a malfeasant official from prosecution , if he resorts to " selectiveprosecution , " i.e. , false or malicious prosecution of a citizen , in order to punish or destroy a citizen for attempting to have a malfeasant official prosecuted .
5.4 - Bonding of Judges
A judge shall lose his bonding , shall not be bonded , and shall be deemed unbondable :
if he fails toprotect the U.S , national constitutionally guaranteed remedies of due process and the equal protection of the laws of any citizen appearing in his court of law , or of any citizen appearing in any court of the county in which he works whose case may come to his attention 12y a means .
5.5 - Bonding of Attorneys
A lawyer or an attorney shall lose his bonding , shall not be bonded , and shall be deemed unbondable , :
if he fails to protect the remedies of due process and the equal protection of the law of either his client or of the adverse party in an action .
In an adversary system of law , each lawyer or attorney shall protect the representation of fact not only for their own party , but shall protect the legal process for both parties without , exception .
5.6 - Bonding an Amicus Curiae
( Friend of the Court - Especially under a Citizen ;s Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to 42 USC 1986 )
It is not necessary for a non-incorporated lawyer or amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) to be bonded .
But a lawyer or an amicus curiae , if he chose to be bonded , shall lose his bond and shall not be bonded :
if he uses his involuntary intervention to interfere with constitutional due process , if he does not speak and act openly for the best interests of both opposing adverse parties , even if paid by one party and sits as counsel to that party .
An amicus curiae may favor the cause of one side of an action , but must serve the due process of both sides of an action in order to be of service to the system of law as a whole .
If the judge is acting in insurrection and rebellion against the U.S. Constitution , and the judge shows no signs of amending his ways ( correcting his court procedure ) , it is usually best for the amicus curiae to file a notice of criminal malpractice ( malfeasance ) with the court administrator , and with the bonding company in person , by fax , or by telephone to immediately establish reversible error and .
civil damage in the case .
6.0 - JUDICATIVE OUTPUT
The process of Judgment will be bonded only if the bonding company finds that :
the terms , definitions , principles ( axioms ) , logic and conclusion underlying the statutes being used in a judgment are all bonded , i.e. , the statute used is a valid and lawful statute , i.e. , is a bonded statute ; the process of receipt of data input is bonded ; the Court rules , the jurisdiction and the processes of consideration of affidavits , litigation and prosecution are all bonded ; a jury trial was granted , if it was not .
waived in writing by all parties to the suit ; a summary judgment hearing was not imposed in place of a jury trial as long as there was so much as one genuine issue of material fact or one unprosecuted element of criminal behavior , criminal malpractice , or official or clerical malfeasance ; - the jury was allowed to come to a verdict by ballot while sitting in the courtroom without retiring to the jury room to arrive at a verdict ; NOTE : Retirement of a jury to a jury room for deliberating a verdict is internal jury tampering , creates an homogenized verdict , constitutes conspiracy to convict or to vindicate , and makes every member of the jury individually and personally liable for the verdict , regardless of the content of the verdict .
if a summary accusation or complaint , Judgment .
and execution of contempt has been brought against a person appearing before the court because his behavior or argument in favor of his rights in that court displeases the judge , or is held by that judge to be contrary to the order and decorum of the court , and then the accusing judge has made out the complaint of contempt , the accused has been tried by a second j udge yielding a judgment of contempt , _ , and a third judge has agreed in writing to accept the total liability for both the accusation or complaint of contempt , and the judgment of contempt if either or both of the first two judges hasacted with malfeasance in the contempt process , and the third judge has yielded the order of execution of contempt .
If the contempt charge is later found to be improper or unlawful , the personal liability of the third judge shall be proportional to the number of judges acting in defect of the law .
( i.e. , treble damages ( make triple ) .
This rate of damages corresponds to the treble damages of a U.S. R.I.C.O. ( Racketeer - Influenced and Corrupt Organization ) suit .
The third judge will have to sue the other two judges to recover remedy from them .
The order . of execution of the judgment has an attached check list containing a signature­verified entry for every step of the process which must be bonded in order for the over­all process to be perfected for judicial bonding .
Each step must have a space provided for reference to any attached comments on irregularities in the process .
" An order of judgment becomes a valid and lawful order of execution only if it is judicially bonded . "
6.1 . - Bonding of Judicial Consequence
A government official , officer or clerk shall lose their bond , shall not be bonded , and shall be deemed unbondable :
if he fails to answer , or fails to require an answer to , a citizen 's complaint , and affidavit of information categorically point­ for - point , except that , where criminal accusations are made , he shall have the right to remain silent , or allow silence ( non-­answer ) as a protection against self­incrimination .
Otherwise , the ordinary rule is , " An affidavit unrebutted stands as the truth . " if he knowingly imprisons , or keeps as a prisoner , a citizen in violation of that citizen 's U.S. constitutional rights and equal protection of the law .
The offense shall repeat the application of pertinent remedy statutes each and every twenty - four ( 24 ) hours .
if he refuses a prisoner the materials and information necessary for the prisoner to defend , acquit or vindicate himself .
The offense shall repeat the application of the pertinent remedy statutes each and every twenty - four ( 24 ) hours .
NOTE : If an officer or clerk who has lost his bond , gives aid and comfort to a citizen or to a prisoner deprived as described under this chapter , and shall prove himself genuine , the same shall recover his bondability .
7.0 - EXECUTIVE INPUT
Principles of Executive Bonding
Qualifications For Bonding Enforcement Officers
The input / qualifications of an executive / enforcement officer shall be bonded .
Pursuant to state incorporation laws , any official , officer or clerk , of any municipal .
corporation ( city , county , state ) engaged in any activity potentially dangerous or hazardous to the public safety , health and welfare must be bonded and must carry an identification card which declares his bonding status .
In a scientific system , the executive bond on a reasonable officer with a good social attitude , a " good track record . " and a good education , is less expensive than the bond on a rookie cop ( constable or patrol ) just as the automobile insurance on an older , sensible , seasoned and proven driver is less than the auto insurance for a younger , impulsive and unproven driver .
The Glass House Doctrine
It is the executive branch which ultimately commits the statutory injuries which the legislative and judicative branches order up for the control and punishment of citizens .
" A person who lives in a glass house should not throw rocks at others . " ( sic )
Likewise a government infested with malfeasant officials , officers and clerks is in no position to pursue felons in the public sphere .
If it would be credible in the eyes of the public and the bonding companies , then it must first eliminate its own malfeasance with the same diligence that it would pursue the civilian felon .
Grace / Escape
In all complaints of a citizen against a public law enforcement officer , the complaining citizen has the general responsibility of protecting the general enforcement of the laws by giving every opportunity of grace and escape to the officer complained about .
The complainant must always remain sensitive to the fact that a law enforcement officer is constantly subject to the most psychologically demanding emergency situations and the most dangerous social combinations , and must be given every benefit of the doubt so that he can survive his daily work .
7.1 - No Criminal Bonding
Criminal acts may not be bonded against prosecution or litigation , or there would be people who would become bonded as a license to commit criminal acts in violation of the peace and dignity of the state .
Likewise , corporations may not be established by a person to hide the criminal acts of that person behind corporate limited liability , or there would be people who would incorporate their activities in order to secure for themselves a license to commit criminal acts behind the corporate limited liability veil in violation of the peace and dignity of the state .
Corporate limited liability , as it pertains to civil commercial obligations , is a delicate enough creation without the criminal aspect , and it is only because business people accept the idea that they are gambling in commerce when they deal with a corporation that there is any honesty at all in the limited liability concept of a corporation .
For if a person uses a corporation to run up a commercial debt with the intent to abscond ( run away and hide ) at some future time , then that corporation becomes simply an instrumentality , called an alter ego , for the commission of crime .
It is for this reason that the state is a silent partner in every state incorporated artificial person , and has the liability .
There is no corporate limited liability for the commission of crimes .
Criminal acts committed by corporate officials , officers and clerks pierce the limited liability veil of every type corporation and artificial ( purely legal ) person .
Also , criminal accusation always pierces the veil of corporate limited liability .
No Criminal Bonding
An official , officer or clerk who commits a criminal act ( a crime ) or gross negligence of duty against a citizen or against the public generally :
shall lose his bond , shall not be protected by his official bond , shall not be protected by the limited liability of the corporation , trust , or office of public trust which employs him , shall be personally liable ( financially responsible ) for the damage which that crime or gross negligence causes , must pay for the damage out of his own personal assets of real and personal property .
A citizen 's recourse against official crimes is to file his claim in the form of a criminal complaint / U.S. First ( so - called ) Amendment petition for redress of grievances with a civil value noted on the complaint , but with the U.S. Seventh Amendment process on hold as not immediately answerable , and with the civil value pending the outcome of the U.S. Sixth ( so - called ) Amendment criminal prosecution .
The criminal claim puts payment of the bond on hold and pierces the veil of corporate limited liability , exposing the officer to unlimited attachment of personal property unless he is prosecuted and vindicated by prosecution .
If the prosecutor does not agree to prosecute the case within thirty days , or such time as is reasonable for investigation of the charges ( not to exceed sixty days without reasonable cause ) , then the matter reverts to a civil action standing half inside and half outside of the corporate veil with the bonding company , the corporation and the officer standing liable for the damages .
If the Bonding Company Compels the Prosecution
If the bonding company compels the prosecution and the acts of the officer are clearly criminal , then the bonding company can argue for release of the liability of the bonding company for the officer 's actions , provided the bond was written to dissuade ( discourage ) _ criminal acts .
Since the prosecutor must have a bond in order to be a prosecutor in fulfillment of his job description , it follows that the bonding companies collectively have the power to compel the prosecutor to prosecute on the criminal charges to attempt to vindicate the officer and to protect the relevant ( directly affected ) bonding company from a claim , or to minimize the claim against the bonding company .
If the Bonding Company Does Not Compel Prosecution
If the bonding company does not compel prosecution , then the first claim of liability is against the bonding company up to the face value of the bond , and the remaining claim of liability is against the corporation and against the officer for the unpaid balance of the claim .
The officer against whom the complaint and accusation has been made also has the right to defend his interests by demanding that he be prosecuted and vindicated .
Both the complaining party and the prosecutor have the obligation to serve notice on the accused officer if the prosecutor will not prosecute , thereby giving the officer a chance to protect his interests by demanding a prosecution .
7.2 - Bonding of Attitude
The principles of economics are more and more being used to establish scientific bonding practices which eliminate the bonding , hence employment , of antisocial enforcement officers .
The bond on an enforcement officer is based on the officer 's social attitude and past performance , that is , his " track record . "
An antisocial officer is generally defined as a person who : has a bad social attitude , thinks he is bonded for any sort of social behavior whatsoever , thinks he has to prove himself by being socially abusive or " macho " towards members of the general public .
Antisocial officers create bad enforcement situations which cause citizens to file malpractice claims with bonding companies .
Therefore , a credible bonding company will not bond a known antisocial enforcement officer .
7.3 - Bonding of Education
Principle -- Ignorance of the law is not an allowable excuse for a law enforcement officer to use when exercising the power to enforce the law .
An officer must know and understand all of the processes which must be bonded before he can act on an execution of j udgment .
An officer , although presumably acting in his official capacity , has no commercial escape or grace through a bonding company when the statute he enforces is not bonded against accidental misuse .
When an officer commits an accidental misuse of his office or of a statute , or accidentally acts on an unbonded statute , the bonding company will pay on the bond only to the extent of a reasonable degree of error or accident ; but nothing in the agreement between the bonding company and the bonded party shall be construed to free the official or officer from investigating and knowing whether or not his own actions or the statute acted upon or enforced were adequately bonded ; and whatever portion of the damage claim remains after the bonding company has paid its reasonable obligation to the bonded party , shall be paid out of the assets of the municipal corporation and / or out of the real and personal property of the official or officer who misacted .
An enforcement officer of a municipal corporation ( city , county , state ) , who operates without a bond or who enforces an unbonded statute , is acting outside of the public hazard licensing and bonding statutes governing municipal corporations .
A bonding company has no financial responsibility for such an officer .
Such an officer is regarded to be out of uniform , outside the shield or veil of his official capacity , and is a common citizen operating upon his own personal liability and risk .
If an officer was deceived by the government ( municipal corporation ) for which he works , into performing his " duties , " namely , of accepting statutes , carrying out Judgments of execution , or exerting enforcement beyond limits of his bonding , then , the officer shall not have a claim on the bonding company , and his personal property shall become attachable for the satisfaction of claims of damages , and he will have to make his claim against his employer .
In the case of an unbonded statute , the employer will have to make its claim against the state legislature and the state of these factors are :
the psychological stability and sociability of the officer ( is he antisocial , does he have a good social attitude , is he reasonable ? ) , the " track record " of his daily performance ( past performance ) , how much legal education the officer has and what kind of legal education the officer has and what kind of legal education does he have relevant to the laws that he will be required to enforce , the specific performance ( job description ) of the officer being bonded , generally for the construction and advertisement of an unbonded statute .
If a citizen knows how to enforce his civil remedies under the laws of commerce , and if the claim of the citizen for civil damages exceeds the face value of the bond , then the officer who victimizes that citizen can easily be bankrupted .
7.4 - Bonding of Specific Performance
Modern scientific bonding is based on a number of factors which mathematically determine the price of the wager ( premium ) charged by the bonding company .
Some
the types of unbonded statutes he will enforce , the types of bonded statutes he will enforce , the types of paper enforcement processes he will use , and , the types of enforcement acts he will engage in ( especially the violent ones ) .
An officer is acting without the protection of a municipal bond , is acting on the municipal corporate assets , or is acting " out of uniform " and on his own personal liability if he :
behaves in a clearly antisocial manner , does not have an education in law adequate for his specific performance ia a law enforcement officer , is not adequately bonded for law enforcement , i.e. , to enforce the law , does not have an adequate identification card or does not show his identification card when necessary , acts on an unbonded statute , and / or violates a citizen 's U.S. or state constitutional rights or equal protection of the laws .
The identification card of a law enforcement officer declares the authority of the officer to act by :
stating the specific performance of his job for which he is bonded , such as the class of statutes he is bonded to enforce .
stating that he is licensed and bonded , stating the name of the bonding company which is bonding the executive acts of the officer , and stating the bond ( policy ) number of the officer 's bond ( insurance ) .
An officer who cannot or does not display his official identification card is deemed out of uniform and acting as an ordinary citizen on his own personal liability .
His personal property is then the true pledge underwriting his authority .
Liability by Association
An officer can be sued for the injury caused by the act (s ) of another officer , if the act(s ) was committed and the injury was caused while the two officers worked together .
The assessment of the transfer of liability rests upon such concepts as reasonable diligence , accident , neglect and conspiracy .
7.5 - Authority
A statute has no social authority or the capacity to be enforced without an author , and has no author without the assumption of social , liability or financial responsibility for the statute authored .
Any attempt to exercise social authority by enforcing a statute without assuming a corresponding measure of social liability for the enforcement of the statute constitutes fraud .
The only authority which an official , officer or clerk of a government ( e.g. , municipal corporation ) has to use , act upon , or enforce a statute resides in or arises out of the financial responsibility for the acts and actors as follows :
the legislation - construction of the statute , the content of the statute itself , the judication -- the exercise of the judicative power , the judicative process itself , the execution - the enforcement paper process which is used as a reason to enforce the statute , the enforcement act of the enforcement officer , and the enforcement officer .
This financial responsibility for the acts and actors will usually be provided from one or more the following three sources :
the bonds on the acts and the actors ( insurance on an official act or person ) , the sacrifice , forfeiture or pledge of the personal property , real or movable , of the government corporate property , real or movable , or , the sacrifice , forfeiture or pledge of the personal property , real or movable , of the official , officer or clerk who is using , acting upon or enforcing the statute .
The total value in property or money extractable from these three sources must be sufficient to sustain a suit at law and pay for the damages caused as a consequence of using , acting upon or enforcing the statutes ; that is , in defense of each specific performance of the jobs or of the persons , the said performance of said jobs being the product of the government known as public service .
A government official , officer or clerk who is not bonded or who loses his bond , shall be held financially responsible for his own actions .
He shall have , as the only support for his own authority , the pledge of his own personal property , real and movable , to satisfy the damages which he causes to citizens by the exercise of that authority .
7.6 - Bonding Municipal Corporations
Many municipal corporations ( city , county , state ) have quietly chosen to operate without malpractice bonding in violation of state corporate public hazard bonding laws because their bonding is expensive .
Often municipal corporations claim to be " self bonded , " but because civil rights suit claims are often , and properly , astronomically large , such in - house bonding is actually fraud , and passes liability on to the officials , officers and clerks of the municipal corporation .
Municipal corporations have had to resort to lies and deceptions concerning the bonding of their officers in order to get their officers to put on a uniform and go out to fight for the corporation .
The officers are not told that their public hazard bond is not adequate , and they are not told that if their on­the - job activities involve them in a situation where the face value of the bond is not sufficient to cover an injury ( physical , mental , emotional , legal , etc. ) to a public citizen , that then the citizen will have the right to sue the officer for a sufficient amount of the officer 's personal property ( real and / or movable ) in order to be paid the difference between the amount of the damage claim and the face value of the bond .
A municipal corporation will lose its executive enforcement bond or be rendered unbondable :
if it hires an enforcement officer and sends him out into the public to do official enforcement duties without bonding his enforcement processes and actions .
The officer must be provided with a written notarized declaration of his job description ; if it fails to tell an officer or clerk that he is not adequately bonded , the officer must be provided with a written notarized declaration of his bonding status ; if it fails to issue an identification card to an enforcement officer declaring : that the officer is bonded , the name of the officer , the officer 's enforcement classification , the name of the municipal corporation for which he works , the name of the bonding company which is bonding his enforcement , the bond ( policy ) number of the officer , the address and / or telephone number of the bonding company ( bonding companies may want to know who is cheating them .
Many municipal corporations are not adequately bonded and never tell their employees about it ) , a picture of the officer .
if it does not provide a law enforcement officer with a sufficient education in law and process so that the officer can properly carry out his law enforcement duties as agreed to in his job description , if it engages an enforcement officer to enforce an unbonded " statute " which by its hazardous nature must be bonded , or if it engages an enforcement officer to violate a citizen 's U.S. constitutional rights or equal protection of the laws .
8.0 - EXECUTIVE CONTROL
The control / enforcement process of an executive / enforcement officer will be bonded only if the bonding company finds that :
before executing an order of execution the officer had in his possession : a faithful recap ( recapitulation ) of the case representing both sides of the argument , hand - signed by the author of the recap ( who is liable for his recap ) , an original hand - signed verified bonding check list of the complete court process , an original hand - signed copy of the judgment and the order of execution of j udgment , a proper personal identification card including : that the officer is bonded , the name of the officer , the officer 's enforcement classification , the name of the municipal corporation for which he works , the name of the bonding company which is bonding his enforcement , the bond ( policy ) number of the officer , the address and / or telephone number of the bonding company , and a picture of the officer , a proper personal business card which the officer could hand out to the public and to the person (s ) arrested , containing all of the same information as given in Part ( 1 ) ( D ) except for the picture , because of the expense of picture cards .
9.0 - EXECUTIVE OUTPUT
The output / enforcement act of an executive / enforcement officer will be bonded only if the bonding company finds to its satisfaction that , taking into consideration the urgency and hazard of the situation , the officer while enforcing the paper process acted in a reasonable manner as regards :
the reading and understanding of the recap , the reading and understanding of the verified bonding list , the reading and understanding of the j udgement , and the reading and understanding of the order of execution of judgment , And when enforcing­ properly identifying himself , properly serving necessary papers , and properly notifying people of their rights .
9.1 - Bonding Jail .
Procedure
A government , or an official , officer or clerk of a government , will lose its / his bond , will not be bonded and will not be bondable if a person , hereinafter referred to as the " prisoner , " which it / he handles , who has been charged and arrested but who has not been convicted :
has been denied or delayed anything , or any right , or the equal protection of the law necessary for the prisoner 's defense which an uncharged and unarrested citizen would have at his use , service and disposal , has been denied or delayed legal paperwork in the prisoner 's case , including but not limited to affidavits of accusation , police reports , arrest warrants , mailing addresses for the delivery of all leg paperwork , etc. , has been denied or delayed .
the assistant counsel of , or communication with any lawyer , attorney , spouse , relative , friend , non-union paralegal , non-union lawyer , etc. , needed for his personal safety and legal defense , has been denied or delayed necessary appearances and opportunity to speak before a judge in court and on the court record ( " necessary " as defined by the prisoner , not as defined by the jail .
Ear , the judge or the court ) , and / or consideration from the jailer , the judge of the court , and / or a hand - signed record of the proceedings before the judge and the court , has been denied or delayed a copy of anything : ( A ) the prisoner has signed while enteringor dwelling in the jail , or ( B ) the prisoner has been required to sign while entering or dwelling in the jail ( " It is best not to sign anything . " ) , has been denied or delayed the physical basics ; namely , light , heat , simple comforts , rest , writing materials or any other obvious physical means necessary to compose , write and perfect the prisoner 's defense , said basics to be provided at no cost to the prisoner , has been denied or delayed the opportunity to effectively file counter complaints against the prisoner 's accusers , and those who have handled and processed the prisoner 's case ( see also 4.0 Judicative Input , _ specifically ) , has been denied or delayed a readable copy of the Holy Bible printed in a language in which the prisoner is educated or fluent , has been denied or delayed access to law books of the prisoner 's choice , has been denied or delayed medical needs .
NOTE : The county shall provide all of the above services immediately to the unconvicted prisoner at no cost to the prisoner .
Any county which fails to meet the above criteria will itself be totally liable for its own acts .
It is not inconceivable that a county violating the above criteria could accumulate over one hundred million dollars worth of civil damages in one day 's time involving only one prisoner , and no credible bonding company wants anything to do with that kind of obligation .
- In Conclusion -
According to the equitable authorities at law in regard to state - created marriages , any property sought after belongs to both parties / spousal , therefore , both are responsible for their spouse 's action (s ) .
Thereby , criminal complaints jointly affect in regard to liens .
In short , bring the civil rights violators , wife / husband , into the court action also .
Remember , all liens cannot be removed until the declaration is adjudicated and / or the claimant is satisfied .
In the wording of the published rules of the Ninth Circuit Court , " Go for the jugular vein . "
9.2 - Escalation
Further :
A law enforcement officer will lose his bond if he oppresses a citizen to the point of civil .
rebellion when that citizen attempts to obtain redress of grievances ( U.S. constitutional 1st so - called amendment ) .
When a state , by and through its officials and
agents , deprives a citizen of all of his remedies by the due process of law and deprives the citizen of the equal protection of the law , the state commits an act of mixed war against the citizen , and , by its behavior , the state declares war on the citizen .
The citizen has the right to recognize this act by the publication of a solemn recognition of mixed war .
This writing has the same force as the Declaration of Independence .
It invokes the citizen 's U.S. constitutional 9th and 10th so - called amend guarantees of the right to create an effective remedy where otherwise none exists .
" I found this insight on the UBC to be very perspicuous and most useful to the Patriot movement , but like all laws , it is useful only to the one (s ) who use it and enforce it . "

( Read and discern until it 's perspicuous . )
" Prior law governs always . "
" Prior etymons govern always . "
" To act in pro se fashion in a court of law or equity is to profess in law , thus , casting yourself to drift away from logic and into the arms of a fool . "

MAXIM ; ( Universal Axiom of Law )
All persons know that the foundation of law and the legal system exists in the telling of the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , generally by testimony , deposition , and / or by affidavit .
Therefore , every honorable judge requires those who appear before him to be sworn to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , and is compelled by the high principles of his profession to protect that truth and do nothing to tamper with that truth , either directly or indirectly , either in person or by proxy , or by subornation of the affiant or other person ( subornation / extortion of perjury ) .
This instrument is an Affidavit of Obligation , also known as a Claim of Lien .
This affidavit of obligation is a commercial instrument arising from a private or public contract , either express , constructive , and / or implied , which exists by the express , constructive , and / or implied consent of the Lien Debtor .
Therefore , this Affidavit of obligation is a consensual commercial lien .
This lien arises from the necessity to guarantee specific performance ( oath ) of the Lien Debtor .
Therefore , this Affidavit of obligation is also a z - just compensation commercial lien .
The Lien Claimant 's Claim of Lien is expressed as this Affidavit .
A mere unsworn declaration is not sufficient grounds for a Claim of Lien because it does not attach commercial liability to the person making the claim of obligation upon a debtor .
The person making the claim ( the Lien Claimant ) must assume the commercial liability for making a claim against the debtor ( the Lien debtor ) by issuing a sworn statement known as an Affidavit of Obligation which is given to the best of the claimant 's knowledge and belief to be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , for which the claimant stands personally commercially responsible .
A declaration of obligation does not become a lien unless it is sworn to , in which case it is known by the stronger term , " Affidavit of Obligation . "
A mere declaration of obligation is not a lien .
A " distress , " which essentially compels instant specific performance , being severe because of its instant effect , must be bonded .
On the other hand , a lien , having a traditional three month grace period , allows ample time for a response , hence is regarded as commercially moderate , and , therefore , does not have to be bonded beyond the personal liability which it automatically imposes upon the Lien Claimant / Affiant .
( The three day , three week , three month , and three year grace periods in American Law arise from the traditional numerology of ancient Hebrew and Jewish law .
See Holy Bible , Old Testament . )
As would be the case with any other affidavit , deposition , or testimony , an Affidavit of Obligation ( commercial / contract lien ) may not be tampered with by any judge , other public official , or other person , and generally may be removed by only one or more of four means :
A satisfaction of the lien by the Lien Debtor .
A categorical point - for - point rebuttal ( affirmation , denial , or explanation ) of every element of the Lien Claimant 's claim , said rebuttal being also in the form of a commercial affidavit for which the Lien Debtor accepts full personal .
commercial responsibility .
If the lien claimant can rebut the lien debtor 's rebuttal , the lien stays in force .
A voluntary ( unextorted ) removal of the lien by the Lien Claimant ( or his heirs and assigns , if such has been provided for ) .
A decision by an impartial jury duly convened and properly conducted ( not tampered with by a judge , other public official , or other person ) .
The suspension of an Affidavit of Obligation is the suspension of the right to give testimony in one 's own behalf and is , therefore , in the nature of a suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus , a thing done only under the conditions of martial law , civil war , or mixed war .
A judge cannot interfere with , tamper with , or in any way modify testimony without rendering incredible the truth seeking process in his sacred profession and destroying the fabric of his own occupation , thereby committing professional suicide .
Any judge who tampers with testimony , deposition , or affidavit , is a threat to the commercial peace and dignity of the State and of the United States , is in violation of the Supreme Law of the Land , is acting in the nature of a foreign enemy , and is justifiably subject to the penalties of treason ; God 's speed .
A lien implies impoundment of property .
A breach of the said impoundment , also known as poundbreach , is a felony .
A bill in commerce is a private declaration of obligation .
A lien in commerce is the same bill made public with a commercial affidavit attached in support of the bill .
When a lien instrument is composed and made public , either by filing in the Office of the County Recorder or by any other method of open and wide publicity , a copy of the Claim of Lien must be provided for the Lien Debtor so that the Lien Debtor will thus be enabled to defend against the lien .
To guarantee that the Lien Debtor has an ample grace period of three months to defend against the lien , the grace period does not begin until a copy of the Claim of Lien or a Notice of Lien is in the possession of the Lien Debtor .
If only a Notice of Lien is supplied to the Lien Debtor then the Claim of Lien must be filed in a place of public access such as the County Recorder 's Office , or other such public place clearly specified in the Notice of Lien / Affidavit of Obligation , and therefore cannot be lawfully entered by the County Recorder on a County , State or Federal Lien Index .
A Claim of Lien exists upon the property of a Lien Debtor even if a copy of that lien is only witnessed and in the possession of the Lien Debtor .
However , if the Lien Debtor commits poundbreach by a sale , transfer , or assignment of the liened property to some third party , the Claim of Lien does not travel along with that property and attach commercial liability to the said third party , unless the Claim of Lien has been filed in the County Recorder 's Office of the county affected by the lien , or said Claim of Lien has otherwise been satisfactorily publicized .
If any attempt is made by any public official to impair the lien process by compelling the county recorder to refuse to file the Lien Claimant 's Claim of Lien , then any alternate publicity of the Claim of Lien with reasonable diligence is to be considered adequate publication of the lien for the purpose of passing the obligation of lien forward to the new third party owner of the property , the property seized by the original Claim of Lien against the original Lien Debtor .

June 25 , 2009  -- The Supreme Court ruled today that school officials ' strip search of a then - 13 - year - old Arizona teen suspected of possessing a painkiller violated the girl 's constitutional rights , despite the school district 's zero - tolerance policy for drugs .
The court said , however , that school officials are protected from personal liability in the case .
The ruling is a partial victory for Savana Redding , who had been summoned from her middle school classroom and was asked to strip down to her underwear as school officials searched for prescription strength ibuprofen .
The decision could redefine student privacy rights and outline important guidelines for school officials as they seek out dangerous contraband , like drugs , weapons or alcohol .
An 8 - 1 majority of the Court found that the search was unconstitutional .
Justice David Souter , writing for the majority said , " Savana 's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing , frightening , and humiliating .
…
Here , the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion . "
" The strip search of Savana Redding was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment , " the court ruled .
The Court emphasized that the intrusiveness of the search was not justified because Savana was not suspected of carrying dangerous drugs .
" The Fourth Amendment places limits on the official , even with the high degree of deference that courts must pay to the educator 's professional judgment . "
Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent , arguing the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment .
Thomas wrote , " By deciding that it is better equipped to decide what behavior should be permitted in schools , the Court has undercut student safety and undermined the authority of school administrators and local officials . "
The Court ruled 7 - 2 that the school officials were protected from having to pay Savana monetary damages , saying that though the search was unconstitutional , school officials " are nevertheless protected from liability through qualified immunity . "
Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , in partial dissent , would have found the officials personally liable for monetary damages .
Justice Ginsburg , the sole female on the court , caused a stir in a recent interview when she questioned whether her male colleagues could fully embrace a young girl 's reaction to such a search , wrote that the school officials treatment of Redding was " abusive , an and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it . "
Savana Redding : ' I Really Wanted to Cry '
When Savana Redding was asked to come to the principal 's office , she remembers walking down the hallway wondering why .
" I had never been in trouble , " said Savana , then a 13 - year - old honor student in the small town of Safford , Ariz .
" I thought maybe something good was happening . "
But when she walked in the office , she ran headlong into school officials ' zealous efforts to protect students from drugs .
Suspecting Savana , school officials subjected her to an invasive strip search -- without ever calling her mother .
That search set the stage for the significant Supreme Court showdown .
In an interview earlier this year , Savana , now 19 , said her case -- being subjected to a strip search for what amounted to two Advils -- shows guidelines are necessary .
" They asked me to take off my clothes , and I did while they stood there , " Savana said .
" When I was finally in my underwear , I thought , ' OK , they are going to let me put my clothes back on . ' "
" They just looked at me and said , ' well , now you have to pull out your bra and shake it and your underwear as well , " she said , her eyes filling with tears .
" I really wanted to cry . "
School officials were worried about reports of students using drugs and alcohol .
When an eighth grade girl was found with a cigarette and pills , she pointed the finger at Savana .
In the principal 's office , Savana denied she had any pills .
A search of her backpack turned up nothing , so the vice principal said the school nurse would conduct a strip search .
" They saw everything , " Savana said of the search , conducted by the school nurse and a secretary .
" It was really embarrassing .
These are people that I see every day . "
Savana said there was one thought going through her mind during the search : " Where 's my mom ? "
" I just wanted to know where my mom was and why were they doing this to me , " she recalled .
But officials never called Savana 's mother .
When April Redding got to school that afternoon , she was horrified to learn from a student that her daughter was strip - searched .
" I am shocked that they did n't call me .
I did n't know nothing about it , " she said , crying .
" [ Savana ] was very upset , emotional .
She tried telling me ... what they had done to her .
She was crying and telling me that she never wanted to see them people , and that she could n't go back there .
" And it just hurt me I could n't protect her , " Redding said .
School officials saw nothing wrong with the strip search , but Redding watched as Savana , embarrassed and humiliated , refused to return to school .
She could n't handle the students talking about her .
" It was n't like , 'hey , welcome back .
We missed you . '
It was just whispering -- ' that girl , she got in trouble for pills . '
Everybody thought that I was a troublemaker , and I did n't do anything wrong , " Savana said .
" So it hurt a lot . "
Savana withdrew from her friends and eventually changed schools .
She later dropped out of school entirely .
Redding decided to sue , arguing the search violated Savana 's constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures .
A California - based federal appeals court sided with Redding , and found the school liable .
The school district took the case to the Supreme Court , which heard arguments in April .
ACLU : Strip Searches ' Traumatic '
Adam Wolf , Redding 's attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union , said strip searches of children are " traumatic events " and that the case could set important new guidelines for schools .
" Never in your worst nightmare do you envision your child standing naked in front of her school officials , " Wolf said in an interview earlier this year .
" If the court signs off on the strip search , we could very well see more strip searches in our schools .
It is a proposition that should scare every parent out there . "
But school officials had contended they have a duty to find dangerous drugs .
" Most schools that engage in strip searches do it because they are acting in good faith , " said Francisco Negron of the National School Boards Association .
" They are doing it because they feel an intense need to protect the safety of the students .
But Savana and her mother say schools can go too far -- and put students at risk .
" They keep saying that they did it to keep everyone safe .
What about me ? " Savana said .
" They did n't keep me safe by doing that . "
( CNN ) --
Young and old , poor and prosperous , sick and healthy -- residents of Pakistan 's Swat Valley continue to flee the violence that has erupted there as the military clashes with the Taliban .
The fighting in the Swat Valley region has forced thousands of civilians to abandon their homes .
Those who have fled tell of the whole valley being turned into a battlefield as citizens run away , many of them with no shoes and some elderly .
They fall ill from sun and heat exposure -- particularly infants and those already weak and sick -- as they flee .
According to the most recent United Nations numbers , about 2.4 million Pakistanis have registered as displaced persons since May 2 .
Currently , the clashes are concentrated near Mingora , the valley 's largest city .
But fighting in the valley over the past three years has made people 's lives " worse than hell , " one former resident told CNN .
The 50 - year - old man asked that his name be withheld because he fears retribution from the Taliban .
He fled Hazara Gul Jaba Aligama , a village 5 miles ( 8 kilometers ) west of Mingora , on Sunday .
The Pakistani Army ordered the village vacated , he said , and all the residents from that village and others nearby -- several thousand people -- fled , mostly on foot , although some cars were used .
Iftikhar Hussain Shah , 27 , a farmer from Union Council Hazara , adjacent to Hazara Gul Jaba Aligama , also recounted the fleeing of thousands .
He said the army ordered all five villages evacuated , telling the residents an operation was to take place in the area .
His village was already housing people from three other villages nearby , he said .
He estimated the total number of those displaced at about 50,000 .
He said the " miserable condition " of some of the refugees brought him to tears .
The group got as far as Chakdara , a town controlled by the military near the southern end of the valley , where a curfew prohibited them from traveling further , the men said .
Those displaced have no food or water and are depending on handouts ; they have received nothing from the military .
Women were staying in two school buildings , Shah said , but men and children were out in the heat with no shelter .
Civilians feel betrayed at being told to move , he said , then stopped at Chakdara .
The army has been bombing civilian areas from jets and helicopters , said the 50 - year - old who asked not to be named .
Shelling continues round the clock .
Shah said gunshots , artillery and mortars could be heard as the exodus took place .
Painda Khan , a Mingora shop owner who lives in the village of Shahgai Saidu Sharif , said that out of his 22 - member family , one person has been killed by military shelling and another one is missing .
Ten of his relatives fled with him to Islamabad .
Khan , who estimates his age at between 65 and 70 , told CNN life around Mingora was so desperate , he can not put it into words .
Both he and the 50 - year - old man said no food or water remain besides what has been stockpiled .
There is no power , and all land lines and cell phones have jammed , and citizens have been confined to their homes by military curfews .
Khan said his family left before him , because he wanted to stay behind and protect his home .
But the Taliban were occupying a house immediately behind him , and fear drove him out -- despite a curfew -- after that house was destroyed in an air strike .
He walked about 40 miles along the banks of the Swat River , he said , then walked another three hours in the mountains south to Malakand .
After spending a night in the fields , he said , he continued to Islamabad , about 100 miles away , using public transportation and rickshaw .
Shah said he has no issues with the military operations , but does n't understand why civilians have to suffer as a consequence .
Over the past two years , he said , the majority of casualties in Swat have been civilians -- some 2,700 of them .
CNN was not able to independently confirm this toll with the Pakistani military .
The 50 - year - old blamed both the Taliban and the military , saying it seems they are both enemies of the people .
The Taliban , he said , are using locals as human shields and infiltrating the civilian population , shooting from in their midst .
In retaliation , the army fires back indiscriminately without differentiating between militants and noncombatants .
As a result , he said , civilians make up the majority of the dead .
The Taliban takes over any houses vacated by civilians , he said , as well as their possessions .
The Taliban are ruling the Mingora area by fear , he said .
Anyone who speaks up against them or does anything the Taliban does n't like gets killed within a day .
Civilians ' bodies are left in the center of town , he said , with a note warning the Taliban is watching and anyone who tries to remove the body before a time specified in the note will be punished .
Taliban fighters and checkpoints can be seen in every village .
The Taliban has seized all civilians ' guns and ammunition and planted mines in the roads , he said .
Some former Mingora residents are helping the Pakistani military identify Taliban hideouts in the valley , Khan said .

CBS Station KCBS reports that the California Republican Party issued a statement calling the arrest " partisan activity undertaken by California Secretary of State Debra Bowen . "
http://www.cbsnews.com/s...tional/main4532113.shtml
So , the person himself plead guilty ... but it 's " partisan activity " ?
The partisan activity is what Jacoby did .

The California Republican Party does n't think what Jacoby did is " partisan activity " , but Debra Brown is engaging in partisan activity !
We should let Jacoby commit voter registration fraud !
Because NOT letting him do that , is " partisan activity " !

I have come to the conclusion the DLC , the DNC , the DCC have no interest in protecting our right to vote .
I see now why Dennis Kucinich was prevented from participating in the debates .
The powers that be made sure we have two corporate chills to choose from and the incumbents protect their little club im DC .
So much for Obama giving a flying F for " mainstreet " over Wall Street .
I will never vote Democrap again .

yes , obama is really just another lying liar - " yes we can " , with hindsight , was just a campaign gimmick .
He found billions for war , banks , auto industry , and has now sold us out on healthcare reform , which the public overwhelmingly supports .
Even worse than his sell out , however , is how some blogs that represented themselves as " progressive / liberal " have sold us out too , giving the dems and the administration a " free pass " on this wholesale fraud .
The usual strategy is to distract by doing nothing but talk about widely disenfranchised repugs and totally ignoring or banning any mention of the fact that meaningful healthcare reform has been effectively neutralized .
Democraydiva , your spot - on - the way we will see real change it to hold BOTH dems and repugs accountable and this does mean voting for neither .

Democrats should go GREEN and self respecting Republicans should go Libertarian .
And everyone should fight for the right to get on the ballot for third parties and independents .
In a democracy the rules should be the same for all parties .
They are not even close .
Try running as a third party candidate in any state .

I may be the old woman on this site , but at 51 and politically active for almost 40 , I gotta tell you guys that progress does n't come in the blink of an eye .
You need to pay more attention to all those little steps that are taking place with each executive order .
Do you have any idea how long women have been fighting for pay equity ?
What about easing gay rights into the federal bureaucracy , first in the state department under Sec. Clinton and then to others .
You need to take into account the fact that our President is a man of strategy .
He knows that he can't get everything he wants all at once , but he also knows that every time he chips away another piece of the long - held establishment , progress reveals itself a little bit more .
He 's been in office for 5 months .
Did you imagine that he is Superman or the " Returned Messiah " ( gag ) and would magically transform everything at once ?
The last thing that progressives need right now is to dump the closest thing we 've had to a leader since ... sorry can't think of an appropriate analogy since no other president has been so heavy laden with problems before he could take over .
Patience and steadfast work toward our goals will get us what we want , not total reliance on a president who does n't have and will not claim the powers of a dictator .

Anopheles mosquitoes spread malaria Mosquito bites can be deadly .
Anopheles mosquitoes carry the parasite that causes malaria , a disease which kills around a million people every year .
Traditionally mosquito populations have been controlled by pesticides .
But scientists at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) are working on another method - using radiation to sterilize male mosquitoes .
The idea is to produce large numbers of male mosquitoes that are sexually sterile
Mark Benedict
International Atomic Energy Agency
The sterile insect technique ( SIT ) has worked well in reducing tsetse flies and some other insect pests , such as fruit flies .
The IAEA scientists are now trying to adapt the technique to the anopheles mosquito .
Birth control Mark Benedict , a medical entomologist at the IAEA , says SIT is " birth control " for insects .
" The idea is to produce large numbers of male mosquitoes that are sexually sterile , " he said .
" Those males will be released into the wild and find virgin female mosquitoes and they will mate with them . "
A female usually only mates once in her life so if her partner has been sterilized none of the hundreds of eggs she lays will hatch .
Sterilization takes just a couple of minutes .
Mosquito pupae are gathered into a metal pot and are lowered into a machine , where they are exposed to radiation .
When they come out they are sexually sterile .
In the hot and humid laboratories at the IAEA , the team is trying to develop methods of raising male mosquitoes that are strong enough to survive the irradiation - and sexy enough to attract females out in the wild .
They are also working on ways to transport and release them in the wild .
Field project Preparations for a pilot field project in Northern Sudan are underway to test the feasibility of SIT for mosquitoes .
The area is marked by extreme desert , but humans , livestock and wild mosquitoes live along the edge of the Nile River .
Despite a relatively small number of mosquitoes , there are high levels of malaria transmission there .
Mark Benedict says the sterilized pupae will be released along the river banks where the wild mosquitoes breed .
" That will give us a good idea of over what area we can release and what population densities we can see controlled " he says .
It is early days but Mark Benedict is optimistic about the prospects of SIT .
It is hoped that along with other tactics such as insecticide treated bed-nets , the technique can work as a tool in the fight against malaria .
The technique is " very well suited to elimination and eradication programmes . "
" What we need to do now is get one or two projects off the ground , measure the potential and see where we can take it from there , " he said .

The Time is Now
It 's only " A Matter of Time " .
That is the name of a great book by Don Kirchner , a decorated Vietnam combat helicopter pilot whose adventures as a marijuana smuggler tells the tale of how deeply involved organized crime cartels are in the marketing and sales of this , the safest drug on the planet .
It is a fascinating and exciting tale that I strongly recommend to everyone .
A matter of time also refers to the current situation in America .
The people of America have reached the point of understanding that this banned plant needs to be legalized .
A new Zogby poll commissioned by the conservative - leaning O'Leary Report has found 52 % voter support for treating marijuana as a legal , taxed , regulated substance .
The survey , published as a full - page ad in today 's issue of the political newspaper , The Hill , polled a sample of 3,937 voters weighted to match the 2008 presidential outcome -- 54 percent Obama voters and 46 percent McCain supporters .
The results showed a decisive majority of 52 percent in favor with 37 percent opposed and 11 percent not sure -- slightly higher than the 46 percent support reported in an ABC News / Washington Post poll released at the end of April .
In California , the respected Field poll recently found 56 percent support for making marijuana a taxed , regulated product that is legal for adults .
" This new survey continues the recent trend of strong and growing support for taxing and regulating marijuana and ending the disastrously failed policy of prohibition , " said Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , D.C .
Of course , politicians will fight against it as the money behind them wants to maintain control of its distribution .
Another important reason that politicians seek to continue the ban is the tremendous lobbying influence of the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry .
The fact is that they are fully aware of the cancer killing properties of THC , marijuana 's active ingredient .
We addressed these issues in other articles , such as THE PRESIDENT MAKES A MISTAKE .
Mr. Obama spoke about wanting a cure for cancer .
Arlen Specter , suffering from cancer which is apparently starting to affect his judgment or memory ( he said he wanted Norm Coleman appointed as Senator of Minnesota , then retraced his steps and said he forgot what party he was supposed to support ) could surely benefit from the proven anti-cancer therapy that Hemp with THC brings to cancer patients .
The medical evidence is there and growing :
In 2000 Dr. Manuel Guzman of Complutense University in Madrid Spain re-discovered that THC destroys tumors with no negative side effects whatsoever .
His team also irrigated healthy rats brains with high doses of THC for seven days and again found no negative results .
Cannabinoids kill cancer cells by cutting off their blood supply but not to the healthy cells .
These results have since been duplicated around the globe with many other cancers as well .
In 2005 Dr. Xia Zhang of the University of Saskatchewan found that THC actually promotes the growth of brain cells bringing new hope for head trauma and stroke patients .
The same year the Scripps Institute reported that THC was a superior inhibitor of the plaque that causes Alzheimers .
Unfortunately we hear little of any of these findings .
In 2008 researchers in Italy and the U.K. found that cannabinoids have germ killing activity against MRSA and kill bacteria in a different way than current antibiotics , meaning they might bypass bacterial resistance .
MRSA 's are becoming more and more prevalent and new treatments are desperately needed .
Our government KNOWS that marijuana kills cancer cells .
They have known for a long time .
In 1974 researchers at the Medical College of Virginia , who had been funded by the National Institute of Health to find evidence that marijuana damages the immune system , found instead that THC slowed the growth of three kinds of cancer in mice - lung and breast cancer , and a virus - induced leukemia .
The DEA quickly shut down the Virginia study and all further cannabis / tumor research , according to Jack Herer , who reports on the events in his book , " The Emperor Wears No Clothes . "
In 1976 President Gerald Ford put an end to all public cannabis research and granted exclusive research rights to major pharmaceutical companies , who set out - unsuccessfully - to develop synthetic forms of THC that would deliver all the medical benefits without the " high . "
Rick Simpson not only tells the story of how Hemp Oil with THC CURES CANCER , but he has proven it to his Canadian Royal Lodge members and townspeople in Nova Scotia .
In this video he not only has significant supporting documentation and testimony , but he actually shows how to make the medicine that cures cancer .
Is anyone in government listening ?
Then listen to the testimony of a Medical Marijuana patient :
Here is a link to Mr. Simpson 's instructional page : MAKE YOUR OWN MEDICINE .
Here is his story :
WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN .
The time has come .
The 2009 Piaggio MP3 500 looks like it just ate your neighbor ’s Vespa .
The MP3 500 is n’t your typical lightweight , low powered scooter nor is it a high - powered superbike .
What Piaggio does is take the best of both worlds and provide a vehicle that does n’t require manual shifting and wo n’t tip over .
But do n’t think that because Piaggio has taken the fear factor out of motoring that you will get lots of slack .
In fact , its appearance is so intimidating that nobody will peg you as a chump .
The thing looks like it just stepped out of a modern day Mad Max movie .
So , what ’s the real deal with the Piaggio MP3 500 ?
This vehicle is powered by a four - valve , liquid - cooled 492 cc engine rated at 40 hp .
This is enough juice for a top end of 89 mph and a run from 0 to 60 mph in 9.7 seconds .
Okay , so it ’s not lightning fast or a sub - 5 - second vehicle but it ’s so badass that we had to bring it to your attention .
( One quick note , the MP3 does n’t have anything to do with a music player or iPod .
I know we just showed you the MotoCzysz with iPhone dashboard and if you read that article that ’s where your head was … )
The MP3 500 is super easy to ride with Piaggio making the driving experience as carefree as possible .
Turning actually mimics riding a motorcycle with the MP3 500 providing up to a 40 % lean angle without any pushing or tucking of the front contact patches .
The transmission is a stepless CVT automatic that requires no gearshifts or popping it into neutral at stop lights .
Speaking of stopping , when your speed drops below 10 mph , there is a switch than can be activated which locks the MP3 ’s front end fully upright , thereby keeping the bike totally balanced and eliminating the need to step down .
The Piaggio MP3 500 is available in either matte - black or red .
You already know our preference .
Gas mileage is shown as 55 - 57 mpg .
The list price is a little steep at $ 8,899 but this three - wheeler is a pretty amazing amalgamation of the scooter and motorbike and is well worth checking out if switching gears is too daunting or the thought of riding on a scooter too dainty .

John Simpson reporting from Tehran before his visa ran out on Sunday For reasons best not explained , I 've come to know a former member of the Revolutionary Guards really well .
He 's done some pretty dreadful things in his life , from attacking women in the streets for not wearing the full Islamic gear to fighting alongside Islamic revolutionaries in countries abroad .
And yet now , in the tumult that has gripped Iran since its elections last week , he 's had a change of heart .
He 's become a backer of Mir Hossein Mousavi , the reformist candidate who alleges fraud in the elections .
He 's saved up the money to send his son to a private school abroad , and he loathes President Ahmadinejad .
He 's not the only one .
I had to leave Iran last Sunday , when the authorities refused to renew my visa .
But before I left , another former senior Revolutionary Guard came to our hotel to see us .
" Remember me , " he pleaded .
" Remember that I helped the BBC . "
I realised that even a person so intimately linked to the Islamic Revolution thinks that something will soon change in Iran .
The 11 extraordinary days I spent there was my 20th visit in 30 years .
I 've been reviewing the material we recorded , taking a second look at what was really going on .
I think that these last weeks may turn out to be as momentous as the Islamic Revolution I witnessed there 30 years ago .
The Revolutionary Guards with second thoughts illustrate some of the deeper forces driving a crisis which I believe could change Iran forever .
Torn fabric
The first big change is that nowadays in Iran , even when you meet an official you can't necessarily tell which side they 're on .
It 's as if the fabric of the Islamic Revolution itself has been torn ; so much so that individual government ministers , civil servants , Republican Guards , senior military men , and all sorts of others , have taken sides , reflecting a power struggle at the very top .

Or listen via the BBC iPlayer Or download the podcast
You can see this reflected on the streets in all sorts of ways .
In the protests , for example , where the crowds were bold enough to protect our BBC team from secret policemen .
Driving around Tehran gathering TV material , we often found ourselves in difficult situations as authorities clashed with crowds of protesters chanting slogans like : " We want freedom . "
In one memorable incident , a group of street demonstrators actually chased away a man in plain clothes from the once - feared state security .
They felt brave enough to do it because they know that many within the state system itself are actually backing Mr Mousavi and the protests .
Apologetic
After we were ordered to leave Iran , we went around to the Ershad , the Islamic Guidance Ministry , which supervises foreign journalists .
We expected to be scolded and intimidated .
But , in fact , the body language of the person who spoke with us was bizarrely apologetic .
IRAN UNREST 12 June Presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled on grounds of electoral fraud Street protests saw at least 17 people killed and foreign media restricted

The official said we could stay in the country a little longer and " do our shopping " - a code for our work .
This was accompanied simply by a warning not to get arrested by the police .
It illustrates the split that goes all the way through Iranian society .
It 's not just about President Ahmedinejad and his challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi .
It 's about two much bigger characters , locked in a confrontation that the rest of the crisis reflects .
On one side is Ayatollah Khameinei , the arch conservative who keeps the Islamic revolution together .
On the other , a cynical figure who has made a pile of money since the revolution : former President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani .
Charm Mr Rafsanjani is one of the few people in Iran who could stand in open opposition to the Supreme Leader because , as his friends are fond of claiming , he first installed Ayatollah Khamenei - who was n't considered a particularly distinguished theologian at the time .
Rafsanjani has dominated Iranian politics since the 1980s For almost a decade , this worked to both men's advantage .
Then in 2005 , Mr Rafsanjani made the disastrous mistake of standing for the presidency a third time .
His former protege was by now powerful enough to turn against him .
The public were sick of the corruption they associated with Mr Rafsanjani .
They stayed away from the polls in droves , handing victory to the Supreme Leader 's new favoured candidate Mahmoud Ahmedinajad .
I first encountered Rafsanjani during the Iran - Iraq war , and I must confess I liked him .
He 's very amusing and charming , though I would n't like to have him as my enemy .
I remember one press conference from the mid-80s where , as usual , the women sat separately from the men .
In those days women journalists were almost exclusively right - on hardliners , very earnest and dressed in the deepest black .
Mr Rafsanjani came to the microphone , looked at them irritably for a moment or two , and asked , " Can anyone tell me where it says in the Holy Koran that women have to make themselves look ugly ? "
Struggle
But that does n't make him a liberal .
In fact , Mr Rafsanjani remains every inch a man of the Islamic Revolution .
Today he operates from the shadows using the wealth he has amassed , rather like a Russian oligarch .
But while the idealistic young people rally behind the slogan : " Death to the Dictator , " I am not fully convinced that a Rafsanjani Iran necessarily offers the more open form of government they are risking their lives for .
Both sides in this struggle are strong believers in the Islamic Republic .
It may change , but it is n't finished .
And the great mass of people who 've taken part in the demonstrations could find themselves just looking on from the outside , as they did before .

A dire warning that the Republic is a prime candidate to go bust has come from one of the world 's leading economic historians .
" The idea that countries do n't go bust is a joke , " said Niall Ferguson , Harvard professor and author of The Ascent of Money .
" The debt trap may be about to spring " he said , " for countries that have created large stimulus packages in order to stimulate their economies . "
His chosen prime candidate to go bust is " Ireland , followed by Italy and Belgium , and UK is not too far behind " .
Argentina is top of his list of shaky countries but " the argument that it can't happen in major western economies is nonsense " .
Professor Ferguson believes the economists are ill qualified to analyse the current economic situation since they lack the overview of historians such as himself .
" There are economic professors in American universities who think they are masters of the universe , but they do n't have any historical knowledge .
I have never believed that markets are self correcting .
No historian could . "
The historian does not subscribe to the theory of the " Great Depression " repeating and says this scenario is unlikely because the Federal Reserve has " massively expanded the monetary base which is the opposite of what happened in the 1930s " .
The problem now is what happens when current monetary policy collides with a policy of " vast government borrowing " on a scale unknown since the 1940s .
" We have the fiscal policy of a world war without a war . "
Referring to the clash between inflation and deflation he added : " I do n't know who is going to win but we know that while the struggle goes on ordinary people will get trampled .
There will be more economic volatility and ordinary people will pay . "
He has also warned that in Britain he expects " more riots in major cities this year " because of the economic situation and says the recent " drip feed " of the peccadilloes of British MPs and their expenses is " just the beginning of a crisis of political legitimacy that will be played out over the next 18 months " .
Ferguson , a native of Glasgow , specialises in financial and economic history as well as the history of the British empire .

Elegance is necessarily , only achieveable at great expense .
If you just do something , it wo n't be elegant , but if you do it and then see what might be more elegant , and do it again , you might , after an unknown number of iterations , get something that is very elegant .
So .
Alea iacta est , as Julius Caesar might have said , if there had been a major Roman chariot manufacturer in putative need of nationalization .
The nation 's largest automaker , our most iconic firm , is bankrupt , GM and Citigroup exit the Dow in favor of Travelers and Cisco .
The first obvious thing to say is that the only alternative the US government probably had to this massively expensive reorganization was probably liquidation .
I take seriously the claims that there was no DIP financing available for the automakers .
However .
The reason there was no DIP financing available is , at least in part , that there 's no obvious upside here .
The government is acting as if GM 's main problem is that it stubbornly refused to enter the lucrative market for small , fuel - efficient cars .
But the market for small , fuel efficient cars is not lucrative -- they 're the cars with the thinnest margins .
And no one 's making it up on volume , either : at the height of last year 's oil spike , when barrels of Brent Crude were being quoted in first - born sons , small cars soared to . . . 20 % of the American market .
Yes , there was a glut of SUVs , but that 's because American companies were making a lot of SUVs .
Foreign companies make money on small cars because they develop them for lucrative home markets before modifying them for American production .
Forget the new cyber security czar position that President Barack Obama announced last week .
The real sign that the White House might be finally taking cyber security seriously came in an announcement on Friday that Jeff Moss , aka " Dark Tangent " and the former hacker behind the annual DefCon hacker confab in Las Vegas , has been appointed to the Department of Homeland Security 's Advisory Council ( HSAC ) .
He was among 16 people ( .pdf ) sworn in to the council by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
Former CIA Director WIlliam Webster and former FBI Director Louis Freeh are also on the council , which provides advice and recommendations to the secretary .
Webster is the council chair .
Moss , who lives in Seattle , says he was really surprised when he got a call about three weeks ago inviting him to join .
" I always figured that because of my associations in the past that I would be kind of out of the running for anything like this , " he told Threat Level .
" DefCon started as a hacking conference . . . and I just figured that that past , in a nontraditional beginning , people would n't know how to relate to that .
To me it shows that they 're really looking for fresh perspectives . "
Moss , who 's 39 , was a phreaker in high school – someone who cracks into phone systems to make calls on the telecom 's dime .
I asked him in a 2001 interview how he got into hacking .
" I did n't know there was really a scene until probably about my junior year in high school , " he said .
" Somebody called me up one day from the other side of the country .
I was asking him how he could afford the call , and he just laughed and said , ' You 're joking , right ? '
And he started to explain how phone systems work and how you can phone for free .
That was the peeling back of the veneer . "
He stopped hacking when people around him started getting arrested .
" You can only stand by and watch so many people you know get busted , " he said .
" Sooner or later you catch on that ... there 's a limited life span to doing this kind of stuff .
So before I got out of high school that was pretty much it . "
He studied law for a while before switching to computer science .
He launched DefCon in 1993 on a lark to bring hacker friends from around the country to the desert to party and trade skills .
Over the years , the attendance grew and the attendees ' hi-jinks – cement poured into a hotel toilet , fire alarm systems and ATMs hacked – gave way to serious talks , and the conference soon became the premier " haxor " event for learning about computer security vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them .
It also quickly drew the attention of undercover feds , who came to spy on hackers and recruit them .
The tension between hackers and feds at the conference has loosened over the years , with help from the annual Spot - the - Fed contest .
In 1996 , Moss launched Black Hat , a complementary conference to DefCon that caters more to the computer professional crowd , many of them former hackers who doffed their Goth clothes , mohawks and body piercings for khaki pants , white socks and corporate jobs .
Black
Hat runs in Vegas the week before DefCon , as well as in Washington , DC , Europe and Japan at other times of the year .
Moss says he did n't have a clue what the Advisory Council was when he got the call to join .
But he was told that DHS was looking for outside perspectives to rejuvenate the council , which had been neglected under former Secretary Michael Chertoff .
The position is voluntary and runs for a term of three years .
He was told he might have to attend quarterly meetings and occasional teleconferences but other than this , it would n't be a lot of work .
" I thought okay , that 's fine , " he says .
" And then the next day all the e-mails arrived with all the financial disclosure forms and security clearances .
I spent the rest of the week filling out forms like mad . "

Why have a tapestry in your home ?
By Darren Waters
Technology editor , BBC News website
The Pirate Bay lets you search for TV programs , movies and applications On Friday at about 1100 local time ( 1000 BST ) computer expert Peter Sunde will receive a phone call , e-mail or fax at his home in Malmo , Sweden , which will mark one of the most decisive moments in the 10 - year battle between file - sharers and the professional creative industries .
The message will tell him whether he has been found guilty or not guilty of " assisting making available copyright material " .
Mr Sunde is one of four defendants facing those charges in the Swedish courts .
The charge sounds innocuous but the stakes are high for the global music and movie industries .
Mr Sunde , Frederik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm
Warg are the men the courts have deemed to be behind The Pirate Bay , the world 's most high - profile file - sharing site .
It boasts more than millions of members and it is said that half of all BitTorrent traffic in the world is directed via The Pirate Bay .
The fourth defendant Carl Lundstrom , while having no direct technical dealings with the site , has been accused of helping finance The Pirate Bay .
The court 's judgement will be one of the most closely - scrutinised decisions since the original file - sharing site Napster was shut down in 2001 .
There 's no difference between us and Google
Peter Sunde , The Pirate Bay " Everybody involved is quite okay with it , " says Mr Sunde , brushing off any suggestion that he and his co-defendants are under pressure .
" We still do n't think we have done anything illegal under Swedish law . "
Mr Sunde 's defence is simple : The Pirate Bay does not host or store copyright material .
It acts instead as a directory which users can employ to post links to and find copyright material .
' Just link '
" We do n't share any files we just link to material .
We do n't say what people should or should not download " It 's open platform , an open technology , for people to find and share content .
There 's no difference between us and Google . "
Mr Sunde believes that if The Pirate Bay is found guilty , then the whole internet is just as damned because it too is based on the premise of links .
He rejects the idea that The Pirate Bay 's operators should take responsibility for the types of material that are linked to on the site .
" We think we have a responsibility to not check what people are linking - it's a privacy issue , " he explains .
For Rickard Falkvinge , leader of The Pirate Party , which is trying to reform laws around copyright and patents in the digital age , the trial in Sweden has become something of a cause celebre for the younger generation .
He believes it is a reflection of a wider battle between industry , politicians and digital natives about the future of content and copyright in the networked age .
Coin toss
" At the lowest court , it is basically a coin toss over whether they will be found guilty .
" People I talk to feel they will be acquitted .
But if they are found guilty , then linking on the internet will be found guilty also .
" This is not about detail in copyright law , or a fun toy to take away from kids when they have been bad .
This is a catalyst for change to society on the scale of the printing press or written language . "
The Pirate Bay founders will receive a verdict on Friday Mr Falkvinge says The Pirate Bay should be found not guilty because the technology it represents does more good than harm .
" Some people abuse the postal service to hide their criminal activities but we do n't think about shutting it down .
" Once you have digital communication , people will use it to copy content and communicate .
The Pirate Bay is just a symptom of that capability . "
Mr Sunde is adamant that whatever the verdict , The Pirate Bay will keep sailing .
" Nothing is going to happen if we lose .
One of the reasons is that the verdict is not final .
" If we lose , we will appeal .
This is a criminal court case - and in Sweden you are not found guilty until there is no more appeal possibility .
Public relations
" This is not going to be finalised for a couple of years . "
Mr Sunde says the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries and Motion Picture Association of America , who lobbied for the case to be brought , are using the case to generate public relations .
The ultimate realistic aim is to push it to the boundaries in the way shoplifting is to the boundaries in a music shop .
Mark Mulligan , Forrester Research
" They are both abusing the court case to get some media attention and are scared of people like us because we point out flaws in the system . "
Mark Mulligan , a research director at Forrester Research , says the industries had no choice but to take action .
" This is first and foremost about PR .
I do n't mean that in a dismissive way - it sends out a message that the industry will take action ; that ultimately there is a price to pay .
" They know they are not going to shut down BitTorrent even if The Pirate Bay closes , which is more of an aspiration than a goal .
" The ultimate realistic aim is to push it to the boundaries in the way shoplifting is to the boundaries in a music shop .
" It goes on , and no matter how many security guards or cameras you have , it will go on .
But the majority of people do n't do it . "
He says defeat for the music and movie industries would be a major blow in the campaign to re-educate people about the implications of illegal file - sharing .
" This is a high - risk strategy because if the courts rule in The Pirate Bay 's favour then some people will see this as the courts saying it is okay to file share .
But they had to take action . "

" We 've had this very misleading view of babies , " says Alison Gopnik , a psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , and author of the forthcoming book , " The Philosophical Baby . "
" The baby brain is perfectly designed for what it needs to do , which is learn about the world .
There are times when having a fully developed brain can almost seem like an impediment . "
In fact , in some situations it might actually be better for adults to regress into a newborn state of mind .
While maturity has its perks , it can also inhibit creativity and lead people to fixate on the wrong facts .
When we need to sort through a lot of seemingly irrelevant information or create something completely new , thinking like a baby is our best option .
This hyperawareness comes with several benefits .
For starters , it allows young children to figure out the world at an incredibly fast pace .
Although babies are born utterly helpless , within a few years they 've mastered everything from language - a toddler learns 10 new words every day - to complex motor skills such as walking .
According to this new view of the baby brain , many of the mental traits that used to seem like developmental shortcomings , such as infants ' inability to focus their attention , are actually crucial assets in the learning process .
Now , however , scientists have begun to dramatically revise their concept of a baby 's mind .
By using new research techniques and tools , they 've revealed that the baby brain is abuzz with activity , capable of learning astonishing amounts of information in a relatively short time .
Unlike the adult mind , which restricts itself to a narrow slice of reality , babies can take in a much wider spectrum of sensation - they are , in an important sense , more aware of the world than we are .
Modern science has largely agreed , spending decades outlining all the things that babies could n't do because their brains had yet to develop .
They were unable to focus , delay gratification , or even express their desires .
The Princeton philosopher Peter Singer famously suggested that " killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person .
Very often it is not wrong at all . "
WHAT IS IT like to be a baby ?
For centuries , this question would have seemed absurd : behind that adorable facade was a mostly empty head .
A baby , after all , is missing most of the capabilities that define the human mind , such as language and the ability to reason .
Rene Descartes argued that the young child was entirely bound by sensation , hopelessly trapped in the confusing rush of the here and now .
A newborn , in this sense , is just a lump of need , a bundle of reflexes that can only eat and cry .
To think like a baby is to not think at all .
But the newborn brain is n't just denser and more malleable : it 's also constructed differently , with far fewer inhibitory neurotransmitters , which are the chemicals that prevent neurons from firing .
This suggests that the infant mind is actually more crowded with fleeting thoughts and stray sensations than the adult mind .
While adults automatically block out irrelevant information , such as the hum of an air conditioner or the conversation of nearby strangers , babies take everything in : their reality arrives without a filter .
As a result , it typically takes significantly higher concentrations of anesthesia to render babies unconscious , since there 's more cellular activity to silence .
While the pruning process makes the brain more efficient , it can also narrow our thoughts and make learning more difficult , as we become less able to adjust to new circumstances and absorb new ideas .
In a sense , there 's a direct trade - off between the mind 's flexibility and its proficiency .
As Gopnik notes , this helps explain why a young child can learn three languages at once but nevertheless struggle to tie his shoelaces .
These new research techniques have uncovered several surprising findings .
It turns out that the baby brain actually contains more brain cells , or neurons , than the adult brain :
The instant we open our eyes , our neurons start the " pruning process , " which involves the elimination of seemingly unnecessary neural connections .
Furthermore , the distinct parts of the baby cortex - the center of sensation and higher thought - are better connected than the adult cortex , with more links between disparate regions .
These anatomical differences are n't simply a sign of immaturity :
They 're an important tool that provides babies with the ability to assimilate vast amounts of information with ease .
In recent years , however , scientists have developed new methods for entering the head of a baby .
They 've looked at the density of brain tissue , analyzed the development of neural connections , and tracked the eye movements of infants .
By comparing the anatomy of the baby brain with the adult brain , scientists can make inferences about infant experience .
There 's something slightly paradoxical about trying to study the inner life of babies .
For starters , you can't ask them questions .
Young children can't describe their sensations or justify their emotions ; they can't articulate the pleasure of a pacifier or explain the comfort of a stuffed animal .
And , of course , none of us have any memories of infancy .
For a scientist , the baby mind can seem like an impenetrable black box .
One of the most surprising implications of this new research concerns baby consciousness , or what babies actually experience as they interact with the outside world .
While scientists and doctors have traditionally assumed that babies are much less conscious than adults - this is why , until the 1970s , many infants underwent surgery without anesthesia - that view is being overturned .
Gopnik argues that , in many respects , babies are more conscious than adults .
She compares the experience of being a baby with that of watching a riveting movie , or being a tourist in a foreign city , where even the most mundane activities seem new and exciting .
" For a baby , every day is like going to Paris for the first time , " Gopnik says .
" Just go for a walk with a 2 - year - old .
You 'll quickly realize that they 're seeing things you do n't even notice . "
While thinking like an adult is necessary when we need to focus , or when we already know which information is relevant , many situations are n't so clear - cut .
In these instances , paying strict attention is actually a liability , since it leads us to neglect potentially important pieces of the puzzle .
That 's when it helps to think like a baby .
" Adults can follow directions and focus , and that 's great , " says John Colombo , a psychologist at the University of Kansas .
" But children , it turns out , are much better at picking up on all the extraneous stuff that 's going on .
. . .
And this makes sense :
If you do n't know how the world works , then how do you know what to focus on ?
You should try to take everything in . "
Consider this memory task designed by John Hagen , a developmental psychologist at the University of Michigan .
A child is given a deck of cards and shown two cards at a time .
The child is told to remember the card on the right and to ignore the card on the left .
Not surprisingly , older children and adults are much better at remembering the cards they were told to focus on , since they 're able to direct their attention .
However , young children are often better at remembering the cards on the left , which they were supposed to ignore .
The lantern casts its light everywhere .
While this less focused form of attention makes it more difficult to stay on task - preschoolers are easily distracted - it also comes with certain advantages .
In many circumstances , the lantern mode of attention can actually lead to improvements in memory , especially when it comes to recalling information that seemed incidental at the time .
Consider , for instance , what happens when preschoolers are shown a photograph of someone - let 's call her Jane - looking at a picture of a family .
When the young children are asked questions about what Jane is paying attention to , the kids quickly agree that Jane is thinking about the people in the picture .
But they also insist that she 's thinking about the picture frame , and the wall behind the picture , and the chair lurking in her peripheral vision .
In other words , they believe that Jane is attending to whatever she can see .
" We sometimes say that adults are better at paying attention than children , " writes Gopnik .
" But really we mean just the opposite .
Adults are better at not paying attention .
They 're better at screening out everything else and restricting their consciousness to a single focus . "
The hyperabundance of thoughts in the baby brain also reflects profound differences in the ways adults and babies pay attention to the world .
If attention works like a narrow spotlight in adults - a focused beam illuminating particular parts of reality - then in young kids it works more like a lantern , casting a diffuse radiance on their surroundings .
This new understanding of baby cognition , and the peculiar ways in which babies pay attention , is also giving scientists insights into improving the mental functioning of adults .
The ability to direct attention , it turns out , does n't merely inhibit irrelevant facts and perceptions - it can also stifle the imagination .
Sometimes , the mind performs best when we do n't try to control it .
The differences in how babies and adults pay attention are primarily caused by the unformed nature of the prefrontal cortex , a brain area just behind the eyes .
While the prefrontal cortex has been greatly enlarged during human evolution - it 's responsible for a wide variety of cognitive abilities , from directed attention to abstract thought - it's also the last brain area to fully develop , and often is n't done developing until late adolescence .
Although scientists have long held the lack of a functional prefrontal cortex responsible for all sorts of " childish " behaviors , researchers are beginning to realize that , sometimes , it might actually be better to allow the prefrontal cortex to loosen its grip .
A recent brain scanning experiment by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that jazz musicians in the midst of improvisation - they were playing a specially designed keyboard in a brain scanner - showed dramatically reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex .
It was only by " deactivating " this brain area that the musicians were able to spontaneously invent new melodies .
The scientists compare this unwound state of mind with that of dreaming during REM sleep , meditation , and other creative pursuits , such as the composition of poetry .
But it also resembles the thought process of a young child , albeit one with musical talent .
Baudelaire was right : " Genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will . "
The immaturity of the baby brain comes with another advantage : utter absorption in the moment .
The best evidence for this comes from brain scans of adult subjects as they watched an engrossing Clint Eastwood movie .
The experiment , led by Rafael Malach at Hebrew University , found that when adults were watching the film their brains showed a peculiar pattern of activity , as their prefrontal areas were suppressed .
At the same time , areas in the back of the brain associated with visual perception were turned on .
As Gopnik notes , this mental state - the experience of being captivated by entertainment - is , in many respects , a fleeting reminder of what it feels like to be a young child .
" You are incredibly aware of what 's happening - your experiences are very vivid - and yet you 're not self - conscious at all , " she says .
" You 're not thinking about anything but what 's on the screen . "
But it 's not just the movie theater that transports us back to a newborn state of mind , in which we 're fully immersed in the moment .
Gopnik notes that a number of other situations , from Zen meditation to the experience of natural beauty , can also lead to states of awareness so intense that the self seems to disappear .
" This is the same ecstatic feeling that the Romantic poets were always writing about , " she says .
" It 's seeing the world in a grain of sand . "
If people could never regress into this babylike consciousness , then we 'd struggle with the kind of tasks that require us to stop being self - conscious and lose ourselves in the job .
Such moments are often described as " flow " activities , and can occur whenever we 're completely captivated by what we 're doing , be it stirring a risotto or solving a crossword puzzle .
The Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki referred to such modes as " beginner 's mind , " since people are able to think like a baby , open to possibility and free of errant preconceptions .
Gopnik has discovered for herself the advantages of being able to shift between a babyesque form of cognition and a more adult frame of mind .
" As a scientist , you really need to use both kinds of thinking , " she says .
" Sometimes you need to focus and analyze your data .
But you also need the ability to be open and creative , to think in a new way if the old way is n't working . "
At such moments , she suggests , we need to think with the innocence of an infant - to release the reins of attention and look anew at a world we 're still trying to understand .

Today , the Overthinkers enter the Think Tank to tackle the greatest key change in popular music .
Read the four entries and vote for your favorite at the end .
— Ed. ]
Fenzel , The Thong Song
Pop songs often lie , and that ’s fine .
There ’s something aspirational about pop music — it ’s escapist , and it hopes for a world much different from our own .
In this world , Britney is a Slave 4 U , everybody gets to be immortal with the Oasis Brothers , and Whitney Houston will always love Kevin Costner .
It ’s liberating , sort of .
At the very least , it relieves us a bit of the mundanity of the real world .
But Sisqo gives us a special sort of delusion .
At the peak of a mounting cascade of modulations that wails to the heavens with a fury and pathos no undergarment ever deserved , Sisqo belts out the greatest counterfactual in all of music .
“ I do n’t think you heard me ! ”
That ’s right .
After expounding deliberately , loudly , enthusiastically and shrouded in only the most halfhearted simile about his enthusiasm for “ that thong ” — after doing so in front of a full orchestra in a song with multiple choruses and verses piling layer upon layer ( much like the multithonged women in the video ) into a full oratorio of thong worship , Sisqo still thinks that you either literally can’t hear him or figuratively do n’t understand what he ’s talking about .
This is impossible .
I love the behemoth key change in the Thong song because it is a world - killer , because it makes John Williams look like Phillip Glass ( or John ” ny ” Cage ) , because it has all the sublime glory of Icarus ascending to the heavens just before his brief record career melts in the heat of a bethonged sun and crashes into the Adriatic Sea ( or , for Sisqo , the Chesapeake Bay ) .
But I think it ’s the greatest key change ever because it does more than any other of its kind what all over - the - top pop song key changes aspire to do — it forces emotional significance on moments and lyrics that cannot bear it otherwise .
In that one key change , Sisqo demands , like Superman at his most absurd , that the world spin backwards .
For a split second atop the tip top of what used to be the top of his shattered lungs and discarded dignity , I can feel it shudder a little .
[ Stokes ’ music theory korner : Fenzel ’s analysis stands up just fine on its own , but I just could n’t help myself .
The thing you have to remember about the Thong Song is that the basic loop starts with a dissonant chord .
( i.e. the music for “ Baby make your booty go / Baby make your booty goooo ” sounds much more anxious than the music for “ Baby make your booty show / that thong , tha - thong thong thong . ” )
So the key change is from C# minor to D minor , but the actual cadence moves from C# minor to a G minor 9th , or something like that , which is crunchy as hell . ]
WASHINGTON --
A government audit found that the State Department overpaid the contract - security firm once known as Blackwater Worldwide by tens of millions of dollars because the company failed to properly staff its teams in Iraq .
The report did n't identify any specific security breaches , but it said the State Department should have withheld at least $ 55 million in payments to the company because of the shortfalls .

Few hiring issues rattle job seekers more than negotiating a starting salary .
Laura Allen was interviewing recently for a position as vice president of communications at a small New York entertainment company when its chief executive suddenly asked what salary she hoped to earn in the position .
The company had posted the range for the job at $ 42,000 to $ 55,000 , and she picked the upper limit .
" The fact that I said $ 55,000 first completely put me out of the ballgame , " she says .
She had been earning between $ 75,000 and $ 80,000 in her prior job as a vice president of sales and marketing at eCatalogmail , a New York online - marketing company , before she was laid off in December 2001 .
But she suspects she appeared arrogant by naming the company 's top salary figure , without leaving room to negotiate .
" I learned that as the job seeker , if you mention a number first you lose , " says the 32 - year - old New York resident .
Many career experts agree with that rule of thumb , advising job seekers to put the onus of setting a starting salary on the employer , regardless of when the subject comes up in the hiring process .
Conventional wisdom holds that if a job seeker names a figure first , negotiations will push the salary down , while when an employer speaks first , a negotiated salary can only go up .
Moreover , naming a salary figure prematurely sometimes knocks you out of contention early in the process , experts warn .
But some hiring managers insist that candidates should be upfront about salary requirements -- and in fact make naming a figure a prerequisite .
" Companies can't react to something they do n't know , " says Scott Stahlmann , a vice president of talent acquisition for Prudential Financial Inc. in Newark , N.J .
He argues that candidates could actually hurt their chances for a position by being coy about salary issues , and says he always asks candidates for their salary requirements in preliminary phone interviews .
" The ones who do n't give me an answer usually wo n't get a call back , " he says .
So how should you handle yourself in the heat of the moment ?
Here are some tips :
Do research .
Before you walk into your first interview for a job , be informed about what a company is likely to pay for the position , says Peter Goodman , author of " Win - Win Career Negotiations . "
He recommends visiting Internet salary sites , including SalaryExpert.com , that allow you to research salaries for related positions at similar firms in similar regions .
When pressed by a company , candidates should provide a salary range based on their research .
" If you 're going to put the first figure on the table , make sure the low end of the range is the number you 're willing to accept , " he says .
David Schmier , president of GetHired.com , a New York company that teaches job - finding skills , advises clients to avoid naming the first salary figure at all costs .
This includes a candidate 's first response to postings that ask for salary requirements ( unless they insist on such information ) as well as an impromptu query from a manager early in the interview process .
Mr. Schmier says that , in his previous post as a director of interactive marketing for AOL Time Warner , he frequently asked candidates for their salary requirements , and more than 90 % of the candidates responded with a figure .
" I knew how much I was going to have to pay them , and I would low - ball them , " he says .
Now he advises clients to delay such a discussion until an employer makes an offer of employment .
Even then , candidates should express their enthusiasm for the job and ask for a day to consider the offer ; they should then come back to negotiate any additional compensation items .
Practice negotiating , and do n't be afraid to ask for what you want , says Lori Davila , an Atlanta - based career coach .
Many anxious job seekers are currently selling themselves too low in today 's market , she says .
She advises her clients to always make a good - faith counteroffer .
" It 's showing the hiring manager , in a sense , how you 're going to approach this new job -- that you have good negotiating skills , that you work hard and go after things " she says .

Enlarge By Susan Walsh , AP Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , talks to the press about hate crime legislation on Capitol Hill on Monday , flanked by Wade Henderson , CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , left , and Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign .
FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES WASHINGTON  Conservative Christian leaders are fighting a bill that would provide federal hate - crimes coverage to gays and lesbians , prompting questions of who , if anyone , should be protected by such laws .
With a Democrat - controlled Congress and a president who has indicated his support for the Matthew Shepard Act , time may be running out for its opponents .
To stop the legislation , a few Christian leaders have suggested repealing all hate - crimes law , which would undo historic protections for race and even religion .
FAITH & REASON : How does sect handle disparate views within the ' family ' ?
" The entire notion of hate - crimes legislation is extraneous and obsolete , " said Matt Barber , director of cultural affairs with the conservative nonprofit Liberty Counsel , adding that he believes hate - crimes laws are unconstitutional .
In addition , a number of Christian conservatives have raised fears that pastors would be prosecuted for inciting hate crimes if they had preached against homosexuality , despite assurances that the law only targets physical violence .
" All violent crime is hate crime , " said Tom McClusky , vice president for government affairs at Family Research Council here in the capital .
" What drives an individual to commit a violent crime but hate for their victim ? "
Hate crimes are only named as such when victims are targeted specifically because of their race , color , religion or national origin .
Convictions for hate crimes carry harsher sentences because the victimization goes beyond the individual targeted .
" If you burn a cross on someone 's lawn , or put a swastika on a synagogue , the intent is not just vandalism , " said David Stacy , senior public policy advocate of the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign , a strong backer of the bill .
" It 's to send a message to intimidate the community . "
Many religious groups publicly support the Matthew Shepard Act , even if their denominations view homosexuality as sinful .
A 2007 Gallup poll showed a majority of Americans ( 68 % ) favor expanding hate - crimes protections .
Majorities of frequent churchgoers ( 62 % ) , conservatives ( 57 % ) , and Republicans ( 60 % ) also were in favor of the legislation .
The Matthew Shepard Act , named for a gay Wyoming man slain in 1998 , would add sexual orientation , gender identity and disability to the list of federally - protected classes .
It would also allow federal support for state and local police investigations , which often come with a hefty price tag .
The bill 's supporters doubt the sincerity of the Christian right 's constitutional arguments .
" These groups have long opposed any rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgendered Americans , " said Stacy .
" One certainly has to question whether they believe this about hate - crimes laws in general or rather that this is really about their own bias against the LGBT community . "
If , as opponents of the bill say , gays and lesbians do not deserve hate crime protections , then who does ?
Focus on the Family does not favor repealing hate - crime laws , but sees sexual orientation and gender identity as changeable , unlike race , for instance , said Ashley Horne , federal policy analyst for the Colorado - based group .
While Horne acknowledges individuals can change their religion , that category is the exception to the rule because " the government has historically protected religion since the founding of this country . "
The current federal hate - crimes law was put in place in 1968 , during the Civil Rights era .
Barber and organizations like the FRC and the Alliance Defense Fund say the constitution covers all citizens adequately , without hate - crimes provisions .
" Everyone is receiving equal protection under the law , regardless of race , religion , gender , homosexuality , favorite color or ' American Idol ' pick , " Barber said .
Hate crimes often go underreported .
FBI statistics show annual hate crimes number around 7,000 .
However , a 2005 study done by Department of Justice provided victim numbers as high as 190,000 .
Conservative groups said that proves local law enforcement officials are already doing the job without need of additional legislation .
" There is no evidence that a lack of prosecutions is occurring , " said Erik Stanley , senior legal counsel of Alliance Defense Fund .
" There is a well - documented pattern that these crimes are being punished under current criminal law without adding any kind of hate crimes provisions . "
In Matthew Shepard 's case , his killers received life sentences without hate crime laws ; but the prosecution was expensive , with no help from federal funds .
The proposed legislation would help local prosecutors tap federal resources .
Sean Kennedy , a 20 - year - old gay man , was killed in South Carolina in 2007 in what many call a hate murder .
His killer , Stephen Moller , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter , and is serving 12 months and 2 weeks in prison .
His mother , Elke Kennedy , believes if the Matthew Shepard Act had been in place , federal authorities could have stepped in , providing longer sentencing .
" I ca n't do anything to change the past , " she said .
" What I can do is take my energy in a positive way and help get the Matthew Shepard Act passed at the federal level and then work to change South Carolina laws . "

BERKELEY ( MarketWatch ) --
The hype over the unreleased iPhone has actually increased over the past month despite the fact that nobody has seen or used the device .
This , if nothing else , proves the power of branding and especially the power of brand loyalty .
It 's the loyalists who keep promoting this device as if it is going to be anything other than another phone in a crowded market .
And it 's exactly the crowded - market aspect of this that analysts seem to be ignoring .
Apple Inc.'s AAPL past successes have been in markets that were emerging or moribund .
Its biggest hit has been the iPod .
But let 's examine what happened here .
First the MP3 player business was segmented and unfocused with numerous players making a lot of cheap junk and not doing much to market any of it .
Apple does what ?
Advertise .
Gosh , what a concept .
Then there was the online music distribution business , again unfocused and out - of - control with little marketing and a lot of incompatible technologies .
So Apple comes in with a reasonable solution , links it to the heavily promoted iPod and bingo .
A winner .
It advertises on TV , on billboards and on the Internet .
Within no time the company takes over the business that would probably still be languishing without Apple .
Thus Apple does what it does best .
It produces a jazzy product and promotes it like any good business should do .
And in the process manages to get a high margin .
This is nothing more than the fundamentals .
Now compare that effort and overlay the mobile handset business .
This is not an emerging business .
In fact it 's gone so far that it's in the process of consolidation with probably two players dominating everything , Nokia Corp. NOK and Motorola Inc. MOT
During this phase of a market margins are incredibly thin so that the small fry cannot compete without losing a lot of money .
As for advertising and expensive marketing this is nothing like Apple has ever stepped into .
It 's a buzz saw waiting to chop up newbies
The problem here is that while Apple can play the fashion game as well as any company , there is no evidence that it can play it fast enough .
These phones go in and out of style so fast that unless Apple has half a dozen variants in the pipeline , its phone , even if immediately successful , will be passé within 3 months .
There is no likelihood that Apple can be successful in a business this competitive .
Even in the business where it is a clear pioneer , the personal computer , it had to compete with Microsoft and can only sustain a 5 % market share .
And its survival in the computer business relies on good margins .
Those margins cannot exist in the mobile handset business for more than 15 minutes .
And note that the Microsoft Corp.
MSFT versus Apple battles are laughable compared to the frenzied marketing mania in the handset business .
Even Microsoft itself has troubles with its attempts to get into a small sub segment of the handset business with its operating system .
What Apple risks here is its reputation as a hot company that can do no wrong .
If it 's smart it will call the iPhone a " reference design " and pass it to some suckers to build with someone else 's marketing budget .
Then it can wash its hands of any marketplace failures .
It should do that immediately before it 's too late .
Samsung Electronics Ltd. SSNGY might be a candidate .
Otherwise I 'd advise you to cover your eyes .
You 're not going to like what you 'll see .
Massive geysers on Saturn 's moon Enceladus may be fed by a salty ocean beneath the surface , adding weight to speculation it harbors the essential building blocks needed for life .
Enceladian plumes , courtesy of NASA
Scientists working on NASA 's Cassini mission have detected sodium salts in ice grains of Saturn 's outermost ring .
The planet 's outer ring , or " E- ring , " is believed to be primarily supplied by giant geysers on Enceladus 's south polar region tossing out materials to a distance of three times the moon 's radius .
Cassini 's cosmic dust analyzer has examined the composition of the material and found salt within it .
Since the discovery of Enceladus ' eruptions in 2005 , the tiny moon has become a top candidate for where extraterrestrial organic life could exist within our own solar system .
Enceladus has at least two of the three requirements scientists are looking for : it 's the proper warmth and has the necessary organic compounds .
The final ingredient is liquid water , and continued analysis of the moon 's geysers indicate the source is a sub - surface ocean of water .
" We believe that the salty minerals deep inside Enceladus washed out from rock at the bottom of a liquid layer , " said Frank Postberg , Cassini scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , Germany .
Postberg is the lead author of a study that appears in the June 25 issue of Nature .
The scientists on Cassini 's cosmic dust - watching team have concluded it must be liquid water lurking under the surface because it 's the only way to dissolve the amount salt detected .
They say the process of sublimation - where a compound transistions from solid to gas with no intermediate liquid stage - cannot account for the presence of salt .
" Potential plume sources on Enceladus are an active area of research with evidence continuing to converge on a possible salt water ocean , " said Linda Spilker , Cassini deputy project scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" Our next opportunity to gather data on Enceladus will come during two flybys in November . "
When Saturn 's outermost ring grains were checked by the Cassini dust analyzer , nearly every time it found at least some sodium within the particles , the scientists said .
The measurements also contained carbonates like soda , and both materials in concentrations that match the predicted composition of a underground Enceladus ocean .
However , a another study on ground - based observations did not detect traces of sodium on the geyser plumes of Enceladus themselves .
Sodium combined with chloride are the two major components of salt .
The scientists believe the results mean if the plume vapor comes from an subterranean ocean , the evaporation must take place deep underground rather than a violent eruption near the surface similar to geysers found at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming as previously thought .
How Enceladus ' plumes may be formed - NASA / JPL / SWRI / University of Colorado
" Finding salt in the plume gives evidence for liquid water below the surface , " said Sascha Kempf , a Cassini scientist on the dust analyzer team .
" The lack of detection of sodium vapor in the plume gives hints about what the water reservoir might look like . "
Further analysis of Enceladus eruptions will be a top priority for Cassini during the orbiter 's extended tour of the neighborhood . ®

Governor Tim Pawlenty ( R - MN ) has an uphill battle .
He is between a rock and a hard place .
How ?
He is a glowing new or semi-new face in the Republican Party .
He has pressure from his party to keep his boot on Franken 's neck and not sign the certificate to seat him in the senate .
This pressure from the GOP will continue , even if the Minnesota Supreme Court sides with Franken on the win for the senate seat against Norm Coleman .
If Pawlenty does not sign the certificate , he is playing politics , clear and simple .
He is going against the will of the people in his state and he is allowing this to drag on .
If Pawlenty does this , bad move .
We all know that Al Franken won this seat , in a mandatory recount because the vote total was too close .
During the recount and every court appeal , Franken has come out ahead and he is stil 300 + votes to the north .
It is over for Coleman .
And Coleman ?
The polls are out and the people of Minnesota want this over with and Coleman to concede .
If Coleman does not , he can forget any other political aspirations in Minnesota .
He will be forever remembered as the grumpy , sourpuss , sore loser who dragged a senate race to the courts , knowing he did not have the votes and knowing he LOST .
So , what will Pawlenty do ?
I hope the right thing .
DNC Chairman Tim Kaine penned a letter to Tim Pawlenty on Tuesday , asking the Minnesota Governor to persuade Norm Coleman to concede and , short of that , sign the certification of Al Franken 's election once the state 's Supreme Court makes its final ruling .
The letter is the latest in a growing effort to ramp up the pressure on the governor - and Republican Party as a whole - to seat Franken , as the Minnesota Senate race drags on more than six months since the actual election .
In his note , Kaine claims it is " all but indisputable " that Franken won the election and urges Pawlenty to " use [ his ] influence to bring this process to an end by asking Norm Coleman to allow his neighbors and yours , their full representation in Congress . "
" However , " Kaine adds , " if Mr. Coleman refuses to concede and this case is heard and decided by the Minnesota State Supreme Court , I urge you to commit to signing an election certificate for the rightful winner as soon as the Court issues a ruling in this case .
To allow this to process to continue into the federal courts for no other reason than to deny for as long as possible the seating of another Democratic Senator would make what has been a bad situation for Minnesotans even worse .
I urge you to do everything within your power and influence to bring this process to an end . " read more here ....

The halls of Foggy Bottom are ringing with the Tweets coming with Iran and the State Department is working to ensure they keep coming .
Senior officials say the State Department is working with Twitter and other social networking sites to ensure Iranians are able to continue to communicate to each other and the outside world .
By necessity , the US is staying hands off of the election drama playing out in Iran , and officials say they are not providing messages to Iranians or " quarterbacking " the disputed election process .
But they do want to make sure the technology is able to play its sorely - needed role in the crisis , which is why the State Department is advising social networking sites to make sure their networks stay up and running for Iranians to use them and helping them stay ahead of anyone who would try to shut them down .
For example , senior officials say the State Department asked Twitter to refrain for going down for periodic scheduled maintenance at this critical time to ensure the site continues to operate .
Bureau 's and offices across the State Department , they say , are paying very close attention to Twitter and other sites to get information on the situation in Iran .
Because the US has no relations with Iran and does not have an embassy there , it is relying on media reports and the State Department 's Iran Watch Offices in embassies around the world .
The largest such offices are in Dubai , Berlin and London , all home to large Iranian expat communities .
But officials say the internet , and specifically social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook , are providing the United States with critical information in the face of a crackdown on journalists by Iranian authorities .
" There are lots of people here watching , " one senior official said .
" There are some interesting messages going up . "
While officials would not say whether they were communicating with Iranians directly , one senior official noted that the US is learning about certain people being picked up for questioning by authorities through posts on Twitter .
" It is a very good example of where technology is helping , " the official said .
The situation in Iran is a real world example of the State Department 's efforts to increase use of technology in diplomacy , including social networking sites , Web Video and text messages to reach large numbers of people who would otherwise be difficult to reach .

Dolan publicly bashes our civil equality ?
Fine .
Paterson supports same ?
DISRESPECT !!!!!
by Jeremy Hooper
Speaking about tomorrow , the day that Gov. David Paterson plans to introduce a marriage equality bill , New York 's biggest senatorial fairness foe , Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr. , shares the following thoughts with the Daily News :
In a brief telephone interview this morning , Diaz Sr. , a Pentecostal minister who has long been vocal in his opposition to gay marriage , questioned Paterson 's timing and called it " ridiculous , " particularly given the fact that this is the week Archbishop Timothy Dolan is being installed in his new job .
" I think this is the wrong time to do it , " Diaz Sr. said .
" ( Paterson ) is doing this as a welcoming ceremony for the new Catholic ?
It 's ridiculous . "
In the press release announcing tomorrow 's meeting at the Christian Community Neighborhood Church , the Bronx Democrat went even further , calling the governor 's move " disrespectful , and adding : " If I were Governor Paterson , I would abstain from going to St. Patrick ’s Cathedral for the welcoming ceremony and to celebrate Mass . ” Diaz Sr : Timing On Gay Marriage Bill ' Ridiculous ' [ NY Daily News ]
Yes , because one really should consult the local calendars of every faith denomination before introducing CIVIL legislation .
Pushing for tax reform ?
Well ya better make sure it 's not shuvuot .
Taking up term limits ?
Then you must first swing by the Scientology Center and check to see if there are any super - important auditing going on .
Pushing for congestion pricing ?
Fine , but first ya gotta see if the Baptists and Methodists have enough left over after they 've tithed to pay the new tolls .
And if you do n't check with all of these groups before pushing your CIVIL legislation , then you are both " ridiculous " and " disrespectful , " and should stay away from all local houses of worship .
Because , after all , your harsh religious insensitivity will have made you God 's number one political archenemy .
Uhm , yea -- NO .
The truth is that both Ruben Diaz Sr. and Archbishop Dolan wish to use their personal faith beliefs to stop our CIVIL freedoms , and they wish to do so 365 days a year .
It may be convenient to shun Paterson as some sort of anti-Catholic because he 's " ridiculous " enough to think that ( a ) his gay constituents deserve CIVIL equality and ( b ) that this particular week is a good time to make that happen .
But in reality , it 's Ruben Diaz Sr. who is dishing the true disrespect .
Disrespect towards church / state separation .
Disrespect towards deserving gay families .
Disrespect towards the concept of God , an unimaginable power who we 'd imagine is comfortable enough in his or her own all - knowing skin to be offended by state political matters .
Disrespect towards the countless Catholics who support LGBT rights ( and who are sick of being made to feel badly for doing so ) .
Disrespect towards ANYONE who 's tired of socially conservative politicians who will pull out every disingenuous stop in order to get their undeserved way .
Sen . Diaz : Fight us on our merits , in the Senate chamber .
Fair enough .
But please do us all a favor and stop this false reliance on conveniently timed religious goings - on .
You do n't hear us making a stink because WNBC 's local Dolan coverage rescheduled " Days of Our Lives , " do you ?

With version three of CSS , many exciting features will be implemented .
CSS3 leads to greater flexibility and makes it much easier to recreate previously complex effects .
Many time - saving rules are being thought up for CSS3 : text - shadow , box - sizing , opacity , multiple backgrounds , border - radius , border - image , multi - column layout , etc …
Although only the most modern browsers currently support these effects , it ’s still fun to see what ’s around the corner !
In this post we will take a look at some interesting properties of CSS3 that you can put into practice in your website designs today .
CSS3 supports more color and a wider range of color definitions .
The new colors that CSS3 support are HSL , CMYK , HSLA and RGBA .
This powerpoint explains in details the CSS3 colors and how use them .
You can have gradient border using the - moz - border - radius / - webkit - border property .

Well , that was glorious , was n't it ?
Say what you will about yesterday 's protests , but one thing remains unassailably true .
A bunch of fucking morons waved a bunch of very , very stupid signs .
Here are a collection of some of my favorites , both from yesterday 's protests and from an earlier Tea Party last weekend in California .
This really says it all .
Clearly , the U.S. is becoming such a third world nation that we can't afford enough cardboard to make a sign saying the U.S. is a third world nation .
Bonus points for trying to salvage " Nation " by writing the rest of the letters smaller , then realizing after the " A " and the " T " that more drastic cuts in point size were required to balance the cardboard budget .
You do n't fire Congress by honking .
You fire Congress by voting .
We all " honked " five months ago , fired a bunch of members of Congress , and this is the result .
I 'm sorry you 're not happy with it , but all the angry honkies in the world wo n't get to change that until 2010 .
YOU HAVE REPRESENTATION , ASSHOLES .
The Boston Tea Party was about paying taxes without even a chance at a say in how , and to what extent , they were enacted .
Your tea parties are about paying taxes when you blew your chance at a say in how , and when , and to what extent they were enacted , because you threw all your support behind a senile old man and a bimbo .
Not liking your representation is not the same as not having any .
I 've got to give this guy some credit .
Either by accident , due to his laser - like focus on Congress , or by design , this guy has actually managed to avoid raising the image of lynching the black president .
So ten out of ten for racial sensitivity , but subtract several million for violent , eliminationist rhetoric .
Whoops .
I 'm not going to get into the comparison with Hitler .
That 's old news .
All over the Tea Parties , all day today .
What I will take issue with , however , is the capitalization .
What the fuck ?
OBama ?
HiTler ?
Unlike the last guy , there 's plenty of room on the sign , although it looks like somewhere there 's a road crew missing a warning flag .
Pick a case and stick with it .
Our founding fathers did n't fight and die for your awful penmanship , fuckload .
OK , why did n't someone send this guy the " it 's not about race " memo ?
" Kenyan " ?
An outdated In Living Color reference ?
Wait a second ... is this David Duke ?
Nah , probably just a coincidence .
I do n't know what 's more disheartening .
That these people are out there bitching about the taxes that have n't gone up , or that they 're doing such a half - assed job at it .
Come on !
Your protests are being funded by some of the wealthiest right - wing think tanks in the country !
Your sign does n't have to look like a ransom note mailed on part of a refrigerator box .
Call up FreedomWatch and have them send you one of their slickly produced , correctly - spelled placards !
And I 'll finish with a twofer - these signs were ten feet away from each other , and a trillion miles from reality .
Contrary to what the Army recruitment ads tell you , America 's fresh - faced youth are n't willing to shoot foreigners for free plus " leadership experience " .
It 's not a fucking internship .
And even if they were , the Army does n't actually operate on a Bring Your Own Bullets basis .
Hope you enjoyed your day in fantasy land , dipshits , because , because the real world 's back today .
" I 've come to terms with all my incongruities and am proud of who I am and what I do .
In closing , words can hurt .
But words should not provoke someone to violence .
Stripped away from the mask of Perez Hilton , I have been extremely bothered by the public reaction to my assault .
Violence should never be condoned with such statements as ' It 's karma ' or ' I do n't believe in violence but … '
In fact , several television and radio shows over the past couple of days echoed the sentiment , ' He had it coming . '
Would they have said the same thing if I was a woman ?
Would I have ' deserved it ' if I had been stabbed ?
Or shot ?
Or killed ?
" There are many ways to deal with disagreements , both good and bad , but violence is never the answer .
Never .
I now know that firsthand .
It should not be condoned , promoted or accepted .
No one ' deserves ' to be the victim of violence .
No one 'has it coming . '
NO ONE .
And victims should not be ridiculed . "

What to do if GLAAD can't rely on Hollywood 's self - proclaimed gossip queen to avoid the F - word ?
The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is none too pleased with blogger Perez Hilton for mixing a few antigay slurs into his diatribe against Black Eyed Peas frontman will .i.am .
" I do n't need to respect you , and you 're a f - g .
You 're gay , and stop being such a f ---- t , " the openly gay Hilton said in a videoblog response to reports of a fight between him and the hip - hop singer last night in Toronto .
" These are vulgar antigay slurs that feed a climate of hatred and intolerance toward our community , " said Rashad Robinson , senior director of Media Programs at GLAAD .
" For someone in our own community to use it to attack another person by saying that it is ' The worst possible thing that thug would ever want to hear , ' is incredibly dangerous .
" It legitimizes use of a slur that is often linked to violence against our community .
And it sends a message that it is OK to attempt to dehumanize people by exploiting antigay attitudes . "
Hilton maintains that he was was roughed up by will .i.am and the Peas ' tour manager , Polo Molina .
Molina , 36 , has been charged with one count of assault and ordered to appear in court Aug .
5 .
The " Boom Boom Pow " singer said in his own video post that he did not hit Hilton but rather was just coming to Fergie 's defense , claiming the celeb - dirt shoveler had disrespected his bandmate .
" This dude twists it and says that I assaulted him , " will .i.am said .
" When I was the one that came to him with respect and he was the one who called me a [ f ----- t ] outside the club . "
Now GLAAD is calling upon Hilton to admit to his mistake .
" We have reached out to Hilton and asked him to apologize for promoting this antigay slur , and we would ask media outlets to avoid repetition of the slur in their coverage of this story , " Robinson said .
But it 's not as if the GLAAD folk think , no matter how inappropriate Hilton 's reponse , that the blogger deserved to get hit .
" While not all the facts in this case are known , the violence that appears to have been committed against Perez Hilton is unacceptable and ought to be condemned in the strongest possible terms , " Robinson added .
Hilton twittered earlier today that he was " honestly SHOCKED at the amount of people saying [ he ] deserved to be hit .
" Shame on you !
NO .
Violence is never the answer .
NEVER . "
In a statement to E !
News , Hilton says : " I am saddened GLAAD chose to victimize me further by criticizing me for how I nonviolently dealt with a very scary situation that , unfortunately , turned violent .
While I doubt I will get an apology from GLAAD , nor do I expect one , I would just hope people know how difficult it is to intellectualize a situation and think rationally when a thug disguised as a musician is screaming at your face and intimidating you .
I am just very fortunate and grateful that nothing more serious happened to me ...
He also notes that he is a " proud " former GLAAD staffer .

From the start of his run for governor , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has tried to show there is more to his career than the gesture that won him worldwide fame : his 2004 decree legalizing same - sex marriage .
Yet there he was Tuesday on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live , ” speaking out for gay rights after the state Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8 , the same - sex marriage ban that Californians passed in November .
For Newsom and five major - party rivals , the resurgence of the same - sex marriage issue has added a new complication to the race for governor .
If gay rights groups get their way , the nominees to succeed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will share the November 2010 ballot with a measure to repeal Proposition 8 , turning an emotionally charged cultural issue into a central focus of the campaign .
Advertisement
Across the nation , the subject has grown more challenging for candidates of all kinds as the mere concept has given way to the reality of tens of thousands of married gay couples .
Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont , Maine and Iowa have legalized same - sex marriage .
Voters have also shifted their views .
In April , a Washington Post - ABC News poll found that 49 % of Americans said gay marriage should be legal , and 46 % said it should be illegal .
Three years earlier , 36 % had said it should be legal , and 58 % had said it should not .
“ The trajectory of public opinion on this issue has been dramatic , ” said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman .
In California , where Newsom ’s rebel edict in 2004 touched off the court battles that spawned some 18,000 marriages that were declared valid Tuesday , candidates for governor face multiple dangers on the issue .
Although support for gay marriage has risen over the last decade -- the 52 % yes vote on Proposition 8 was down from 61 % on a similar measure in 2000 -- the issue still sharply divides Californians .
Advertisement
“ People care about this one -- a lot -- on both sides , ” said Steve Smith , a Democratic strategist who worked on the campaign to defeat Proposition 8 .
A Field Poll taken three months ago affirmed stark generational and ideological splits on same - sex marriage .
Younger voters were far more likely to approve of it than older voters .
And Democrats overwhelmingly favored it , while Republicans were strongly opposed .
In that environment , candidates for governor are juggling wildly different needs for the primaries and the general election .

To score points with partisan voters in the June 2010 primary -- regardless of party -- is to risk harm in the broader arena of the general election .
So Newsom or any other Democrat who gets too bold about same - sex marriage in the primary could face a backlash if running as party nominee come November , said Republican strategist Frank Schubert .
“ In the general election , it ’s a huge problem , because it identifies you so closely with a polarizing issue that could define your candidacy , ” said Schubert , who led the campaign for Proposition 8 .
Schubert said blacks and Latinos , both strong Democratic constituencies that have largely opposed gay marriage , will be targets of opportunity for the Republican nominee -- particularly if a marriage measure is on the same ballot .
Likewise , Democrats believe that a staunchly anti-gay marriage stance could limit a Republican nominee ’s success in appealing to the moderates whose support is necessary for victory .
Advertisement
So far , the candidate taking the biggest gamble on the issue is a Republican , Tom Campbell of Orange County .
The former Silicon Valley congressman supports gay marriage , putting him starkly out of sync with the conservatives who hold sway in GOP primaries .
( That is not a surprising position for Campbell , who is also touting higher taxes as a way out of the state ’s fiscal mess . )
Republican rival Meg Whitman , a former EBay chief executive , supported Proposition 8 .
But she too has vexed conservatives , in her case by saying the 18,000 same - sex marriages that occurred before the measure passed should stay legal .
“ That ’s very troubling , ” said Karen England , a key state Republican Party leader .
England also faulted another GOP candidate , state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner , for not speaking out sooner and more forcefully for Proposition 8 .
On the Democratic side , a spat has broken out between Newsom and state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown over which man has been a stronger supporter of same - sex marriage .
Advertisement
In a tack apparently aimed at undercutting Newsom among backers of gay marriage , Brown waged a court fight to overturn Proposition 8 .
It was an unusual move for an attorney general , who typically defends initiatives passed by voters , and the state Supreme Court rebuffed him Tuesday .
But Newsom , in turn , has cast Brown as late to the gay - marriage cause .
Newsom strategist Garry South hammered Brown for a bill that he signed into law as governor in 1977 ; it defined marriage as between a man and a woman .
In an interview , Brown brushed the bill off as a technical clarification of previous laws .
“ I saw it as codifying legislative intent , ” he said .
South , however , said Brown “ is responsible for the fact that California defines marriage as between a man and a woman . ”
And for a man who often “ blabbers ” about being a forward - looking governor in the 1970s , South said , “ there ’s a certain irony to that . ”
Advertisement
This week , Newsom made clear that he would not shy from the gay - marriage issue , even as he tries to familiarize Californians with his record on healthcare , education and other issues .
“ It sets him apart as a politician in terms of doing what he thought was right , ” South said .
Another potential candidate , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , has also made a point of speaking out for gay marriage as he weighs whether to run .
On Tuesday night , he took part in a West Hollywood protest against the California Supreme Court ’s ruling .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A rush - hour collision Monday between two Metro trains north of downtown Washington , D.C. , killed at least six people and injured scores , Mayor Adrian Fenty said .
One train was stationary when the crash happened , according to Metro General Manager John Catoe .

He called it the deadliest crash in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , known as Metro .
One of the dead was the female operator of one of the trains , Metro officials said .
" The scene is as horrific as you can imagine , " Fenty said in a news conference .
" One car was almost squeezed completely together . "
Seventy - six people were treated for injuries , including two with life - threatening injuries , said Chief Dennis Rubin of Washington 's Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department .
Two of the injured were emergency responders , Rubin said .

The crash happened just before 5 p.m. on an above - ground track on the Red Line in the District of Columbia near the border with Takoma Park , Maryland .
Both trains were on the same track , and one of them was stationary when the crash happened , said John Catoe , Metro general manager .
Watch woman say she , fellow passengers " went flying " »
Video footage of the scene showed two cars of one train lying atop the cars of the other train .
Emergency personnel carried injured passengers , some on stretchers , from the wreckage .
Watch injured passengers limp from the scene »
" Metro officials do not know the cause of the collision and are not likely to know the cause for several days as the investigation unfolds , " a Metro statement said .
Fire department personnel cut through the trains to help people from the wreckage , officials said at a press briefing .
Some three hours after the accident , fire department sources said rescue operations had ceased , with ongoing work focusing on recovery .

President Obama issued a statement saying he and his wife Michelle were " saddened by the terrible accident , " and thanking the first responders to the scene " who arrived immediately to save lives . "
A survivor , Jodie Wickett , described feeling a bump on the track , and then being flung forward when the train suddenly halted a few seconds later .
She said she hit her head , but managed to get out and go to where the collision occurred a few cars up , where one subway car lay atop another .
" There was debris , and people pinned under in - between the two cars , " Wickett said .
" We were just trying to get them out and help them as much as possible , pulling back the metal . "
People were badly injured , she said .
" Ones that could speak were calling back as we called out to them . "
One car was " about 75 percent compressed , " and recovery workers are n't sure if any more bodies are inside , Fenty told CNN's " Larry King Live " on Monday night .
" We just have n't been able to cut through it to see if there 's bodies in there , " Fenty said .
A certified nursing assistant who was on one of the trains told CNN affiliate WUSA she was trying to help those in severe condition after the crash , including a lady who appeared to be in her 20s .
" She is very , very torn in her legs -- the muscles and everything are torn , ripped through .
She had metal pieces in her face , " said the nursing assistant , who said her name was Jeanie .
Other witnesses described seeing more blood than they had seen before .
Tom Baker , who was in the train that hit the stationary train , told WUSA that after the collision , he looked toward the front of the car , and when the smoke cleared , " all you could see was sky . "
Jasmine Gars , who also was on the moving train , told CNN's " Larry King Live " that the collision " was like nothing I 've ever felt before . "
" It was like we hit a concrete wall , " Gars said .
" Almost immediately I fell off my seat .
Another person -- I do n't know who -- flew off their seat .
And the lights went off and smoke started filling the train car . "
Four people were taken to Providence Hospital in Washington , including two with back injuries , one with a hip injury and one complaining of dizziness from hitting her head , hospital officials said .
Washington Hospital Center reported seven patients from the crash with injuries ranging from serious to minor , while Howard University Hospital reported three and Suburban Hospital in Maryland reported two .
Groups of people wearing green plastic ribbons to show they had been checked by paramedics left the scene about 90 minutes after the crash .
Some were crying , and a woman with her arm in a sling who gave her name as Tijuana described the crash as " an earthquake . "
A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived to investigate the crash , assisted by the FBI Evidence Response Team , according to NTSB board member Deborah Hersman , who said she walked the tracks by the wreckage .
" I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation down there , " she said .
Hersman said both trains contained six cars .
One train struck the other train from the rear and and its " first car overrode the last car of the other train in an accordion fashion , " she said .
She said it was n't clear if the trains involved in the accident carried devices that recorded speed and other data .
At least two FBI officials were at the scene , and the FBI confirmed it was assisting as part of the National Capital Response Squad .
Amy Kudwa of the Department of Homeland Security said " at this early stage , " there was no indication of anything other than an accidental collision .
It was the second Metro crash to involve fatalities in the 33 - year history of the transit authority .
In January 1982 , a derailment killed three people .
The only other collision between Metro trains occurred in 2004 .
" We are extremely saddened that there are fatalities as a result of this accident , which has touched our Metro family , " Catoe said in a statement .
" Our safety officials are investigating , and will continue to investigate until we determine why this happened and what must be done to ensure it never happens again . "
By a vote of 89 - 57 , the Maine House of Representatives enacted L.D. 1020 , An Act To End Discrimination in Civil Marriage and Affirm Religious Freedom .
The formal debate did not run nearly as long as had been anticipated , with the final vote coming just before 2:00 this afternoon .
The roll call votes can be found here ( when they become available ) .
The bill will be signed by the Speaker , and then sent back to the Senate for one final vote to be held Wed , 6 May .
The two live blog threads from this morning 's debate can be found here : first and second .
Congratulations to the people of Maine , and thanks to all those that voted for this bill , and those that worked so hard to see it passed .
Uh-oh !
Another big bank is the subject of a depositor run amid charges its chairman has run off with customers ’ money .
Thankfully , this scandal is taking place in Eve Online , a space - age virtual reality created by CCP , a games developer and Iceland ’s coolest company .
But these troubles in the ether may offer some valuable lessons for earthly banking and regulation .
Eve is one of the more successful multiplayer online games .
Some 300,000 people  as it happens , nearly equal to the population of Iceland  pay $ 15 a month to navigate characters that pilot intergalactic spaceships , manufacture and trade goods , mine resources and enter into big alliances , or bloody battles , with one another .
Central to Eve ’s strategy , players develop economies within an “ anything goes ” free - market framework that allows them to expand their fleets , buy weaponry and equipment and bolster defenses .
Indeed ,
Eve has 66 marketplaces for some 5,000 items , with more than a million transactions a day .
Enter Ebank , this virtual universe ’s online bank .
Because players often do not have the interstellar credits  abbreviated to ISK , also the official abbreviation of the Icelandic kroner  they need to expand their fleets , an enterprising player created a bank that would accept deposits and lend to players who would pledge assets , like their spacecraft , as collateral .
Web professionals are often expected to be “ always on ” — always working , absorbing information , and honing new skills .
Unless our work and personal lives are carefully balanced , however , the physical and mental effects of an “ always on ” life can be debilitating .
Article Continues Below
It ’s taken me the better part of a year to finish writing this article , and the reasons it took that long are tied directly to the topic at hand .
If anything , the last year has made it clear that we as an industry are facing increased levels of stress , illness , and exhaustion .
Having learned a few things from my own battle with exhaustion and burnout , I hope they ’ll benefit others who are now or may eventually be in the same situation .
Burnout : running on empty #section2
Burnout is a psychological response to “ long - term exhaustion and diminished interest , ” and may take months or years to bubble to the surface .
First defined by American psychoanalyst Herbert J. Freudenberger in 1972 , burnout is “ a demon born of the society and times we live in and our ongoing struggle to invest our lives with meaning . ”
1
He goes on to say that burnout “ is not a condition that gets better by being ignored .
Nor is it any kind of disgrace .
On the contrary , it ’s a problem born of good intentions . ”
Another description in New York Magazine calls burnout “ a problem that ’s both physical and existential , an untidy conglomeration of external symptoms and personal frustrations . ”
Sounds like fun , does n’t it ?
During his research , Freudenberger and his associate , Gail North , developed a simple outline to describe how otherwise healthy individuals can burn out , the key being that people may experience several or all phases , though not necessarily in a specific order .
The identified phases , several of which I bet sound familiar , are :
A compulsion to prove oneself
Working harder
Neglecting one ’s own needs
Displacement of conflict ( the person does not realize the root cause of the distress )
Revision of values ( friends , family , hobbies , etc. , are dismissed )
Denial of emerging problems ( cynicism , aggression , and frustration become apparent )
Withdrawal from social contexts , potential for alcohol or drug abuse
Behavioral changes become more visible to others
Inner emptiness
Depression
Burnout syndrome ( including suicidal thoughts and complete mental and physical collapse ) 2
It ’s important to note that burnout is not the same as depression , though there are shared characteristics that blur the distinction ; burnout can be brought on by fits of depression or may lead to depression itself .
My own head - on collision with burnout came at the end of 2007 .
In the year since , my focus has changed and I ’ve become extremely conscious — and protective — of the balance I need in my life .
Here ’s what I ’ve learned .
How it happens #section3
Burnout does n’t happen without stress .
Characterized as being “ too much ” of something , stress may come from too many meetings , projects , responsibilities , unrealistic deadlines , improperly set expectations , distractions , or any number of other things prevalent in our hyper - connected world .
Stress is not crippling in and of itself , but we each have limits , and once those limits are reached , we can find ourselves teetering on the brink of burnout .
Although burnout is primarily a work - related illness caused by an imbalance in an individual ’s personal goals , ideals , and needs as related to their job , stresses and factors outside the workplace can also contribute to the problem by wearing down emotional defenses .
You may be flirting with burnout if :
Every day is a bad day
You are no longer emotionally invested in your job or the work you ’re doing
You feel unappreciated or do not feel like you ’re making a difference in your job
There is a clear disconnect between your personal values and what is expected of you
Self - defined goals or those imposed on you are unrealistic or unreasonable
A significant amount of your day is focused on tasks that are not fulfilling on a personal or emotional level
Ultimately , burnout results from a lack of equilibrium .
When you lose your balance , physically , you fall over .
Burnout is very similar , except that once you ’re down , it can be a real challenge to get back up .
How to recover from ( or prevent ) burnout #section4
The first and most important step in preventing or recovering from burnout is to recognize the problem and objectively survey your situation .
What are the stressors in your life ?
Are there aspects of your job that do not align with your personal goals and values ?
Are you not doing the type of work you enjoy ?
Are your own measures of success realistic ?
Are you really engaged in the work you ’re doing , or are you just overloaded ?
These same questions can help you restore your internal balance without going as far as changing jobs or careers , which is rarely a realistic option .
Burnout does n’t have to be a career killer , but it can be if left untreated .
Stop ( or at least slow down ) #section5
If you ’re working 50 or more hours a week , cut that number to the bare minimum .
If possible , use up your sick days , work from home one day a week , and take a vacation or a leave of absence to give yourself the time needed to decompress , reflect , and reconnect .
Sabbaticals are gaining acceptance in our industry , and even one day outside of your normal routine can help prevent burnout or get on the right track to push through it .
The point being : take yourself out of the problem for as long as you can realistically afford to .
When in doubt , talk .
Seek counsel and support from family , friends , and industry peers , or consider more formal coaching , possibly through a local business network or wellness center .
In my case , my wife recognized my burnout before I did , and helped me find a local business coach who understood client demands in the creative realm and the pressures of operating a small business .
The time spent reflecting on how I got to where I was at the end of 2007 was invaluable , and has been the catalyst for the many changes I ’ve made since .
Set boundaries and expectations # section7
The days of the 9 - to - 5 job are gone and the boundaries between work and home are blurred to the point of non-existence .
We ’re expected to be available nearly all the time , and the problem is often exacerbated for freelancers or anyone who works primarily from a home office where the only divide between being “ at home ” and being “ at work ” is a single door or a flight of stairs .
It ’s not a badge of honor to work 80 hours a week or to answer e-mail or to Twitter at all hours of the night .
Ask yourself :
Have you set sufficient boundaries between your job and your life outside of work ?
Are you guarding those boundaries ?
Although clients may choose to leave you messages and send e-mail at all hours , it ’s up to you to set expectations about your responsiveness .
As soon as you leave yourself open to responding to e-mails at 10 o’clock at night , you set a precedent that can be hard to take back .
The world is a much smaller place now than it ’s ever been .
Information is at our fingertips whenever we want it and wherever we happen to be .
Time zones blur , allowing us to work with clients in the same city as easily as those on the other side of the world .
But we still need sleep , and we rarely get enough .
Sleep gives our brains a chance to work out problems and process the information we ’ve absorbed throughout the day .
Even if you can function on four or five hours of sleep , how much better would you function on seven or eight hours ?
Even though the 9 - to - 5 work day is history , there ’s no reason work should extend into the wee hours of the morning .
Create a daily routine #section9
It ’s not unusual for creative types to do their best work at the same time every day .
By this I mean that it ’s important to follow our own circadian rhythms .
Hemingway began writing every morning at dawn and explained his choice this way : “ There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to work and warm as you write .
You read what you have written and , as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next , you go on from there . ”
The same system often works well for designers or developers .
Do your most important work ( or the work requiring the greatest focus ) during that time when you ’re most energized and have the fewest distractions .
Use the rest of your working hours to solve secondary problems or gather information that will fuel the next productive sprint .
Make time for numero uno#section10
Whether you ’re treading water or already below the surface , making time for yourself is critical .
It ’s easy to get caught up in the demands of bosses or clients and leave precious little time for your own needs .
Spending time with family , friends , or your personal interests may provide the fulfillment you do n’t get at work .
So get out .
Go to a museum or an art gallery .
Go to the library or a concert .
Get some exercise .
Play .
Make time for what makes you happy , and guard that time fervently .
Examine your values , goals , and measures of success #section11
Know thyself , but be gentle .
What are you passionate about ?
How do you evaluate yourself against expectations placed on you by managers and clients , and the work you ’re doing ?
Are those measures grounded in reality ?
Are your personal development goals being met by the type of work you are doing ?
Are you feeling too much pressure from unrealistic demands or those that go against your values ?
What frustrates you ?
Simply connecting with things that matter to you can provide perspective .
Although burnout is a miserable experience , it can also be a great opportunity for personal growth and discovery .
Good work requires focus .
Focus might mean restricting your access to e-mail , IM , Twitter , and Facebook , or turning off your cell phone .
Modern communication conveniences provide a valuable social connection to the outside world , but they can also destroy concentration and clarity .
Change your situation # section13
Although changing careers is usually not an option , there ’s plenty you can do to make your job more engaging and fulfilling .
Change departments , learn a new skill , or simply focus more on the things you ’re good at , and that make you happy .
Offload responsibilities that are not fulfilling or that are not part of your core job function .
If you ’re a designer , focus on design , not on day - to - day accounting .
If you ’re a developer , focus on building great applications , not on client hand - holding .
If you ’re a freelancer , shake up your routine — and whenever possible , bring in additional help on the parts of projects that you do n’t enjoy or that someone else could do better .
Changing your situation could be as easy as changing desks :
If you work at home , spend more time at a local coffee shop or bookstore that has free wifi .
If you work in a more traditional office , change desks or spend time in another part of the office .
Rely on a good process # section14
The reason we have processes is so that we can focus on getting things done , not on wondering what to do next .
If you do n’t have a good work process , get one .
Talk to your peers , read up on the topic , and see what processes others use .
Experiment and find out what works for you .
If you already have a process that you think works , scrutinize it , clarify it , and simplify it as much as possible .
Educate your clients on your processes , follow them yourself , and ensure that everyone you work with understands the consequences of failing to complete deliverables or meet deadlines .
Regaining your balance # section15
When you ’re burned out , you know it .
You can feel it and taste it , but in order to get past , it you have to acknowledge it and fight to restore your internal equilibrium .
Stop , decompress , communicate , and focus .
That process often begins with a look inward to learn what gives your life balance , such as family , friends , personal interests , and hobbies — the things that counterbalance your life on the web .
Your life should be just that — a life ; if your waking hours are entirely consumed by work , or if you ’re unfocused and inattentive to your own needs , burnout will be waiting at every turn .
Now we all know that the Apple is holding special event on September 10 at Cupertino Campuses , where the next …

MCM , a writer and artist from Victoria , Canada , has released the first book of his TorrentBoy series .
' TorrentBoy : Zombie World ! ' deals with a kid named Wesley , who 's on a quest to save the world while battling zombies and giant leeches .
The book can be downloaded for free .
On first sight , Wesley – the main character in the book – is not really different from the other kids in school .
However , this quickly changes when the sewage treatment plant is in danger .
In order to protect mankind Wesley transforms into TorrentBoy , a first class super - hero .
Wesley has a talking ‘ tracker watch ’ that is able to tap into the power of TorrentSphere when needed , and transform him into TorrentBoy .
Together with a laser blaster - carrying , speech - impeded teddy bear named Crash , he defends the world against all evil , including giant leeches .
TorrentBoy Fights Giant Leeches
Although the book is n’t literally about BitTorrent , it is inspired by it says MCM .
“ The underlying concept of the TorrentSphere is that all people in the world are connected through a massive invisible network , and that the network makes us all smarter and better people .
“ It ’s BitTorrent philosophy , but very abstracted .
Then again , TorrentBoy battles giant leeches .
Take from that what you will , ” the author adds .
The book is a pleasure to read , and certainly not just for kids .
It has a Creative Commons license , which means that people are free to add , edit , remix and share the book for non-commercial use .
In fact , the author encourages readers to do so with the TorrentBoy project that was launched in addition to the book .
With the project MCM hopes to get a swarm of people involved in the TorrentBoy series .
The best ideas will get licensed , and those who help out will of course get their share of the revenue generated .
All is explained in the video at the bottom of this article .
‘ TorrentBoy : Zombie World ! ’ can be downloaded for free , but a paperback and e-book ( .epub ) version are also sold on Amazon , Barnes and Noble and other book stores .
TorrentBoy has to be on BitTorrent of course , so we ’ve uploaded a torrent to Mininova as well .
Mr. Espada has said he joined the effort because he wanted to change how Albany does business .
Indeed , shortly after taking power on Monday , Republicans enacted new rules for the Senate , including one imposing six - year term limits for the Senate ’s leaders and another equalizing distribution of the $ 85 million the Senate allocates annually for legislative earmarks .
But Mr. Espada was said to have grown frustrated about power and money .
Mr. Espada has been fined more than $ 60,000 for ignoring state law requiring disclosure of campaign contributions .
A nonprofit organization that he ran for decades , Soundview HealthCare Network , is being investigated by the attorney general on suspicion of having misappropriated funds .
And the Bronx district attorney is investigating whether he lives in the Bronx district he represents .
After he agreed earlier this year to back Mr. Smith , Mr. Espada requested perks that he believed should accompany his title as vice president of the Senate for urban policy .
He asked for the use of the Capitol office adjoining his , close to $ 100,000 for rent for his district office  more than twice the amount allotted to other senators from New York City  and a dozen extra staff members .
Mr. Aponte denied the requests .
Mr. Espada also clashed with Mr. Smith over housing legislation that the Democrats had promised tenant advocates they would pass .
For months , Mr. Espada , the chairman of the Housing Committee , had delayed introducing the legislation .
Landlords increasingly viewed him as one of their only defenders among the Democrats .
Mr. Espada sought more than $ 2 million in earmarks this year for two groups with links to Soundview .
State records indicate that the groups were created just days before Mr. Espada put in the requests , which Senate Democrats rejected in early April , saying they could not confirm that the groups were legitimate nonprofit organizations .
For example , Mr. Espada requested $ 1.3 million in grants for the Bronx Human Services Council Inc. , which registered with the state on March 26 .
The council ’s headquarters are at the same Bronx address as a clinic that is part of Soundview .
Its chairman is one of Mr. Espada ’s Senate staff members .

A photo showing Iranian clerics prominently participating in an anti-government protest speaks volumes about the new face of Iran 's opposition movement .
Clerics in robes and turbans join rallies to protest the disputed presidential election results in Iran .

In a blatant act of defiance , a group of Mullahs took to the streets of Tehran , to protest election results that returned incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power .
Whether these clerics voted for Ahmadinejad or one of the opposition candidates is unknown .
What is important here , is the decision to march against the will of Iran 's supreme leader who called the results final and declared demonstrations illegal .
In the Islamic Republic of Iran , Mullahs rule supreme .
They are the country 's conservative clerics ; the guardians of the Islamic revolution and its ideologies .
They 're loyal only to God and Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Iranian opposition supporters took to the streets in protest of their candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi 's loss in the June 12 presidential elections .
They alleged the elections were rigged .
Moussavi asked to annul the results and hold new vote .
Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the proposal , backed Ahmadinejad and called on people not to demonstrate or else face the consequences .
When the protests began , Iranian students for the most part , especially women were visible and in the lead .
Watch clerics join the protests »
Their numbers dwindled over time .
Some blame police and militia crackdown and intimidation .
Social networks swelled with amateur video showing protesters beaten or shot at .
Their screams of pain and even death were caught on tape by fellow protesters using mainly cell phone cameras .
Throughout all that , some clerics of the Islamic Republic have spoken up against the stifling of people 's right to voice their opinion and in support of new elections .
On his Web site , Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri described government efforts to crackdown on the protests as threatening the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic because it was no longer representing all the people .
Moussavi ally and former president Mohammad Khatami also said in a statement that to " protest in a civil manner ... is the definite right of the people and all must respect that . "
The graphic pictures out of Iran in the past week have shown time and again , making statements is one thing and taking to the streets is another .
Iranian opposition at the leadership level and in the streets now has new faces , made up of those who had opposing ideologies before the election .
One symbol of that has become a nightly tradition in Iran .
Secular or religious , Iranians go to their rooftops every night .. and shout out " Allahu Akbar " -- God is great -- and " down with the dictator . "

The White House now objects to the release of detainee abuse photos , an administration official says .
Obama reverses on releasing photos
In a dramatic , high - profile reversal for his young administration , President Barack Obama is seeking to block the release of 44 photographs depicting abuse of detainees in U.S. military custody in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by small number of individuals , ” the president told reporters Wednesday as he left the White House on a two - day trip to the Southwest .
Advertisement
“ In fact , ' he said , " the most direct consequence of releasing them , I believe , would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put our troops in greater danger . ”
And , he added , distribution of the photos could also have a “ chilling effect on future investigations of detainee abuse . ”
The Justice Department had already agreed to release the photos by May 28 in response to a lawsuit , but Obama is shifting course .
“ Last week , the president met with his legal team and told them that he did not feel comfortable with the release of the DOD photos because he believes their release would endanger our troops , and because he believes that the national security implications of such a release have not been fully presented to the court , ” said a White House official who asked not to be named .
“ At the end of that meeting , the president directed his counsel to object to the immediate release of the photos on those grounds , ” the official said .
Obama ’s reversal is sure to set off an outcry on the left , which has pushed the Obama administration to come clean about interrogation policies and other actions carried out by the Bush administration .
Obama endorsed such openness during the campaign – and even released memos detailing interrogation practices critics call torture .
But those “ torture memos ” gave Republicans fodder for attacks on Obama for weakening U.S. national security – and touched off a series of questions about what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi knew about waterboarding and other practices , and when .
Obama ’s move seems designed at least in part to avoid giving Republican critics new fodder for attacks – even if that means angering those on the left .
“ If it ’s true that they ’re reversing position , we find that wholly unacceptable , ” American Civil Liberties attorney Jameel Jaffer told POLITICO .
“ It ’s inconsistent with the commitment they ’ve made to the court and its inconsistent with the promise of transparency that they ’ve repeated many times both before the election and since . ”
Jaffer said the ACLU had not been officially informed of the government ’s change in stance , which he earlier called an effort to “ renege ” on the administration ’s prior promise .
Already last week , Obama was coming under pressure to squelch the photos from Sens. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , who wrote to Obama urging him to drop plans to release the photos .
The ACLU has been seeking the photos for years in a pending Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over records of alleged abuse of prisoners .
A federal appeals court ruled last year that the Bush Administration could not use the danger of retaliation against U.S. soldiers to withhold the images .
Last month , Obama administration officials said a decision was made not to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court .
Yet in his reversal Obama cited concerns about retaliation against U.S. troops as one of the main reasons .
“ The president would be the last to excuse the actions depicted in these photos .
. .
But the president strongly believes that the release of these photos , particularly at this time , would only serve the purpose of inflaming the theaters of war , jeopardizing US forces , and making our job more difficult in places like Iraq and Afghanistan , ” the White House official said .
One hurdle that could complicate the president ’s effort to reverse course is that the Justice Department sent U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Hellerstein a letter on April 23 saying that “ the government has now decided ” not to seek review of the 2nd Circuit appeals court decision by the Supreme Court .
“ The parties have reached an agreement that the Department of Defense will produce all responsive images by May 28 , 2009 , ” the letter said .
Comments that the White House made about the photos just last month could also undermine any legal attempts the administration will now pursue .
Asked at an April 23 briefing why the administration was not seeking Supreme Court review , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said , “ I know that the Department of Justice determined specifically based on the ruling that they were not likely to be successful . ”
Gibbs was also unambiguous , at that time , that the government had agreed to disclose the pictures .
“ The administration , the Pentagon , and the court entered into an agreement to release those photos , ” he said .

For the month of April , Sony ’s PS3 only sold 127,000 units for North America .
Sony ignored the poor performance completely by just concentrating in the future of PS3 .
Here ’s what Patrick Seybold , Sony ’s US comms boss said in regards to the NPD report :
“ We ’re revving up the new fiscal year with a broad tent of content and services across our platforms with envelope - pushing PS3 games like inFAMOUS , MAG , and Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves ”
“ We often hear from our customers that they ’re surprised by everything the PS3 does in addition to what they purchased the device for – including features like DLNA , free access to Wi-Fi and internet browser
In some ways , this serves as a reminder that there ’s more we can do to relay the full breadth and power of the PS3 . ”
“ We know our consumers have varying entertainment lifestyles from the Blu-ray movie fanatic to photo enthusiast , so we ’ve outlined our most aggressive marketing plans to help showcase this tremendous value proposition to all our consumers . ”
“ We ’ve got a proven history in delivering the best entertainment experience and there is no doubt the PlayStation brand is staged for another big year . ”

New house building in the US increased in May after a record low in April The US economy should emerge from recession by the late summer , according to economists from some of the country 's top banks .
The American Bankers Association 's Economic Advisory Committee has said it expects economic activity to increase by 0.5 % between July and September .
But committee head Bruce Kasman said the economy would " return to growth [ in the quarter ] but not to health " .
The bankers also said US unemployment would hit 10 % early next year .
Separately , the secretary - general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has said that economic recovery within the group 's 30 countries will begin at the end of this year .
Speaking in Mexico , Angel Gurria added that the US would be one of the first countries to come out of recession .
Housing recovery US consumer spending , which accounts for about two - thirds of economic growth in the US , should increase in the second half of the year and help to moderate lay - offs and cuts in investment spending , the Economic Advisory Committee said .
" Coupled with support from policy stimulus and an improvement in financial market conditions , these developments have made it likely that the overall economy will expand in the second half of the year , " it predicted .
Mr Kasman , chief economist for JP Morgan Chase , also said that a recovery in the housing market would be an " important contributor " to economic growth .
But he cautioned against too much optimism .
" Growth in the coming quarters is likely to gather momentum but will not prove sufficiently robust to undo much of the severe damage done to our labour markets and public finances , " he said .
This means that growth would not return to " trend pace " until the middle of 2010 , he added .
For this reason , unemployment would remain at or above 9.5 % for the whole of next year .
The current unemployment rate in the US is 9.4 % , the highest since 1983 .
Mixed messages
The US economy contracted by an annual rate of 5.7 % in the first three months of 2009 .
It has shrunk for three consecutive quarters - the first time that has happened since 1975 .
And recent figures have sent out mixed messages about the timing of any recovery .
Earlier on Tuesday , figures showed that the number of new houses being built in the US in May bounced from record lows in April .
But separate figures showed that industrial production fell by more than analysts had expected .

As someone who produces copyrighted content , I suppose I should be cheering at the Pirate Bay verdict .
Or perhaps , as someone who wants to get the latest episodes of my favourite show quickly , I should be angry about it .
That 's the trouble with the current system of distribution and copyright enforcement : it sets content producers and fans against each other .
There was a time when the system worked .
From the earliest days of cinema , a system of staggered worldwide releases of Hollywood movies developed .
It made sense : there were only a certain number of prints and it took time to ship them across the world .
Nick James , editor of the British Film Institute 's magazine Sight and Sound , told me that in the 1970s you could sometimes wait two years to see a Hollywood film in the UK .
And 30 years ago that was alright .
The markets really were separate .
How would the average person in the UK even hear about the latest movies or TV shows on the US ?
You could run a five - year - old US TV show , call it brand new and very few people would be any the wiser .
It felt natural for the same system to extend to videos and DVDs .
But it 's not alright anymore .
Here 's why : the markets for legitimate purchase are still separate , but the marketing is not .
The web is , as the name suggests , worldwide , and if you 're advertising your great new movie or TV show on the New York Times website , or Salon magazine or in Gmail banner ads , you 're advertising it to the world .
Advertisers are very good at their jobs .
They know how to tease and persuade , to push the buttons that get us to buy things ; even things that we know are bad for us .
It 's not that we 're entirely helpless in the face of advertising .
Of course it 's possible to see an ad for something you really want and still not buy it .
But we find it difficult ; that 's the whole point of advertising .
And if you 're advertising a movie or a TV show , but not giving people the opportunity to buy it legally , what do you think is going to happen ?
You 're working against yourself : with one breath saying " look at this wonderful product , do n't you want it ? " and with the next saying " you ca n't have it at any price " .
People who download illegally are n't people who hate the product .
They 're fans .
Of course there are some people who would never pay a penny for it , no matter how cheaply or easily available it was .
But there are many who , like me , just want to enjoy a TV show they 've seen advertised .
It 's time for staggered releases to end .
Every day they continue , more people , tired of seeing adverts and reviews of shows and movies they wo n't be able to buy legitimately for months or years , call up a techie friend and say " that torrenting thing , how do you do that ? "
Every day these shows and movies are n't available to buy , worldwide , on the same day , for a reasonably equivalent price , more people are finding out how to get them for nothing .
And once they 're used to doing it that way , it 's going to be harder than ever to get them back .
Dom DeLuise , the portly funnyman whose star shined in comedies such as Cannonball Run , Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles , died Monday in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 75 according to Entertainment Tonight .
While we do not know the cause of death , we do know DeLuise had battled prostate cancer in the past although he said in a Dec. 28 interview with ET that he was feeling much better after being declared cancer - free .
“ I ’m still here , I ’m 75 and I feel so blessed , ” he said .
With a large face offset by pinch - able cheeks , the affable New York - born comic plied his craft in a self - deprecating manner throughout a string of successful comedies including : The Muppet Movie , History of the World : Part I , The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , Johnny Dangerously and Robin Hood : Men in Tights .
Burt Reynolds — who starred with DeLuise — in several movies issued this statement on the passing of his long - time friend :
“ I was thinking the other day about this .
As you get older you think about this more and more , I was dreading this moment .
Dom always made everyone feel better when he was around .
I never heard him say an unkind word about anyone .
I will miss him very much , ” Reynolds told ET .
DeLuise leaves behind a wife — actress Carol Arthur — and three sons : actor , writer , director Peter DeLuise , actor David DeLuise and Michael DeLuise .
Funeral arrangements have not yet been made public .

( CNN ) --
The massive amount of garbage in the ocean likely complicates the search for the remains of an Air France flight that went missing Monday near Brazil , oceanographers who spoke with CNN said .
Earlier this week , investigators said they had located pieces of the plane in the southern Atlantic Ocean , which might have given them clues to the origin of Air France Flight 447 's crash .
But on Thursday , Brazilian officials said what they had found was nothing more than run -of - the - mill ocean trash .
This highlights a little - seen environmental problem : Scientists say the world 's oceans are increasingly filled with junk -- everything from large items like refrigerators and abandoned yachts to small stuff like plastic bottles .
Much of the ocean trash is plastic , which means it wo n't go away for hundreds of years , if ever .
And the problem has gotten so bad that soupy " garbage patches " have developed in several locations , called gyres , where ocean currents swirl .
One of them is estimated to be the size of Texas .
There are about five or six major trash - collecting gyres in the world 's oceans , with the most famous located in the Pacific Ocean about midway between North America and Asia , experts said .
Trash collects at these locations , where ocean currents swirl , and forms a gunk of small plastic pieces .
See a map of Pacific Ocean debris »
There is not a major " trash island " near the site of the Air France plane crash in the south Atlantic , oceanographers said , but splitting currents do create a smaller area for trash to congregate .
" That area [ of the crash site ] has got lots of debris that 's just out there , coming from Europe heading over the Americas , " said Curtis Ebbesmeyer , a oceanographer and author of a book called " Flatsometrics and the Floating World . "
" And it 's notoriously difficult to spot debris from the air . "
The south Atlantic near Brazil is driven by two currents , one that pushes debris to the north , along the coast of Florida , and one that would push it to the south , perhaps all the way to the tip of South America , he said .
So the plane 's wreckage could span that massive area , he said .
Most debris from the crash of Air France Flight 447 would head toward Brazil and arrive within a couple of months ; but wherever the remnants land , the plane debris would be difficult to distinguish from the mountains of trash that wash up on beaches every day , Ebbesmeyer said .
" The trouble is that there is so much debris on eastern Florida that 's from South America .
Anywhere , it 's very unlikely that anyone will recover [ the plane debris ] , " he said .
" It 's very likely that debris that would provide closure for loved ones would go in the Dumpster because [ beachgoers ] do n't know what it is . "
The search for signs of the Air France flight highlights what environmentalists say is a pressing issue for the world today :
We produce a lot of trash that biodegrades slowly , and too much of it ends up in the ocean .
Out at sea , plastics suffocate sea turtles and choke birds , which look at the bits of floating gunk as food .
Endangered sea turtles become entangled in discarded fishing line and also ingest plastic bags , like those from grocery stores , said Bamford .
" They love to eat jellyfish , and when they see a plastic bag it looks exactly like a jellyfish , basically , " she said .
Still , scientists say they know relatively little about the scope of the problem and the effects that trash has on ocean life .
Finding answers to those unknowns is among the current initiatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said Holly Bamford , director of the U.S. agency 's marine debris program .
Enough is known about ocean trash to know that it 's time to act , she said .
" It 's a global problem .
You can go do a collection almost anywhere and you 'll probably come up with a piece of debris in your sample .
The question is what all is out there and what is it doing , " she said .
" It 's something that needs to be addressed . "
About 80 percent of the trash that ends up in the ocean starts on land and is swept out to sea either from beaches or through waterways and sewer systems , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The garbage can make its way to the ocean via rivers from the very heart of a continent , Bamford said .
Once it hits the sea , ocean currents -- and to a lesser extent , wind -- determine where the trash goes .
Since the mid-1900s , people have been making plastic , which decomposes much more slowly than other materials .
International treaties ban ship captains from dumping their trash into the sea , scientists said , but the rules are not well - enforced .
Education is the key to preventing trash from ending up in the ocean in the first place , said Peter Niiler , an oceanographer and distinguished researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
Niiler said too little is known about the oceans , and there are gross misconceptions about their size .
" I think the [ idea of an ] ocean being an infinitely large thing comes from the fact that you 've never been there or you do n't have data from there .
You do n't know what 's there .
So you 're just living on the coast and you can't hardly imagine going from North America to China , " he said .
He added : " The ocean is just like land .
It 's part of our whole ecosystem of the whole earth .
We know a great deal about land but we know very little about the oceans . "
While they are n't likely to help with the plane search , volunteer groups seek to collect trash before it hits the ocean and is swept away to a garbage patch .
The Ocean Conservancy says it organizes the largest of these efforts .
Last year , 400,000 volunteers from 100 countries collected trash off of the beaches , preventing it from harming the ocean , said Tom McCann , a spokesman for the group .
" It 's entirely preventable , " he said of the problem of trash in the ocean .
" It 's something we can solve ourselves . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. credit card defaults rose to record highs in May , with a steep deterioration of Bank of America Corp ’s lending portfolio , in another sign that consumers remain under severe stress .
American Express and MasterCard credit cards are shown in Washington June 25 , 2008 .

Delinquency rates -- an indicator of future credit losses -- fell across the industry , but analysts said the decline was due to a seasonal trend , as consumers used tax refunds to pay back debts , and they expect delinquencies to go up again in coming months .
“ I find it hard to believe that it is really a trend .
You need to see stabilization in unemployment before you see anything else , ” said Chris Brendler , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus .
“ It is too early to see some kind of improvement . ”
Bank of America Corp -- the largest U.S. bank -- said its default rate , those loans the company does not expect to be paid back , soared to 12.50 percent in May from 10.47 percent in April .
The bank is paying the price of expanding rapidly in recent years and of holding one of the highest concentrations of subprime borrowers among the top card issuers , analysts said .
In addition , American Express Co , which accounts for nearly a quarter of credit and charge card sales volume in the United States , said its default rate rose to 10.4 percent from 9.90 , according to a regulatory filing based on the performance of credit card loans that were securitized .
The credit card company also holds a large exposure in California and Florida , two of the states most affected by the housing crisis and unemployment .
Citigroup -- the largest issuer of MasterCard branded credit cards -- reported credit card chargeoffs rose to 10.50 percent in May from 10.21 percent in April .
“ Chargeoffs went up to record highs , ” said Walter Todd , a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates , referring to the entire U.S. credit industry .
Credit card losses usually follow the trend of unemployment , which rose in May to a 26 - year high of 9.4 percent and is expected to peak over 10 percent by the end of 2009 .
If credit card losses across the industry surpass 10 percent this year , as analysts and bank executives expect , loan losses could top $ 70 billion .
“ Until lenders show stabilization then trend - bucking improvement over a several - month period , we remain bearish on credit card lenders -- and the U.S. consumer , ” said John Williams , an analyst at Macquarie Research .
“ We continue to believe that macro challenges and credit quality concerns will pressure U.S. card issuers over the next 12 months , ” he added .
However , some smaller credit card companies such as Capital One Financial Corp and Discover Financial Services reported defaults rates grew less than expected .
Capital
One said its credit card default rate rose to 9.41 percent from 8.56 percent , while Discover said its charge - off rate increased to 8.91 percent from 8.26 percent .
JPMorgan Chase & Co -- the second - largest U.S. bank and the biggest issuer of Visa - branded credit cards -- said its default rate rose to 8.36 percent in May from 8.07 percent in April , but it still holds the best performance among the largest credit card companies .
LOWER DELINQUENCIES
Among credit card issuers , Citigroup and American Express showed a third straight month of a decline in delinquencies in May .
While the data was encouraging , analysts said it was too early to claim victory .
“ Past May , seasonally it gets more challenging , ” said Sanjay Sakhrani , an analyst at KBW , as unemployment will keep rising and the tax refund effect will dissipate .
Credit card lenders are trying to protect themselves by tightening credit limits , raising standards and closing accounts .
They have also been slashing rewards , increasing interest rates and boosting fees to cushion against further losses .
But that could come to an end soon .
The U.S. government approved a law last month limiting credit card fees and interest rates , which is expected to tighten lending further and ultimately boost defaults as consumers find it harder to refinance their debts .
Bank of America ’s shares closed 2.8 percent lower at $ 13.33 on the New York Stock Exchange .
JPMorgan was down 3.22 percent at $ 33.99 , and Citigroup retreated 2.9 percent to $ 3.37 .
American Express also surprised investors as it sold some loans that it had already written off , reflecting a partial recovery of such losses .
Its stock ended 0.3 percent higher at $ 25.23 on the New York Stock Exchange .

“ The only answer to Pakistan ’s problems , ” he added , “ is a broad - based people ’s movement . ”
The trash movement , which calls itself Responsible Citizens , does not yet qualify as broad , but it still drew a respectable crowd on a recent Sunday , considering the heat ( above 90 degrees ) and the time ( around 4 p.m. ) .
Mr. Ahmed and his friends were doling out trash bags they had bought for the occasion .
About 40 people had gathered .
Some were wearing masks .
All were carrying shovels .
They set their sights low .
The area of operation , Ghalib Market , was modest , a quiet traffic circle in central Lahore encircled by shops , a cricket field and a mosque .
It was not one of the dirtiest parts of the city , but the group felt attached to it , as they had cleaned it in the past , and wanted to see if their actions were having any effect .
The first time they cleaned there was like raking leaves on a windy autumn day .
“ We collected , like , 30 bags , but there was no visible difference , ” Mr. Ahmed said .
But they talked with local shopkeepers , in a kind of trash outreach , asking them to walk their garbage to the trash bin .
Those connections , Mr. Ahmed said , were actually the point of the cleaning  setting an example for others to follow .
“ The major problem people have here is that there are no bins , ” said Murtaza Khwaja , a 21 - year - old medical student .

Actually , the problem was deeper .
A long - term cycle of corrupt , weak governments interrupted by military coups has caused Pakistan ’s political muscles to atrophy , leaving Pakistani society , particularly its poor , hopeless that it will ever receive the services  education , water , electricity , health  that it so desperately needs .
Two Thirds of Americans Would Refuse to Give Up iPod – Even if it Ruined Environment
June 22nd , 2009 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
An astonishing new survey has revealed that more than 60 % of Americans would refuse to stop using their iPods , even if they knew it was seriously damaging the environment .
The survey , which quizzed more than 1,000 people across the US , found that , whilst the majority of Americans are making efforts to buy greener products , most would n’t do so if it meant compromising on convenience or comfort .
Presented with a choice between comfort , convenience or the environment , 38 percent of those questioned said they ’d choose their convenience , 36 percent comfort and just 26 percent the environment .
According to market researcher Suzanne Shelton , “ Consumers do n’t want to give up the modern conveniences of life .
We ’re all basically saying , ‘ I ’ll be green as long it does n’t make me uncomfortable or inconvenienced . ' ”

In further findings , when asked , “ If you thought these things were harming the environment , which of the following would you be willing to give up ? ” well under 50 percent of those polled were prepared to give up the following items :
i Pod – 38 percent would be willing to do without it
– 38 percent would be willing to do without it Dishwasher – 35 percent
– 35 percent Microwave – 25 percent
– 25 percent Cellular phone – 21 percent
– 21 percent Air conditioning – 14 percent
– 14 percent TV – 13 percent
– 13 percent Computer – 7 percent
– 7 percent Car – 6 percent
– 6 percent None of the above – 21 percent
– 21 percent
All of the above – 6 percent
Commenting on the findings Shelton said , “ For most Americans , what once were considered conveniences have become necessities .
That means the green movement has its work cut out for it : Convenience and comfort are big barriers for consumers going green .
“ It means a lot of people simply wo n’t take on green projects , or buy a green product if they have to go to a different store to find it or if it somehow takes away from their personal comfort . ”

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
It is a sobering time for the world ’s most fragile countries — virulent economic crisis , countless natural disasters , and government collapse .
This year , we delve deeper than ever into just what went wrong — and who is to blame .
Yemen may not yet be front - page news , but it ’s being watched intently these days in capitals worldwide .
A perfect storm of state failure is now brewing there : disappearing oil and water reserves ; a mob of migrants , some allegedly with al Qaeda ties , flooding in from Somalia , the failed state next door ; and a weak government increasingly unable to keep things running .
Many worry Yemen is the next Afghanistan : a global problem wrapped in a failed state .
It ’s not just Yemen .
The financial crisis was a near - death experience for insurgency - plagued Pakistan , which remains on imf life support .
Cameroon has been rocked by economic contagion , which sparked riots , violence , and instability .
Other countries dependent on the import and export of commodities — from Nigeria to Equatorial Guinea to Bangladesh — had a similarly rough go of it last year , suffering what economist Homi Kharas calls a “ whiplash effect ” as prices spiked sharply and then plummeted .
All indications are that 2009 will bring little to no reprieve .
Instead , the global recession is sparking fears that multiple states could slip all at once into the ranks of the failing .
Now more than ever , failed - state triage could become a grim necessity for world leaders from the United Nations and World Bank to U.S. President Barack Obama ’s White House .
All of which puts a fine point on an old and uncomfortable dilemma :
Whom do you help when so many need it ?
This is a sober question for sober times , and it is the backdrop for the fifth annual Failed States Index — a collaboration between The Fund for Peace , an independent research organization , and Foreign Policy .
Using 12 indicators of state cohesion and performance , compiled through a close examination of more than 30,000 publicly available sources , we ranked 177 states in order from most to least at risk of failure .
The 60 most vulnerable states are listed in the rankings .
Figuring out which faltering states to help depends in large part on what they need .
After all , as Tolstoy might have put it , every failing state is failing in its own way .
Georgia , for example , jumped 23 places in this year ’s index due to a substantial spike in that elusive indicator , “ Invaded by Russia . ”
Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are failing because their governments are chronically weak to nonexistent ; Zimbabwe and Burma are failing because their governments are strong enough to choke the life out of their societies .
Iraq is failing , but its trajectory may be toward greater success , while Haiti is failing as well , and it is hard to imagine success around the corner .
It is also a harsh fact that a greater risk of failure is not always synonymous with greater consequences of failure .
For example , Zimbabwe ( No. 2 on the index ) is technically failing more than Iraq ( 6 ) , but the geopolitical implications of state failure in Iraq would be far greater than in Zimbabwe .
It ’s why we worry more about Pakistan ( 10 ) than Guinea ( 9 ) , and North Korea ( 17 ) more than the Ivory Coast ( 11 ) .
Then take the paradoxical case of Iran , which jumped 11 spots in the rankings this year .
With an already faulty economy , a vampire state mismanaging it further , and a global recession on top of all that , it is no surprise that Iran is faltering .
But the state is not failing — indeed , it is succeeding quite well — in one rather important respect : the pursuit of nuclear weapons .
And it is this “ success , ” more than Iran ’s myriad failings , that keeps it above the fold of other worrying news .
Answering the question of which failed states demand attention might well come down to which are deemed to pose the biggest threat to the world at large .
But even the widely presumed linkage between failing states and terrorism is less clear than many have come to assume since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks sounded the alarm about the consequences of governments not in control of their territory .
Take Somalia , once again the No. 1 failed state on this year ’s index .
A recent report by West Point ’s Combating Terrorism Center , drawing on captured al Qaeda documents , revealed that Osama bin Laden ’s outfit had an awful experience trying to operate out of Somalia , for all the same reasons that international peacekeepers found Somalia unmanageable in the 1990s : terrible infrastructure , excessive violence and criminality , and few basic services , among other factors .
In short , Somalia was too failed even for al Qaeda .
Which failed states are global security threats and which are simply tragedies for their own people ?
This is one question that will matter most this year of living dangerously , and there are others we present in the following pages :
Which countries might blow up next ?
Are there pockets of success within states of failure ?
And who ( or what ) is to blame when things go bad — corrupt leaders , dysfunctional societies , bad neighbors , a global recession , unfortunate history , or simply geography itself ?
The Failed States Index does not provide all the answers , nor does it claim to be able to .
But it is a starting point for a discussion about why states fail and what should be done about them — a discussion , sadly , that we might be having even more frequently this year .

LED Cooling Fans
.
I got a chance to visit the Computex computer show in Taipei , Taiwan .
I took some pics of the more interesting stuff I saw , and one of them was programmable cooling fans .
These would be the cooling fans you put on the back of your computer , or inside to keep air moving .
You can program them to put a message , or even run a program to display current RPMs .
Not really useful , but something you could throw into the mix when tricking out your machine .
Here is one of them showing the current RPMs
Another programmed to display a face – it is cut off because of the cycle rate difference between my camera and the fan …if you were looking at it , it would be a full face :
The big daddy was a clock that had something different on each one :

A Kansas - based church has won a fight to continue holding antigay protests in Missouri near funerals of American troops killed overseas .
The US Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up an appeal that sought the enforcement of a Missouri law regulating protests at funerals .
Groups from the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , have been demonstrating at military funerals across the country to spread the church 's message that God is punishing America by killing US soldiers for what the church says is the sin of homosexuality .
Church members near military funerals have displayed signs proclaiming : " Thank God for Dead Soldiers " and " God Blew Up the Troops . "
Concerned about the disruptive effect of such protests on the sanctity and dignity of burial ceremonies , lawmakers in Missouri passed a law banning protests at funerals .
The church went to court to block enforcement of the state law , claiming it violated the church 's free - speech right to spread its message to mourners at exactly the moment church officials believe them to be most receptive .
A federal judge refused to block enforcement of the law .
But a three - judge panel of the Eighth US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed .
The appeals court said the government had no compelling interest in protecting individuals from hearing unwanted speech in public areas such as outside a church or at a cemetery .
The panel quoted a 1999 Eighth Circuit decision : " We recognize that lines have to be drawn , and we choose to draw the line in such a way as to give the maximum possible protection to speech , which is protected by the express words of the Constitution . "
It also said : " We conclude that [ the Westboro Baptist Church ] is likely to prove any interest the state has in protecting funeral mourners from unwanted speech is outweighed by the First Amendment right to free speech . "
The appeals court did not declare the Missouri law unconstitutional .
Instead , the court action prevents enforcement of the law pending any judicial decision on the constitutionality of Missouri 's funeral protest ban .

5 Men Behind the Sun 1988 , Mou Tun Fei
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_t7ZVFUA1U
The film is a graphic depiction of the war atrocities committed by the Japanese at Unit 731 , the secret biological weapons experimentation unit of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II .
The film details the various cruel medical experiments Unit 731 inflicted upon the Chinese and Soviet prisoners at the tail - end of the war .
Because of its graphic content , the film has suffered mass controversy with censors all over the world .
It was originally banned in Australia and caused public outcry in Japan to such an extent that director T.F.
Mou even received threats on his life .
The film is extremely controversial for its use of what Mou claims to be actual autopsy footage of a young boy and also for a scene in which two cats are thrown into a room to be eaten alive by hundreds of frenzied rats ( the rats are later set ablaze ) .
4 Flower of Flesh and Blood 1985 , Hideshi Hino
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L84hGKGcbos
Flower of Flesh and Blood is said to be based on a snuff film sent to the director Hideshi Hino by a crazed fan .
In it , a man dressed as a samurai drugs a woman and proceeds to cut her apart , and finally adds her body parts to an extensive collection .
The snuff film rumour has been shown to be a contemporary legend ; the film was in fact based on a manga ( by Hideshi Hino himself , no less ) about a florist who kills women and uses their dismembered parts as the seed of his beautiful flower arrangements .
After viewing a portion of this film , actor Charlie Sheen was convinced the murder depicted was genuine and contacted the MPAA , who then contacted the FBI .
FBI agent Dan Codling informed them that the FBI and the Japanese authorities were already investigating the film makers , who were forced to prove that the special effects were indeed fake .
This is the second film is what is known as the Guinea Pig films .
3 Slaughtered Vomit Dolls 2006 , Lucifer Valentine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKJ__hFl39k&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1
The gruesome tapestry of psychological manifestations of a nineteen year old bulimic runaway stripper – turned prostitute named Angela Aberdeen ; as she descends into a hellish pit of Satanic nightmares and hallucinations .
True to its name , this film contains no shortage of actual vomiting mixed in with a healthy dose of slaughter .
To its credit , the title does not lie .
The film contains scenes of extreme violence like eyeballs being gouged out mixed in with scenes of self inflicted vomiting .
All of which is intercut with a home movie of a little girl , presumably one of the girls in the film ( or representing all of the girls in the film for that matter ) during a once happier time in her life and their ultimate loss of innocence .

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MT7lgW0HLo
August Underground ’s Mordum is an independent exploitation film released by the Pittsburgh - based film production / special effects / design company Toetag Pictures in 2003 ; like its predecessor , Mordum is a simulated snuff film , which includes graphic depictions of sexual deviancy ( including necrophilia and pedophilia ) and murder ( including a fleeting depiction of infanticide ) .
The film depicts a dysfunctional love triangle of sorts between the volatile lead from the original August Underground ( portrayed by Toetag founder Fred Vogel ) , his maniacal girlfriend and partner - in - crime Crusty ( Christie Whiles ) , and Crusty ’s animalistic brother , appropriately dubbed Maggot ( Michael Schneider ) .
As Maggot ’s mental facilities decline and competition with Vogel ’s character for the affections of Crusty mounts , tensions simmer before coming to full boil at Mordum ’s climax : Maggot manages to wrestle Vogel ’s knife out of his hands and then proceeds to …
Well – I do n’t want to spoil the ending – so go see it .

No es tiempo de especulaciones , no hay condiciones para anular las elecciones en Coahuila , indicó Gabriela León Farías , consejera presidenta del Instituto Electoral de este estado , luego de que el PAN denunciara que 20 % de los paquetes electorales presentan indicios de haber sido vulnerados .
León Farías también defendió que el PREP ( Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares ) no tuvo un comportamiento atípico , como lo señaló horas antes Lorenzo Córdova Vianello , preside del INE .
No presentó ninguna falla , el sistema funcionó muy bien , ( el problema fue que ) por diversas razones no pudimos alimentar el sistema , argumentó la consejera presidenta .
Abundó en que la tardanza se debió a que no pudieron cargar varios paquetes al sistema , ya que 494 de éstos llegaron con inconsistencias y según marca la normatividad , tuvieron que recontarlos antes de subirlos al PREP .
También reconoció que parte de la paquetería no llegó con encintados del instituto electoral , ya que en las mesas de casilla se olvidaron de hacerlo , pero justificó que éstos no presentaban alguna violación .
Se advirtió que en algunos conteos desde las casillas los ciudadanos omitieron encintar los paquetes , pero no presentaban signos de violación y de alteraciones .
Y bueno , la normatividad establece , como lo hicimos , que estos paquetes procedan al recuento total , declaró la titular del Instituto Electoral de Coahuila .
Por otra parte , en entrevista radiofónica , Guillermo Anaya , candidato del PAN al gobierno de Coahuila , aseguró que impugnará la elección y acusó a la consejera presidente de trabajar para el actual gobernador de la entidad .
Here it is , the moment many of you have been waiting for : the U.S. Trustee 's office , through its counsel Joseph J. McMahon , Jr. , has filed a motion in the SCO bankruptcy proceeding to convert the SCO 's Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 .
And I think this will be your favorite sentence : Additionally , not only is there no reasonable chance of " rehabilitation " in these cases , the Debtors have tried  and failed  to liquidate their business in chapter 11 .
So what 's left ?
Dismissal or , more logically , Chapter 7 .
SCO 's been in Chapter 11 as long as it's supposed to be , and it 's tried three times to figure out a " rehabilitation " plan , and nothing panned out .
Meanwhile , SCO reports a net negative cash flow of more than $ 3.5 million in its March 2009 report .
$ 3.5 million since the bankruptcy was first filed in September 2007 , and that represents cause to switch to Chapter 7 , the Trustee 's Office argues , due to " substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation . "
That 's $ 3.5 million that could have been paid to Novell .
I never expected SCO to be rehabilitated .
Oh. Different definition .
The Trustee 's Office means " to put back in good condition ; re-establish on a sound , firm basis . "
I mean to admit it was wrong , turn around and sin no more .
Like * that * will ever happen .
It 's conceivable SCO could come into court with a done deal , I suppose , with all their paperwork done and in order , as a counter .
With SCO , I never say never .
I 'd want to see the real buyers in the flesh , though , if I were the judge , with their right hands on their heart and their left holding their wallets up before the judge , spilling over with dollars , so to speak .
Um. Real ones .
Here is the filing : 05/05/2009 750 Motion to Convert Chapter 11 Case to a Case Under Chapter 7 .
Fee Amount $ 15 .
Filed by United States Trustee .
Hearing scheduled for 6/12/2009 at 02:00 PM at US Bankruptcy Court , 824 Market St. , 6th Fl. , Courtroom # 3 , Wilmington , Delaware .
Objections due by 5/26/2009 .
( Attachments : # 1 Notice of Motion # 2 Proposed Form of Order # 3 Certificate of Service ) ( McMahon Jr. , Joseph ) ( Entered : 05/05/2009 ) [ Update : Right on cue , SCO says it will try again , according to Tom Harvey 's report in the Salt Lake Tribune :
The timing of the filing caught SCO officers by surprise .
CEO Darl McBride had flown into Denver to attend the 10th Circuit hearing .
 We are reviewing the motion that was filed in Delaware today with counsel and will have a detailed response for the court in due course ,  McBride said in an e-mailed statement .
 We plan to oppose the motion and present our own suggested course of action to the court . 
You are surprised ?
Incidentally , going into Chapter 7 would not necessarily end the litigation .
In fact , it ca n't on its own .
It would be up to the appointed trustee to try to figure out what to do , and the trustee 's interest will not dovetail with SCO executives , I 'm guessing .
For one thing , he 'll be wanting to pay the creditors .
Like , for example , Novell .
And the trustee has no power to terminate the IBM counterclaims .
Then there is Red Hat .
They are not necessarily willing to drop their claims , since the goal is to establish that there are no legitimate claims against Linux .
As for being surprised today , I 'd point out that the SCO lawyers at least knew about this motion yesterday , as you can see for yourself by reading the Certificate of Service [ PDF ]
Plus , at the last hearing , the judge ruled that the period of exclusivity was over , and it was obvious to me , at least , that IBM , Novell and the Trustee 's attorney would argue for Chapter 7 , and it was left that if anyone wished to file such a motion , the judge would entertain it then , and it was pretty obvious that at least one of the three would do this .
So I question why , if I figured this was next , anyone at SCO would be surprised by a motion like this .
- End update . ]
And we have the motion as text for your reading pleasure , followed , after the double row of stars , by the relevant parts of the statute governing this motion , 11 U.S.C. § 1112 , which is referenced throughout : ******************************************
UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE In re
THE SCO GROUP , INC . , et al. ,
Debtors .
Chapter 11
Case Number 07-11337 ( KG )
( Jointly Administered ) Hearing Date : June 12 , 2009 at 2:00 P.M .
Objection Deadline : May 26 , 2009 MOTION OF THE UNITED STATES TRUSTEE
TO CONVERT CASES TO CASES UNDER CHAPTER 7
In support of her motion for an order converting the above - captioned cases to cases under chapter 7 , Roberta A. DeAngelis , Acting United States Trustee for Region 3 ( " U.S. Trustee " ) , by and through her counsel , and based upon information and belief , avers : PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The above - captioned cases should be converted to cases under chapter 7 because there is a " continuing loss to or diminution of the [ Debtors ' ] estate[s ] and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation " under 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) .
The Debtors are a technology " startup " venture .
Since the inception of the above - captioned cases nearly two years ago , the Debtors have continued to rapidly lose money ; by their own admission , the Debtors have had in excess of $ 3.5 million of negative cash flow post-petition .
This fact , by itself , is sufficient to establish a continuing loss to , or diminution of , the Debtors ' estates .
Additionally , there is not a reasonable likelihood that the Debtors will be rehabilitated .
On three separate occasions over the past twenty - one months , the Debtors have started sale and / or plan processes designed to liquidate and / or ( 1 ) reorganize their business .
All three of those attempts to resolve the cases failed .
Under these circumstances , this Court is obligated to either convert the Debtors ' cases to cases under chapter 7 or dismiss the cases , whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estates pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) .
The U.S. Trustee submits that conversion of the cases to cases under chapter 7 will be in the best interest of creditors and the Debtors ' estates .
INTRODUCTION 1 . Under ( i ) 28 U.S.C. § 1334 , ( ii ) ( an ) applicable order (s ) of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(a ) and ( iii ) 28 U.S.C. § 157 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) , this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the Motion .
2 . Under 28 U.S.C. § 586 , the U.S. Trustee is generally charged with monitoring the federal bankruptcy system .
See United States Trustee v. Columbia Gas Sys. , Inc. ( In re Columbia Gas Sys. , Inc. ) , 33 F.3d 294 , 295-96 ( 3d Cir. 1994 ) ( noting that U.S. Trustee has " public interest standing " under 11 U.S.C. § 307 which goes beyond mere pecuniary interest ) ; Morgenstern v. Revco D.S. , Inc. ( In re Revco D.S. , Inc. ) , 898 F.2d 498 , 500 ( 6th Cir. 1990 ) ( describing the U.S. Trustee as a " watchdog " ) . " [ I ] n any case in which the United States trustee finds material grounds for any relief under section 1112 of [ the Bankruptcy Code ] , " the U.S. Trustee is obligated to apply promptly after making that finding to the court for relief . "
28 U.S.C. § 586(a ) ( 8 ) .
3 . Under 11 U.S.C. § 307 , the U.S. Trustee has standing to be heard on this Motion .
GROUNDS / BASIS FOR RELIEF Background 4 .
On September 14 , 2007 , the Debtors filed the petitions which initiated the above - captioned cases .
( 2 ) 5 .
To date , this Court has not directed the appointment of a trustee or an examiner in the above - captioned cases .
6 . On September 18 , 2007 , the Office of the U.S. Trustee ( " OUST " ) mailed a notice to the Debtors ' top twenty unsecured creditors informing them of the meeting to form an official committee of unsecured creditors .
The scheduled date / time for the meeting was September 28 , 2007 .
As of that date , the OUST had not received sufficient expressions of interest to appoint an official committee of unsecured creditors in the above - captioned cases .
Accordingly , on September 28 , 2007 , the OUST filed a statement indicating that an official committee of unsecured creditors had not been formed .
Conversion 7 . The U.S. Trustee submits that these cases are ripe for conversion to cases under chapter 7 . 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) provides : Except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ) of this subsection , subsection ( c ) of this section , and section 1104 ( a ) ( 3 ) , on request of a party in interest , and after notice and a hearing , absent unusual circumstances specifically identified by the court that establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate , the court shall convert a case to a case under chapter 7 or dismiss a case under this chapter , whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate , if the movant establishes cause .

8 . Under 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) , the term " cause " in 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) includes " substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation . "
( 3 ) 9 . 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) indicates that , if the U.S. Trustee moves for conversion under 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) and establishes " cause " for relief , there are no " unusual circumstances " that would allow this Court to refrain from converting the above - captioned case to a case under chapter 7 . 10 .

No. 109-8 , 119 Stat. 23 ( 2005 ) , Congress eliminated this Court 's discretion that was previously reflected in the appearance of the permissive word " may " in to 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) and , through substitution of the mandatory word " shall " for " may , " directed this Court to convert or dismiss the case , " whichever is in the best interests of the creditors and the estate , " if " cause " is established .
7 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY § 1112.04 (1 ) ( 15th ed. rev. 2005 ) ( " . . . as amended in 2005 , section 1112 ( b ) circumscribes the court 's discretion by directing certain instances in which the court must , and must not , convert or dismiss the case . " ) ; cf. Association of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA , 22 F.3d 1150 , 1153 ( D.C. Cir. 1994 ) ( " The word ' shall ' generally indicates a command that admits of no discretion on the part of the person instructed to carry out the directive . " ) .
11 . The purpose of 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) is to " preserve estate assets by preventing the debtor in possession from gambling on the enterprise at the creditors ' expense when there is no hope of rehabilitation . "
In re Lizeric Realty Corp. , 188 B.R. 499 , 503 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1995 ) ( quoted in Loop Corp. v. United States Trustee ( In re Loop Corp. ) , 379 F.3d 511 , 516 ( 8th Cir. 2004 ) ) .

" Rehabilitation , " as the term is used in 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) , means " to put back in good condition ; re-establish on a sound , firm basis . "
5 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY § 1112.03 ( 2 ) ( 15th ed. 1980 ) ( quoted in In re L.S. Good & Co. , 8 B.R. 315 , 317 ( Bankr . N.D. W.Va. 1980 ) ) .
14 .
In these cases , the " continuing loss / diminution " prong of 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) is satisfied by statements in the Debtors ' most recent monthly operating reports , where SCO Operations , Inc. reports net negative cash flow of more than $ 3.5 million in its March 2009 report ( Docket Entry # 743 ) .
15 .
Additionally , not only is there no reasonable chance of " rehabilitation " in these cases , the Debtors have tried  and failed  to liquidate their business in chapter 11 .
In the fall of 2007 , the Debtors filed a motion seeking approval of emergency sale and bidding procedures and , later , the Debtors filed a copy of their proposed asset purchase agreement with York Capital Management , Inc .
The sale process with York failed to move forward .
Next , in or about February , 2008 , the Debtors proposed that Stephen Norris Capital Partners , LLC ( " SNCP " ) would fund a " 100 percent " plan that would make allowed , general unsecured claims whole .
Like the York deal , the SNCP deal never materialized .
Most recently , in January 2009 the Debtors again initiated a sale / plan process that was abandoned .
In sum , there have been three unsuccessful attempts by the Debtors over the span of nearly two years to bring these cases to closure .
16 .
Under these circumstances , and consistent with 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) , this Court is required to convert the above - captioned cases to cases under chapter 7 or dismiss the cases .
In light of the facts and circumstances of these cases , the U.S. Trustee submits that conversion of the cases to cases under chapter 7 is the appropriate course of action .
( 5 ) RESERVATION OF RIGHTS / CONCLUSION
17 . The U.S. Trustee reserves the right to amend and / or supplement this motion .
18 . The U.S. Trustee reserves the right to conduct discovery in connection with this motion .
WHEREFORE the U.S. Trustee requests that this Court issue an order converting the above - captioned cases to cases under chapter 7 .

[ Here 's the referenced statute , and I 've marked in red the parts that apply : ]
11 U.S.C. § 1112 § 1112 .
Conversion or dismissal ... ( b ) ( 1 ) Except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ) of this subsection , subsection ( c ) of this section , and section 1104 ( a ) ( 3 ) , on request of a party in interest , and after notice and a hearing , absent unusual circumstances specifically identified by the court that establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate , the court shall convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 or dismiss a case under this chapter , whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate , if the movant establishes cause .
( 2 ) The relief provided in paragraph ( 1 ) shall not be granted absent unusual circumstances specifically identified by the court that establish that such relief is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate , if the debtor or another party in interest objects and establishes that 
( A ) there is a reasonable likelihood that a plan will be confirmed within the timeframes established in sections 1121 ( e ) and 1129 ( e ) of this title , or if such sections do not apply , within a reasonable period of time ; and ( B ) the grounds for granting such relief include an act or omission of the debtor other than under paragraph ( 4 ) ( A )  ( i ) for which there exists a reasonable justification for the act or omission ; and ( ii ) that will be cured within a reasonable period of time fixed by the court .
( 3 ) The court shall commence the hearing on a motion under this subsection not later than 30 days after filing of the motion , and shall decide the motion not later than 15 days after commencement of such hearing , unless the movant expressly consents to a continuance for a specific period of time or compelling circumstances prevent the court from meeting the time limits established by this paragraph .
( 4 ) For purposes of this subsection , the term cause includes  ( A ) substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation ; ( B ) gross mismanagement of the estate ; ( C ) failure to maintain appropriate insurance that poses a risk to the estate or to the public ; ( D ) unauthorized use of cash collateral substantially harmful to 1 or more creditors ; ( E ) failure to comply with an order of the court ; ( F ) unexcused failure to satisfy timely any filing or reporting requirement established by this title or by any rule applicable to a case under this chapter ; ( G ) failure to attend the meeting of creditors convened under section 341 ( a ) or an examination ordered under rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure without good cause shown by the debtor ; ( H ) failure timely to provide information or attend meetings reasonably requested by the United States trustee ( or the bankruptcy administrator , if any ) ; ( I ) failure timely to pay taxes owed after the date of the order for relief or to file tax returns due after the date of the order for relief ; ( J ) failure to file a disclosure statement , or to file or confirm a plan , within the time fixed by this title or by order of the court ; ( K ) failure to pay any fees or charges required under chapter 123 of title 28 ; ( L ) revocation of an order of confirmation under section 1144 ; ( M ) inability to effectuate substantial consummation of a confirmed plan ; ( N ) material default by the debtor with respect to a confirmed plan ; ( O ) termination of a confirmed plan by reason of the occurrence of a condition specified in the plan ; and ( P ) failure of the debtor to pay any domestic support obligation that first becomes payable after the date of the filing of the petition ....
A standards body greenlighting cellphones for carriers has supposedly approved four new iPhone models , including a new 32 GB model as well as an unusual 4GB version .
A Canadian rumor is now said to be showing the smaller - capacity device .
The PCS Type Review Certification Board was said on Monday to have approved new 4GB , 8GB , 16GB and 32GB versions of Apple 's handsets for use with AT&T .
While most have expected a 32 GB model due to advances in technology , Engadget 's " trusted " source for the purported leak notes that the range of storage levels is unusually wide for Apple , which until now has never had more than two capacities on sale at a time .
It sold 4GB iPhones for just three months , dropping the lowest capacity in September 2007 .
The company also has a history of always upgrading the feature set of its devices with each new introduction rather than it scaling back for the sake of a new model , further casting doubt on the apparent update .
Unless the claimed certification is referring to both old and new models , however , the approval would support notions that Apple is moving capacity both upwards and downwards to catch the largest audience possible .
Analysts have called for lower - priced iPhones but have until now had little to no corroborating information other than a desire for their existence as part of a market share grab .
The news comes as a purported insider at Canadian provider Fido has leaked a roadmap slide that claims Apple is introducing a 4GB iPhone .
It would cost $ 99 on a plan , according to Boy Genius Report , but would still have the same 3G and 2 - megapixel camera .
No mention is made of GPS or Wi -Fi , however .
The device is listed as supporting " video calling " through an iChat app and is highly suspected of being a fake .

Canadian researchers have found that childhood abuse victims who later commit suicide have marked genetic differences in their brains .
The researchers from McGill University in Montreal discovered the biological effects in a study of the brains of 18 men who committed suicide and who were also abused or neglected as children .
The results were compared to the so - called normal brains of 12 men who had died suddenly from other causes , and who were not abused as children - some of this group had various psychiatric problems such as anxiety disorders .
Although the genetic sequence was identical in the suicide and non-suicide brains , there were differences in their epigenetic marking - a chemical coating influenced by environmental factors .
Changes were found in the genetic material that makes make cells function in all 18 suicide victims .
Epigenetics is the study of changes in the function of genes that do n’t involve changes in the sequences of DNA ; the DNA is inherited from our parents , it remains fixed throughout life and is identical in every part of the body .
During gestation , however , the genes in our DNA are marked by a chemical coating called DNA methylation which is quite sensitive to its environment , especially early in life .
The epigenetic marks punctuate the DNA and program it to express the right genes at the appropriate time and place .
The researchers examined a set of genes that code for rRNA , a basic component of the machinery that creates protein in cells .
Protein synthesis is critical for learning , memory and the building of new connections in the brain ; it can affect decision - making and other behaviour .
The scientists found that rRNA can be regulated epigenetically .
Lead researcher Professor Moshe Szyf says the changes involved the methylation process which turns genes on and off and the findings could help select people at high risk of suicide , and treat them to prevent future suicides .
The researchers say neglect and abuse can have biological effects which perpetuates unhealthy behaviours through the generations .
Professor Szyf from McGill ’s Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics , says it remains to be seen whether scientists can detect similar changes in blood DNA , which could lead to diagnostic tests - then whether interventions could erase these differences in epigenetic markings .
Experts say both drugs and psychotherapy may act to reverse some of these changes .
Previous research by the team in laboratory rats found that simple maternal behaviour during early childhood has a profound effect on genes and behaviour in ways that are sustained throughout life and parental abuse and neglect can affect the brains and behaviour of offspring .
The research is published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE .
In ruling that a justice on West Virginia ’s highest court should have recused himself from a case involving a campaign benefactor , the U.S. Supreme Court has righted an egregious wrong .
More important , the 5 - 4 decision will encourage judges to avoid both the appearance and the reality of conflicts of interest .
Monday ’s decision involved a nightmare scenario for those who believe that courts should be impartial .
In 2002 , a jury concluded that the A.T. Massey Coal Co. had driven a competitor into bankruptcy by engaging in fraudulent business practices , and it ordered Massey to pay $ 50 million in damages .
Don L. Blankenship , Massey ’s chief executive , then spent $ 3 million to oppose the reelection of Warren McGraw , a justice on the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals .
McGraw was defeated in 2004 , and the man who took his seat was Brent Benjamin .
When Massey ’s appeal reached the state ’s high court , Benjamin was part of a 3 - 2 decision overturning the verdict against the company .
Two other justices had recused themselves , one because he had criticized Blankenship ’s involvement in the 2004 election , the other because he had vacationed with Blankenship on the French Riviera .
But Benjamin refused to withdraw despite his obvious obligation to Massey ’s CEO -- though Blankenship had only given $ 1,000 to Benjamin ’s campaign , he spent enormous sums on separate efforts to defeat McGraw .
Benjamin ’s refusal , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority , violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment because “ the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decision maker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable . ”
Advertisement
That language comes from a 1975 Supreme Court decision involving the suspension of a medical license .
In applying it to the relationship between a judge and a campaign benefactor , the court is breaking new ground .
But Kennedy ’s “ probability of actual bias ” test would seem to apply not only to elections but to other potential conflicts -- for example , when a sitting judge is wined , dined or lavished with gifts by a litigant .
Oddly , Kennedy ’s opinion minimizes its own importance , stressing that its rule would “ be confined to rare instances . ”
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , writing for the dissenters , had the better of this argument when he wrote that Kennedy ’s claim of rare application of the new rule is “ so much whistling past the graveyard . ”
Roberts is right that the new test will sweep widely .
He ’s wrong to bewail a decision that will force judges , including members of his own court , to take apparent conflicts of interest more seriously .
Obama : immigration overhaul is essential
June 22 , 2009
President Barack Obama said Friday he is committed to a comprehensive immigration overhaul that includes a way for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens .
Obama is hosting a small group of senators
Obama is hosting a small group of senators and House members at the White House next Thursday to discuss how to move the stalled issue forward , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
People who disagree with the president 's positions on immigration reform are among those being invited , he said .
" We know the votes are n't there right now , " Gibbs said , adding that one way to try to change that is to talk about legislative approaches different from previous proposals .
Obama told the Esperanza National Hispanic Prayer Breakfast and Conference that U.S. borders must be strengthened to thwart illegal immigration .
But he also supports giving the millions of people now in the U.S. illegally the chance to become citizens .
He said they must pay a fine and taxes , learn English and " go to the back of the line " of people trying to enter the United States from their home country .
" That is the fair , practical , and promising way forward , and that 's what I 'm committed to passing as president of the United States , " Obama said .
He added : " The American people believe in immigration , but they also believe that we can't tolerate a situation where people come to the United States in violation of the law , nor can we tolerate employers who exploit undocumented workers in order to drive down wages . "

FP - Syd # 16 .
On Thursday June 18th we held the 16th meeting of FP - Syd , the Sydney Functional Programming group .
The meeting was held at Google 's Sydney offices and we had about 25 people attending to hear our two presentations .
This month we tried something a little different , 5 minute lightning talks .
We had four lightning presenters :
Jeremy Apthorp , " Closures in C " - Jeremy explained how the Clang frontend for LLVM had added lexical closures to the C programming language .

Jeeva Suresh , " Functional Programming Warps your mind - Quantified " - Jeeva quantified exactly how programming in functional languages changes a programmer 's approach when programming in other languages .
- Jeeva quantified exactly how programming in functional languages changes a programmer 's approach when programming in other languages .
Mark Bradley , " Cycling Josephus for Speed " - Mark show how a naive approach to the Josephus Problem in Haskell would , for some example parameters , exhaust all memory .
Mark showed a better solution that satisfied the problem but still consumed a large amount of memory .
Interestingly , Benjamin Johnston posted a solution to this problem in SWI Prolog that performed very well in comparison to the Haskell version .

Ben Lippmeier , " The Poisoning Problem " - Ben showed us an example of the poisoning problem which had cropped up in his DDC compiler where a value might need to be mutable or immutable depending on the value of an if statement .
Interestingly , none of the presenters managed to stay within their allotted 5 minutes but the time limits were not enforced .
Our main speaker of the evening was Eric Willigers who gave us an excellent introduction to the Clojure language , a LISP like language for the Java Virtual Machine .
Eric started with the main data structures ; lists , vectors , maps and sets , moved on to functions and macros before explaining Clojure 's concurrency primitives .
All in all this was another most inspiring and enjoyable meeting .
Thanks to all our speakers as well as Shane Stephens and Google for providing the venue .

本編
He is charged with accessing and uploading child - abuse material after he published , on a video - sharing site , a video of a man swinging a baby around like a rag doll .
He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years ' imprisonment for each of the two charges .
Illingworth 's lawyer , Michael Byrne , QC , has worked on some of the biggest criminal cases recently , including as the defence lawyer in the manslaughter case against former Bundaberg surgeon Jayant Patel .
He says he will argue that the video is not child - abuse material but " a training film for a Russian circus family " .
Illingworth published the three - minute clip on Liveleak after obtaining it from YouTube , but had no involvement in the creation of the video , which has been published widely across the internet and shown on Australian and US TV news shows .
The clip can still be found online and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times .
Australians who simply view the video can be charged with child - abuse offences and face a maximum of 10 years in prison .
Byrne said it was unusual for a case such as this to involve silks but he did not believe it was excessive " when he 's facing charges of this sort " .
He said he was " surprised they [ police ] charged in the first place " , as the video was " certainly not your run - of - the - mill child pornography " .
" Our argument is that this is certainly not what the legislation was aimed at .
It was aimed at the sexual abuse of children , " he said .
" This seems to be a training film for a Russian circus family . "
At the committal hearing the magistrate will decide whether there is enough evidence for a jury to convict Illingworth at a trial .
It is understood the defence will present other examples of Russian circus family clips , showing , for instance , the practice of strapping weights to the ankles and wrists of toddlers to make them stronger .
If the magistrate does not agree with Byrne 's assertion that the clip is not child abuse , the case will most likely be fought in the District Court .
Illingworth said today he had already spent $ 12,300 on legal fees trying to clear his name and had been admitted to hospital four times due to the stress of the case .
He said he had not been on medication before but was now taking valium and blood - pressure medication .
Asked why he hired a high - profile silk , he said Byrne 's name " carries a bit of weight " and " when you 've got something like this facing you , you 've got to have the best " .
A conviction against Illingworth would widen the definition of what constitutes child - abuse material , and would have an impact on all Australian web users , Byrne said .
The comments echoed similar statements earlier this year by Illingworth 's solicitor , Chelsea Emery of Ryan and Bosccher Lawyers , who said that , if the case went ahead , every Australian who surfs the net could be vulnerable to police prosecution .
" Who made the decision to prosecute a man with child - abuse - related charges for sharing a file he did not create , of images not filmed in Australia , taken from a foreign website ? "
Emery asked .
Queensland Police 's brief of evidence centres on a witness statement from Susan Cadzow , specialist pediatrician at Royal Brisbane Children 's Hospital .
The footage , viewed by Cadzow , shows an adult male vigorously swinging a baby by the arms but , at the end of the clip , the baby is shown laughing and smiling .
Cadzow thought it represented child abuse .
" The child 's demeanour at the end of the video would seemingly suggest that no significant injury has occurred .
However , it does not exclude the presence of a [ hidden ] injury , " Cadzow said in her statement .
Twitter is one of the best content marketing tools .
In fact it is the only social media network that does n’t care whether you are a brand or a human being .
While Facebook and Instagram are getting increasingly monetized through limiting businesses ’ channels , everyone can still generate free organic visibility on Twitter .
One of the most important steps in turning Twitter into an effective traffic - generating channel is making the sharing process “ smooth ” – and a good Twitter button inviting nicely to spread the word can be highly effective .
Twitter Buttons That Encourage Readers to Tweet Your Posts
WordPress Plugins
If your site runs on WordPress , you have a huge selection of sharing plugins that all support Twitter .
This includes the official Twitter plugin that allows to add a Tweet button to each individual post by including the shortcode in the post editor .
It is a fairly popular WordPress plugin that lets users easily Tweet each post of the blog .
It works like any social sharing button that allows to tweet a link with two clicks .
Apart from basic tweeting functionality , it allows you to add a follow button , embed tweets easily , tie your blog to Twitter analytics for more insights .
Another popular social media sharing plugin is Social Warfare that also includes support for Facebook , Linkedin , Mix and Pinterest .
The plugin offers smooth integration and a social media count option that would show how many times an article has been shared on social media so far .
Thanks to the lazy - loading functionality , the buttons do n’t slow your site down .
There ’s also an option to create “ floating buttons ” that would remain on the screen even when a reader scrolls down to read your article further .
You can also create different rules for different types of your pages ( home page , post , page , categories , etc . )
There are also plenty of Social Warfare alternatives which may work even better for you .
Create the Button Yourself :
If you do n’t like installing and using plugins , or if your site is not on WordPress , there ’s an option to generate the code manually , to paste it anywhere you want the URL shared .
All you need is to follow these steps :
Go to publish.
twitter.com and select “ Twitter buttons ”
Click “ Share buttons ”
Optionally , use customization options to include any hashtag or your own Twitter name into each tweets originating from your site :
Grab the code and paste it anywhere inside your site template where you want the button to appear :
Mind that the button will include the URL of the page it is currently located on .
For tech - savier website owners , Twitter offers more options to integrate the Tweet button inside their pages .
Create “ Click - to - Tweet ” Buttons
A click - to - tweet button is an in - line button that allows readers to tweet a specific quote from your article .
They are highly engaging ( if you do your job picking a great quote to tweet ) and can help your article get tweeted more .
Here ’s a click - to - tweet button in action :
There are various ways to add a click - to - tweet option inside your content .
You can use a plugin that adds an option inside your editor and allows you to add a new block with click - to - tweet call - to - action .
The plugin lets you add a click - to - tweet section through a shortcode which means you have a full flexibility as to where you want those CTAs to appear :
The plugin also offers a few cool settings allowing you to customize the look and feel of those buttons .
Another option is to use Click - to - Tweet generator which is a good workaround if you do n’t like installing any plugins .
It is very easy to use the generator but the downside is that in case the site stops working , so will your “ click to tweet ” buttons .
No matter which method you choose , do n’t forget to make the most of your tweeted quotes :
Only use them for compelling sentences , stats or takeaways .
Include your ( or an author ’s )
Twitter handle inside the tweetable quote to tag them in each tweet .
Conclusion
Your readers may be willing to share your awesome content on Twitter .
All you need to do is to make it easy and fast for them to tweet your URLs .
Do n’t underestimate the power of a well - integrated call - to - action : Unless you urge your readers to , they may totally overlook the possibility of including your content on their Twitter feeds .
Now imagine if those readers of yours have a vast and / or well - engaged following on Twitter .
Your content will be tweeted and retweeted even more !
The simple action of adding a tweeting option may have a great marketing potential .
The results could be great , especially given this is a low - effort initiative .
Do n’t be afraid to combine a few options .
Even if you have a standard sharing button , adding an eye - catching click - to - tweet CTA will not hurt .
Good luck !

Incredibly , the blue and the green spirals are the same color .
From the article :
The orange stripes go through the “ green ” spiral but not the “ blue ” one .
So without us even knowing it , our brains compare that spiral to the orange stripes , forcing it to think the spiral is green .
The magenta stripes make the other part of the spiral look blue , even though they are exactly the same color .

Toby as incredibly stupid but I think he is possibly the most intelligent animal I have ever met .
If I could do nothing but sleep all day and have someone feed me and clean up my shit I would take full advantage of it too .
I quite like dogs , if I was going to have a pet it would be a dog .
Not one like Toby though .
I pretended to like Toby for his owners sake but everytime I put on a jacket and found it covered in an inch of hair , I would plot ways to kill and bury him in the backyard .
Nobody would have found him as noone was brave enough to venture into the backyard due to the 200 kilo dog turds hidden every few feet beneath the knee height grass .

Toby turd weighs upwards of 200 kilos and , once dried , can be hollowed out and used as a garden shed .
If Toby was replaced with a stuffed version it would be several weeks before anyone was aware ... and only then by the absence of new 200 kilo turds on the lawn .
Due to not having the time for hygiene , Toby 's aroma has been known to peel veneer .
If the hair that Toby sheds in a single day was collected , it would provide enough filling for two hundred and eighty sofa cusions .
If an entire week of hair was collected and spun , it would provide enough yarn to knit a beanie that would fit Thomas ' head .
Below is the amount of hair collected from a single square metre of floor after Toby walked past .

Tricks that Toby can do :
A day in the life of Toby :
8.00 am Sleeping .
9.00 am Moves hind leg twenty four centimetres and head six .
10.00 am Moves back to original position .
11.00 am Signs of life noticed .
11.10 am Signs of life no longer visible .
12.00 pm Sleeping .
1.00 pm Sleeping .
1.40 pm
An unexpected moment of alertness as Toby mistakes the sound of a plastic wrapper being put in the bin for that of a packet of crisps being opened .
1.50 pm
As he is up anyway , Toby decides to take one of his 200 kilo craps on the lawn .
2.00 pm
After the effort of getting up and taking a crap , Toby is too tuckered to make it the extra ten metres back to bed and takes a quick nap on his blanky .
3.00 pm Sleeping .
4.00 pm Sleeping .
5.00 pm Sleeping
6.00 pm Dinner time .
Toby has never tasted dog food and a four course meal is lovingly prepared for him each night by his personal chef .
7.00 pm Tuckered out after the effort of chewing and swallowing .
8.00 pm
Having gained the energy to walk the ten metres to his bedroom by taking a nap , Toby goes to bed to have a nap .
9.00 pm Sleeping .
I ’m sure that this is oldish news but I found it pretty amazing all the same .
According to Internet Evolution , using data accumulated from Bear Sterns Co , comScore , Credit Suisse and Google itself , the search giant will spend more than $ 2 million daily to support the over 375 million expected visitors to YouTube for the year 2009 .
Now , Google does not disclose sales figures by division , so there is no definitive revenue number for YouTube .
The range of estimates from financial analysts stretches from a low of $ 90 million ( Bear Stearns ) to a high of $ 240 million ( Credit Suisse ) .
All the numbers are well below the estimated maximum of $ 753 million Google is spending annually , based on our calculations .
So , depending on whose version of revenues you accept , Google is losing anywhere from $ 513 million to $ 663 million annually on YouTube , or anywhere from $ 1.4 million to as much as $ 1.65 million every day ( see chart below ) .
As David Silversmith points out in the post Google is paying you to watch all those videos in exchange for putting up with ads that are n’t even coming close to help pay the bills .
Bandwidth costs alone for Google are estimated to be at a minimum of $ 1 million per day in order to serve up all those videos .
When it comes to storing all that prime video footage the company is spending $ 36,000 per day with Credit Suisse estimating that YouTube is currently storing at least 5 petabytes of video .
All I can say is – Ouch !
Deepak Chopra calls Limbaugh “ an icon of anti-morality ”
The bad news is that newspapers are dying and comic strips are fading into history .
The good news is that the Huffington Post is guaranteed to make you laugh every day .
For example , here ’s how New Age guru Deepak Chopra opened his article about Rush Limbaugh yesterday .
“ When Michael Steele , the hapless chairman of the Republican Party , lost his bearings and called Rush Limbaugh ’s style ugly and incendiary , everyone knew it was the truth , ” the subcontinental sahib said .
“ But it was a perfect example of an inconvenient truth .
The right wing has long used ugly , incendiary speech the way baseball players use steroids : to artificially pump themselves up .
Limbaugh has taken to saying that he wants Obama ’s policies to fail because they spell the end of an America based on personal freedom .
This is n’t just a grotesque exaggeration ; it disguises the very thing the right wing has been doing when it curtailed civil liberties in the name of national security . ”
Calm down .
Take a deep breath .
The left wing loonies always say things like this .
Problem is , they ca n’t come up with a single example of “ curtailed civil liberties ” that supposedly occurred during the Bush years .
Now , let ’s move on to Chopra .
As your grandmother always used to say , just consider the source .
This guy ’s made a fortune by writing fifty books about New Age nonsense .
Hey , maybe that could be the name of his next book .
“ New Age Nonsense from best - selling author Deepak Chopra .
Coming soon to a Barnes & Noble near you .
Do n’t miss this insightful exploration of mind , body , and how to pick a reader ’s pocket for $ 21.95 . ”
Hey , Deepak !
Do n’t forget to mention us in the forward .
What is it good for strokeText.js is an unobtrusive javascript library working in all the major browsers - Mozilla Firefox 1.5+ , Opera 9 + , Safari and IE6 +.
The library provides cross API text stroking capability for Canvas and VML .
The ( built in ) sans - serif font is also adapted for SVG to ensure an identical representation .
strokeText.js is not a standalone application .
It act's as an expansion to support core text stroke capability and has to be accessed via API , which is different for Canvas and VML .
The library is based on cvi_text_lib.js and was original made for the CVI - Projects but because of the universal nature of this library ( every software project using canvas , vml or svg can benefit from it ) it seems to be fair to release it as strokeText .js to the open source community .

Harder puzzles , please : Meister Sudoku brings more difficult Sudoku to Germany , Switzerland and Austria
The trend towards harder Sudoku puzzles continues : A new magazine released in Germany , Switzerland and Austria by Rätsel Agentur Schweiz joined other publications around the world focusing on hard level logic puzzles .
Titled Meister Sudoku , the 52 page monthly magazine contains 121 Classic Sudoku , Diagonal Sudoku , Sum Sudoku , Irregular Sudoku , OddEven Sudoku and Mega Sudoku puzzles in hard and very hard difficulty levels .
As previously published by Conceptis , the trend towards more difficult Sudoku began in Japan about 2 years ago where some hard and very hard books were becoming more successful than others .
This trend spread to some countries in Europe , including Rätsel Agentur ’s successful Kniffel Sudoku , and now Meister Sudoku containing even harder puzzles is being published as a result .
" I feel this trend will continue even further " says Dave Green , president of Conceptis , " as more puzzle fans become proficient with Sudoku and start looking for harder challenges to keep their brains stimulated " .
A different approach
In Meister Sudoku , Rätsel Agentur took a different page lay - out approach .
Instead of having all puzzles in the same grid size , each page contains one very hard puzzle in a large grid and two hard puzzles in smaller grids which are similar in size to what we usually see in newspapers .
This unique layout ( see picture above ) enables Rätsel Agentur to pack 50 percent more puzzles in the magazine as most publishers place only 2 puzzles on each page .
Stefan Haller , graphic designer of Raetsel Agentur says the company has launched Meister Sudoku because hard puzzles are getting more and more ‎popular .
" The idea was to give the space and attention to the very ‎hard Sudoku " , explains Haller , " while including the less difficult puzzles in a size people are familiar with from their experience with ‎newspapers . "

The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has been in the news a lot lately .
At the G - 20 Summit on April 1 , the leaders of the world 's largest countries agreed to loan it hundreds of billions of dollars to be loaned to needy countries .
Then , on April 21 , the IMF issued an updated World Economic Outlook which predicted negative growth for the world in 2009 and a modest recovery beginning in 2010 .
But their forecast for the United States was not so positive .
They predicted that the United States economy will have zero growth in 2010 , despite President Obama 's stimulus package .
In fact , they predicted that U.S. unemployment will climb , that year , to 10.1 % .
The IMF also estimated that American foreign debt is now in the process of doubling from 4.5 % of world GDP in 2007 to 9 % of world GDP in 2009 , and they saw a pretty good chance that the continuing U.S. trade deficits would cause a dollar collapse .
They wrote :
The U.S. net external position [ foreign debt ] will also continue to deteriorate , as U.S. external borrowing needs remain substantial ...
Thus , concerns about global imbalances have not gone away .
The financing of current account deficits [ trade deficits ] , particularly in the United States , may still be problematic in the coming years .
If the attractiveness of U.S. assets were to decline , for example , because foreigners became concerned that higher government financing needs would push up U.S. long - term bond yields , foreign investors might reduce their U.S. exposure , leading to an abrupt depreciation of the dollar [ dollar crash ] .
( p. 38 )
IMF Ignored Own Role in Causing Recession
The new IMF report argued that poor risk management by financial companies caused the great recession , intoning that " a central role in the current crisis has been played by the failure of risk management in financial institutions and weakness in financial supervision and regulation . "
They noted that the failure at risk management is linked to " global imbalances " [ imbalanced trade ] across countries :
Global imbalances were an integral part of the global pattern of low interest rates and large capital inflows into U.S. and European banks , which in turn fostered a buildup of leverage , a search for yield , and the creation of riskier assets and house price bubbles in the United States and some other advanced economies . " ( p. 36 )
If they were being honest , the IMF would have pointed out that they , themselves , caused the great recession when they failed to enforce Article IV of their Articles of Agreement which required that countries " avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members . "
These currency manipulations let the Asian governments practice mercantilism ( the strategy of maximizing exports and minimizing imports ) , which , in the short - run , caused financial bubbles in the trade - deficit countries and , in the long - run , destroyed the conditions necessary for growing world trade .
Competent economists realized that imbalanced trade was taking the world economy toward disaster .
Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser have long been predicting the financial crisis that the world is now going through .
They knew that the American consumer could not continue to pile up debt .
And Richard Duncan predicted the same in his 2003 book ( which he revised in 2005 ) , The Dollar Crisis : Causes Consequences and Cures .
In fact , Duncan even warned that the global imbalances would cause a great depression that would be the biggest economic story of the 21st century .
The Solution is Balanced Trade
So what was the IMF 's solution to a great recession caused by trade imbalances ?
The IMF recognized that an end to the major trade imbalances was a critical part of its " benign " scenario for future world growth ( p. 32 ) .
But instead of recommending actions to balance trade , they recommended that the world 's governments increase their loans to bankers , the same loans that have been failing to make a dent in the great recession since October 2008 when the United States Congress passed the $ 700 billion TARP bill and the Federal Reserve and Treasury started pouring long - term loans down the black holes of AIG , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac .
Essentially , their self - serving recommendation was that banks get more loans from governments , with the most deserving bank of all being the IMF itself .
There is an alternative .
During WW II John Maynard Keynes , tried to set up an international system that would have kept trade in balance .
But instead we got the IMF , World Bank and the WTO .
Keynes ' system was based upon balanced trade , not free trade .
He understood that a world system which permitted mercantilism was not sustainable .
He would require that trade surplus countries take down their trade barriers and stimulate their economies and would let trade deficit countries limit their imports and subsidize their exports .
Maybe it's not yet too late to adopt Keynes ' proposal .
As the new loans to the IMF demonstrate , we live in an age in which incompetence is not only tolerated but rewarded .
All of the post - WW II international institutions have ignored Keynes ' views on balanced trade .
All of the America 's post -WW II administrations were saturated with " free trade " ideologues who overlooked the flight of industry overseas , first to Japan , then China , and now India and other countries , which displaced millions of U.S. industrial workers , caused wages to stagnate , worsened the distribution of income and caused one economic bubble after another .
Even now Washington wo n't take action to bring trade into reasonable balance .
Last year ( 2008 ) , the U.S. trade deficit was $ 692 billion , about 5 % of our GDP .
It would employ about seven million industrial workers to produce that amount of goods .
Instead Washington tried to pump up the economy without fixing its trade deficit leak , taking out huge loans that will have to be repaid by our children .
The United States is in a great recession with no end in sight .
Our failure to deal with our trade deficits threatens a dollar collapse .
Yet still , the free trade ideologues at the international institutions and in Washington are unwilling to tackle the underlying problem .
At this hour , we know two things for sure : A. ) Shaquille O’Neal has been traded to the Cavs ; B. )
Shaq loves giving himself nicknames .
That ’s why we wanted to welcome the Big Fella with open arms and 20 Cleveland - inspired nickname suggestions .
Anything to make Cleveland feel like home for the three - time NBA Finals MVP .
The Remake on the Lake – There ’s little doubt that Shaq will pledge to bring a championship back to the Mistake on the Lake , just like he pledged to when he arrived in Miami .
Cav-a - Shaq –
This one might turn a phrase with negative memories ( “ Hack - a - Shaq ” ) into something more pleasant .
LeBrawn – LeBron James is big , but No. 23 ’s only medium sized compared to the giant - sized No. 34 .
The Twibe – A fusion of the hometown Tribe and The_Real_Shaq ‘s Twitter obsession .
Brad Daughterneze &
Scary Larry Nance – Cleveland saw some good big men back in the day , but they ’ve never seen anything like the Big Fella .
Zone Thugs - N - Harmony –
The only way you are going to stop a revitalized Shaq in Cleveland is with a lot of zone and a full assortment of fouls .
Shaquillbasa– Kielbasa is one of the most popular foods around town , and it would n’t surprise us to see this moniker pop up on a few menus .
Chief Shaq Fu – Chief Wahoo gets a modern - day update , and named after one of the worst rap acts in history ( sorry , big guy ) .
Basketball Jim Brown –
Ain’t nobody bullied Cleveland opponents like Jim Brown did during his prime until , well , now .
Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Wall of Fame – Try to take it to the hole on the Diesel .
Just try it .
Especially with LeBron as his Swat Team partner .
Bartles ( and James ) - The best duo from the 80s not named Hall and Oates , Magic and Kareem , Montana and Rice or Crockett and Tubbs reborn .
The Kardiac Big – Paying homage to the Browns team that came the closest to beating the ’ 72 Dolphins , aka the Kardiac Kids .
Zydrunas Ilswatskus – The Big Aristotle is n’t the defensive force he used to be , but he still loves to sit back in the cut and send balls flying into the stands .
Shaqer Heights –
That place ai n’t called Shaker Heights any more .
Get out the spray paint and change the signs , Clevelanders .
Hot Bod –
If skinny - ass , underachieving John “ Hot Rod ” Williams gets to be Hot Rod , then Mr. O’Neal gets to be Hot Bod .
Only fair .
The Dawg Mound – Hey , in Cleveland both the size of the dog in the fight and the size of the fight in the dog matter .
Cavalanche –
Is exactly what ’s going to hit the Eastern Conference later this year .
Ca n’t you see him running down the court making that shivering face he makes ?
The Big O’Hio – Might as well start taking bets on how long it will take Shaq to give himself this nickname .
Gonna happen .
Dark Price –
He will have to really , really , REALLY work on his free - throw shooting , but we can see him going here , too .

BEIJING , May 6 ( Xinhua ) -- China said Wednesday that a U.S. Navy surveillance ship , which conducted activity in China 's exclusive economic zone in the Yellow Sea , violated international and Chinese laws .
" The fact is that the USNS Victorious conducted activities in China 's exclusive economic zone in the Yellow Sea without China 's permission .
China has expressed concern over this issue , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a statement .
" We demand that the United States take effective measures to prevent similar acts from happening , " Ma said .
Ma 's comments came in response to a question concerning a Pentagon spokesman 's remarks Tuesday that Chinese fishing vessels " harassed " the USNS Victorious in international waters in the Yellow Sea last Friday .
" The Chinese government always handles foreign vessels ' activities in China 's exclusive economic zones strictly in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , the Law on the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf of the People 's Republic of China , and the Regulations of the People 's Republic of China on the Management of Foreign - related Marine Scientific Research , " said Ma .
Why is the issue of sexual orientation so explosive that the very act of saying the word " gay " or " lesbian " is sometimes against the rules ?
Bioware found itself on the wrong end of this controversy when a community manager gracelessly began locking threads that discussed the issue , and then claimed that there simply were no gay or lesbian characters in Star Wars .
Maybe those words do n't exist in galaxies far , far , away , but the characters often do : Bioware themselves created a game with a character who laid down with another woman as with a man .
Sony was a part of a similar controversy after the words " gay " and " Jew " were edited out of Home , the company 's social online service for PS3 owners .
And Microsoft made headlines when the company banned a player who self - identified as a lesbian , claiming any notice of sexual orientation was against the terms of service .
In some ways it 's unfair to take the world of gaming to task for its immature handling of gay and lesbian issues .
After all , it 's hard to find a game that takes any kind of relationship seriously .
This is an art form that knows how to show two people killing each other nearly perfectly , but seems to turn into a bunch of fifth - graders when dealing with a kiss , much less when that kiss is between two men or two women .
It 's clear that something has to give , although companies only seem to pay attention after receiving the wrong kind of attention for their policies .
This is for your own good
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation contacted EA over the Bioware issue , and received an e-mail and phone call from the Vice - President of EA .
His defense of the actions is interesting , and it highlights the problem even as it shows how sincere EA is in its efforts to " fix " it .
" Filtering the words ' gay ' and ' lesbian ' was clearly a mistake ; but one made with the intention of providing a civil atmosphere for players — certainly including gay and lesbian players , " EA wrote .
" I hope that you and everyone associated with GLAAD understand that this was a mistake based on a sincere effort to filter hateful language off of our web site , and not to discriminate against anyone in the player community . "
Taking away the very words used to discuss the issue would certainly lead to less discrimination , as it just pretends that gay and lesbian players do n't exist .
If we do n't talk about the problem , if we take away the ability to even say the word " gay , " we 've very efficiently brushed the issued under the carpet .
We 've shoved gay players back into the closet , and installed a door with no key .
Does anyone really believe that the word " lesbian " is hate - speech ?
What does who you sleep with have to do with your gaming , anyway ?
There is a nasty counter - argument that one often sees in this discussion : why not just keep sexual politics out of the world of gaming ?
Taking away the very words used to discuss the issue would certainly lead to less discrimination , as it just pretends that gay and lesbian players do n't exist .
" I feel that a lot of ' straight ' people take for granted that everyone around them is also straight .
They just assume that everyone feels the same way and enjoys the same things they do , " Flynn De Marco , the Editor in Chief of GayGamer , told Ars .
" This is clearly not the case .
Being able to identify as gay or lesbian in an online gaming perspective has its positives and negatives .
The negatives being obvious in that they face endless harassment .
The positives are that maybe you can connect and play with someone else without having to listen to a litany of gay jokes and ' fag ' insults , " he explained .
" I would prefer to play with people of a like mindset as me , gay or straight .
Would n't you ? "
There is also the subtle change in context that happens when you censor a word : it risks creating the impression that the very act of being who you are in the game constitutes a threat to the community .
The attitude behind the censorship seems to be that gamers who are n't straight need to sit down and shut up about it , but of course this is for their own protection .
" I think that in one way [ gaming companies ] are trying to avoid any controversy or use of the words as derogatory , " De Marco noted .
" On the other hand I think it shows an extreme short sighted - ness and a bit of ignorance as to who some of their customers or potential customers may be .
Accidentally repressing GLBT visibility in forums , even with good intentions , only makes it safer and more acceptable to use hate speech .
Visibility is key to equality . "
Does gay and lesbian content need to be disclosed ?
With same - sex marriage being a hot - button issue in the US at the moment — and some groups claiming that same - sex marriage could hurt the American family — what would gay and lesbian content do to the rating of a game ?
We reached out to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board and asked if game ratings differentiated between different kinds of sexual content .
" We 've encountered the issue of same - sex content before — the boy - boy kiss in Bully being one example — and , as with any sort of suggestive or sexual content , there is always thoughtful discourse as to how best to address it from a ratings perspective , " Eliot Mizrachi of the ESRB told Ars .
" While there are n't any content descriptors that specifically identify same - sex content , our raters are trained to consider these types of elements within the context of the overall game , and to weigh those factors , among others , when deliberating about which rating and content descriptors would be most appropriate . "
We also asked Common Sense Media how they dealt with gay or lesbian content when giving parents guidance on which games and movies are appropriate for their children .
" Our philosophy is that all parents are different .
We 're here to make you a better parent , " Marisa Connolly , Communications Manager of Common Sense Media told Ars .
" We want to provide as much information as we can , just literally saying here is the content .
Here is what goes on in the movie , how much , how explicit it is .
Here 's how much drinking , those sorts of things . "
The content is noted , but like the ESRB , these issues do n't affect the guidance on the media .
" The idea is to be as objective as we can possible be , we say it 's there , but we do n't to my knowledge ... if it 's explicit , we would give it the same ratings as heterosexual activities .
We do mention it because we do know that everyone parents differently . "
Gaming needs to grow up , in more ways that just this one
" I definitely feel that the LGBT issues are part of the larger issue of gaming 's immature treatment of sex , " De Marco said .
" I would also say that this applies to the US in general when it comes to sex .
It 's such a huge taboo here , when in other countries they are more worried about things like kids being exposed to violence . "
The problem is that while gaming may treat sexuality as a whole clumsily , non-traditional sexual roles in gaming are treated borderline offensively .
" At the same time , the immature treatment of LGBT issues goes way beyond the treatment of straight sex .
Many of the ' gay ' characters seen in games are pure negative stereotype , much like many ethnic depictions , " De Marco claims .
" People want to suppress or marginalize what they do n't understand .
Gaming reaches many walks of life , to be certain , but I think we all know that many games are taken in by impressionable young people who need to be taught that everyone they meet in the world is not a walking stereotype .
It would be great to see the industry start taking some responsibility about the lessons it is teaching young gamers . "
The problem is that we 're so far away from having a reasonable discourse on the subject that the very words used to describe it are being treated as toxic in gaming and in official fora .
Online gaming is a social activity where anyone can be anything they want , and people are free to explore new ideas and to meet new people .
By limiting or even removing the ability to take part in , much less discuss at all , same sex relationships , we 're putting an artificial barrier on expression and open communication .
If you can't be yourself in an online game or community , where can you ?
Gaming should be an escape , a diversion , and a safe place to play .
It 's certainly the first two things , but the third is a much harder trick .
Simply forcing gay and lesbian gamers into silence , however , is n't the answer .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Nanotechnology researchers at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock have developed a method of detecting , tracking , and killing cancer cells in real time with carbon nanotubes .
The discovery opens the prospect of a new , major front in the fight to eradicate cancer with promise for a new generation of cancer treatment beyond surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy .
Dr. Alex Biris , University of Arkansas at Little Rock ( UALR ) chief scientist at the Nanotechnology Center and assistant professor of applied science in University 's Donaghey College of Engineering and Information Technology , and Dr. Vladimir P. Zharov , professor and director of the Phillips Classic Laser and Nanomedicine Laboratories in the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences ( UAMS ) Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute , published their findings in the latest issue of the Journal of Biomedical Optics .
“ Until now , nobody has been able to fully understand and study in vivo and in real time how these nanoparticles travel through a living system , ” Biris said .
“ By using Raman spectroscopy , we showed that it is possible not only to monitor and detect nanomaterials moving through the circulation , but also to detect single cancer cells tagged with carbon nanotubes .
In this way , we can measure their clearance rate and their biodistribution kinetics through the lymph and blood systems . ”
Zharov emphasized that in vivo Raman flow cytometry is promising for the detection and identification of a broad spectrum of various nanoparticles with strong Raman scattering properties , such as cells , bacteria , and even viruses .
“ Before any clinical application of nanoparticles , it is imperative to determine their pharmacological profiles , ” Zharov said .
“ And this tool will provide this function as a supplement or even an alternative to the existing methods . ”
In their research , Biris , Zharov , and UAMS colleague Ekaterina Galanzha , M.D. , injected a single human cancer cell containing carbon nanotube material in the tail vein of a test rat .
They were able to follow the circulation of the carbon nanotubes in the blood vessels to the rat ’s ear , tracking the cell through the rat ’s blood stream , lymphatic system , and tissue with a Raman spectrometer .
In the same issue of the scientific journal , Biris and Zharov published a second paper discussing how nanoparticles can tag cancer cells .
A laser then heats the nanoparticles , killing the cancer cell .
“ If we are able to target cancer cells using these nanomaterials , we can monitor where the cancer cells are specifically located , and then we can kill them , ” Biris said .
He said the live rat experiment shows how the cancer killing process leaves only a dead cell and nanoparticles that , within a matter of hours , disintegrate and die .
Dr. Mary Good , dean of UALR ’s Donaghey College of Engineering and Information Technology , said the medical and economic ramifications of the discovery are significant .
“ The research Dr. Biris and Dr. Zharov have conducted indeed is significant and promising , ” said Good , former technology undersecretary of Commerce in the Clinton administration .
“ It points to a whole new direction for medical applications for nanoparticles .
There still is extensive time needed for research into the ultimate utility for these approaches and for human subject experiments .
But this early work is exciting and provides long - term hope for more effective cancer treatments . ”
Biris , 34 , said the UALR Nanotechnology Center ’s aim is to accelerate the development of commercial applications of nanotechnology and its potential to revolutionize medical advancements and the next generation of manufacturing of other products .

All Unmarried Japanese Girls are Virgins by Fukuyama Hiroaki
Regarding the rape of the 12 - year - old Okinawan child , I have been called upon to voice my opinion about the 12 - year - old girl who was raped by three Afro-American savages .
This was truly a great tragedy for the poor girl .
Now she will never be able to get married and live a happy life .
She is forever tainted in the eyes of Japanese society and no respectable Japanese man will have anything to do with her .
Those three savages got off easy .
They will only have to spend about 8 years in prison and perhaps get time off for good behavior .
They should have been given the minimum of life in prison without parole , but the death sentence by hanging would have been preferable .
However , I have heard a rumor that certain gangster elements here in Japan will put out an international contract on them when they get out of jail and rid the world of them .
From the postings I read on the newsgroups , there seems to be an attitude that Americans can come to Japan and do what they like to our women .
All our women are supposed to be available for one - night stands and there is never any mention of developing a meaningful relationship with them .
Roppongi is crawling with the vermin of the US military .
It is time that America pack up and leave our islands .
We never needed you here in the first place .
It all started back in 1853 when Admiral Perry and his black ships landed in Japan .
Japan had no choice but to become a colonist power so that they could compete with the West .
If we did n't , Perry and President Fillmore had agreed that they would annex Okinawa and use it as a base for an invasion of Japan .
Now Japan is unfairly labeled as being a militaristic nation .
But before Perry arrived on our shores we had a golden age with 250 years of peace during which time Europeans were slaughtering each other and the Europeans who had invaded America were slaughtering the Indians and enslaving Africans .
The racists of America would have done the same to us if we had n't taken measures to defend ourselves .
And the racists Christians of Europe were the vanguard of the European enslavers , who were kidnapping Japanese at the end of the 16th century and selling them as slaves .
This is when Toyotomi Hideyoshi lowered the boom on the Christians and banished them from Japan .
And to prove that he was serious , he crucified 26 of them in Nagasaki on February 5 , 1597 .
By this act Hideyoshi became the savior of Japan .
How many of you white Christians know that in 1581 , the chief Jesuit missionary to Japan , Father Organtin , presented an African to the great warlord Oda Nobunaga as a slave , offering to supply him with many others should it please his fancy .
Nobunaga was repulsed by the offer and refused it .
There is no doubt that the Judeo - Islamic - Christian religion is the scourge of the earth .
And , yes , it is true that America started the Pacific War with Japan .
Roosevelt had brought the entire US naval fleet to Honolulu .
What would any Japanese general think when he saw that ?
Clearly , America must be planning to launch an attack upon Japan .
And if that attack could be pre-empted by wiping out that fleet , it would make good military sense to do that .
Any military man who would not do such a thing would be derelict in his duties .
In its war with America , Japan attacked only military targets , but it was the allies who thought it might be a good idea to attack the civilian population of Japan ( and in Germany , too ) , heartlessly incinerating millions of innocent women and children .
( Thank you , General Curtis LeMay , General MacArthur , and President Truman .
May you and your underlings fry in hell for all eternity . )
It is time that America and Americans leave Japan .
You are more than a burden to us .
You pollute our culture .
You send your GIs and low - class civilians soil our women , and you have the audacity to brag about it over the Internet and advertise where these women can be found . *
You should all be ashamed of yourselves .
Fukuyama Hiroaki
Saitama Prefecture , Japan
* Note : I investigated the places in Shinjuku and Roppongi where it was said that you could find Japanese women for sex .
Well , as it turns out these women are not Japanese .
By speaking to them I discovered that they are mostly from Taiwan , the Philippines , Korea , China , and Thailand .
Most of them are here illegally and they work as prostitutes to earn a living because they are unable to find other work .
** Note 2 : I would like to thank Mr. Sloan for giving me the opportunity to address this newsgroup .
Not everybody agrees with the views expressed by Mr. Fukuyama .
For a somewhat contrary view of the virtue of Japanese womanhood , see the screenplay : Hard Times in Tokyo , Japan .
Here is a photo of a Japanese girl who is not a virgin : A girl who looks like a virgin , but is not ( but is she perhaps married ? ) .
Banksy revealed ?
Graffiti artist paints first ever ' self - portrait ' on London office block
Mysterious guerrilla graffiti artist Banksy has apparently created his first ever self - portrait .
The notoriously secretive artist has gone to extraordinary lengths in the past to hide his identity .
But his latest street mural , which will astonish Banksy fans , may finally have given the game away .
Is this Banksy ?
A mysterious mural in Shoreditch , East London , that is believed to be a self - portrait and , right , a previous photo thought to be the artist
The simple wall painting on the side of an East London office block shows one of Banksy ’s trademark necklace - wearing rats holding a placard showing what is apparently the artist ’s own face .
The face is recognisable from previous photos of a man believed to be Banksy .
The artist ’s anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world ’s biggest names with his works selling at auction for up to £ 250,000 .
Buyers have included movie couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie , Jude Law and pop star Christina Aguilera .
Last summer , Banksy was unmasked by a national newspaper as Robin Gunningham , a 34 - year - old Bristol - born former public schoolboy who grew up in middle class suburbia .
Banksy has never confirmed or denied that he is , in fact , Mr Gunningham .
Typical : Banksy 's trademark rat on the West Bank wall in Bethlehem
But the foot - high painting on the outside wall of an unremarkable office building in London ’s trendy Shoreditch , could confirm the elusive artist ’s identity at last .
It has been stencilled - a technique Banksy favours to create his works quickly and so minimise the risk of him being caught .
As well as his graffiti art across London and in other British cities , Banksy has regularly sparked controversy with his bizarre stunts .
He was slammed by animal welfare groups for using a live elephant in an exhibition in Los Angeles .
He painted a mural of children digging a hole to a paradise beach on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall and once placed an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo Bay prisoner on a rollercoaster ride in Disneyland , California .
Banksy marked the seventh anniversary of Princess Diana ’s death by printing mock £ 10 notes decorated with her face and once created a 3.5 - tonne bronze of the Old Bailey ’s statue of Justice dressed as a prostitute in thigh - high PVC boots and a suspender belt .
Imagination : A Banksy work found near the recent ' self - portrait ' mural
Dismissed by critics as a childish prankster and glorified vandal , Banksy soon won a cult following for his anti-war , anti-capitalist and anti-establishment messages .
His paintings appear in the most unlikely places and are witty and subversive : two policemen kissing ; a helicopter with a pink bow on top ; an insect with air - to - air missiles beneath its wings .
The latest image may be his way of coyly acknowledging his unmasking .
While it is almost certainly his , the possibility that the painting was by someone else cannot be ruled out entirely because Banksy ’s agent no longer authenticates his client ’s graffiti .
Ever since he began unleashing his distinctive murals on railway bridges and walls of his home town of Bristol in the early 1990s , Banksy has worked hard to protect his identity , setting up false trails to throw reporters hell - bent on exposing him off the scent .
False rumours abounded as to his identity .
It was variously said that his name was “ Robin Banks ’ , that he was a former butcher with a gold tooth and love of stout and that his parents believed he was an unusually successful painter and decorator .
Bizarre : Banksy marked Princess Diana 's anniversary by printing mock £ 10 notes
There were even claims that he was not one person but a collective of graffiti artists who have got together to perpetrate a giant hoax .
But last year , an investigation found compelling evidence that he is Robin Gunningham , who grew up in Bristol ’s exclusive Clifton area .
Mr Gunningham was born in Bristol on July 28 , 1973 , to Peter Gordon Gunningham , now 66 , a contracts manager , and Pamela Ann Dawkins - Jones , 67 , a company director ’s secretary .
One neighbour said he believed Mr Gunningham had gone on to become a ‘ graffiti artist ’ while former schoolmates remembered him as a particularly gifted artist who disappeared after leaving home under something of a cloud .
Mr Gunningham had attended Bristol Cathedral School , a prestigious , £ 9,240 - a - year private school that lists supermodel Sophie Anderton as a former pupil .
Mr Gunningham ’s parents denied the reports and the artist refused to comment , saying only that ‘ anyone described as good at drawing does n’t sound like Banksy ’ .
Gavin and Stacey stars James Corden and Ruth Jones Overweight celebrities such as Gavin and Stacey star James Corden are making dangerous weight gain appear normal , a medical expert is warning .
Professor Michael McMahon of Nuffield Health says fat stars are seen as role models , helping to make being overweight acceptable .
He says it is akin to the dangers of skinny media images and anorexia .
A survey for the healthcare provider found many obese people are apathetic about their weight gain .
We talk about the dangers of skinny media images , but the problem actually swings both ways
Professor McMahon
Researchers found many obese people refused to take any action about their situation with almost one in five not contemplating doing anything to lose weight .
The survey of over 2,000 individuals also revealed many obese people fail to recognise they have a problem at all .
Professor McMahon , a expert on keyhole surgery , said : " The increasing profile of larger celebrities , for example James Corden , Eamonn Holmes , Ruth Jones and Beth Ditto , means that being overweight is now perceived as being ' normal ' in the eyes of the public .
" We talk about the dangers of skinny media images , but the problem actually swings both ways . "
Role models HAVE YOUR SAY
Both underweight and overweight stars are causing issues C Brady , Glasgow Although he does not think large celebrities have been in any sense responsible for the obesity epidemic that exists today , he says the increased acceptance of obesity is alarming .
" If people continue to turn a blind eye to their weight problems , they will see their life expectancy considerably shortened , " he warned .
According to the research , the proportion of Britons who are obese has doubled in the last decade from 11 % in 1999 to 23 % this year .
Professor McMahon believes if nothing changes , we could see one in six people eligible for weight - loss surgery within a generation .
Former Hollyoakes soap star Mikyla Dodd , who weighed 25 stone ( 159kg ) and fitted a dress size of 28 when she appeared in the show as Chloe Bruce , defended overweight role models .
She told the BBC's Five Live : " There are very few role models in our society that are overweight .
" The problem you have got is a body of people who are overweight who feel ostracised and completely shut out from the community , therefore they eat more .
" It 's actually quite refreshing to see people who are in the public eye .
It shows that fat people can be successful , build self - esteem and then people eventually get the motivation to do something about it . "
Mikyla has since lost nearly 11 stone in weight .

* Sudan chooses Ahmed Haroun as governor of key province
* South Kordofan seen as potential north - south flashpoint
* Haroun wanted by ICC on accusations of Darfur war crimes
KHARTOUM , May 8 ( Reuters ) - Sudan has chosen Ahmed Haroun , wanted by the International Criminal Court on Darfur war crimes charges , as governor of a sensitive north - south border province that contains key oil fields , state media said on Friday .
State news agency SUNA said President Omar Hassan al - Bashir had named Haroun to lead the province of South Kordofan , which includes the contested border town of Abyei , site of clashes between northern and southern armies last year .
A spokesman for the former southern rebel Sudan People 's Liberation Movement had no immediate comment on the move , saying the appointment was Khartoum 's to make .
North and south Sudan , whose conflict is separate from the ongoing violence in Darfur in Sudan 's west , have had a troubled relationship since signing a peace deal in 2005 to end two decades of civil war .
The International Crisis Group think tank said in October the peace deal was at risk in South Kordofan , which had " many of the same ingredients " that sparked the conflict in Darfur .
Scores of people were killed and more than 50,000 displaced last year when northern and southern armies clashed in Abyei .
Both north Sudan and the country 's semi-autonomous south claim the town .
At stake is control over nearby oilfields and a pipeline funnelling crude to Sudan 's Red Sea coast .
Sudan says it produces 500,000 barrels of oil a day , a figure which it hopes to raise to 600,000 in 2009 .
UPCOMING ELECTIONS
The move , part of a small cabinet reshuffle , comes as Sudan is preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections set for February 2010 that will pave the way for a referendum on southern independence the following year .
The elections and referendum are key to implementing the 2005 peace deal , in which northern forces were also to be reduced to pre-war levels in South Kordofan , where large parts of the population backed southern rebels during the war .
Haroun , before being named as governor of South Kordofan , was minister of state for humanitarian affairs .
Bashir , who is himself the subject of an ICC arrest warrant on charges of masterminding war crimes in Darfur , named former census official Abdel Baqi Al - Jailani to replace him in that post , SUNA said .
The ICC accuses Haroun of recruiting and arming ' Janjaweed ' militias in Darfur while working at the Interior Ministry , and of having full knowledge of their atrocities against civilians .
U.N. officials say as many as 300,000 people have died and more than 2.7 million driven from their homes in almost six years of ethnic and politically motivated violence in Darfur .
Khartoum says 10,000 have died .
Haroun has defended his record in the Darfur conflict .
" What I did there was part of my professional job and responsibility as stipulated in the constitution and the law , " he said in March , adding that he had no chance of a fair trial at the ICC because it was a " political organisation backed by Europe " .

Skunk Girl is Sheba Karim ’s first novel .
It is told from the point of view of 16 - year - old Nina Khan , self - described as “ a Pakistani Muslim girl ” and from a small white town in upstate New York .
Although published in 2009 , the story is set in approximately 1993 .
In a fast - paced , entertaining read , Nina narrates her life and drama as the only Pakistani and Muslim girl in her high school .
She deals with worries about school and boys , as well body hair and strict parents .
Karim keeps a light - hearted tone throughout the novel , balancing Nina ’s self - deprecation with her humorous critique of others around her .
When a male friend asks Nina what her father would do if he ran outside and started kissing her in front of him , one of her best friends says , “ Nina ’s dad would kill her if you did that . ”
“ He would n’t kill me , ” she responds .
In the narration , Nina explains :
“ I must defend my father .
He may be conservative , but he ’s no murderer like those nutty Islamic fanatics they show on TV movies who marry unsuspecting white women , then kidnap their daughters and take them to some unnamed Middle Eastern country .
He would n’t kill me , just yell and maybe cry and only ever let me out of the house for school . ” ( 57 -8 )
Karim takes on stereotypes in a less heavy - handed manner than , say , Randa Abdel - Fattah of Does My Head Look Big in This ?
and Ten Things I Hate About Me .
She uses humor to poke fun at , and thus challenge , popular portrayals of Muslim men .
At the same time , Karim does n’t go the other route , of painting Nina ’s parents as permissive and progressive to challenge the image of Muslim parents as strict and conservative .
Nina ’s parents are in many ways much more conservative than Amal ’s parents in DMHLBT .
When Nina goes to the movies with her female friends and their boyfriends , she ca n’t let her father see that there are boys in the group , lest he “ kill ” her as discussed above .
Neither Nina nor her sister has ever been to a school dance , and her parents get “ worked up about the lack of morality in Western culture ” ( 138 ) .
When they see one of Nina ’s best friends having dinner with a boy , they grow concerned that Nina will want to have a boyfriend too , and they try to limit the amount of time Nina spends with her best friends , so that she does n’t become influenced to do “ things that are wrong for you , ” in the words of her mother .
Nina finds it hard to be the only girl in her school with such restrictions .
She feels left out when classmate Serena holds a big party and she does n’t even get an invitation , because , as Serena tells her , “ you ’re not allowed to go to parties and I do n’t want to waste any [ invitations ] . ”
But even while Nina bemoans her plight as the only high schooler at home on a Friday night , she never takes herself too seriously , which is refreshing .
Spending her Friday nights at home watching crime shows with her parents , she decides , “ Maybe there are only two types of people who spend their Friday nights in high school at home — Pakistani Muslim girls and future serial killers .
Though I suppose Indian and maybe even some Asian parents might be as strict with their kids . ”
She remembers hearing that there ’s an Indian girl in the middle school : “ Maybe I should become friends with her .
I bet we ’d be allowed to spend our Friday nights together , memorizing vocabulary words or something . ” ( 28 )
In some ways , Nina ’s parents are archetypes of strict , conservative parents .
When Nina asks her father what would be so wrong with having friends who are boys , he replies , “ If you lose sight of what is wrong and right , and start behaving like Americans , you ’ll end up on the streets , on drugs , and a prostitute . ”
Nina comments on her father ’s warning : “ It is so preposterous that you ca n’t even argue with it ” ( 36 ) .
Despite their strictness , Nina ’s parents fail to become stereotypes .
Karim ’s description of Nina ’s father , who tells jokes , even though they ’re not always funny , loves and sings along with qawwali music , and tries to have heart - to - hearts with his daughter make him into a multidimensional , believable character .
Nina ’s mother , too , breaks out of the stereotype she could otherwise become .
When Nina wails to her mother about the plight of being a “ hairy Pakistani Muslim girl , ” her mother says , “ It ’s not such a big deal , ” and hands her a box of bleach , telling her stories of mixing her own ammonia / hydrogen peroxide concoction when she was in college in Pakistan .
It makes sense that Karim would write Nina ’s parents as believable , multidimensional characters , since her whole cast of characters is complex and engaging .
Some characters , who start out as archetypes , such as Nina ’s sister , Sonia , the “ nerd girl , ” and classmate Serena , popular mean girl , develop through the novel as Nina gets to know them better .
While Nina ’s parents are strict about certain rules , they are less conservative about other issues .
Nina explains that her mother is the only one who prays regularly , and that the family only ever prays together to keep up appearances whenever her mother ’s sister , the very Pakistani , very Muslim Nasreen Khan , comes to visit .
Karim depicts Muslims more conservative than Nina ’s parents .
Nina tells the story of the Qur’an teacher she had when she was young , Brother Hassan .
When he sees her mother ’s favorite painting hanging on the wall , of two Mexican women holding bright flowers , he instructs Nina to tell her mother to take it down :
“ It is haram to depict human figures , ” he tells her .
Instead , it is her teacher who Nina never sees again .
She learns to read Qur’an instead from her mother , “ under the watchful eyes of the Mexican women . ” ( 81 - 2 )
With stories like this , Karim establishes a diversity of belief amongst Muslims .
Nina ’s mother , presented as the most religious member of her family , has a different understanding of Islam than Nina ’s Qur ’an teacher and is willing to stand up for it .
That Nina ’s mother does not discard the painting per Brother Hassan ’s advice is not presented as a failure on her part to live by the rules of Islam but as a way Nina ’s mother rejects a more conservative interpretation of Islam and affirms her own values .
Nina , who admits to be less religious than her mother , does not live up to the archetype of a conservative Muslim girl either .
Enamored by her crush , Asher Richelli , she does n’t hold the same resistance to him that very consciously religious Amal of DMHLBT had for her crush .
When Nina and her sister Sonia are left alone for a few days , when their parents fly to Pakistan early , Nina takes the opportunity to attend her first high school party , has her first beer — and proceeds to get drunk .
Later , she asks her sister what makes a good Muslim .
Sonia replies ,
“ Whose definition are you applying to that ?
In every religion people pick and choose what they want to follow .
Look at Ma and Dad ’s own friends — a few of the aunties cover their hair , and a few of the aunties drink , some fast during during Ramadan , some do n’t .
You ca n’t spend your life worrying about what other people will think .
If you live decently and help others , is Allah going to condemn you simply because you had a beer ?
I do n’t think so , but others might .
In the end , you have to do what you believe is right . ”
Sonia ’s advice of self - determination seems to the message of the book .
She tells her sister , “ When it comes to religion and orthodoxy and culture and self - actualization , there is no magic box [ with ] easy answers ” ( 208 ) .
And indeed , Nina ’s dilemma of what to do about her crush , Asher , is not presented as a test from God of resisting temptation but as a religious , cultural , and family issue with which she must struggle and not necessarily find any easy option .
While Nina ’s parents are quick to deplore what they see as immorality around them ( and Nina ’s potential fall to a drug - addicted prostitute ) , Nina does not judge .
When best friend Bridget announces her decision to have sex with her boyfriend , Nina thinks about how surreal the idea is , and asks Bridget sincerely , “ How are you feeling about it ? ”
But religious and familial drama is not the only issue facing Nina .
Small New York town Deer Hook lacks in racial diversity , which worsens Nina ’s feeling of isolation .
Nina recalls an incident from her childhood .
In the car , she asks her sister , “ When you take over the world , can you make me white ? ”
Her mother , driving , slams on the brakes and asks , “ Why would you want that ? ”
Nina narrates :
“ Because it sucks being one of the only brown kids in school , I thought .
But I did n’t say this because even then I knew my mother would n’t understand . ” ( 9 )
Nina describes the self - segregation by race during lunch : the few black and Latino students sit on one side of the lawn , while Nina , an Asian freshman , and couple other minorities sit on the “ white side . ”
Even though she sits with the white students and her best friends are white , Nina ca n’t completely fit in , and sometimes wishes to be white .
Nina feels some affinity to Bridget ’s boyfriend , Anthony , who is black and from the island of Grenada — one of the few non-white students at Deer Hook besides Nina .
“ Do you ever wish you were white ? ” she asks him , explaining that she would take the chance to live her life again as a “ cute blonde ” in a heartbeat .
He suggests perhaps being white would n’t make her happier , considering everything she ’d have to sacrifice for it : her family , her food , her pride .
There are no incidents of overt racism that Nina and Anthony face , but Karim shows the difficulty of being one of the few non-white students in the school , especially when all their friends are white .
Nina challenges her parents ’ racism when they find out Bridget is not just dating — horror ! — but dating “ a black boy , ” as well as the preference for light skin within their Pakistani circles .
These are probably the most overt discussions of racism in the book .
One of Nina ’s biggest concerns is not just being a “ Pakistani Muslim girl ” but being a “ hairy Pakistani Muslim girl . ”
She explains that one day , “ I fell asleep a human , and woke up a gorilla ” ( 21 ) .
It is worse when she realizes that she has a stripe of dark hair down her neck to the center of her back .
Describing her dilemma as being a “ skunk girl , ” from which the novel derives its title , Nina feels like a freak .
She stands out in other ways .
In hot weather , Nina sweats in jeans while others wear shorts .
She wears jeans because that ’s what Pakistani Muslim girls do , she says .
But I wonder why she can’t wear a long skirt or looser , lighter pants at least .
Skunk Girl paints a picture of a believable Muslim teenager–not necessarily one CAIR would send out to represent Muslim youth , but a girl with struggles and desires beyond fulfilling her mother ’s image of the perfect Pakistani Muslim girl .
It was refreshing that neither the title nor cover art revolved around Nina ’s Muslim - ness .
Books with a Muslim protagonist have been known to feature hijab - less characters in hijab to emphasize their faith .
Not so for Skunk Girl —
The book jacket shows a white stripe of fur against black , reflecting the book ’s title .
Karim ’s first novel is a fast and enjoyable read .
I read it in one sitting .
At 231 pages , in a comfortable font size and spacing , the book goes quickly .
Karim maintains the pace with short chapters , an engaging plot , and an entertaining and likable narrator .
Nina ’s story is compelling , touching on issues many young people face , whether or not they are Pakistani Muslim girls .
But even when she takes on serious issues , Karim keeps the novel optimistic and funny .
The message , in the end , is one of self - acceptance .
Skunk Girl does not strive to be great literature .
It makes a breezy , but thoughtful , summer read .
I look forward to seeing what else Karim will bring to young adult fiction .
Proposals stuck into Ohio's budget bill would allow the burning of trash and even scrap tires to be considered renewable energy - a move that environmentalists say could stunt the development of wind and solar power .
The Republican - dominated Senate has tucked a number of energy amendments into the 3,600 - page budget bill to expand the official definition of what is renewable .
The new " renewables " -- materials burned to make electricity -- would include :
• Trash and other solid waste , which by state definition could include " garbage , scrap tires , combustible and noncombustible material , street dirt and debris . "
• Methane from abandoned coal mines , which at present can escape into the atmosphere , where it is suspected of causing global warming .
• Pulp liquor , a byproduct of paper - making , which Ohio 's sole paper manufacturer , PH Glatfelter Co , of York , Penn. , already uses to generate electricity .
But a coalition of green and consumer advocates , including Environment Ohio , the Ohio Consumers ' Counsel , the Sierra Club , the Ohio Environmental Council and the Union of Concerned Scientists , oppose the amendments .
Key Senate Republican leaders say the changes may help create jobs and are at least worth talking about .
Senior Strickland administration officials say they have concerns about the proposals and are willing to talk about them , but not as part of the budget bill .
In a petition to lawmakers , environmental advocates argue that the changes could crowd out the development of wind and solar projects by making them compete for a valuable financing process .
The reasoning : Under Ohio's renewable energy laws , electric utilities must by 2025 generate 12.5 percent of their power with renewables , or buy " renewable energy credits " from renewable power sources .
And that means that power generated by wind , solar and bio -gases would generate revenue two ways -- making electricity and creating credits that the big utilities would have to buy .
The changes proposed in the budget bill " would adversely impact the development of traditional renewable energy sources in Ohio along with the jobs that were promised with them , " the coalition argues in a four - page letter .
Sen . Jon Husted , a Republican from Kettering and the former speaker of the House , is behind some of the amendments and aware of all of them .
" I am not necessarily convinced that some of these fall under renewable , " he said .
As speaker last year , Husted inserted annual percentage benchmarks into the administration 's renewable energy requirements , jump - starting the industry .
Husted said he supports calling solid waste renewable because using it to generate power could save landfill space and boost recycling .
" But you may be eating up space for the renewable energy projects .
And these technologies are not as environmentally friendly as wind and solar . "
VASSALBORO , Maine ( AP ) 
A topless coffee shop that created controversy went up in flames early Wednesday , just hours after the owner talked with local officials about making the business more like a strip club .
Investigators from the state fire marshal 's office were sifting through the smoking ruins of the Grand View Topless Coffee Shop to determine what caused the blaze .
COFFEE SHOPS : Scantily clad baristas boost sales
The fire was reported just before 1 a.m. by an ambulance that happened to be driving past .
It took about 50 firefighters from eight communities to douse it .
Owner Donald Crabtree , who escaped unharmed along with six others , was asked if the fire seemed suspicious , coming just hours after he appeared before the town 's planning board .
" I do n't even dare to say at this time , " Crabtree said .
At the shop , waiters and waitresses without shirts served coffee and doughnuts .
Crabtree had met Tuesday night with planning officials to discuss adding a disc jockey , expanding parking and extending the hours of operation .
Crabtree said he spent $ 277,000 buying and renovating the former motel .
It was n't insured , he said .
The shop 's opening in February raised the ire of dozens of local residents .
Someone recently called police to complain that a waitress was outside the business without a shirt .
An ordinance was proposed to regulate nudity at local businesses .
While many people dropped by Wednesday morning to show support , it was clear that others were pleased about the fire , said Paul Crabtree , the owner 's brother .

“ If they open fire on people and if there is bloodshed , people will get angrier , ” said a protester , Ali , 40 .
“ They are out of their minds if they think with bloodshed they can crush the movement . ”
Mr. Obama ’s statement was his strongest to date on the post-election turmoil in Iran .
Saying that “ each and every innocent life ” lost would be mourned , he added : “ Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away .
The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government .
If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community , it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent , not coercion .
“ Martin Luther King once said , ‘ The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ’
I believe that .
The international community believes that .
And right now , we are bearing witness to the Iranian people ’s belief in that truth , and we will continue to bear witness . ”
There had been varying reports in the hours leading up to the opposition rally about whether it would be called off in the face of the government ’s threatened crackdown .
State television reported that Mr. Moussavi had called it off , but some of his supporters , posting on social networking sites , urged demonstrators to gather .

Journalists were banned from leaving their offices to report on the protests .
A reporter from an American news organization said she had been called by a member of the Basij militia warning her not to go to the venue for the Saturday rally because the situation would be dangerous and there could be fatalities .
The authorities were also reported on Saturday to have renewed an offer of a partial recount of the ballots in the disputed election  an offer that the opposition has previously rejected .
A letter from Mr. Moussavi published on one of his Web sites late Saturday repeated his demand for the election to be annulled .

Kidney injury that can arise after undergoing certain medical imaging procedures increases a patient 's risk of having a stroke or heart attack over the next year or two , according to a study appearing in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society Nephrology ( CJASN ) .
The findings indicate that seemingly minor and reversible kidney damage from these common clinical procedures is a serious health threat .
Medical imaging often uses contrast agents , substances such as iodine and barium that enhance the contrast of structures or fluids within the body .
For example , contrast agents may be used during cardiac angiography and computed tomography procedures to visualize blood vessels and changes in tissues .
Exposure to contrast agents can injure the kidneys , but patients are often told that this is only a temporary side effect .
Recent research has suggested that such contrast - induced kidney damage may actually be more serious , although no thorough studies have looked into the hypothesis .
To investigate the issue , Richard Solomon , MD ( University of Vermont ) , and his colleagues studied 294 patients with kidney disease who were exposed to contrast agents during cardiac angiography .
Patients in the CARE ( Cardiac Angiography in REnally Impaired Patients ) trial were randomly divided to receive one of two contrast agents : iopamidol or iodixanol .
After following patients for at least one year , the researchers found that 92 ( 31 % ) of the patients experienced negative health effects .
Thirty - eight ( 13 % ) of the patients experienced a major event , such as death , stroke , heart attack , or end - stage renal disease .
Individuals who developed contrast - induced kidney injuries had twice as many long - term negative health effects compared with patients whose kidneys were not damaged .
In the absence of contrast - induced kidney injury , there was no difference in the incidence of long - term negative health effects between patients taking iopamidol or iodixanol .
However , the investigators found that patients taking iopamidol had reduced incidences of both kidney damage and long - term negative effects .
These parallel decreased incidences support the theory that contrast - induced kidney injury causes long - term negative effects .
The CARE trial findings should prompt investigators to design additional studies on the long - term negative health effects of contrast - induced kidney damage .

The CW : The Fall Schedule
Although I ’m as cautiously amused about the idea of a “ Melrose Place ” reboot as I was with “ 90210 ” last year , and I ’m sure my “ Twilight ” - loving wife will be into the network ’s new Thursday night drama , I really only have one observation to make about The CW ’s fall schedule : instead of pairing “ Smallville ” with a third season of “ Reaper , ” they ’ve canceled the latter and are wasting an hour of their schedule re-running the episode of “ America ’s Next Top Model ” from earlier in the week .
Are you kidding me ?
Okay , that ’s all I ’ve got .
I ’m just really pissed off about that and needed to get it out of my system .

More than 700 doctors from 43 countries have written a letter of protest to their governing ethical body , the World Medical Association , alleging that its recently appointed Israeli president has turned a blind eye to the involvement of medical staff in torture , and calling for his removal .
Dr Yoram Blachar , leader of the Israeli Medical Association since 1995 , assumed the helm of the WMA in November .
The signatories to the letter , who include senior doctors and professors from the UK , Europe and the US , claim he has failed to answer charges that some Israeli doctors condone or collaborate with a regime that uses torture against Palestinian prisoners .
As long ago as 1996 , the letter says , Amnesty International concluded that doctors in Israel working with the security services " formed part of a system in which detainees are tortured , ill - treated and humiliated in ways that place prison medical practice in conflict with medical ethics " .
The letter , whose lead signatory is the paediatrician Alan Meyers from the Boston University school of medicine , says Blachar 's presidency " makes a mockery of the principles on which the WMA was founded in 1947 , which was as a response to egregious abuses by German and Japanese doctors " in the second world war .
The doctors say inaction is not an option .
The WMA 's 1975 Declaration of Tokyo said " physicians shall not countenance , condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading procedures , and in all situations , including armed conflict and civil conflict " .
Two years ago , its annual general assembly explicitly obliged doctors to document cases of torture of which they become aware .
" The absence of documenting and denouncing such acts might be considered as a form of tolerance and of non-assistance to the victims , " it ruled .
In an email to the Guardian promising a response to the charges , Blachar called them " imaginary allegations which have no grounds whatsoever " .
He claimed that most who signed the appeal " did not bother to verify the content " .
No detailed rebuttal was forthcoming , however .
Meyers said Blachar had in effect defended the participation of Israeli physicians in the torture of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails .
In a letter to the Lancet medical journal in 1997 , Blachar wrote : " The guidelines on interrogation recommend that only ' moderate physical pressure ' ( in accordance with international law , and not unknown in other democratic countries ) be sanctioned . "
" As you may know , " Meyers said , " ' moderate physical pressure ' – the same formulation employed by the Bush administration in its prisons at Guantánamo Bay and CIA ' black sites ' in other countries ( and now a subject of heated debate in the US ) – includes confining prisoners in stress positions , beatings , isolation , sleep deprivation , extremes of heat and cold , humiliation and other forms of physical and psychological abuse .
" Physician collaboration in such maltreatment is unacceptable , and the defence of such physician participation should disqualify Dr Blachar from any position of leadership within the international physician community . "
Meyers , who is Jewish , has campaigned for health and human rights in Israel for a decade , but said any physician in any country who was involved with interrogation techniques of this kind should not be practising medicine .
" If they did it in the US , I 'd join with anyone else in seeking to have those physicians brought to account , " he said .
Further allegations of Israeli doctors ' involvement in torture came in a report two years ago from the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel , which gave detailed testimony from nine Palestinian men interrogated between 2004 and 2006 .
Blachar 's critics accuse him of failing to respond to either this report or Amnesty 's evidence .
Sir Iain Chalmers , a senior British doctor , editor of the James Lind Library and a co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration , is one of the signatories to the letter .
" Previous appeals to Yoram Blachar himself , in a number of places and from a number of people , to answer factually based allegations of medical complicity in torture have not resulted in any adequate response , " he said .
" The issue now is : does the WMA have any credibility as long as it continues to ignore people who are complaining about its acquiescence and support of Dr Blachar and the Israeli Medical Association ?
" There have been no satisfactory responses from the IMA to allegations both by Israeli organisations and Amnesty International over the years . "
Dr Derek Summerfield , of the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London , who was the co-ordinator of the letter , said : " The appointment of the long - standing president of the IMA to lead the WMA , which is the world body overseeing medical ethics , which arose out of the abuses of the second world war , just seems to make a mockery of the whole idea that there is an ethical framework for what doctors do and what they do n't do . "
Over the course of the last year we ’ve been developing tools and software in collaboration with an amazing artist , TEMPT1 , who suffers from advanced stage ALS .
The resulting EyeWriter system is a free and open source DIY project that allows TEMPT1 to make art again by using his eyes for the first time in seven years .
An initial milestone in the project was to see TEMPT1 write his name again .
Through Kickstarter we are now trying to help push a second milestone , which is TEMPT1 ’s return to being able to make a living as an artist .
As a part of this initiative he is releasing new archival digital prints , an original type face drawn using the EyeWriter , a screen saver , T - shirts , letter press prints , a special xerox zine about his work and message , and large format robotically drawn eye tags .
$ 10 pledge – Custom eye - drawn font created by TEMPT1 using the EyeWriter ( works on Mac , PC and Linux ) :
$ 75 pledge – Limited edition letter press print of original design by TEMPT1 ( 8 ″ x 10 ″ , edition of 100 ) .
Printed by Paper Jam Press .
Includes TEMPT1 Second To None zine .
$ 500 pledge – A Kanye West edition of the original EyeWriter glasses design made by the EyeWriter development team ( edition of 5 ) :
$ 1000 pledge – TEMPT1 tag designed by TEMPT1 using the EyeWriter and drawn with RoboTagger , a large industrial robotic device ( edition of 10 , each signed by thumbprint ) :
The Eyewriter team is also going to drop a 2.0 version of the device in the very near future that will allow users to do much more than just write graffiti ( e.g. type , speak , browse the web ) and costs about $ 100 in parts .
This will be a brand new system that will functionally compete with incredibly expensive medical computing devices .
Additional proceeds from the Kickstarter campaign will help fund this initiative .
To support TEMPT1 , the Eyewriter team and to own some great art , please visit eyewriter.org / kickstarter and spread the word .
Thank you in advance from the entire team ( chris , evan , james , theo , TEMPT1 , zach )
Editor 's note : Periodically , The A.V.
Club enters its gleaming , sterile laboratories to taste - test new and bizarre foodstuffs it finds on the open market , from Vosges ' Bacon Chocolate bar to Brawndo : The Thirst Mutilator to Jones Soda 's holiday ham drink .
The results are posted weekly at avclub.com / blog .
Recently , The A.V. Club considered taste - testing the KFC " Famous Bowl , " that inexplicably popular , remarkably grotesque heap of food that comedian Patton Oswalt memorably described as " a failure pile in a sadness bowl . "
Then it occurred to us that we should just have Oswalt do our dirty work for us — especially since he admitted he'd never actually sampled one of those failure piles for himself .
So we dared him to .
Here are the results .

I am writing this under appreciable mental strain , since by tonight , I shall be no more .
When you read these hastily scrawled words , you may guess , though never fully realize , why I must have forgetfulness or death .
Would that I could forget that fateful evening in the autumn of 2006 when I first heard the shrieking , beckoning clarion call of Kentucky Fried Chicken 's Famous Bowl .
I was fast - forwarding through the commercials of a Tivo 'd episode of The Venture Brothers .
The commercial for the Famous Bowl came on .
I thought it was a Tim & Eric sketch .
Advertisement
It was n't .
Kentucky Fried Chicken had filled a bowl with gravy , mashed potatoes , corn , breaded chicken , and finally , cheese .
Shut-ins , people afflicted with Prader - Willi Syndrome , and manic - depressives also do this .
If you 're trying to make a fortune in the food and beverage industry , those are the three demographics to shoot for — the Famous Bowl is one of the bestselling items on the KFC menu .
KFC calls it their version of the shepherd 's pie .
Shepherds in Kentucky must be full of rage and slathered in confusion .
They must hang their fat , skin , and muscles from bones carved with runes of surrender .
I must 've watched the commercial a dozen times .
It looked like a self - shot ( but well - cut and - lit ) video that someone would make as they prepared to commit suicide .
I could n't take my eyes off it .
I did n't think the implosion of society would be so funny .
So I wrote a bit about the Famous Bowl .
I 'm a comedian .
I 'm obsessed with love , crime , America , and the apocalypse .
The KFC Famous Bowl is all of these , and it also kind of looks like the future - food you 'd see people eating in '70s science - fiction flicks .
Advertisement
I also like science fiction .
And boy , did the bit work .
I love doing it .
I put it on an album and did it on Late Night With Conan O'Brien .
And it took on a weird life of its own .
People keep telling me about the Famous Bowl , in all its permutations .
Someone told me KFC added a biscuit to the bowl .
I heard desperate whispers about newer , more sinister products that were being tried out at the ominous - sounding " test market store " in Louisville — including something called " The Megaleg , " which I fear will be part of some future A.V. Club Taste Test .
Advertisement
Somehow , KFC got wind of it .
The creator of the Famous Bowl had my bit quoted to him in an interview in Fast Company magazine .
And yesterday , KFC sent a Patton Oswalt bobblehead to my management company .
I 'm not kidding .
The fact that it looms over the official Colonel Sanders bobblehead in stature means … something .
Are they mocking me ?
Advertisement
But I have a shameful secret .
I 've never had a Famous Bowl .
Until now .
The A.V. Club asked me to try one and write about it .
I said yes .
I bought one and ate it .
It was a mistake .

First off , when I went looking for a KFC in Los Angeles , I realized I had n't been in a KFC in decades .
I remember , as a kid , how fun they were , with the corn on the cob on a stick , and the way KFC chicken tastes so goddamn awesome the next day after spending the night in the fridge .
The franchise I visited , on Hollywood Boulevard near my old apartment , looked like it had withstood assault by bullets , flamethrowers , Baseball Furies , and a hundred hook - handed whores .
Everything inside the store — including the employees and customers — looked like it had been rubbed with sad ham .
And they were offering a new product for kids — " fun meals " that came in colorful cardboard containers that opened like laptop computers .
A generation of children are growing up associating computer use with fun , grease , and food .
I will flee to the mountains before I see how porn gets folded into that equation .

The Famous Bowl has a black plastic bottom and a clear plastic top that fogs appealingly from the jungle heat of the beige glop inside .
Here 's where , in a quirky indie - film moment , I 'd eat a sporkfull and realize …
" Hey , this is pretty good ! " I had considered that reaction as I drove the Famous Bowl home .
It sat on the passenger seat next to me like a sullen runaway I 'd picked up on the interstate .
I wanted us to bond somehow .
I wanted to eat my words .
I like when things work out unexpectedly .
The Famous Bowl hit my mouth like warm soda , slouched down my throat , and splayed itself across my stomach like a sun-stroked wino .
It was that precise combination of things , and so many other sensations that did not go together .
At all .

The gravy , which I remembered as being tangy and delicious in my youth , tasted like the idea of blandness , but burned and then salted to cover the horrid taste .
The mashed potatoes defiantly stood their ground against the gravy , as if they 'd read The Artist 's Way and said , " I 'm going to be boring and forgetful in my own potato -y way ! "
The corn tasted like it had been dunked in fake - corn - flavored ointment , and the popcorn chicken , breaded to the point of parody , was like chewing a cotton sleeve that someone had used to wipe chicken grease off their chin .
The cheese had congealed .
Even in the heat and steam of the covered Famous Bowl , it had congealed .
I stabbed it with the tines of my spork and it all came up in one piece .
I nibbled an edge , had a vision of a crying Dutch farmer , and put it down .

I managed three or four more spoonfuls , trying to be fair .
I am not the healthiest eater , but this was a level of crap I had n't earned a belt in yet .
Afterward , I had the weirdest feeling .
I 'm trying to imagine this feeling amplified , as if I 'd finished the entire bowl :
My mouth was laced with the various " flavors " of the Famous Bowl .
My stomach was bloated and uncomfortable with the fist of starch I 'd just put in it .
But I did n't feel like I 'd eaten .
It 's like when you see some loud summer blockbuster , or hear an overproduced pop song — you 're left with the sensation of seeing , hearing , or in the case of the Famous Bowl , eating .
But in the end , that 's all they are — sensations .
Advertisement
There was nothing of consequence or value for me to digest , no taste or memory left on my teeth or tongue to savor and think about .
It 's goddamn horrible , this Famous Bowl .
The end is near .
I hear a noise at the door , as of some immense slippery , living mound lumbering against it .
It shall not find me !
God , that gravy !
The window !
The window !

The Swedish Supreme Administrative Court has ruled that collecting and storing IP addresses is in violation of the Personal Data Act .
But as some celebrate this ruling as the death of the notorious IPRED anti-piracy legislation , the truth is a little more sobering .
In June 2005 , the Swedish Data Inspection Board – a public authority protecting individuals ’ privacy in the information society – decided that the activities of the Swedish anti-piracy bureau ( Antipiratbyrån ) went against the Personal Data Act .
The act in question defines who is eligible to store information on individuals and the inspection board ’s justification for the decision was that IP addresses can be tied to a specific person and that only government agencies may store that kind of information in criminal cases .
Since collecting IP numbers ( and suing the owners ) is the core business for Antipiratbyrån , they appealed the decision to the County Administrative Court which agreed with the inspection board ’s stance .
Antipiratbyrån appealed again , with the same result , and then once again .
Today , the highest instance , the Supreme Administrative Court said it will not try the case which means the previous decision is upheld .
Antipiratbyrån ’s method for chasing filesharers by logging and storing their IP addresses is thereby in violation of the Personal Data Act .
However , while some prematurely celebrated the result as the death of IPRED ( and have since rewritten their article ) , the truth is a little more sobering .
On his blog , Swedish Pirate Party ’s Rick Falkvinge writes that a paragraph in IPRED specifically says that you do n’t need to be granted exception from the Personal Data Act in order to retrieve the names of IP address holders from ISPs .
8.2.11 Exception from 21 § Personal Data Act
In the copyright law , additions are made that means no specific exception from 21 § Personal Data
Act is needed to handle personal information regarding immaterial rights breach , when handling such information is necessary in order to present a legal claim .

UPDATE : TweetDeck for iPhone is now LIVE in the iPhone App Store .
Get it here , and then tell us what you think in the comments .
—
TweetDeck , the leading desktop app for Twitter , is set to launch its iPhone version tonight at 9 pm Pacific Time , the company has informed Mashable .
The app will be available for free , and has already been submitted to the App Store , the company informed us .
While the announcement will take place at midnight ET ( 9 pm PT ) , the availability of the app is dependent on how long it takes Apple to approve it .
News of the app , but not its launch date or price , was leaked by Digg founder Kevin Rose on his blog today .
We 've previewed the upcoming iPhone application at Mashable and can confirm that it 's quite stunning , bringing Tweet Deck 's beloved columns and gorgeous interface to the small screen .
The app also syncs with the desktop version , providing a complete desktop and mobile solution for Twitter power users .
The feature list includes :
- Column based friend groups ( like Tweet Deck desktop ) - TweetDeck desktop syncing ( make a change on the iphone and it's reflected back on the PC ) - Facebook toolbar like status updates - Multiple account support - Flicking to move between columns - Shake to refresh
The launch will mean that TweetDeck competes on two fronts : against Seesmic Desktop on the desktop , and popular mobile client Tweetie on the iPhone .
What TweetDeck brings to the table is a holistic experience : leave your desk and have the exact same experience and data on your phone .
Many Twitter applications are moving in this direction : Tweetie already has a Mac version , while an iPhone app is on the way from Seesmic .
The trick for TweetDeck will be to leverage its desktop dominance to win in the iPhone market , too .
Our previews today suggest it has a fighting chance .
Foreclosed three - deckers have become prime targets for squatters , vandals and thieves , who sometimes set them on fire to gain access to copper pipes inside the walls .
In Worcester , 60 percent of vacant , bank - owned dwellings with multiple code violations , are three - families , as are 21 of the city ’s 27 condemned buildings .
In New Bedford , whose poorer neighborhoods brim with three - deckers , Mayor Scott W. Lang has set about demolishing the worst of them , including seven so far this year .
“ It ’s only a matter of time before it begins to spread like a cancer , ” Mr. Lang said .
On some streets in New Bedford , tight rows of triple - deckers are now interrupted here and there by dirt lots , which impart the odd effect of missing teeth .
Patrick Sullivan , the city ’s director of housing and community development , said its foreclosed three - deckers were mostly owned by absentee landlords who had scooped them up as investments and then let them decay .
In one notorious case , Mr. Sullivan said , a single investor bought hundreds of properties in New Bedford and other Massachusetts cities during the real estate boom , ran up dozens of code violations and fled the country .
Mr. Lang hopes the demolitions make room for small parks , community gardens or parking lots .
“ It might make sense to open up a little air , allow some green space , create a little more of a recreational - type pattern , ” he said .
Boston , home to roughly 15,000 three - deckers , is taking a different approach .
It has not demolished any abandoned three - deckers because city officials want to preserve as many affordable housing units as possible , said Evelyn Friedman , chief and director of the Boston ’s Department of Neighborhood Development .
Modern zoning laws , Ms. Friedman said , would never allow three units on such small lots .
“ If we have four three - deckers on 12,000 square feet and could only get two on that amount of land now , ” Ms. Friedman said , “ we are losing six units .
So it ’s very important to us to sustain them . ”
Well , it was n't too hard to see this trend coming , but it looks like Foxconn is among the first out of the gate with a Moblin - running netbook at Computex Taipei , with its new SZ901 model opting for Linpus ' j ust - revealed distribution of the OS .
As you might expect , however , there are n't exactly many surprises beyond that welcome addition , with the 10.1 - inch netbook packing the usual Atom N270 processor , 1GB of RAM , a 160 GB hard drive , and built - in 3G , along with a glossy finish all around .
No word on a price or release date just yet , but this is Foxconn after all , so there 's a good chance this one could be showing up under any number of different brands .

These are really three different issues :
1 ) The CEO compensation ; 2 ) Commission / P&L bonuses of profitable employees ; 3 ) Misaligned compensation packages of the CDO / mortgage - backed buying managers .
The first one is a symbolic issue ( and is irrelevant IMO ) and the second one is perfectly appropriate — its the 3rd one that has become so problematic .

Wall Street ’s $ 18.4 Billion Bonus

Ever since losing the high - def format war to Blu-ray , Toshiba has resolutely refused to join the enemy camp and start manufacturing Blu-ray products .
Until now that is .
According to reports coming out of its annual shareholder meeting in Tokyo , Toshiba is considering making Blu-ray products .
The company ’s president , Atsutoshi Nishida , told shareholders that Blu-ray recorders in particular appear to be a viable option , reports CrunchGear .
The logic appears to be that with demand for Blu-ray recorders increasing ( especially in Japan ) Toshiba cannot afford to miss out on a slice of that market .
There is also Toshiba ’s current financial plight – although for the current fiscal year , Nishida said his company is expected to save USD $ 3.5 billion after a poor 2008 .
The company ’s change of attitude comes as a survey by Harris Interactive suggests the picture for Blu-ray is still far from rosy .
It shows that the percentage of American adults with a HDTV is up from 35 in May 2008 to 47 per cent today .
But the only 7 per cent of Americans own a Blu-ray player – up from 4 per cent a year ago .
By comparison , 11 per cent of Americans own a machine that plays the now - defunct HD DVD format .
Milton Ellis , VP and senior consultant for Harris Interactive , said only 7 per cent of non-Blu-ray owners is considering buying a Blu-ray disc player within the next year , down from 9 per cent in May 2008 .
He said Blu-ray adoption is being hampered by competition from alternative technologies , such as cable and satellite TV and the Internet , all of which offer HD content .
" Consumers today can easily watch high - definition TV channels or use the Internet or video - on - demand to access high - definition movies , " he said .
" In the near future , access to high - definition movies may be a download or streaming delivery of one ’s favorite movies to a home media server that eliminates the need for a Blu-ray player and Blu-ray disc . "
However , the Blu-ray Disc Association has challenged the accuracy of the Harris Poll .
It said the Harris survey does n’t chime with actual shipping and sales numbers for Blu-ray .
The BDA cited Adams Media Research data that puts the numbers closer to nearly 8 per cent for Blu-ray and less than 1 per cent for HD DVD .
Calling the Harris data " grossly inaccurate " , the news release states that by the end of 2009 , Blu-ray players will be in nearly 15 per cent of American TV homes .
Tom Adams , president of Adams Media Research , suggested the Harris survey findings were a result of consumers ’ inability to identify what exactly is next to their TVs .
" Some people believe a DVD player on an HDTV is high - def , " he said .
" There ’s just so much confusion out there .
Everybody makes mistakes , but we have models that show those numbers just ca n’t be true . "
A Barrie woman has filed a request to an Ontario court to compel actor Keanu Reeves to provide a DNA sample as part of a bid to get support for herself and her four children .
Karen Sala , 46 , who is acting as her own lawyer , filed notice on Monday in the Superior Court of Justice family branch .
Legal papers were served on Reeves ' business manager in Los Angeles two days ago .
The first court date for the case is July 6 in Barrie .
" I 'm pissed .
I just want him to stand up and be a man , " Sala said in an interview yesterday .
A spokesperson for the actor said Reeves denies even knowing Sala and strongly rejects her claims .
None of the allegations have been proven in court .
Sala said she has tried " privately " over the years to persuade Reeves to provide support .
She said she has known him since she was 9 years old and he was 7 , and briefly lived with his family as a teenager after running away from home .
She added that her brother once dated Reeves ' sister .
With her children , aged 20 to 25 , in post - secondary schools , Sala said she could use financial support to help them complete their education .
Sala said her children would like to know the truth about who their father is and she is launching the suit to seek " closure . "
" They grew up with the ex's family always saying they were n't his , so they had to contend with that , " she said .
In addition to the DNA test , Sala is seeking child support of $ 150,000 per month , retroactive to June 1988 , as well as $ 3 million per month in spousal support retroactive to November 2006 .
A Los Angeles spokesperson for Reeves issued a statement last night denying her allegations .
" Karen Sala 's allegations are completely false and absurd .
Mr. Reeves has no knowledge of who she is , " Cheryl Maisel said in a statement .
Paul Knell , Reeves ' Los Angeles business manager , questioned Sala 's motives , noting that all four children are now adults .
" Before you disparage my client and lend validity to this , there 's clearly something wrong with someone who claims child support after all the kids have grown .
I 'm just pointing that out , " Knell said .
Knell said his client will undoubtedly become a target of tabloid speculation as a result of Sala 's suit .
" He ( Reeves ) is a high - profile person in Hollywood so people come out of the woodwork .
I 'll leave it at that , " Knell said .
Reeves , 44 , was born in Beirut , Lebanon , but lived in Toronto with his mother until he moved to Hollywood in the late ' 80s .
His current address in the court documents is in West Hollywood .

Sala is the first to admit that she 's no angel , claiming that she and Reeves had a sexual relationship before and during her stormy marriage .
She also acknowledged she is not sure which , if any , of her children he has sired .
But Sala insisted that Reeves was aware that he might be the father of some or all of her children , noting that at least one of them bears a resemblance to him .
Sala said her relationship continued with Reeves throughout her teens and early 20s , saying Reeves has stayed in touch over the years and played a minor role in her children 's upbringing .
She contended that Reeves came to the hospital for the birth of her youngest son , who is now 20 .
" He ( Reeves ) knows what the kids are doing .
He used to buy them Christmas gifts when they were little .
His mother bought Easter gifts and stuff like that .
He did contribute back in the day when they were younger , " Sala said .
Childhood friend Connie Harten , 49 , said Reeves and Sala were close friends as teenagers and had visited her home together .
" She ( Sala ) used to come up and visit me , and she brought him ( Reeves ) with her a couple of times .
They were very close .
I got the impression something was going on .
I did n't ask questions , " Harten said .
Harten said she only realized who Reeves was years later after seeing him onscreen .
Sala said she met Hollywood celebrities like Sandra Bullock and Cameron Diaz while with Reeves .
" There 's a lot of witnesses to the relationship . "
Sala said she has a picture of Reeves when he was a teenager – though she was unable to produce it yesterday – and that she is hoping to get a photo from a friend of the two of them together more than 20 years ago .
Sala has what she describes as a sample of his handwriting , and said she has Reeves ' phone number and current address in Los Angeles .
IT 'S a ringing endorsement of Iarnrod Eireann from the most unlikely quarter .
Controversial Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is campaigning to be re-elected on the plank that his country is advancing as rapidly as a train , only the train in question is Irish , almost as old as he is and until 2007 was delivering freight around the country .
An Irish tourist visiting Iran could n't believe his eyes when he spotted the locomotive fronting an election poster in the centre of Tehran , and forwarded the photo to a friend working for Iarnrod Eireann .
The General Motors 181 was scrapped two years ago , although two of its number are still working .
That said , it did have a 43 - year career , entering service in 1966 .
Yesterday , Iarnrod Eireann said while it did n't support any candidate in the presidential elections , it would have preferred to see one of its new trains on display .
" We fully expected Irish public transport , and our plans to develop the rail service , to feature in our own election campaign last week , but to feature in Iran was a bit of a surprise , " spokesman Barry Kenny said .
The Farsi script on the poster says : " The country is advancing as rapidly as a train . "
The Iranian Embassy said it could not comment on where the image of the locomotive came from , and the office of the president could not be contacted last night .
The embassy reminded Iranians living here to vote on Friday in the presidential election between 9 am and 7 pm in the Iranian Embassy at 72 Mount Merrion Avenue , Blackrock , Co Dublin .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke denied accusations Thursday that he pressured Bank of America to follow through on its purchase of Merrill Lynch late last year or risk having top management removed .
Testifying the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , the central bank chief maintained that his agency acted with the " highest integrity " in dealing with BofA , countering charges made recently by BofA ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) chief Ken Lewis that Bernanke threatened him with his job when his company considered pulling out of the deal .
" I did not tell Bank of America 's management that the Federal Reserve would take action against the board or management , " Bernanke said Thursday .
The Fed chief also rejected the notion that he asked former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to act on his behalf , a claim made by Lewis earlier this year that came to light during a related investigation on Merrill Lynch bonuses .
Thursday 's hearing into Bernanke 's role in the controversial deal comes at a time when the administration is looking to expand the Federal Reserve 's regulatory powers and just months before his term as chairman expires .
Lawmakers have been eager to determine if the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department overstepped their bounds in pushing through the merger .
There have also been questions about whether Bank of America may have used the threat of scuttling the deal as a bargaining chip for additional government assistance .
" We need to get all the facts out on the table before we are in a position to say what happened and when it happened , " committee chairman Rep. Edolphus Towns , D - NY , said Thursday .
Testifying before the same committee two weeks ago , Bank of America 's Lewis offered up his side of the story , saying he and other company executives were not looking for a handout .
Lewis said that BofA approached regulators after discovering the scope of Merrill 's losses late last year .
At the time , Bank of America considered invoking the " material adverse change " or MAC clause , of the deal , which would have allowed Bank of America to walk away from the purchase .
But regulators feared that an unraveling of the deal would jeopardize the health of the U.S. financial system and the two firms themselves .
After some behind - the - scenes wrangling , regulators reached an agreement to give BofA $ 20 billion in aid in January to help them absorb Merrill .
That assistance came on top of the $ 25 billion it received as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
BofA also received loss guarantees on $ 118 billion in assets .
Focus on transparency
At times Bernanke appeared shaken and frustrated by members ' pointed questions about what he did and did not say when the merger appeared as if it might fall apart .
On several occasions Thursday , lawmakers cited a Dec. 20 email by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president Jeffrey Lacker .
In that email , Lacker recounted a conversation with Bernanke , in which Lacker recalled the Fed chief saying that " management is gone " if Lewis tried to invoke the MAC .
Bernanke maintained that he could not remember the details of that conversation , which made for a heated moment with Rep. Dan Burton , R - Ind .
" One of the things that I learned was in order to keep people from perjuring themselves they could n't remember anything .
Are you sure you can't remember ? " asked Burton .
Bernanke clarified Lacker 's comments , noting that what he said was that if Bank of America abandoned the deal and later on needed further government assistance as a result , then the firm would have to answer to regulators .
" I think if somebody makes a decision that results in their company failing and being rescued by the government , I think there should be consequences for them , " he told lawmakers .
Bernanke also modified his " bargaining chip " remark that was widely cited in a Republican memo prepared for Thursday 's hearing .
Bernanke noted that at first he believed Lewis was using the MAC threat to gain more assistance .
But he said Thursday that further talks with Lewis later led him to believe that the BofA chief was just really uncertain about what to do .
As was the case during Lewis ' hearing two weeks ago , members of Congress also seized on the issue of disclosure during Thursday 's hearing .
Bernanke and Paulson have been accused of ordering Lewis not to disclose the details of talks with regulators .
Others have charged that the two men failed to keep their fellow regulators in the loop , namely the Securities and Exchange Commission and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , regarding what was happening with Bank of America .
Bernanke denied claims that he and Paulson tried to keep details of the negotiations with Bank of America a secret .
On Wednesday , Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif , the committee 's ranking member , went so far as to call the Fed 's actions in the BofA - Merrill deal a " cover-up . "
The issue of transparency at the Federal Reserve comes at a critical time .
Lawmakers are carefully considering whether to give the agency a broader regulatory reach , one of the key components of the regulatory reform plan announced by President Obama last week .
This has given some lawmakers pause , particularly in light of what happened with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch .
" We can't afford to make the Fed a super regulator , as some have proposed , without also increasing its transparency in meaningful ways , " said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
My local Whole Foods recycles used batteries .
Staples , the office supply store , takes spent ink cartridges and recycles or refills them .
Even the mechanic around the corner would recycle my old oil filters– if I had a car .

But after doing some spring cleaning this weekend , I was left with a bag full of objects I did n’t just want to throw away .
Was it possible to recycle them ?
I did some quick research online and found out that all my junk was about to become someone else ’s recycled treasure .
Here are five items you might not know you can recycle , along with the information you ’ll need to get them out of your home and into someone else ’s hands :
1. Old Keys :
Photo : Bohman
In the past 10 years , I ’ve lived in at least 11 different apartments in three different countries .
And somehow , I still had at least one set of keys from almost all of them .
I was sure the keys were destined for the landfill , where they ’d take years to break down , but a family in New York collects used keys and recycles the scrap metal , donating all proceeds to the Multiple Sclerosis Society .
Just package up your keys and put them in the mail .
All the information you need can be found here .
This is not a registered charity and the website seems not to have been updated in a couple months , but I ’m willing to accept this trade - off to feel better about not throwing those keys away .
2. Foreign Coins :
What do you do with old coins when you come home from your travels ?
Maybe you have a collection .
I do , too , but it ’s grown way too large , with coins I ’ll never spend spilling onto the bureau .
Three organizations in the UK accept foreign coins , even those currencies that are now obsolete .
The widely recognized Oxfam is one of the organizations ; you can find drop - off locations and shipment addresses here .
If you ’d rather support another cause , the Royal National Institute of Blind People accepts coins for recycling , as does Marie Curie Cancer Care .
Both are registered charities in the UK .
3. CDs , DVDs , and Hard Drives :
As a travel writer who meets frequently with PR and marketing reps around the world , I get lots of promotional material– often stored on CDs or DVDs .
While I ’d like to keep these , the tiny size of my NYC apartment makes doing so unrealistic .
Yet I really hate the idea of throwing these items in the trash and I do n’t want to store all of them until NYC ’s next electronics recycling day .
I was happy to package these up and ship them off to Back Thru the Future , which recycles CDs , DVDs , and even hard drives .
According to the company , a single CD can take one million years to decompose .
And in the manufacture of just 30 CDs , an outrageous amount of resources is used : 300 cubic feet of natural gas , 2 cups of crude oil and 24 gallons of water .
4. iPods :
I wish I did n’t have to recycle my old iPod , but I dropped it in the ocean during a trip to Colombia last summer .
Though it prefers working iPods , which are refurbished and given to kids in hospitals , Recycling for Charities will accept my worse - for - the - wear device .
They also accept used cell phones and other electronics .
Check their site for a full list .
5. Wire Clothes Hangers :
Do n’t ask me how a household accumulates so many clothes hangers because I just do n’t know .
But I want to get rid of them without pitching them in the trash bin .
There are lots of ways to reuse wire hangers , but I ’m not particularly crafty .
I ’ll take this site ’s advice and drop them off at a cleaner ’s service , where they can be reused .
COMMUNITY CONNECTION :
Recycling is just one part of the “ 3 Rs ” equation : reduce and reuse are the other ones .

Read more on AAPL at SAN FRANCISCO  Steve Jobs has vowed to return as Apple CEO this month .
At least on paper and in e-mail , he already has .
Despite questions about his health , Jobs — who has battled pancreatic cancer and has been on medical leave since January — has been in contact with Apple employees the past few weeks via e-mail , three employees told USA TODAY .
They did not speak on the record out of fear of repercussions .
On Monday , Apple ( AAPL ) issued the first public statement from Jobs since he went on leave , underscoring growing sentiment that he will soon return .
" Customers are voting , and the iPhone is winning , " Jobs said in a statement about boffo iPhone sales .
Apple has sold more than 1 million units of its latest iPhone model since Friday , its most successful debut .
The Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that Jobs received a liver transplant in Tennessee two months ago .
The report , citing unnamed sources , said he is likely to work part time at first .
A patient with the type of tumor Jobs was diagnosed with in 2004 may undergo a liver transplant because the original cancer has spread to the liver , says Juan Del Rio Martin , surgical director of liver transplantation at New York 's Mount Sinai Medical Center .
That shows the cancer has advanced .
On the other hand , it also shows that Jobs is well enough to undergo surgery and years of treatment with anti-rejection drugs , says Del Rio Martin , who has no personal knowledge of the case .
The surgery also suggests that the cancer has not spread beyond the liver , he says .
About 75 % of patients survive five years , says Andrew Muir , assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine , who has no personal knowledge of the case .
Patients often can get back to work after six weeks to six months .
" I 've had some patients working on their laptops in the hospital against our wishes , " Muir says .
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling declined to comment on the report of a transplant .
He says Jobs , 54 , " looks forward " to returning to work at the end of the month .
USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify the report .
Jobs ' high profile and Midas touch since his return to Apple in 1996 put him in a unique position , says Charles King , chief analyst at Pund - IT .
The success of the iPod , iPhone and the resurgence of Apple in general were all " intimately guided by the hand of Jobs , " King says .
Apple 's stock has weathered the recession better than most .
Shares have improved 75 % since January .
They fell 1.5 % to $ 137.37 in trading Monday .
The stock owes its ascent to a slew of gadgets and software improvements , including the new iPhone .
Analysts also credit the stewardship of interim CEO Tim Cook , Apple 's respected chief operating officer .

Religious slaughter techniques practised by Jews and Muslims are cruel and should be ended , says a scientific assessment from the Government 's animal welfare advisers .
The Farm Animal Welfare Council says that slitting the throats of the animals most commonly used for meat , chickens , without stunning , results in " significant pain and distress " .
The committee , which includes scientific , agricultural and veterinary experts , is calling for the Government to launch a debate with Muslim and Jewish communities to end the practice .
One Muslim organisation , the Halal Food Authority , already insists on the slaughterhouses it regulates stunning animals first on welfare grounds , as long as they are still alive when their throats are slit .
But in other halal and almost all kosher slaughterhouses , animals have their throats slit without prior stunning which would render them insensible to the pain .
Religious groups say that doing so would be against their interpretation of religious texts .

They are granted an exemption to the Welfare of Animals ( Slaughter or Killing ) Regulations 1995 , which stipulates that creatures such as cows , goats and chickens be stunned first .
In a report into the slaughter of white meat , the Farm Animal Welfare Council ( Fawc ) said evidence suggested that chicken and turkeys were likely to be conscious for up to 20 seconds as blood seeped out of them .
The animals are killed by a transverse incision across their neck , cutting skin , muscle , trachea , oesophagus , carotid arteries , jugular veins and major nerves .
" Such a large cut will inevitably trigger sensory input to pain centres in the brain , " the council said .
" Our conclusions ... are that such an injury would result in significant pain and distress ... before insensibility supervenes .
Fawc is in agreement with the prevailing scientific consensus that slaughter without pre-stunning causes pain and distress .
On the basis that this is avoidable and in the interests of welfare , Fawc concludes that all birds should be pre-stunned before slaughter . "
While recognising the difficulties of reconciling scientific findings with matters of faith , it urged the Government to " continue to engage with religious communities " to make progress .
In a 2003 report on red meat , Fawc called for ministers to repeal the religious groups ' legal opt-out .
The Shechita Council , which oversees kosher meat , was contacted but did not supply a comment .
Massood Khawaja , president of the Halal Food Authority , insisted that its animals were stunned , unlike those regulated by another group , the Halal Monitoring Committee .
" The Koran says use your brain , ponder about things and that 's what we are doing , " he said .
" It 's a question of animal welfare . "
The Government no longer keeps statistics on religious slaughter , but five years ago , the Meat Hygiene Service suggested 114 million animals were killed under halal and 2.1 million under kosher methods each year in Britain .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said it would not change its " long - standing policy of religious tolerance " by ending the opt-out .
" And while the Government would prefer to see all animals stunned before slaughter , we will continue to ensure that required standards of animal welfare are effectively monitored and enforced in all slaughterhouses , " it said in a statement .

Last year , Lord Rooker , a minister in the department , called for meat slaughtered without stunning to be labelled for the public 's benefit , since some cuts were considered unacceptable to eat , and sold back into the food chain .
The Government no longer keeps statistics on religious slaughter , but five years ago the Meat Hygiene Service suggested 114 million were killed under halal and 2.1 million under kosher methods each year .
Last night , the vegetarian organisation Viva ! , Tom Lane , said : “ How many times does the Government 's own advisory committe on animal welfare have to ask for a ban on slaughter without pre-stunning before action is taken ?
Viva !
embraces multiculturlism and all religious faiths , but the suffering of these animals is so extreme that a line has to be drawn somewhere . ”
In the dictionary game , when you 've found a historical example of word that is earlier than anything previously found , it 's called an " antedating . "
Looking for antedatings in American English has been utterly transformed by the advent of digitized newspaper databases .
Now , hot on the heels of my antedating of jazz in New Orleans , I have another early 20th - century discovery to report : from 1901 , the first known proposal for using the title Ms. to refer to a woman regardless of her marital status .
On page 4 of the Springfield ( Mass . )
Sunday Republican of November 10 , 1901 , under the heading " Men , Women and Affairs , " is the following item , in which the writer suggests that " a void in the English language " may be filled by Ms. , pronounced as " Mizz , " as an alternative to Miss or Mrs. :
I 've been on the trail of this historical nugget for a few years now .
Until recently , the earliest known appearance of Ms. was nearly half a century later , from 1949 .
In The Story of Language , Mario Pei wrote : " Feminists , who object to the distinction between Mrs. and Miss and its concomitant revelatory features , have often proposed that the two present - day titles be merged into a single one , ' Miss ' ( to be written ' Ms . ' ) . "
Pei states that Ms. had been " often proposed , " but where were the proposals ?
The closest precursor that had been found was a 1932 letter to the New York Times where the title M's is suggested , not quite the same as Ms .
Some have theorized that Ms. has roots long before the 20th century .
One piece of evidence that has been put forth is the tombstone of Sarah Spooner , who died in 1767 in Plymouth , Massachusetts .
As you can see from this image , what appears on the headstone is M with a superscript s.
As Dennis Baron writes in his excellent book Grammar and Gender ( 1987 ) , " it is certainly an abbreviation of Miss or Mistress , and not an example of colonial language reform or a slip of the chisel , as some have suggested . "
There things stood until 2004 , when I happened upon this tantalizing little notice in the Humeston ( Iowa ) New Era of Dec. 4 , 1901 ( thanks to the Newspaperarchive database ) :
The writer seems confused about the Springfield Republican proposal since he ( or she , but probably he ) guesses that Ms. is an abbreviation of some longer word .
That 's a confusion that persists among those who assume Ms. is an abbreviated form of Miss or Missus , but the Republican article puts forth Ms. without any particular expansion .
I had n't been able to locate the original piece in the Springfield Republican , and was n't even sure if the Springfield in question was in Massachusetts or Missouri .
( Fellow word sleuth Stephen Goranson had suggested Missouri 's Springfield , since the town did have a newspaper back then called the Republican , and it would certainly be closer to Humeston , Iowa .
Plus , would n't it be great if Ms. originated in Mizz - ouri ? )
Finally , progress was made by Fred Shapiro , author of the indispensible Yale Book of Quotations , who managed to find a republished version of the Republican item in the Salt Lake Tribune of November 17 , 1901 .
Shapiro 's discovery prompted me to hit the databases again .
I found that the Republican of Springfield , Massachusetts ( not Missouri ) had been digitized by America 's Historical Newspapers ( Readex / NewsBank ) , the same database that yielded the 1916 citation for jazz from the New Orleans Times - Picayune .
And now that I had the full text of the item as republished in the Salt Lake City paper , I could search on phrases until the original article turned up .
Because the quality of document scanning and character recognition for old newspapers can be so variable , finding the right search terms to match the scanned text can be a real challenge .
It often feels like finding the right incantation to release the proverbial genie in a bottle .
When you do find the right incantation , it 's a great feeling .
It 's one of the joys of the competitive ( and collaborative ) sport of antedating , which I recommend to all word lovers .

Should Guantanamo detainees facing the death penalty for their alleged roles in the 9/11 attack be allowed to plead guilty without ever going to trial ?
I suspect that a strong majority of Americans would say " yes , " with little hesitation ; an Administration proposal to allow pleas in these cases ( reported by the New York Times ) seems likely to encounter opposition primarily from human rights advocates , law professors not occupying the White House , and defense attorneys concerned with the voluntary nature of guilty pleas obtained after torture and years of extra-judicial detention , as well as with the legal and moral propriety of allowing guilty pleas in capital , military commission cases .
( Advocates of assisted suicide might also wonder why alleged 9/11 terrorists should effectively enjoy rights generally denied to the law - abiding , terminally ill . )
The detainees themselves , however , have reportedly indicated their desires to plead guilty , raising awkward questions for attorneys involved in representing or assisting them .
Should they advocate for their clients ' prerogatives to engage in what is probably the only act of self - determination left to them - pleading guilty in a quest for execution and martyrdom ?
Or should Guantanamo detainees who have suffered torture and prolonged imprisonment be considered effectively incompetent to plead ?
In these cases , are the rights of the accused to determine their own fates merely cynical excuses for the government to avoid the demands of due process , more exposure of " enhanced interrogations , " and the trouble of a trial ?
Are there other considerations for attorneys counseling the detainees ?
ACLU lawyer Denny LeBoeuf suggested to the Times that the public interest requires that the detainees be tried , not summarily convicted on the basis of pleas .
" ' Do n't we have an interest as a society , ' Ms. LeBoeuf asked , ' in a trial that examines the evidence and provides some reliable picture of what went on ? ' "
Defense attorneys , however , do n't represent society ( that 's the prosecutor 's job ) ; they represent their clients , obviously .
For counsel to the detainees , the public interest in learning whatever a trial might reveal about 9/11 and our government 's use of torture against the alleged conspirators is secondary , at best , as LeBoeuf understands better than I ; she 's a dedicated , experienced capital defense attorney ( whom I 've known for years . )
So , in advocating for the public interest , LeBoeuf does n't seem to be advocating for the detainees .
But she 's also director of the ACLU 's John Adams Project , established in 2008 and promoted in fund - raising appeals as a groundbreaking initiative to provide defense counsel for these " high value " detainees charged in the 9/11 attack .
LeBoeuf 's remark and her vague identification in the Times as an ACLU lawyer " who works on Guantanamo death penalty issues , " suggests that the John Adams Project is not , in fact , involved in representing the alleged 9/11 conspirators ( unless perhaps the ACLU has a retainer agreement with detainees specifying that its notion of the public interest could govern the representation , which I doubt . )
The ACLU website states that the John Adams Project " has worked with under - resourced military lawyers to provide legal counsel for several of the Guantánamo detainees , " raising questions about whether the ACLU " is working " to assist in their defense and how attorneys might represent simultaneously the public 's interest and the interests of the detainees .

Valve 's E3 announcement that Left 4 Dead 2 would hit this year , almost one year to the day after the original , has seen mixed response .
Nearly 25,000 fans of the original have pledged not to purchase the sequel .
Why ?
Advertisement
As outlined in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group 's manifesto , that group of fans believe that the " stand - alone sequel will split the communities and decrease the quality of multiplayer gaming . "
Miffed fans believe that the content so far revealed " does not warrant a stand - alone , full - priced sequel and should instead become updates ( free or otherwise ) " for the original Left 4 Dead .

We asked Valve for a response to those claims .
" Doing a sequel in one year is new for Valve .
But providing ongoing support for our titles after the initial launch is n't - it has been part of our philosophy since Half - Life was released ten and half years ago , " said Valve president Gabe Newell in a statement to Kotaku .
" We see no reason to change that and will continue to support the over three million customers in the L4D community . "
" E3 is a trade event where developers and publishers come to announce new games for the coming year .
L4D2 — like any new product — requires an appearance at the show , " Newell said .
Valve says , it will continue to support the original with continued updates .
" Some in the community are concerned that the announcement of L4D2 implied a change in our plans for L4D1 .
We are n't changing our plans for L4D1 . "

Whether that will allay fears that Left 4 Dead will be left behind by some community members remains to be seen , but Valve notes that it has n't abandoned the original .
" In addition to the recently released Survival Pack , we are releasing authoring tools for Mod makers , community matchmaking , 4x4 matchmaking , and more new content during the coming months for L4D1 , " Newell says .
" We also agree with our customers that there needs to be an interoperability plan for players of L4D1 and L4D2 , as multiplayer games are driven by the cohesiveness of their community . "

When we first went hands - on with the Steam version of Left 4 Dead 2 at E3 , we felt that the title felt awfully similar to the original .
Some of that may simply be due to incremental updates already revealed .
As Valve 's Chet Faliszek told us at the time , there are still plenty of details left to be doled out , including information on new weapons , two new Special Infected types and more .
Left 4 Dead 2 Extended Impressions
Yes , Left 4 Dead 2's release is shockingly close to the release of the original Left 4 Dead .

Faliszek said at E3 that he very much understood the " gut reaction " to the uncharacteristically Valve move to launch such a quick follow - up .
But , he said , as people learn more about the game over the next few months , they 'll see why " none of the additions [ in Left 4 Dead 2 ] are trivial . "
In recent years , pediatricians and researchers in this country have been giving bullies and their victims the attention they have long deserved  and have long received in Europe .
We ’ve gotten past the “ kids will be kids ” notion that bullying is a normal part of childhood or the prelude to a successful life strategy .
Research has described long - term risks  not just to victims , who may be more likely than their peers to experience depression and suicidal thoughts , but to the bullies themselves , who are less likely to finish school or hold down a job .
Next month , the American Academy of Pediatrics will publish the new version of an official policy statement on the pediatrician ’s role in preventing youth violence .
For the first time , it will have a section on bullying  including a recommendation that schools adopt a prevention model developed by Dan Olweus , a research professor of psychology at the University of Bergen , Norway , who first began studying the phenomenon of school bullying in Scandinavia in the 1970s .
The programs , he said , “ work at the school level and the classroom level and at the individual level ; they combine preventive programs and directly addressing children who are involved or identified as bullies or victims or both . ”
Dr. Robert Sege , chief of ambulatory pediatrics at Boston Medical Center and a lead author of the new policy statement , says the Olweus approach focuses attention on the largest group of children , the bystanders .
“ Olweus ’s genius , ” he said , “ is that he manages to turn the school situation around so the other kids realize that the bully is someone who has a problem managing his or her behavior , and the victim is someone they can protect . ”
The other lead author , Dr. Joseph Wright , senior vice president at Children ’s National Medical Center in Washington and the chairman of the pediatrics academy ’s committee on violence prevention , notes that a quarter of all children report that they have been involved in bullying , either as bullies or as victims .
Protecting children from intentional injury is a central task of pediatricians , he said , and “ bullying prevention is a subset of that activity . ”
By definition , bullying involves repetition ; a child is repeatedly the target of taunts or physical attacks  or , in the case of so - called indirect bullying ( more common among girls ) , rumors and social exclusion .
For a successful anti-bullying program , the school needs to survey the children and find out the details  where it happens , when it happens .

REMEMBER THOSE TV ads in which a razor traversed the skin of a man 's cheek , twin blades the size of aircraft propellers hacking into hairs giant as flax leaves ?
No ?
Well , they did air in 1971 but are probably somewhere on YouTube .
The first blade lifted the hair as it cut and the second slashed through it , leaving the hair to slip , beaten and bowed , beneath the surface of a face as smooth and huge as a hot - air balloon .
Neat , clean , sleek .
So how come we now have three , four and five blades on our razors ?
It turns out those ads were n't exactly lying , but they were n't telling the entire truth .
They demonstrated a new shaving discovery , " the hysteresis effect " , in which the cut hair protrudes temporarily above the skin .
What shaver - makers did n't have so much of a handle on back in the early 1970s were things like " interblade span " , " skin bulge " , " frictional characteristics " and that must - have : " rinsibility " .
Kevin Powell can't be blamed for that simplistic ad science moves on , and anyway in 1971 he was three years old .
Though he can be blamed for the above shaving jargon and any other in this story .
Powell is lab director at Gillette 's research centre in Reading , near London , and his PhD in ceramics engineering did lead him to working with jet engines at Rolls Royce and missile guidance at the UK Ministry of Defence before he moved , inevitably , into razors .
Powell , who 's one of those chatty , enthusiastic , likeable boffins with an unplaceable southern English accent , says blade - makers did actually know about the interblade effect in 1970s having the right distance between blades reduces skin bulge and so drag but the technology did n't exist .
There was too much variation in the production of the blades .
And since then they have also solved the problem of close blades clogging up by using narrow blade supports , easing many a man 's nightmare about insufficient rinsibility .
But the quest for the perfect razor goes on .
And it's all about the customer , Powell insists .
The multiple blades , the pivoting head , the glide strip , the battery - powered vibrations to further reduce drag , the trimming blade on the back for sculpting facial hair it's what men said they wanted , he says .
Gillette 's Mach3 delivered a pretty good shave , he says after spending a reported $ US750 million on research and testing yet the chimera of perfection beckoned .
The customer wanted more , more , more or so we are told .
Competition is fierce .
Why ?
Because the market for non-disposable razors in this tiny country of two million men is worth about $ 30 million a year , Dave McLeod , the New Zealand manager of market minnow King of Shaves , told the Sunday Star - Times last year .
The separate shaving preparations market is worth about a third of that .
In the US the male razor market tops $ US2 billion .
Gillette claims about 70 % of the market here , which is typical .
Schick - Wilkinson Sword , now owned by Energizer , the batteries people , is probably its fiercest rival , with others like Super - Max and King of Shaves biting at their spring - loaded heels .
Lawsuits frequently fly over intellectual property shavers are some of the most patented consumer products around .
Gillette almost certainly spends the most to maintain its lead .
It would n't tell us how much but its owner , Proctor & Gamble , whose products range from pet food to Old Spice to CoverGirl makeup to Braun electric shavers , spends $ US2 billion a year .
Men are the market lodestone for razors , as we shave four or five times a week compared to women 's paltry once or twice .
So what else has the male shaver been asking for ?
Says Powell : " He was telling us he was looking for further comfort during the stroke , less pulling on his face , greater improvement in safety , so fewer nicks and cuts and less irritation , and he was looking for an improvement in manoeuvring in hard - to - reach places . "
Greater comfort came from less bulge , which came from changing that interblade span .
In the Mach3 , the blades were 1.5 mm apart ; in Fusion they are just over 1 mm .
" What you get when you do that literally we measure the bulges that form on people 's skin , kinda fun you can see a 45 % reduction in the skin bulge height .
That 's what translates into them saying , `wow , this is a helluva lot more comfortable , it 's an awful lot safer , there 's less irritation , there 's an awful lot less nicking and cutting ' .
So the science is critical to quantify what the consumer is telling us , and then to measure that indeed our concepts are delivering against his needs . "
His needs .
What if his needs do n't quite stretch to paying more than $ 5 for each of the Fusion Phenom cartridges ?
I tried the Phenom and it gives a damned good shave , but Schick 's Quattro probably does a reasonable job , as do the many cheaper three - blade options .
But then I can get two months of shaving for $ 5 out of the safety razor I started using last year .
There 's a recession on , you know .
Do n't underestimate the power of the brand .
Brands hold emotional sway over us , says Richard Bourke , of market research company Big Picture .
Because grooming is closely tied up with power and status and fashion and attractiveness , many people will pay a premium for such products .
He says there is always " some level of resistance to the latest and greatest " , and some will " trade down " if it 's just one more blade or some magic ingredient , but that 's a functional judgment .
If your emotional bond to the brand is strong , there is " price elasticity " that is , we will pay whatever it costs .
And that technology costs all right .
Forget the laser - guided 3D prototyping machines that can crank out a plastic model overnight .
If one of those stainless steel blades is off by the radius of human hair 40 micrometres the result is a bad shave .
If the tip of the blade , with its coatings of ultra - hard carbon and Teflon - like material , is out by a tenth of a nanometre , a billionth of a metre , same thing .
" We 're talking about hundreds of atoms here .
You just wo n't find another mass - produced consumer product good that has to do that .
So it 's absolutely phenomenal the level of precision that guys demand . "
Sheez , we are hard to please .
If you have been thinking about those two blades in 1971 and wondering how many blades will be enough , the answer seems to be about five plus one on the back .
Powell says the number of blades is " pretty well optimised " , and " a good shave is about skin management " more than an increasing number of blades .
Powell says his customers still see value for money in the latest razors ( as do thieves razor blades are the items most often stolen from supermarkets ) .
" We would never put out anything that is not something that he wants and that delivers on what he wants .
" There is never a gimmick we only put in to these razors what physically deliver for customers .
I am sure there are price points at which the benefit that you 're giving does not equal the price point .
What we call the consumer value equation .
" But quite frankly , we are mostly definitely not there . "

Dressed in OR greens and speaking to an off - screen interviewer , past Canadian Medical Association president Brian Day is being featured in a new million - dollar ad campaign in the United States touting the benefits of competition and privatization in health care .
" Patients are languishing and suffering on wait lists , " Day says in the ads .
" Our own Supreme Court of Canada has stated that patients are actually dying as they wait for care in Canada . "
Day told the Star the clips in the ads are from a half - hour interview he gave for a forthcoming documentary on health care by the same people who put together the ads .
" They 've obviously edited them to suit their message , " said Day , owner of a private surgery clinic in Vancouver .
In the parts of the interview not shown , Day said he criticized the U.S. system for leaving 47 million people without insurance .
" The U.S. system is a poor model to emulate . "
Day said , however , that while incomplete , the ads airing on CNN and Fox News do not misrepresent what he said .
In the ads , Day calls Canadian medicare a " dysfunctional system in need of reform . "
The ad campaign , sponsored by the Conservative Patients ' Rights Action Fund , is aimed at heading off health - care reforms in the U.S. and includes an online component with interviews at facesofgovernmenthealthcare.com and on YouTube .
" Tell Congress you wo n't trade your doctor for a national board of bureaucrats , " Rick Scott , founder of the patients ' rights fund , says in another ad .
" Let 's put patients first . "
In the online ads , Day touts privatization and competition as a cure to Canadian health - care woes .
" Privatization introduces that necessary component of competition , of a market that that will influence and be a yardstick for the public system , " he tells interviewer Gene Randall , a former CNN and NBC correspondent .
Day served as CMA president for one year until last August .
During his term , he pushed what he called a " European " system mixing public and private care , a campaign continued by his successor , Dr. Robert Ouellet .
The ads also feature patients and doctors from Canada and Europe describing their bad experiences with government - run medical care .
The spots inspired anti-privatization activists in Canada to write U.S. President Barack Obama , urging him to ignore the ads in general – and Day in particular .
" Mr. President , we urge you to listen to Canadians , and not to Dr. Day and those who want to introduce more private , for - profit health services into Canada and the United States , " reads the letter sent Thursday by Michael McBane of the Canadian Health Coalition .

Protecting Your Information
So , what does ID spoofing mean ?
This simple and easy to use process allows you to change your caller ID display , changing the caller identification when they receive a phone call or text message .
More than just changing caller ID authentications , users can choose their voice tone from male / female , record conversations and send SMS messages .
In a tech - forward world , it is more important than ever to protect your personal information .
Telephones are useful tools but it can also be frustrating to put up with unwanted return calls , so protect your caller ID information from the outset .
When you need to make a call , hang up and call using SpoofTel minutes instead .
The Uses of Caller ID Spoofing
Using SpoofTel can help to disguise an incoming call and help to avoid unwanted calls but the best part is how easy is it to use .
When you are ready to start using caller ID spoofing , simply sign up and purchase Spoof minutes .
Services can be used over the internet or through one of our U.S or Canadian toll - free numbers !
American and Canadian anti-fraud centres warn against revealing contact information such as phone numbers , but this can be tough .
Using a masked number can help to avoid frustrating telemarketing calls and potential fraud .
Spoofed calls mean peace of mind for users .
Changing caller ID can help to protect against serious issues like fraud but it can also help with daily challenges .
Working remotely means giving colleagues access to your personal phone numbers and putting yourself on call 24/ 7 .
Keep your personal numbers personal by using SpoofTel for those work and conference calls .
Whether you are looking to block calls , build a barrier around your personal life or protect your information , SpoofTel has got a solution for you .
In Part I of our review of the Palm Pre and webOS , I attempted to place Palm 's new mobile phone within its proper context as a cloud messaging device .
The focus of that installment was on showing how Palm plans to do for social networking and cloud - based messaging what the BlackBerry did for business email and what the iPhone did for portable media .
In this respect , Palm is ultimately aiming at the business market , which is dominated by RIM .
But there 's no denying that , whatever Palm 's ultimate goals with their nascent line of webOS - based phones , consumers are still evaluating the Pre and the iPhone side - by - side .
And this is appropriate , because the Pre is the first phone to actually take the iPhone as a starting point and build on it , as opposed to merely attempting to ape certain aspects of Apple 's groundbreaking interface .
So in this installment , I 'll shift from the Pre / BlackBerry discussion of the Part I to a more detailed contrast with Apple 's iPhone .
The iPhone contrast is useful from a UI and usability perspective , because the webOS represents an attempt to take what worked in the iPhone 's interface and adapt it to a different information management paradigm ( more on this below ) .
Ultimately , all comparisons and contrasts with RIM and Apple products aside , this review is an attempt to evaluate the Pre on its home turf — as a cloud communication device and mobile multitasking application platform .
There 's another installment to be written about the Pre 's media capabilities ( photos , bluetooth stereo , audio and video playback , battery life during media playback , etc. ) and how well it does or does n't fit in the iLife ecosystem , and if there 's demand for that I can do it as a third installment .
Starting points
Many of the comments on Part I of this review are perfect examples of the fact that our focus on where a particular device is now — or where it might go with the next update — often completely crowds out any memory of where that device started .
In the iPhone 's case , whatever Apple 's mobile may have evolved into , its origins are very straightforward : in the keynote that introduced the iPhone to the world , Jobs described the device as a fusion of three products : a " widescreen iPod with touch controls , " a phone , and an " Internet communications device " .
And thus it remains ; the iPhone is a widescreen , networked media player that also does a bunch of other stuff , telephony and Internet included .
The Pre , in contrast , was introduced by Rubenstein as a cloud messaging device that also does a bunch of other stuff , media playback included .
And this primary messaging orientation has had as deep an impact on every aspect of webOS as the iPhone 's media orientation has had on the iPhone OS .
To take a step back for a moment , it 's useful to contrast where the iPhone and the Pre started out in the areas of connections and sync , interface , and multitasking .
i Phone OS
Connections and sync : Tethered to a single computer ( later to a single MobileMe account ) , and linked to a set of application - specific data silos .
The data silos are a finite repository of structured data that is organized for browsing .

Multitasking : Multitasking is presumed from the start , since the communications apps run as background processes .
The contrasts above represent the lens through which you can view nearly all aspects of the two devices ' respective designs , both the good and the bad .
But there 's an even deeper , more fundamental contrast expressed in the lists above , and it goes to the heart of how we organize and discover information .
Yahoo , Google , and the Wheel of ( Web ) Reincarnation
One of the established truths of the past 50 years of computing is that the same basic problems crop up over and over again in different forms , so that technological advances are less of a linear march forward than they are a sort of spiral that turns the same corners again and again , but on a different level with each rotation .
The same dynamic is at work on the Web , and in my 15 years of using the Internet I 've seen the experience of information discovery and management move back and forth between two distinct paradigms .
The first of these paradigms is exemplified by the early Yahoo !
directory , and I 'll call it the structure - and - browse paradigm .
The idea here is that with a small enough data flow , you can manage incoming information by structuring it yourself , the way that Yahoo !
used humans to sort newly created webpages into categories , creating a kind of giant card catalog for the Internet .
You then browse the resulting structure in order to find what you 're looking for .
There 's a threshold , though , beyond which the volume of data is so high that structure - and - browse becomes a losing battle .
It 's at this point that the second paradigm , which I 'll call collect - and - query , becomes the best way to deal with the mass of unstructured data .
This latter paradigm is exemplified by Google 's approach to information discovery , and it always comes second because it involves swapping human effort for a combination of storage ( =collect ) , bandwidth , and compute cycles ( =query ) .
So these resources have to become cheap enough relative to person - hours to make this tradeoff work .
The contrast between the iPhone OS and Palm 's webOS exemplifies the latest turn of this wheel , driven by the same dynamic of ever - cheapening processor cycles , bandwidth , and storage .
To recap a bit from the previous installment of this review , the iPhone — and , indeed , the entire Apple ecosystem — presumes that your contacts exist as an information repository , the canonical copy of which exists either on your Mac or on the company 's MobileMe servers .
It 's up to you to actively curate this repository , adding structure to it by putting contacts into groups and generally organizing the repository so that it 's easily browsable .
This structure - and - browse approach is a great , time - honored way to manage a finite collection of digital objects ( media files are the best examples ) , and Apple has perfected it across its entire line of products , including the iPhone .
Browsing structured data is , in fact , the default mode of interaction with every single Apple product — from the Finder to iTunes to the iPod and iPhone .
Palm 's webOS , in contrast , is built around the collect - and - query paradigm .
The current crop of default apps presume , fairly consistently , that the first thing you 'll do by way of interacting with them is to begin typing on the hardware keyboard .
Maybe you 're looking for a specific contact , app , or Web history item — regardless , webOS wants you to start typing , even in situations where you also have the option to browse .
At the core of this approach is the global search menu , which Rubenstein rightly made a big deal of in his CES keynote .
If you open the Pre and start typing , global search starts combing your apps , contacts , Web bookmarks , and other on - device directories , and if it can't find a match there it offers you the option of searching Google , Wikipedia , and Twitter .
webOS global search screen
Note that if you start typing on the keys that double as a number pad , it gives you the option to dial a number first :
In the screenshot above , you can see that the search box interprets my input as both the number 5 and the letter " F " simultaneously .
As we go through the major features of the Pre , we 'll see this collect - and - query approach play out time and time again , in the way that different applications work .
And in the few places where it 's conspicuously absent , we 'll notice the omission all the more .
Tomorrow I am traveling to CERN , where I have been invited to give a seminar at a meeting of the LHCb experiment .
My talk will discuss the issue of the , a topic to which I have devoted a good part of my research time for the last thirteen years .
The talk will of course be centred on the explanation of the analysis Julien Donini and I , together with a few colleagues , performed in CDF a few years ago , the search for Z boson decays to b-quark jet pairs .
I have in the pipeline a simpler article than the present one , where I explain why b-quark jets are special , and what makes them so important at hadron colliders ( it is all about the Higgs , the top quark , and new physics searches , as you will learn in the next piece ) .
Here , however , I wish to get away with just a slide show : I am offering to you a preliminary version of the slides of my seminar , with minimal commentary .
Of course , many of you will find the slides unintelligible , and I can not do much to prevent that .
This is thus an " experts only " post , but if you hang around anyway you might find something interesting and understandable in it nonetheless ...
So here we go .
Slide three ( well , yeah .
Slides one and two are just a header and a summary ... ) : the Tevatron collider .
Here I want to give some information on the running performance of this incredible machine , and point out that if it continues to perform as it is presently doing , a first evidence of the Higgs boson might be at reach of CDF and DZERO .
Slide four :
Just a descriptive summary of the CDF detector and its history .
Slide five : some detail of the important parts of CDF .
From top to bottom the pictures show the silicon inner detector , a drawing of CDF with the inner region exposed ( the tracking system is inside the red layer , which is the electromagnetic calorimeter ) , and the central drift tracker .
Slide six : the trigger system of CDF .
Here the three - level architecture of the system is discussed .
The trigger , in case you are wondering , is the system which decided online which collisions to filter and save to mass storage .
Slide seven : SVT is the heart of the Run II CDF trigger system .
With it , b-quarks are collected with high efficiency .
On the left a cartoon shows the function of the SVT associative memory bank , which matches patterns to the reconstructed track segments .
The center plot shows the large sample of hadronic B meson decays , which among other things granted CDF the first measurement of B_s oscillations ; on the right , the inventor of the device , Luciano Ristori .
Incidentally Luciano has recently been awarded the Panofsky prize for the SVT , together with Aldo Menzione .
Slide eight : just an introduction on hadronic jets and their reconstruction .
The cartoon on the right shows what happens when protons and antiprotons collide : a parton jet arises on one side of the event , and particles are created , which then interact and are destroyed in the calorimeter , where we measure the energy of the jet , and try to figure out what the energy of the originating quark was .
Slide nine : here I make a couple of points about the goals of jet clustering .
Slide ten : this is a roll - out display of the CDF calorimeter .
In the grid - so - called eta- phi plane , basically a two - dimensional plane constructed on two angles describing the outgoing direction of the particles - the towers show the energy deposits from an energetic event .
As you see there are clusters of energy scattered around , and different clustering algorithms " see " - interpret - these clusters as jets in different ways .
Slide eleven : some details of the algorithm of choice by CDF in Run II .
Slide twelve : an explanation of the algorithm that corrects the measured jet energy to make it match as closely as possible the energy possessed by the parent quark which originated it .
Slide thirteen : a few plots that describe how the response of the CDF calorimeter to jet energy is equalized for disuniformities as a function of angle of incidence ( bottom left ) , and how the study of the calorimeter response to single particles ( top right , single particles in data ; and center right , pions from test - beam runs ) allows to tune the simulation , which is then used to get an absolute correction function ( bottom right ) .
Slide fourteen : this graph shows the energy behaviour of the biggest sources of systematic uncertainty on jet energy measurement .
As you can see , at low energy the out - of - cone uncertainty - the unknown fraction of energy that flows out of a cone of fixed R=0.7 radius - dominates all others .
Slide fifteen : this introduces the issue of b-jets , and why they are different .
The graph demonstrates that the fraction of energy of a b - jet which is measured in the calorimeter ( in blue or red ) is smaller than for generic jets ( the black curve ) .
Slide sixteen : some more detail on the various sources of uncertainty from the b- jet energy scale , and the impact on the uncertainty on the measured top quark mass ( which uses the b - jet energy measurement , of course ) .
Slide seventeen : still some detail on generator - level issues - herwig and pythia , the two simulation programs , possess some tunable parameters which have an impact on the measured b- jet energy .
Slide eighteen : the way the b-quark originates a stream of hadrons as it " fragments " is well - known from studies performed at LEP ; however , some uncertainties from the modeling of fragmentations still exist .
Slide nineteen : the pattern of possible decays of B hadrons has a clear effect on the fraction of energy that we can measure from a b- quark jet : that is because we do not measure neutrinos - which escape unseen - and also muons provide a small calorimeter response ; electrons , on the other hand , over - compensate .
Slide twenty : the Z decay to b-quark pairs was found already in Run I at CDF - I should know it , I did it by myself for my PhD thesis !
This is just an introductory slide of the problem .
On the top right you can see a figure of historical value : it is the first publication which measured the top quark mass , by CDF in 1994 - when the top quark had not been discovered officially yet .
On the picture below the plot , you can see the detector which made it possible , the SVX - a four - layer barrel of silicon microstrip sensors .
Slide twentyone : this shows the signal I found in 1998 from the 100 inverse picobarns of Run I data .
The plots on the right show two different means of extracting the signal : a counting experiment ( top ) , and a unbinned likelihood fit ( bottom ) .
The other twentyone slides will be posted tomorrow ...

Some French guy is working on his MacBook laptop when suddenly it begins to transform into a spaceship then flies away .
Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said debris found in the south Atlantic is without a doubt from the Air France flight that disappeared this week with 228 people on board .
Brazilian search planes spotted airplane seats , metal parts , and a jet fuel slick floating Tuesday about 650 kilometers off the Brazilian coast .
Jobim said a close examination by two Brazilian naval vessels confirmed the floating wreckage came from Air France Flight 447 .
There was no trace of any survivors .
The big Airbus jet disappeared from radar early Monday , about four hours after taking off from Rio de Janeiro Sunday night on its way to Paris .
The cause of the crash remains a mystery .
Before it vanished from radar , the plane transmitted automatic signals reporting multiple failures in its electric and pressurization system .
Air traffic controllers heard no distress call -- or any other unusual message -- from the pilots , however .
The plane 's flight path took it across an equatorial zone where weather systems collide and often spawn severe thunders torms .
Modern airliners usually have no trouble passing through such weather conditions .
France is sending deep - diving , unmanned submarines to search for the jet 's flight data recorders .
The ocean in the area where the plane apparently went down could be up to 5,000 - meters - deep .
Some information for this report was provided by AFP , AP and Reuters .
One of the longest - running battles in the recording industry 's war against file - sharing appears to have finally come to an end .
Michelle ( age 22 ) and Robert ( age 18 ) Santangelo have settled a lawsuit filed against them by the RIAA in November 2006 for P2P use that occurred when Michelle was 15 and Robert 11 .
The siblings will pay the RIAA a total of $ 7,000 in installments due by November of this year — a paltry sum given that the RIAA started its settlement offers in the $ 3,000 - 4,000 range and often raised the cost if the defendant contested the charges in court .
The RIAA had originally sued their mother , Patricia , in February 2005 .
Having no knowledge of how to download music , she denied the allegations and soon found herself preparing for trial — despite the fact that the judge presiding over the case called her " an Internet - illiterate parent , who does not know Kazaa from kazoo , and who can barely retrieve her e-mail . "
Like the thousands of others who were targeted by the RIAA , she could have made the problem go away with a check for $ 4,000 .
Instead , she spent over $ 24,000 defending herself against the charges before running out of money and firing her lawyer ( a fundraising campaign raised an additional $ 15,000 for her defense ) .
During discovery , Patricia Santangelo's hard drive was turned over to RIAA forensic investigators who found KaZaA installed and set to share music .
Her defense was that a friend of her children installed the program on the family PC .
The RIAA was eventually convinced that Patricia was not responsible for the P2P action and dismissed the lawsuit against her in April 2006 .
After filing suit against Robert and Michelle , the RIAA was able to obtain a default judgment for $ 30,750 against Michelle , who never responded to the original lawsuit .
That judgment was later overturned .
As the case made its slow way through the courts , a friend of Robert 's testified under oath that Robert had downloaded KaZaA and used it " almost daily ; " Michelle eventually copped to P2P use in a deposition .
Under the terms of the settlement , the two have to make six payments of $ 583.33 by October after paying half of the settlement up front .
Family attorney Jordan Glass told the AP that Robert and Michelle did not admit to any wrongdoing ; instead , they settled the lawsuit in order to control costs and move on .
" Sometimes you reduce the damages so much it 's time to call it quits , " Glass said .
The RIAA is also glad the case is over .
" We 're pleased to have settled our case with the Santangelos , " director of communications Cara Duckworth told Ars .
But for the RIAA , $ 7,000 wo n't even begin to cover the hundreds ( thousands ? ) of billable hours it incurred over four years of litigation ( and it may have been able to win had the case gone to trial ) .
But the group has never claimed that the years - long legal campaign was about the money — it was always about sending a message and deterring copyright infringement .
I work in a police dept .
doing IT in the Madison Area .
Every time police go to a location , the GPS coordinates are logged into a server .
Every single squad car has a GPS device and is tracked at all times .
In the case of the officers it 's important because if an officer can't talk on their radio , dispatch still knows where they are .
Personally , I think the police can get a lot more done if they do n't have to physically follow someone .
Ever heard of a stakeout ?
GPS tracking on a car is much less of an invasion of privacy than a detective watching your every move .
I do n't see what the problem is .
It saves the taxpayers a lot of money when they 're not paying a cop to sit and watch someone all day .
If you read the article you 'd also note that GPS tracking was used to determine that a man was stalking a woman who had come to them with a complaint and he was arrested and charged based on the evidence .
Also , most phones have GPS and if you do n't have it turned off , you can be tracked in much more detail than with a unit on a car .
So this is making a stink but everyone 's already forgotten about Bush 's warrentless wire - tapping .
I 'd rather be tagged than tapped .
Ally Bank Review w. 1,100 + User Reviews
After being GMAC
Bank first and then changing it ’s name to Ally Bank , everyone ’s no doubt seen the new advertisements that emphasizes no fine print .
With the bank being connected with General Motors , the first thing I can think of is whether my money will be safe .
Of course , I went to research further before my readers could be ripped off with this bank so this review represents my opinion of putting money with its savings account offering .

Safety of Ally Bank
First things first , Ally Bank saving accounts and CDs are all FDIC insured so our money is safe for up to $ 250 k per account .
There are ways to increase the amount covered even further , but you would need to open individual , joint , and accounts under other entities such as a trust to get a higher limit .
( Another way is to just open accounts across different banks , which might be easier . )
Products Offered from the Online Bank
Ally Bank offers 2 main products that we are really concerned about – an online savings account and a certificate of deposit with above average rates .
The extremely good interest rates for this type of product and the bank being FDIC insured prompt me to open an account with them .
When I opened an account , it was also nice to see that I can actually open multiple savings accounts and certificate deposits all on one screen .
No more submitting multiple applications and spending time filling the exact same form more than necessary .
Ally Bank is Another Excellent Option
There ’s really many options out there to compete for our money , but it ’s nice to see a bank with competitive rates with a simple interface .
The name GMAC may spook you in opening an account , but the safety of the FDIC guarantee should provide comfort , especially since you are getting more interest by going with them .
After 2 years of originally reviewing this bank , I am still an Ally Bank customer .
But before you decide , make sure that you read through some of the other user reviews below .
Though most people only speak up when they have a problem , you can get an idea of the types of issues people have with their accounts .

Is GMAC Really GM ?
Many people asked me about this already , and I actually had the same question myself .
I always thought that GMAC Financial Services was part of General Motors but I was wrong .
GMAC is actually a standalone banking operation that provides lending and banking services .
The difference with GMAC to a traditional loan company is that instead of offering mortgages and home equities to consumers , GMAC offers loans and lending to GM and Chrysler dealers to finance their operations .
Ally Bank is just one of the online banks we reviewed on MoneyNing.com .

Advertisement BNP leader Nick Griffin has been pelted with eggs and forced to abandon a press conference outside Parliament .
Dozens of protesters disrupted the event , which follows the British National Party winning its first two seats in the European Parliament .
Chanting anti-Nazi slogans and holding placards they surrounded Mr Griffin as he was bundled into a car .
Mr Griffin was elected for the North West region - a result condemned by parties across the political spectrum .
Mr Griffin and Andrew Brons , who was elected in the Yorkshire and Humber region , staged a press conference on College Green , opposite the Houses of Parliament .
The BNP leader began the event by holding up copies of national newspapers and talking about what he said were media lies about him and his party .
Scuffle
He denied he had past links with Oswald Mosley , as the former fascist leader " was very hostile to the National Front from which I am from " .
He had been speaking for about two minutes when about 50 to 100 protesters marched towards him chanting slogans and throwing eggs .
Nick Griffin was forced to retreat from college green
There was a brief scuffle as Mr Griffin was jostled by protesters - and a scrum of cameramen - before the BNP leader was bundled into the back seat of a waiting car by his security men .
A tourist who was caught up in the melee was treated in an ambulance , after suffering an injured leg .
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said : " We are aware of the incident and will pursue charges if a complaint is made . "
' Low turnout ' Members of Unite Against Fascism , a new group supported by trade unions and MPs from all parties , including Tory leader David Cameron , and veteran left wing campaigner Tony Benn , said they wanted to " defend democracy " against what they regard as the " fascist " and " racist " policies of the BNP .
One told the crowd his message for Mr Griffin was : " Wherever you go in this country we will make sure you are welcomed by demonstrations . "
The demonstrators kicked and hit the BNP leader 's car with their placards before cheering as he drove off .
Protest organiser Weyman Bennett , national secretary of Unite Against Fascism , said he believed it was important to stand up to the BNP .
" The majority of people did not vote for the BNP , they did not vote at all .
The BNP was able to dupe them into saying that they had an answer to people 's problems .

" They presented themselves as a mainstream party .
The reality was because the turnout was so low , they actually got elected . "
Speaking to BBC
News afterwards , Mr Griffin alleged that the three main political parties were trying to prevent the BNP getting its message across by colluding with protesters who he said were mainly left - wing students .
" It 's a very , very sad day for British democracy , " he said .
" People should be entitled to hear what we have to say and to hear journalists question us robustly . "
He described protesters as an " organised mob that 's backed by all three main parties to stop us getting our message across to the public " and added : " It does not represent ordinary people . "
He said he suffered only a " glancing splattering " with egg but a television cameraman was hit full in the face .
' Terrible thing '
He says the BNP is not racist and says it won votes because it " spoke openly about the problem of immigration " .
And he argued that the " political elite " were responsible for making " the indigenous British majority ... second class citizens in every possible sphere " .
Mr Griffin said the BNP plans to hold a press conference in Manchester tomorrow and he hopes that the police will take action against any violent protests .
On Monday Tory leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said they were " sickened " by the BNP 's win and Labour deputy Harriet Harman said it was " a terrible thing " .
The number of people voting BNP across the UK as a whole went up slightly , from 808,201 to 943,598 in the European elections , but went down slightly in the two regions where it gained MEPs , with the party benefitting from a collapse in the Labour vote .
They won 6.2 % of votes , compared with 8.6 % for the Green Party , 13.7 % for the Lib Dems , 15.7 % for Labour , 16.5 % for the UK Independence Party and 27.7 % for the Conservatives .

WEED MAN
By John McCaslin
Thomas Nelson , $ 24.99 , 300 pages
REVIEWED BY JOHN WEISMAN
Can a nice white boy from Harbour Island ( a tiny Eden - like island off Eleuthera in the Bahamas ) , a kid who does n’t drink or smoke or do ganja , become a top - tier kickboxer , make millions as a marijuana smuggler , go to Prince Charles ’ wedding to Diana Spencer , live the good life , get busted and come out the other end a nice white boy who still lives on Harbour Island ?
That ’s the premise of award - winning Washington Times columnist John McCaslin ’s “ Weed Man , ” the incredible story of a Conchy Joe ( that ’s how white Bahamians are known ) named Jimmy Moree , aka Jimmy Divine .
The majority of the story takes place in the 1970s .
Barely out of his teens , newly married and running a dive shop on Treasure Cay in the northern Bahamas , Jimmy was jogging on the beach , “ rounded a point and had fun trying to jump over a large bale of what appeared to be hay .
‘ I ran a bit farther along the beach and there was another bale , wrapped in burlap like the other one , with three stripes on it , ’ Jimmy recalls .
‘ And that ’s when I said to myself , What ’s hay doing in the Bahamas ?
So I stopped jogging and noticed that other bales were floating in with the surf .
And then it hit me :
This is n’t hay .
This is weed . ’”
Forty bales of Colombian weed , to be exact .
Forty bales of high - octane Colombian rocket fuel weed , to be more exact .
Jimmy immediately reported what he ’d found to his friend Sarge , a Royal Bahamas Police officer whose immediate reaction ( and reported straight - faced by Mr. McCaslin ) was : “ Do you know anybody who might want to buy it ? ”
It turns out that Jimmy did : a 270 - pound Conchy Joe known as the Chief .
The Chief , a native Bahamian , had made his name in London as the executive chef at the five - star Dorchester Hotel , then moved to Paris where he cooked at the George V Hotel .
But the Chief missed his Bahamian roots .
“ He packed up his kitchen knives and mixing spoons , ” Mr. McCaslin writes , “ and , upon arriving in Nassau , launched a catering business that would in time provide its customers with more than food and beverage . ”
The Chief sold Jimmy ’s 40 bales ( that Sarge had conveniently stored in the local police station for safekeeping ) .
And proving that a policeman ’s lot is not always an unhappy one , Sarge and Jimmy ’s share of the sale came to $ 380,000 — almost 200 grand apiece .
Needless to say , Jimmy found that smuggling weed through the Bahamas into the United States was a lot more profitable than running a dive shop .
And so he and the Chief went into business .
By Christmas of 1974 , Jimmy and his crew were handling freighter loads that in one instance totaled 100,000 pounds — that ’s 50 TONS of marijuana at one time .
“ Like somebody in the crew said one time , ” Mr. McCaslin quotes Jimmy , “ we were making more money than the Beatles . ”
Unlike many in the drug trade , Jimmy never used any of the substances he smuggled .
In fact , he was — and remains , Mr. McCaslin writes — a teetotaler .
And to Jimmy , what he did may have been illegal , but it was n’t wrong .
All he did was to satisfy America ’s insatiable demand for marijuana ( according to Drug Enforcement Administration estimates , Americans were toking upward of 35,000 pounds of marijuana a day in the early 1970s ) , and use some of his illegal gains to make the lives of his friends and relatives more comfortable .
“ ‘ And that ’s what it was all about , making a difference in people ’s lives , ’ Jimmy says .
‘ We were n’t hurting anybody ; we were n’t killing anybody .
Yes , we were breaking the law , but we were n’t bad people .
We were just weed people . ’”
In one of the few disappointments of the book , Mr. McCaslin neither follows up on this moral / ethical point with Jimmy , nor takes issue with Jimmy ’s naive and self - serving rationalization .
Because the fact of the matter is that there is no such thing as victimless crime .
Jimmy ’s efforts ultimately helped fund and develop the Colombian drug cartels as well as terrorist organizations such as the FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) .
The tradecraft Jimmy used to smuggle weed was the template that was employed in the 1980s for the hemorrhage of Colombian cocaine that , to this day , continues to come north .
If Jimmy and Chief were making hundreds of thousands of dollars , then the American Mafiosi involved in the drug trade and the Colombian cartels were making hundreds of millions .
Indeed , the drug enforcement authorities have in the past seized sea-going containers crammed full of U.S. currency .
That money buys power and influence .
Still , Jimmy ’s story is fascinating .
And it even has a happy ending .
The Chief , addicted to cocaine , meets a bad end .
Jimmy is arrested .
He serves time in a federal prison , then returns to Harbour Island .
Today , according to Mr. McCaslin , Jimmy does carpentry and lives with his second wife , Hannah , in a beachfront house , content to tell stories about his adventures .

Cire Trudon Candles
In the 1643 , in France , the legacy of Cire Trudon candles was established when a wax merchant named Trudon began crafting candles .
Originally , the merchant created candles for the many churches in Paris .
However , as word of the quality of candles spread , the merchant was soon asked into the homes of royalty and nobility to create candles for some of the best households of France .
Louis XIV , Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette all burned Cire Trudon candles .
After the Revolution , Napoleon turned to Cire Trudon candles for lighting and for ceremonies .
Today , Cire Trudon is the oldest candle maker and wax manufacturer still in business .
Kenzo , Guerlain , Hermes , and Dior all entrust Cire Trudon for their candles and the candles are a big hit with celebrities , too .
The company ’s rich tradition is evident in every beautiful and richly scented candle .
Traditionally , the affluent traveled to the company ’s beautiful flagship store on Rue de Seine in Paris .
Today , everyone can enjoy the delicious scents and ultimate luxury of Cire Trudon candles because these candles can be purchased online through reputable retailers .
Currently , Ramdane Touhami is the creative director of Cire Trudon .
Having worked as a designer and art director , Touhami is fully dedicated to developing the highest quality candles and the most beautiful candles possible .
Touhami has ensured that each Cire Trudon candle is encases in a beautifully hand - crafted glass made by a renowned glass manufacturer in Tuscany .
He has commissioned an ancient champagne maker to create the gold labels for the candles .
Under Touhami ’s direction , Cire Trudon has become unequivocally about quality and ultimate luxury .
Several things set Cire Trudon candles apart .
Since Trudon was originally a wax merchant , it ’s no surprise that the wax in these candles is of the highest quality .
Based on a traditional recipe , the wax in Cire Trudon candles is made with no artificial substances , fillers , or paraffin .
Cire Trudon candles are made from 100 % vegetable wax ( specifically , palm oil , rice , soy and coconut ) for the purest candle and the cleanest burn .
Each Cire Trudon candle has a pure cotton wick that is woven right in for the longest burn time possible .
Cire Trudon candles were green long before environmental consciousness was a trend – all Cire Trudon candles are free of pesticides , allergens , and chemicals .
All are biodegradable .
As a result , they burn amazingly clean and leave virtually no soot behind .
The scents of Cire Trudon candles also set the Cire Trudon brand apart .
Cire Trudon candles have fragrances that are based on the landmarks and history of France .
The Roi Soleil candle , for example , has the scent of the polished wood of Versailles and the fragrance of the palace ’s famous Mirror Gallery .
The Carmelite candle is reminiscent of the stones and shaded scents of cloisters while Spiritus Sancti captures the scent of churches .
The Ernesto candle is scented with tobacco and leather notes while the Manon candle brings to mind tiled floors and fresh linen .
Each scent is unique and created from the finest possible ingredients for a true sensory experience .

Iran 's presidential campaign , now in its final week , has reached a level of passion and acrimony no one remembers to have occured in Iranian history .
Reformists , who seek an easing of social and political restrictions at home and better ties with the West , see a strong opportunity to unseat President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has become increasingly unpopular because of Iran 's economic woes .
Critics also say he has needlessly enflamed world anger at Iran with his statements calling U.N. resolutions " worthless papers " and casting doubt on the Holocaust .

The Iranian opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi is under 24 - hour guard by secret police and no longer able to speak freely to supporters , according to the film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf .
Mr Makhmalbaf , 52 , an informal spokesman abroad for the protest in Iran , said that Mr Mousavi was not under arrest but " he has security agents , secret police with him all the time .
He has to be careful what he says . "
In a telephone interview , Mr Makhmalbaf , the director of the 2001 film Kandaha , denied suggestions that the protests against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were losing steam .
" The regime , arguably , is losing ground , not the protests , " he said .
" Ordinary Iranians are openly rejecting the legitimacy and power of Ayatollah Khamanei .
That is entirely new , unheard of . "
Mr Makhmalbaf , a friend of Mr Mousavi for 20 years , said that there were reports from Iran that some of the militia deployed to suppress protest were " speaking Arabic " .
" That is unconfirmed but it suggests that the regime is unable to trust its own security forces to repress the Iranian people , " he said .
" It suggests that people are being used from abroad . "
Mr Makhmalbaf is touring Europe to try to explain events in Iran to the media .
He denied reports that he had been formally appointed as a spokesman for Mr Mousavi outside Iran .
" I am simply speaking on behalf of all the people who are protesting and dying on the streets of Iran , " he said .
Mr Mousasvi 's means of communication had been cut off , or confiscated , just after the disputed election , Mr Makhmalbaf said .
He had therefore been asked informally to make sure that a true picture of what was happening in Iran reached the outside world .
Asked to explain where the protests might go from here , he said that Mr Mousavi had urged his supporters not to confront the regime directly but to " adopt the tactics of Gandhi , the tactics of non-violent protest and civil disobedience " .
" The problem is that the more people that are killed , the more angry people will be , the more protesters will want to come out onto the streets . "
The film director dismissed all hope of some form of negotiated agreement .
" Within the last ten days , there has been a meeting between Mousavi and Ayatollah Khamanei , " he said .
" Nothing came of this meeting .
I do not know of any further dialogue which is now going on . "
Asked to explain how a Mousavi - run Iran would differ from an Ahmadinejad - run Iran , Mr Makhmalbaf said : " The first thing to say is that it is now clear that Ahmadinejad is irrelevant .
He is not the real power . "
If Mousavi was to become president , he said , Iran would invest in " improving the economy for ordinary people , not creating nuclear weapons or supporting conflicts abroad " .
Secondly , he said , there would be an end to the " constant harassment of young people which means that virtually every young person in Iran has been beaten up by the security forces . "

If you were enjoying these warmer months , taking time away from terrestrial black hole spotting due to the continued deactivation of CERN's Large Hadron Collider , feel free to extend those summer vacation plans a little bit .
The particle crasher and supposed non-threat to life as we know it was previously set to restart in September after some damage put it on the inactive list many moons ago .
Now CERN 's Head of Communications , James Gillies , is saying that the restart is likely to be smashed back a few more weeks into October , meaning New Englanders might just get in one more leaf peeping season before all we know is mashed into an incomprehensibly small ball of matter from which nothing can escape -- not even Gundam robots [ Via MSNBC
( In which your author mocks a pervasive and wrong belief about the future of the Internet . )
Many people believe that the Age of the Internet necessitates the passing of the Age of the Desktop Application , in the same way that the Age of the Desktop Computer heralded the end of the Age of the Mainframe .
This brings up three questions : why , what , and how ?
The first question is the easiest .
A desktop application requires that you find the software , obtain the software , install the software , and then learn how to use the software .
There may be licensing fees or a difficult installation process or compilation or cursing when you discover that the binary does n't work on your operating system .
If you can get past all of that , you may discover that the brilliant User Interface with bells , whistles , widgets , and themes may not only be ugly as sin but also impossible to use correctly .
Then try sharing work you create in that application with other people , or using it on your smart phone , or accessing it from a different computer .
Given that the Internet is a global , loosely - connected , fault - tolerant , distributed network of more computing power than you can imagine , it makes sense to move at least some of that processing ( and certainly the data storage ) to somewhere you can access it from any Internet - connected machine .
The magic is figuring out the right kind of interface makes the most sense and can scale from desktop to laptop to kiosk to tablet to smart phone .
That right kind of interface is simple e-mail .
E-mail relies on all of the good parts of SMTP : it 's widely distributed , it 's federated , it has a store - and - forward system , it 's an open standard , and there are countless clients ( for humans and machines ) capable of understanding it .
Not convinced ?
Imagine commenting on this article via e-mail .
You read it in your favorite mail client .
You hit Reply .
You type your comments and hit Send .
That 's it .
You do n't have to muck around with logging in or creating an account ( you already have one ) .
You do n't have to worry if my server configuration or a web gateway in between us will silently drop your message .
You do n't have to wonder if you need to re-enable JavaScript to solve a CAPTCHA and hope that the mandatory refresh wo n't destroy your carefully typed submission .

Some might say that a plain - text medium is insufficient for all of the graphical goodness necessary in a modern application .
That 's bunkum ; plain - text e-maill supports text areas natively , as well as text boxes , combo boxes , and buttons :
Name : ______________ ( textbox ) Medical history : ( textarea ) Age ( choose one ) : ( ) Under 18 ( ) 19 - 25 ( ) 26 - 39 ( ) 40 and older ( combobox ) Preferred pie flavors ( choose many ) : [ ] Berry [ ]
Peach [ ] Apple [ ]
Pudding [ x ]
Strawberry / Rhubarb
Mac users may appreciate that it 's possible to manipulate graphics even in plain text .
Including a complete demonstration of PhotoShop - quality output would bloat this essay , but for a hint please see Programming Sprites - Another Look .
Privacy - and identity - minded individuals will be glad to note that well - configured e-mail systems support both modes of operation .
SMTP does not require strong identification of senders , but it can support strong identification .
In particular , if your outgoing mail server requires authentication , it can attest with some authority that a message purporting to be from you is indeed from you ( thus solving the identity management problem inherent in other protocols , such as HTTP ) .
If you wish to use the Internet more privately , simply disable this identification system in your outgoing server .
( Perhaps a clever e-mail client could offer a mechanism to toggle secure / anonymous mode . )
I could wax poetic about all of the other benefits of this system , but two of the most compelling are the composability of client and server - side operations as well as offline mode .
The latter is easiest to understand : you can batch client - side operations when you do not have easy access to the Internet at large and submit them only when bandwidth is available .
At the same time , you may receive batched responses from previous requests .
You do not have to be online with an active connection to continue to perform useful background and foreground work !
Composability sounds trickier , but you likely already perform it .
I have access to my incoming mail server , where I use Email : : Filter to categorize all of the Internet applications I use through SMTP through the use of organizational tags , based on message content .
For example , all of my work programming the Parrot virtual machine is available under the folksonomic tag " p6i " .
Please note that this occurs via analysis of incoming communications based on characteristics I 've noticed ; this tag is of my own invention and is neither a feature of the application on the server side , nor normative behavior of other users of the application .
I have the freedom and flexibility to manage my own tags as I see fit .
Another clever feature on my incoming server is the ability to combine several incoming messages into a single message , thus filtering out duplicates .
Of course , it 's easy to write server - side applications as well .
I wrote the underused Mail : : Action software several years ago and have used it productively ever since .
I should note one potential ( though solveable ! ) drawback with the use of pervasive plain - text e-mail as the replacement for desktop applications : it does often require ( at least for now ) the use of a client - side desktop application which can send and receive e-mail .
In the future , e-mail - only devices such as the Blackberry may grow more common ( I should n't have to mention how much easier it is to archive the textual transcript of a conversation than an unrecorded phone call ! ) .
Some users may require persuasion to leave webmail systems for the more powerful and future - proof desktop clients suitable for unlocking the full range of applications made possible by pervasive SMTP .
This may be difficult , but the result is inevitable .
No one sane could possibly believe that a web browser would make an effective universal desktop client .
During the eight years of the Bush administration , liberal outlets such as the Huffington Post often accused the White House of planting questioners in news conferences to ask preplanned questions .
But here was Obama fielding a preplanned question asked by a planted questioner — from the Huffington Post .
DANA MILBANK'S write - up of yesterday 's presidential press conference is a symphony of whining and huffing .
He argues that the president turned a serious event into " the Obama Show " by letting a reporter / blogger for the Huffington Post ask a question that an Iranian had submitted through the website .
True enough .
Liberal blogs made a huge stink over Jeff Gannon , an amateur journalist who got to toss questions to President Bush .
But it 's ridiculous to equate that with what the Huffington Post did yesterday .
Here 's the 2005 question that got Mr Gannon into trouble .
Senate Democratic leaders have painted a very bleak picture of the U.S. economy .
Harry Reid was talking about soup lines .
And Hillary Clinton was talking about the economy being on the verge of collapse .
Yet in the same breath they say that Social Security is rock solid and there 's no crisis there .
How are you going to work -- you 've said you are going to reach out to these people -- how are you going to work with people who seem to have divorced themselves from reality ?
And here was the question yesterday from Nico Pitney of the Huffington Post .
I wanted to use this opportunity to ask you a question directly from an Iranian .
We solicited questions last night from people who are still courageous enough to be communicating online , and one of them wanted to ask you this :
Under which conditions would you accept the election of Ahmadinejad ?
And if you do accept it without any significant changes in the conditions there , is n't that a betrayal of what the demonstrators there are working towards ?
One question 's a softball ; the other is tougher than the spring - loaded " gotcha " questions lobbed by more prominent journalists .
Chip Reid of NBC
News asked the president if he'd toughened his Iran rhetoric because John McCain had taunted him , possibly the least interesting angle of the unfolding Iran crisis .
If the press corps wants to keep a liberal website from stealing their thunder they could , just possibly , ask better questions that come from facts on the ground instead of the usual Washington nonsense .

Here 's another first - hand account of a student protester tortured by the Iranian regime after the last round of student uprisings ten years ago .
What he describes is exactly what the United States did to prisoners under the Bush - Cheney torture regime :
The place was one of the semi- abandoned military camps outside Tehran that date back to the Iran - Iraq war of the 1980s .
There we were shoved into metal freight containers  the kind used for shipping .
They stripped us naked and gave us two blankets each .
Inside there was nothing to sleep on and no electric light .
There was no way to tell the time except by the daylight when it shone through the watchman ’s peephole at one end and a ventilation vent at the other .
This is more daylight and two more blankets than allowed the bulk of prisoners tortured under Bush and Cheney .
But the cramming into windowless cages naked is classic neocon torture .
I was in the container with four other boys .
We were all barely 20 .
And we were inside for two weeks -- naked , powerless , and face - to - face with the fear of being totally at the mercy of our captors ...
I was in the container with four other boys .
Food was thrown in once a day .
From time to time , we were taken out for questioning .
And both those processes helped to destroy whatever shreds of our dignity remained .
The prisoners were beaten as part of their torture , something endemic in US captivity but formally restricted to mild forms under Cheney .
There are other similarities :
The interrogations were conducted with a hood over my head .
Looking down , I could see only the floor .
Once I saw the hands of one of the interrogators after he cuffed my head .
His hands were twice the size of mine .
After two weeks , I was transferred to a succession of other prison cells , with no idea where I was .
Sometimes , the cells were pitch dark .
Sometimes , they had four brilliant light bulbs shining 24 hours a day .
A word to the neocons : you have no standing to protest the barbaric treatment of these prisoners any more .
And you have made their torture more helpless , more powerful and more brutal than it would otherwise have been .
As these protesters - the men and women hose tweets we were reading so recently - look toward America , as they try to see a beacon somewhere that would let them know that their torturers have no standing in the civilized world , they find one thing .
That beacon ?
Neoconservatism snuffed it out .

With the news that Republican Sen. John Ensign has admitted that he had an extramarital affair with one of his campaign staffers , it is time to add his name to list of Republicans who do n’t practice what they preach in terms of family values .
Here are some Ensign quotes on marriage .
Ensign made a statement tonight in Las Vegas where he admitted the affair , “ I came home to Nevada to come forward and explain to the citizens of our state something that I was involved in about a year ago .
Last year I had an affair .
I violated the vows of my marriage .
It is the worst thing I have ever done in my life .
If there was ever anything in my life that I could take back , this would be it .
I take full responsibility for my actions . ”
The problem is n’t that Ensign had an affair .
These things happen .
The problem is that Ensign has built his political career by preaching family values .
When Larry Craig was busted for soliciting gay sex in an airport bathroom , Ensign said that Craig was , “ embarrassing not only to himself and his family but to the United States Senate . ”

Ensign has also been a defender of “ traditional marriage . ”
Ensign said , “ The effort to pass a constitutional amendment reaffirming marriage as being between a man and a woman only is being undertaken strictly as a defense of marriage against the attempt to redefine it and , in the process , weaken it .
Marriage is an extremely important institution in this country and protecting it is , in my mind , worth the extraordinary step of amending our constitution . ”
He also called for Bill Clinton to resign during the Lewinsky scandal , “ I came to that conclusion recently , and frankly it ’s because of what he put his whole Cabinet through and what he has put the country through , ” Ensign said Thursday , becoming the first member of the Nevada delegation to call for Clinton to quit .
“ He has no credibility left . ”
Ensign was on CNN in April , ” I believe that marriage should be defined as that between one man and one woman .
You want to do what is ideal for children and all of the studies show that the ideal for children is to be in a household with a father and a mother . ”
He continued , “ Now , that does n’t always work , obviously .
We know that .
I was raised by a single mom and that ’s — you know , single moms can do a great job .
But the ideal for children in all of the social studies that have been done out there is to be in a home with a man and a woman .
And the government should strive for the ideal , for children especially . ”
The problem , politically speaking , is n’t the affair .
It is the hypocrisy of supposedly being concerned about morals and family values while having an affair .
Ensign now joins a long list of so called values Republicans that includes Sen.
David Vitter , Larry Craig , and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich who have all had sex scandals .
Sex scandals are not a good thing for a political party that prides itself on being a defender of the American family .
Ensign was being touted as a rising star within the GOP , and possibly a 2012 presidential candidate , but that is all gone now .
He has proven himself to be nothing more than a hypocritical politician who told Republican voters what they wanted to hear , all the while personifying the old adage , do what I say , not what I do .
UNIX やLinuxのエキスパートになるのに避けて通れないのが、Bashに代表されるコマンドラインシェルによる操作だ。そこで本記事では、「Bashのカスタマイズ」「シェルスクリプトの高等テクニック」
「Bash以外の高機能シェル」の3つについて、SourceForge.JP

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama plans to crack down on deceptive credit - card industry practices that have saddled U.S. consumers with huge debts and soaring interest rates , U.S. officials said on Sunday .

Top White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said Obama would be “ very focused in the very near term on a whole set of issues having to do with credit card abuses . ”
“ We need to do things to stop the marketing of credit in ways that addict people to it , ” Summers said in an interview on the NBC television talk show “ Meet the Press . ”
Summers , director of the White House National Economic Council , said the administration is concerned about practices that result in consumers being “ deceived into paying extraordinarily high rates that they would n’t have paid if they knew they were getting themselves into . ”
Summers and other officials are scheduled to meet on Thursday at the White House with top executives of credit card companies .
The meeting comes as lawmakers in the Democratic - led Congress have vented anger that banks with big credit card operations charging high interest rates and fees are the same institutions getting government bailouts from U.S. taxpayers who use these credit cards .
The House of Representatives and Senate are considering a credit card “ bill of rights ” that would limit the ability of credit card companies to raise interest rates on existing balances and require greater disclosure of terms .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has spoken out against complexity in consumer lending practices that is designed to confuse customers and drive up lending fees .
The Fed tightened rules on credit - card practices in December , but the proposed legislation would take that further .
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said credit - card abuses were a priority for Obama , who highlighted the subject during his campaign last year .
“ We look forward to working with Congress on these issues , ” Psaki said .
In the post ‘ Forcing evaluation in Haskell ‘ , I described how to fully evaluate a value to get around Haskell ’s lazy evaluation .
Since then , I ’ve found myself using the following snippet a lot :
import Control .
Parallel .
Strategies import Test .
BenchPress bench 1 . print .
rnf
This snippet fully evaluates a value and prints how long it took to do so .
I regularly use it on the Programming Praxis problems to see where the bottleneck lies in my algorithm .
It has the minor annoyance , however , that it prints a lot of information ( min , max , mean , median , percentiles ) that is all identical , because I only run it once .
The reason I only run it once is that I ’m typically evaluating a pure value , which means that any subsequent attempts to benchmark the evaluation time will take no time at all , since it has already been evaluated .
To solve this , I decided to write a small library to make this process easier and only print the time taken once .
The result is StrictBench .
A short example :
import Test .
StrictBench main = bench [ 1 .
. 10000000 :: Integer ]
This code would give
2890.625 ms
as output .
For the rest of the documentation I refer you to the Hackage page .
The source code is pretty simple :
module Test .
StrictBench ( bench , benchDesc , time ) where import Control .
Parallel .
Strategies import Test .
BenchPress hiding ( bench ) import Text .
Printf bench :: NFData a => a -> IO ( ) bench = ( putStrLn . (++ " ms " ) . show =< <) .
time benchDesc :: NFData a => String -> a -> IO ( ) benchDesc s = ( putStrLn . printf " %s : %s ms " s . show =< <) .
time time :: NFData a => a ->
IO
Double time = fmap ( median .
fst ) . benchmark 1 ( return ( ) ) ( const $ return ( ) ) . const .
putStr . ( ` seq ` " " ) .
rnf
Nothing complicated , but a nice convenience library that I ’ll be using from now on .

The Rise and Fall of Death Row Records
The label that once boasted Dre , Snoop and Tupac was auctioned for $ 24 million .
July 21 , 2008  --
With larger - than - life characters , violent feuds , a dramatic rise and a public fall , the story of Death Row Records reads like a classic epic novel or Greek morality play .
" It 's one of those stories that 's iconic and , quite frankly , ironic , " said Keith Murphy , associate senior editor of Vibe magazine .
Co-founded in 1991 by controversial music mogul Marion " Suge " Knight , the label was home to some of the biggest names in rap — Dr. Dre , Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur — and became one of hip - hop 's most influential and profitable labels in its '90s heyday .
" Despite what people might have thought of Suge Knight , it was a very pivotal label , " said Gail Mitchell , senior correspondent for R&B and hip - hop at Billboard magazine .
" That label , along with Def Jam , was one of the pivotal building blocks of the genre . "
But after losing his stable of platinum - record - selling artists and being dogged by legal troubles , mismanagement and debt , Knight was forced to file bankruptcy in 2006 .
Last week , the label was sold in a court - ordered auction for the starting bid of $ 24 million to Nashville - based Global Music Group Inc .
The sale concluded Knight 's reign as one of the most powerful and feared figures in the music industry .
How did Death
Row go from cranking out millions of records to being on the auction block ?
How did Knight fall so low , ending up with what he said was just $ 11 in his pocket and his bloodied face plastered across the Internet after he was knocked unconscious in March during a disagreement outside a nightclub ?
" He was hip - hop 's boogeyman , " Murphy said .
" You make the bed you lie in .
You go around disrespecting people , and things are going to come back to you . "
Murphy added , " As quick as he rose , he fell that fast , but in slow motion almost .
We saw everything that happened with his demise . "
Calls to Knight for comment were not returned .
The Rise and the Fall
Knight 's rise to the top ranks of the music industry is remarkable considering he grew up in Compton , a Los Angeles suburb notorious for gang - related violence .
Though he has never admitted to being a member of a gang , Knight , whose childhood nickname Sugar Bear he later shortened to Suge , was often seen wearing the red colors of the Bloods street gang that dominated his neighborhood .
" To survive in a place like Compton , it 's not easy , " said writer David Fisher , who started working with Knight on his memoir since 2003 .
" The requirements of survival in a place like Compton are different .
There 's a different set of rules . "
" Suge is both the best and the worst of what you 're going to get from a place like that , " Fisher said .
One way Knight stood out was as an excellent student and athlete .
He earned a football scholarship to the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , and after college played briefly for the Los Angeles Rams .
When that did n't work out , he got a job as a bodyguard for celebrities , including Bobby Brown .
" Suge represents the American dream better than a lot of people in this business do , " Murphy said .
" The guy started out as bodyguard for Bobby Brown and ended up being head of one of the most influential and bankable labels . "
How Knight got his start in the music business , with a music - publishing company in 1989 , has been the stuff of legend .
According to one famous story , he made his first big fortune when he dangled Vanilla Ice upside down by his ankles from a 20th - floor balcony and got him to sign over his royalties from " Ice Ice Baby " for music material he supposedly lifted from one of Knight 's associates .
Vanilla Ice , whose real name is Rob Van Winkle , told the washingtonpost.com a few years ago that the story had been grossly exaggerated , though he knew Knight meant business .
" I was on the balcony and had signed over a lot of contractual money to him and felt like I did the right thing , " he said .
" In a weird way , he was nice but firm with me .
He took me to the balcony and talked to me .
... I got the clue .
I 'm no idiot . "
In 1991 , Knight joined forces with Dr. Dre , a rapper and producer , who was eager to leave his group N.W.A. and its label Ruthless Records .
Again , there were rumors that Knight threatened violence against Eazy - E , another member of N.W.A. , and the group 's manager Jerry Heller in order to get Dre released from his contract .
To fund his new venture , Knight borrowed $ 1.5 million from drug kingpin Michael Harris and his wife , Lydia , according to Murphy .
At the end of 1992 , Knight had cut a deal with Interscope Records and Harris was sent to prison , but that would not be the last Knight heard from Harris .
Meanwhile , Death Row Records began churning out multiplatinum hits , starting with Dr. Dre 's " The Chronic " and later his protégé Snoop Dogg 's " Doggystyle . "
Then , in 1995 , Knight offered to pay the $ 1.4 million bail for the already successful rapper Tupac Shakur , who was in jail on a sexual abuse charge — but only if Shakur signed with his label .
Shakur agreed and his first release , the double album " All Eyez on Me , " sold more than nine million copies .
" Suge gave these guys an avenue to make themselves even bigger than they ever could have dreamed of , " Murphy said .
The company 's fortunes began to slide when Shakur was shot and killed in September 1996 in Las Vegas while riding in the passenger seat of a car driven by Knight .
Earlier that evening the pair and their entourage were involved in a brawl at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas .
Shakur 's killer has never been found .
After the fight and shooting , Knight , who was on probation for an assorted number of charges including auto theft , attempted murder and carrying a concealed weapon , was sent to prison for five years for violating his parole .
In his absence , the company was badly mismanaged and his biggest acts had moved on .
After his release in August 2001 , he was never able to replicate his earlier success .
The Comeback and the Fallout
Trouble continued to follow Knight .
He returned to jail twice in 2003 for associating with gang members and punching a parking attendant .
The following year , when Knight attended the Vibe awards , a man threw a punch at Dr. Dre , who was there to receive a lifetime achievement award , and fingers were pointed at Knight .
And in 2005 , he was shot at a bash hosted by Kanye West .
Fisher , Knight 's co-writer , had read about his scary reputation and was surprised to see a very different side of the man when they met in 2003 .
" When he walks into a room , people smile , " he said .
" Everybody comes up to him .
He 's always open and friendly . "
Knight began the book project because " he wanted to have his say , " Fisher said .
They have finished about 90 percent of it , but two years ago Knight took a break from it and now it 's not clear when he 'll return .
In the meantime , Knight lost control of his company , when Michael Harris and his now ex-wife Lydia sued , claiming they helped start the record empire and were owed $ 107 million in royalties .
The judge agreed and awarded their claim in 2005 .
Knight filed for bankruptcy the following year , telling his creditors that his bank account contained just $ 11 .
Fisher believes Knight did n't fight very hard to save his company .
" He did n't even contest it [ the lawsuit ] , " he said .
" He was in and out of prison .
I think he thought they were fighting over a shell that did n't exist and he wanted to start clean . "
So is that the last of Suge Knight ?
" I think he decided to do this book to reinvent himself in a major way , " Fisher said .
" He 's unbelievably charismatic , and a lot smarter than people give him credit for .
If he wants a mainstream career , it 's there waiting for him .
I 'm sure Suge will be back and he might be bigger than ever . "
Articles : Customers given too many choices are 10 x less likely to buy 2009 - 06 - 21
For 10 years , Columbia professor Sheena Iyengar has been studying choice .
For her research paper , “ When Choice is Demotivating ” , they ran a great test :
They set up a free tasting booth in a grocery store , with six different jams .
40 % of the customers stopped to taste .
30 % of those bought some .
A week later , they set up the same booth in the same store , but this time with twenty - four different jams .
60 % of the customers stopped to taste .
But only 3 % bought some !
Both groups actually tasted an average of 1.5 jams .
So the huge difference in buying ca n’t be blamed on the 24 - jam customers being full .
Lessons learned :
Having many choices seems appealing ( 40 % vs 60 % stopped to taste )
Having many choices makes them 10 times less likely to buy ( 30 % vs 3 % actually bought )
Surgeon Atul Gawande found that 65 % of people surveyed said if they were to get cancer , they ’d want to choose their own treatment .
Among people surveyed who really do have cancer , only 12 % of patients want to choose their own treatment .
So , if you ask your customers if they want extensive choice , they will say they do — but they really do n’t .
I recommend the book “ The Paradox of Choice ” if you ’re interested in this .
Where does this not apply ?
In “ preference matching ” contexts , where people come looking for something they already know and prefer , extensive selection increases the likelihood they ’ll be successful in their search .
For example : a menu at a Chinese restaurant .
Many tests have shown that when people are given some choice versus none ( choosing between six possible activities versus being assigned an activity ) , having some choice increases motivation and enhances performance .
How do we use this info ?
Online stores often offer too many choices on their front page .
Lists of dozens of new arrivals , top sellers , sale items , and categories .
Artists showcasing their art ( music , essays , photos ) often present a giant list of everything they ’ve done .
But all of us could come to these conclusions :
Only present 3 to 6 choices at a time .
No less than 3 .
No more than 6 .
No less than 3 .
No more than 6 .
Only show your deep selection when people are searching for something specific .
My favorite example of this is Firefox ’s about : config feature .
There are hundreds of intimidating options that are hidden from most people , but there for the few who need them .

A Mexican restaurant in this border town is drawing the curious and the faithful to see what some believe is a likeness of the Virgin Mary that appeared miraculously on a griddle .
A cook at Las Palmas restaurant was the first to see the image .
“ She started to cry and did n’t want to clean the griddle anymore , ” said Brenda Martinez , who manages the family - owned restaurant .
The griddle has been taken off the stove and is now displayed in a room behind the kitchen that is quickly filling up with rosaries , flowers , votive candles and other offerings left by visitors from the Imperial Valley and from Mexicali across the border .

“ I feel she is here with us .
I can feel her presence , ” said Joe Acuna , who owns a landscaping firm .
“ She looks real , very real , ” handyman Mike Breseno said in Spanish .
The Rev. Edward Horning , associate pastor at St. Mary Catholic Church in nearby El Centro , examined the griddle Thursday .
He would not say whether he thought the outline on the griddle looked like the Virgin Mary .
But he said , “ If God wants to do something like this , he can do it . ”
Advertisement
To some visitors , the image looks like the Our Lady of Guadalupe artwork in a basilica in Mexico City , considered Mexico ’s most popular religious and cultural symbol .
Mary is said to have appeared on a hill outside the city in 1531 .
Among the offerings brought to Las Palmas was a replica of a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe .
Visitors glance at the painting and then the image on the griddle -- and some see a similarity .
“ She ’s here , I know it , ” landscaper Alfredo Luna said .
Only the church hierarchy can confirm that the apparition is a true revelation .
Advertisement
But that has n’t stopped people -- including several Mexican wrestlers in colorful costumes and masks -- from making the trek to the restaurant , which is known for its menudo and carne asada and is tucked in a corner of a popular swap meet at Hacienda Drive and Ollie Avenue .
The restaurant -- and the room with the griddle -- is open Wednesday through Sunday .
Alberto Lopez Pulido , director and professor of ethnic studies at the University of San Diego , said that claims of apparitions , particularly of Mary , are not uncommon among Latino and Mexican Catholics .
The Catholic Church in Central and South America is Mary - centered , while the church in most of North America is more Christ - centered , Pulido said .
Seeing images of Mary in public places or work spaces fulfills the need of Catholics for a personal relationship to their religion outside the church , he said .
Advertisement
“ It establishes a sense of community , of personal connection and access , ” Pulido said in an interview .
“ It makes their religion real to them . ”
Martinez said one of the cooks felt the image had materialized to give her strength after her brother ’s fatal heart attack a few days earlier .
“ Mary is here for us , ” Martinez said .
“ She wants to show us her love and tell us to keep the faith . ”

Theoretical Background
This document aims to provide some theoretical background to Xapian .
Documents and terms In Information Retrieval ( IR ) , the items we are trying to retrieve are called documents , and each document is described by a collection of terms .
These two words , document and term , are now traditional in the vocabulary of IR , and reflect its Library Science origins .
Usually a document is thought of as a piece of text , most likely in a machine readable form , and a term as a word or phrase which helps to describe the document , and which may indeed occur one or more times in the document .
So a document might be about dental care , and could be described by corresponding terms tooth , teeth , toothbrush , decay , cavity , plaque , diet and so on .
More generally a document can be anything we want to retrieve , and a term any feature that helps describe the documents .
So the documents could be a collection of fossils held in a big museum collection , and the terms could be morphological characteristics of the fossils .
Or the documents could be tunes , and the terms could then be phrases of notes that occur in the tunes .
If , in an IR system , a document , D , is described by a term , t , t is said to index D , and we can write , t → D In fact an IR system consists of a set of documents , D 1 , D 2 , D 3 ... , a set of terms t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ... , and set of relationships , t i → D j i.e. instances of terms indexing documents .
A single instance of a particular term indexing a particular document is called a posting .
For a document , D , there is a list of terms which index it .
This is called the term list of D .
For a term , t , there is a list of documents which it indexes .
This is called the posting list of t. ( Document list would be more consistent , but sounds a little too vague for this very important concept . )
At a simple level a computerised IR system puts the terms in an index file .
A term can be efficiently looked up and its posting list found .
In the posting list , each document is represented by a short identifier .
To over - simplify a little , a posting list can be thought of as a list of numbers ( document ids ) , and term list as a list of strings ( the terms ) .
Some systems represent each term by a number internally , so the term list is then also a list of numbers .
Xapian does n't - it uses the terms themselves , and uses prefix compression to store them compactly .
The terms need n't be ( and often are n't ) just the words from the document .
Usually they are converted to lower case , and often a stemming algorithm is applied , so a single term connect might derive from a number of words , connect , connects , connection , connected and so on .
A single word might also give rise to more than one term , for example you might index both stemmed and unstemmed forms of some or all terms .
Or a stemming algorithm could conceivably produce more than one stem in some cases ( this is n't the case for any of the stemming algorithms Xapian currently supports , but consider the Double Metaphone phonetic algorithm which can produce two codes from a single input ) .
Xapian 's context within IR
In the beginning IR was dominated by Boolean retrieval , described in the next section .
This could be called the antediluvian period , or generation zero .
The first generation of IR research dates from the early sixties , and was dominated by model building , experimentation , and heuristics .
The big names were Gerard Salton and Karen Sparck Jones .
The second period , which began in the mid-seventies , saw a big shift towards mathematics , and a rise of the IR model based upon probability theory - probabilistic IR .
The big name here was , and continues to be , Stephen Robertson .
More recently Keith van Rijsbergen has led a group that has developed underlying logical models of IR , but interesting as this new work is , it has not as yet led to results that offer improvements for the IR system builder .
Xapian was built as a system for efficiently implementing the probabilistic IR model ( though this does n't mean it is limited to only implementing this model - other models can be implemented providing they can be expressed in a suitable way ) .
Xapian tries to implement the probabilistic model faithfully , though in some places it can be told to use short - cuts for efficiency .
The model has two striking advantages :
It leads to systems that give good retrieval performance .
As the model has developed over the last 25 years , this has proved so consistently true that one is led to suspect that the probability theory model is , in some sense , the " correct " model for IR .
The IR process would appear to function as the model suggests .
As new problems come up in IR , the probabilistic model can usually suggest a solution .
This makes it a very practical mental tool for cutting through the jungle of possibilities when designing IR software .
In simple cases the model reduces to simple formulae in general use , so do n't be alarmed by the apparent complexity of the equations below .
We need them for a full understanding of the general case .
Boolean retrieval A Boolean construct of terms retrieves a corresponding set of documents .
So , if : t 1 indexes documents 1 2 3 5 8 t 1 indexes documents 2 3 6 then t 1 AND t 2 retrieves 2 3 t 1 OR t 2 retrieves 1 2 3 5 6 8 t 1 AND_NOT t 2 retrieves 1 5 8 t 2 AND_NOT t 1 retrieves 6
The posting list of a term is a set of documents .
IR becomes a matter of constructing other sets by doing unions , intersections and differences on posting lists .
For example , in an IR system of works of literature , a Boolean query ( lang: en OR lang : fr OR lang : de ) AND ( type : novel OR type : play ) AND century : 19 might be used to retrieve all English , French or German novels or plays of the 19th century .
Boolean retrieval is often useful , but is rather inadequate on its own as a general IR tool .
Results are n't ordered by any measure of how " good " they might be , and users require training to make effective use of such a system .
Despite this , purely boolean IR systems continue to survive .
By default , Xapian uses probabilistic ranking to order retrieved documents while allowing Boolean expressions of arbitrary complexity ( some boolean IR systems are restricted to queries in normal form ) to limit those documents retrieved , which provides the benefits of both approaches .
Pure Boolean retrieval is also supported ( select the BoolWeight weighting scheme using enquire.set_weighting_scheme(Xapian::BoolWeight ( ) ) ; ) .
Relevance and the idea of a query Relevance is a central concept to the probabilistic model .
Whole academic papers have been devoted to discussing the nature of relevance but essentially a document is relevant if it was what the user really wanted !
Retrieval is rarely perfect , so among documents retrieved there will be non-relevant ones ; among those not retrieved , relevant ones .
Relevance is modelled as a black or white attribute .
There are no degrees of relevance , a document either is , or is not , relevant .
In the probabilistic model there is however a probability of relevance , and documents of low probability of relevance in the model generally correspond to documents that , in practice , one would describe as having low relevance .
What the user actually wants has to be expressed in some form , and the expression of the user 's need is the query .
In the probabilistic model the query is , usually , a list of terms , but that is the end process of a chain of events .
The user has a need ; this is expressed in ordinary language ; this is then turned into a written form that the user judges will yield good results in an IR system , and the IR system then turns this form into a set , Q , of terms for processing the query .
Relevance must be judged against the user 's original need , not against a later interpretation of what Q , the set of terms , ought to mean .
Below , a query is taken to be just a set of terms , but it is important to realise that this is a simplification .
Each link in the chain that takes us from the information need ( " what the user is looking for " ) to the abstraction in Q is liable to error , and these errors compound to affect IR performance .
In fact the performance of IR systems as a whole is much worse than most people generally imagine .
Evaluating IR performance
It is possible to set up a test to evaluate an IR system .
Suppose Q is a query , and out of the complete collection of documents in the IR system , a set of documents R of size R are relevant to the query .
So if a document is in R it is relevant , and if not in R it is non-relevant .
Suppose the IR system is able to give us back K documents , among which r are relevant .
Precision and recall are defined as being , precision = ( r ) /( K ) , recall = ( r ) /( R ) Precision is the density of relevant documents among those retrieved .
Recall is the proportion of relevant documents retrieved .
In most IR systems K is a parameter that can be varied , and what you find is that when K is low you get high precision at the expense of low recall , and when K is high you get high recall at the expense of low precision .
The ideal value of K will depend on the use of the system .
For example , if a user wants the answer to a simple question and the system contains many documents which would answer it , a low value of K will be best to give a small number of relevant results .
But in a system indexing legal cases , users will often wish to make sure no potentially relevant case is missed even if that requires they check more non-relevant cases , so a high value of K will be best .
Retrieval effectiveness is often shown as a graph of precision against recall average over a number of queries , and plotted for different values of K .
Such curves typically have a shape similar to a hyperbola ( y=1 / x ) .
A collection like this , consisting of a set of documents , a set of queries , and for each query , a complete set of relevance assessments , is called a test collection .
With a test collection you can test out different IR ideas , and see how well one performs against another .
The controversial part of establishing any test collection is the procedure employed for determining the sets R i , of relevance assessments .
Subjectivity of judgement comes in here , and people will differ about whether a particular document is relevant to a particular query .
Even so , the averaging across queries reduces the errors that may occasionally arise through faulty relevance judgements , and averaging important tests across a number of test collections reduces the effects caused by accidental features of individual collections , and the results obtained by these tests in modern research are generally accepted as trustworthy .
Nowadays such research with test collections is organised from TREC .
Probabilistic term weights
In this section we will try to present some of the thinking behind the formulae .
This is really to give a feel for where the probabilistic model comes from .
You may want to skim through this section if you 're not too interested .
Suppose we have an IR system with a total of N documents .
And suppose Q is a query in this IR system , made up of terms t 1 , t 2 ... t Q .
There is a set , R , of documents relevant to the query .
In 1976 , Stephen Robertson derived a formula which gives an ideal numeric weight to a term t of Q. Just how this weight gets used we will see below , but essentially a high weight means an important term and a low weight means an unimportant term .
The formula is , w ( t ) = log ( p ( 1 − q ) ) / ( ( 1 − p ) q )
( The base of the logarithm does n't matter , but we can suppose it is e. ) p is the probability that t indexes a relevant document , and q the probability that t indexes a non-relevant document .
And of course , 1 - p is the probability that t does not index a relevant document , and 1 - q the probability that t does not index a non-relevant document .
More mathematically , p = P(t → D|DinR ) q = P(t → D|DnotinR ) 1 − p = P( tnot → D|DinR ) 1 − q = P( tnot → D|DnotinR )
Suppose that t indexes n of the N documents in the IR system .
As before , we suppose also that there are R documents in R , and that there are r documents in R which are indexed by t. p is easily estimated by r/R , the ratio of the number of relevant documents indexed by t to the total number of relevant documents .
The total number of non-relevant documents is N - R , and the number of those indexed by t is n - r , so we can estimate q as ( n - r ) / ( N - R ) .
This gives us the estimates , p = ( r ) /( R ) , 1 − q = ( N − R − n + r ) /( N − R ) 1 − p = ( R − r ) /( R ) , q = ( n − r ) /( N − R ) and so substituting in the formula for w(t ) we get the estimate , w( t ) = log ( r( N − R − n + r ) ) /( ( R − r ) ( n − r ) )
Unfortunately , this formula is subject to violent behaviour when , say , n = r ( infinity ) or r = 0 ( minus infinity ) , and so Robertson suggests the modified form w( t ) = log ( ( r + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) ) ( N − R − n + r + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) ) ) /( ( R − r + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) ) ( n − r + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) ) ) with the reassurance that this has " some theoretical justification " .
This is the form of the term weighting formula used in Xapian 's BM25 Weight .
Note that n is dependent on the term , t , and R on the query , Q , while r depends both on t and Q . N is constant , at least until the IR system changes .
At first sight this formula may appear to be quite useless .
After all , R is what we are trying to find .
We can't evaluate w( t ) until we have R , and if we have R the retrieval process is over , and term weights are no longer of any interest to us .
But the point is we can estimate p and q from a subset of R .
As soon as some records are found relevant by the user they can be used as a working set for R from which the weights w( t ) can be derived , and these new weights can be used to improve the processing of the query .
In fact in the Xapian software R tends to mean not the complete set of relevant documents , which indeed can rarely be discovered , but a small set of documents which have been judged as relevant .
Suppose we have no documents marked as relevant .
Then R = r = 0 , and w( t ) becomes , log ( N − n + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) ) /( n + ( 1 ) /( 2 ) )
This is approximately log (( N - n ) /n ) .
Or log ( N/n ) , since n is usually small compared with N.
This is called inverse logarithmic weighting , and has been used in IR for many decades , quite independently of the probabilistic theory which underpins it .
Weights of this form are in fact the starting point in Xapian when no relevance information is present .
The number n incidentally is often called the frequency of a term .
We prefer the phrase term frequency , to better distinguish it from wdf and wqf introduced below .
In extreme cases w( t ) can be negative .
In Xapian , negative values are disallowed , and simply replaced by a small positive value .
wdp , wdf , ndl and wqf Before we see how the weights are used there are a few more ideas to introduce .
As mentioned before , a term t is said to index a document D , or t → D .
We have emphasised that D may not be a piece of text in machine - readable form , and that , even when it is , t may not actually occur in the text of D. Nevertheless , it will often be the case that D is made up of a list of words , D = w 1 , w 2 , w 3 ... w m and that many , if not all , of the terms which index D derive from these words ( for example , the terms are often lower - cased and stemmed forms of these words ) .
If a term derives from words w 9 , w 38 , w 97 and w 221 in the indexing process , we can say that the term " occurs " in D at positions 9 , 38 , 97 and 221 , and so for each term a document may have a vector of positional information .
These are the within - document positions of t , or the wdp information of t .
The within - document frequency , or wdf , of a term t in D is the number of times it is pulled out of D in the indexing process .
Usually this is the size of the wdp vector , but in Xapian it can exceed it , since we can apply extra wdf to some parts of the document text .
For example , often this is done for the document title and abstract to attach extra importance to their contents compared to the rest of the document text .
There are various ways in which we might measure the length of a document , but the easiest is to suppose it is made up of m words , w 1 to w m , and to define its length as m .
The normalised document length , or ndl , is then m divided by the average length of the documents in the IR system .
So the average length document has ndl equal to 1 , short documents are less than 1 , long documents greater than 1 .
We have found that very small ndl values create problems , so Xapian actually allows for a non -zero minimum value for the ndl .
In the probabilistic model the query , Q , is itself very much like another document .
Frequently indeed Q will be created from a document , either one already in the IR system , or by an indexing process very similar to the one used to add documents into the whole IR system .
This corresponds to a user saying " give me other documents like this one " .
One can therefore attach a similar meaning to within - query position information , within - query frequency , and normalised query length , or wqp , wqf and nql .
Xapian does not currently use the concept of wqp .
Using the weights .
The MSet Now to pull everything together .
From the probabilistic term weights we can assign a weight to any document , d , as follows , W(d ) = ⎲ ⎳ t → d , t ∈ Q ( ( k + 1 ) f t ) /( k.L d + f t ) w(t )
The sum extends over the terms of Q which index d. f t is the wdf of t in d , L d is the ndl of d , and k is some suitably chosen constant .
The factor k + 1 is actually redundant , but helps with the interpretation of the equation .
In Xapian , this weighting scheme is implemented by the Xapian : : TradWeight class and the factor ( k + 1 ) is ignored .
If k is set to zero the factor before w(t ) is 1 , and the wdfs are ignored .
As k tends to infinity , the factor becomes f t /L d , and the wdfs take on their greatest importance .
Intermediate values scale the wdf contribution between these extremes .
The best k actually depends on the characteristics of the IR system as a whole , and unfortunately no rule can be given for choosing it .
By default , Xapian sets k to 1 which should give reasonable results for most systems .
W(d ) is merely tweaked a bit by the wdf values , and users observe a simple pattern of retrieval .
It is possible to tune k to provide optimal results for a specific system .
Any d in the IR system has a value W ( d ) , but , if no term of the query indexes d , W ( d ) will be zero .
In practice only documents for which W( d ) > 0 will be of interest , and these are the documents indexed by at least one term of Q .
If we now take these documents and arrange them by decreasing W ( d ) value , we get a ranked list called the match set , or MSet , of document and weight pairs : item0 : D 0 , W(D 0 ) item1 : D 1 , W( D 1 ) item2 : D 2 , W( D 2 ) .
.
. itemK : D K , W(D K ) where W ( D j ) ≥ W ( D i ) if j > i .
And according to the probabilistic model , the documents D 0 , D 1 , D 2 ... are ranked by decreasing order of probability of relevance .
So D 0 has highest probability of being relevant , then D 1 and so on .
Xapian creates the MSet from the posting lists of the terms of the query .
This is the central operation of any IR system , and will be familiar to anyone who has used one of the Internet 's major search engines , where the query is what you type in the query box , and the resulting hit list corresponds to the top few items of the MSet .
The cutoff point , K , is chosen when the MSet is created .
The candidates for inclusion in the MSet are all documents indexed by at least one term of Q , and their number will usually exceed the choice of K ( K is typically set to be 1000 or less ) .
So the MSet is actually the best K documents found in the match process .
A modification of this weighting scheme can be employed that takes into account the query itself : W(d ) = ⎲ ⎳ t → d , t ∈ Q ( ( k 3 + 1 ) q t ) /( ( k 3 L ’ + q t ) ) ( ( k + 1 ) f t ) /( ( kL d + f t ) ) w( t ) where q t is the wqf of t in Q , L ’ is the nql , or normalised query length , and k 3 is a further constant .
In computing W ( d ) across the document space , this extra factor may be viewed as just a modification to the basic term weights , w( t ) .
Like k and k 3 , we will need to make an inspired guess for L’ .
In fact the choices for k 3 and L ’ will depend on the broader context of the use of this formula , and more advice will be given as occasion arises .
Xapian 's default weighting scheme is a generalised form of this weighting scheme modification , known as BM25 .
In BM25 , L ’ is always set to 1 .
Using the weights : the ESet But as well as ranking documents , Xapian can rank terms , and this is most important .
The higher up the ranking the term is , the more likely it is to act as a good differentiator between relevant and non-relevant documents .
It is therefore a candidate for adding back into the query .
Terms from this list can therefore be used to expand the size of the query , after which the query can be re-run to get a better MSet .
Because this list of terms is mainly used for query expansion , it is called the expand set or ESet .
The term expansion weighting formula is as follows , W ( t ) = r w ( t ) in other words we multiply the term weight by the number of relevant documents that have been indexed by the term .
The ESet then has this form , item0 : t 0 , W(t 0 ) item1 : t 1 , W(t 1 ) item2 : t 2 , W(t 2 ) .
.
. itemK : t K , W(t K ) where W(t j ) ≥ W(t i ) if j > i .
Since the main function of the ESet is to find new terms to be added to Q , we usually omit from it terms already in Q. The W(t ) weight is applicable to any term in the IR system , but has a value zero when t does not index a relevant document .
The ESet is therefore confined to be a ranking of the best K terms which index relevant documents .
This simple form of W(t ) is traditional in the probabilistic model , but seems less than optimal because it does not take into account wdf information .
One can if fact try to generalise it to : W(t ) = ⎲ ⎳ t → d , d ∈ R ( ( k + 1 ) f t ) /( kL + f t ) w( t ) k is again a constant , but it does not need to have the same value as the k used in the probabilistic term weights above .
In Xapian , k defaults to 1.0 for ESet generation .
This reduces to W ( t ) = r w ( t ) when k = 0 .
Certainly this form can be recommended in the very common case where r = 1 , that is , we have a single document marked relevant .
The progress of a query Below we describe the general case of the IR model supported , including use of a relevance set ( RSet ) , query expansion , improved term weights and reranking .
You do n't have to use any of these for Xapian to be useful , but they are available should you need them .
The user enters a query .
This is parsed into a form the IR system understands , and run by the IR system , which returns two lists , a list of captions , derived from the MSet , and a list of terms , from the ESet .
If the RSet is empty , the first few documents of the MSet can be used as a stand - in - after all , they have a good chance of being relevant !
You can read a document by clicking on the caption .
( We assume the usual screen / mouse environment . )
But you can also mark a document as relevant ( change R ) or cause a term to be added from the ESet to the query ( change Q ) .
As soon as any change is made to the query environment the query can be rerun , although you might have a front - end where nothing happens until you click on some " Run Query " button .
In any case rerunning the query leads to a new MSet and ESet , and so to a new display .
The IR process is then an iterative one .
You can delete terms from the query or add them in ; mark or unmark documents as being relevant .
Eventually you converge on the answer to the query , or at least , the best answer the IR system can give you .
