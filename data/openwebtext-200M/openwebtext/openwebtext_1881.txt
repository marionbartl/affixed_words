Even as an undergrad I was constantly amazed at the lack of consideration that my class mates would put into their course work .
Cheating was obviously their first problem , but this article is less about the questionable ethics of someone that cheats .
What always stood out for me was the beautiful combination of bad
judgment and terrible Microsoft Word skills .
Even more amazing is that I was a computer science student and surrounded by individuals with an amazing aptitude for technology that would often far exceed my own , so what was missing ?
Group assignments , from my perspective this type of assignment brings out the absolute worst in most people .
I am not sure if it is just because when confronted the opportunity to be lazy most people opt in or it is the rare occasion to see how most people go about writing a paper .
As a result of this trend I would go as far as to break a 4 person group into 3 authors and 1 editor because inevitably the paper would not have consistent flow without it .
The following will outline the 3 most common things that people would do that made it blatantly obvious that they did n’t write their own part .
I . Do n’t use Wikipedia as a place to copy your entire paper .
For one second just accept the fact that you are not the only person on the planet with access to the internet and furthermore you do n’t have secret access to Google .
I laugh at how lame mot people are when it comes to their ability to search , thinking that results they pulled back are only disclosed to them .
II .
Answer the question that you are supposed to .
A good sign that someone is cheating is that they get the topic right but they do n’t really answer the question that being posed to them .
If the question is to describe the impact of technology on modern library systems do not hand in 3 pages on the Dewey Decimal System .
III .
The third and easiest way to point out a cheater is when the “ author ” does n’t even bother changing the font from a web font to the default MS Word font .
I mean come on people , how lame do you have to be to think that no one is going to wonder why you used 4 different fonts , and a web font ?!?
Again , let me point this out again , I was a computer science major so the people I was in classes with were arguably better than average computer users .
And still they would turn in papers with web fonts ?
IV .
Avoid turning in papers where the British style of spelling is utilized .
Does it not look suspicious when you suddenly begin spelling :
• Color as Colour
• Analyze as Analyse
• Skillful as Skilful
• Theater as Theatre
So at the end of the day avoid being lazy and if you are going to be lazy about writing , do not be lazy about your research .
Avoid Wikipedia , answer the question asked of you , consider fonts , and avoid the Kings English .
Do these few things and your papers will be better than your classmates .
Surveillance cameras in schools are meant to keep children safe and in - line , but a kiss , a camera and a controversy have Gig Harbor High School in Washington in an uproar .
A security camera captured two girls kissing , but it's what happened next that sparked a surveillance debate .
With Warren County schools having surveillance cameras not only in the high schools but in the middle school and elementary schools as well , you 'll want to read on because reporter Keith Eldridge 's brings you the story that asks the question :
When does Big Brother surveillance cross the line ?
The dean of students said he saw two girls kissing .
He checked the surveillance tape then shared what he saw with the parents of one of the girls .
They then pulled her out of school , which then pulled the peninsula school district into a big controversy .
" They were n't harming other students , so I do n't think the administrators had a right to show it to her parents or anybody else , " student , Laura Varadi said .
" I think that they did n't use the cameras like how they should .
They should only be used for safety I think , " student , Jade Egelhoff said .
" We obviously made a mistake , " Superintendent Terry Bouck said .
" We 're here to make sure our kids , our staff and parents are safe , but we 're not going to be monitoring public displays of affection , etc . "
But some parents ask " Why not ? "
" I think that that 's fine if they 're doing something they should n't be doing .
The surveillance is fine , " said Heidi Holmes , a Gig Harbor parent .
" We 're watching them at home , so we should be watching them at school too , " said Tim , Heidi 's husband .
The Holmes said surveillance cameras are a way of life .
Helping prevent crime , identifying suspects and just giving folks a sense of security knowing the cameras are always watching .
You 've got to figure that no matter where you are you 're probably going to be on camera , whether from that angle or this angle , you 're probably going to be on .
But one store owner said it should n't be for spying .
" I 'm not for it , because we do n't use it that way , " store owner , Sean Whang said .
This is a debate that is not likely to end with the superintendent saying they made a mistake .
It really goes to all facets of life not just schools but the workplace and all public areas .
Dick Cheney and the Not - So - Unitary Executive JB Vice President Dick Cheney and his consigliere David Addington have long been associated with the doctrine of the " Unitary Executive , " the notion that all executive functions are vested in the President of the United States of American and hence that the President has the right to direct all executive officers , who , in turn are required to obey his orders .
All except the Vice - President , apparently .
The New York Times reports that Cheney now takes the position that he is not bound by an executive order requiring all entities within the executive branch to report on how they obtain and use classified information because he is not just another part of the executive branch .
The Vice - President 's office , he contends , is unique .
As President of the Senate , he exercises legislative functions , including the right to cast tie votes in the Senate .
( Of course the President also has legislative functions -- he can veto bills -- but that has never stopped him from claiming that he is the chief executive officer . ) .
The Times explains :
For four years , Vice President Dick Cheney has resisted routine oversight of his office ’s handling of classified information , and when the office in charge of overseeing classification in the executive branch objected , the vice president ’s office suggested that the oversight office be shut down , according to documents released today by a Democratic congressman .
For years Cheney and Addington pushed the theory of the unitary Executive in order to avoid anyone looking into what they were doing .
Once it became clear that the executive branch wanted to know what they were doing , they decided they were no longer part of the executive branch .
It is by now obvious , if any further proof were necessary , that Cheney and Addington have never been particularly interested in defending constitutional principles .
They do not seek to preserve executive power .
They seek to preserve their own power .
They discarded the canard of the unitary executive as soon as it became inconvenient .
( NB :
The basic idea of a unitary executive , by contrast , is not spurious ; some versions of the theory are quite plausible , just not Cheney and Addington 's version .
I discuss some of the different conceptions here ) .
The New York Times article leaves a tantalizing tidbit : Cheney 's office complied with requests for data on classified documents in 2001 and 2002 .
" But starting in 2003 , the vice president ’s office began refusing to supply the information .
In 2004 , it blocked an on - site inspection by [ the Information Security Oversight Office ] , routinely carried out across the government and intended to check whether documents were being properly labeled and safely stored . "
So the question is this :
Why did Cheney change his mind at the end of 2002 ?
What did his office start doing in 2003 that gave him reason to prevent oversight even by other parts of the executive branch ?

The tourists coped with the ordeal well .
Photo : Cango Caves
The woman became trapped in the Tunnel of Love obstacle in the Cango Caves in Western Cape on New Year 's Day .
The caves ' manager said the woman had been warned she might not be suitable but she insisted on trying .
One of those trapped was a diabetic who had to be brought insulin .
The woman and the other tourists were unhurt .
The rescue operation involved several ambulance teams and a helicopter .
Hein Gerstner , manager of Cango Caves , told the BBC it was an " expensive exercise " that could cost 40,000 rand ( $ 5,700 , £ 2,925 ) .
" We do n't know yet who will foot the bill , " he said .
Pulley
The ordeal began when the woman became stuck just after noon on New Year 's Day .
Mr Gerstner said the woman was " told at the ticket office that she was too big to take part in the specific section " .
He said she was again warned by the guide but that it was " very difficult to discriminate " .
Mr Gerstner said : " The obstacle has a narrow base .
She lost her footing and went down in a splits position .
There was no way she could get her body weight up . "
But he said she was young and remained mentally strong throughout and the other tourists took the ordeal " exceptionally well " .
The tourists , including two asthmatic children , were given blankets , water and chocolate bars as the rescue proceeded .
One rescuer was able to climb over the woman to deliver insulin to the diabetic .
No drilling equipment was needed and the woman was eventually freed with a pulley and paraffin used to grease the surface at about 2320 .
She was taken to hospital but is not injured and is expected to be released on Tuesday .
Mr Gerstner said : " We believe what goes in , must come out again .
People get stuck all the time - that 's one of the unfortunate things that happen , it 's part of the adventure . "
However , he said the caves would consider more stringent measures for those entering .
The Dojo of News and Entertainment
FRANKFURT , Germany --
The NFL folded its development league
in Europe after 16 years on Friday , calling the decision a sound
business move that will allow for a stronger international focus on
regular - season games outside the United States .
The announcement came less than a week after the Hamburg Sea
Devils beat the Frankfurt Galaxy 37 - 28 in the World Bowl title game
in Frankfurt before a crowd of 48,125 .
Five of the league 's six
teams are based in Germany , with the other in Amsterdam ,
Netherlands .
A statement on the German - language edition of the NFL's Web site
said the NFL decided to concentrate its " strategies and
resources " on regular - season games outside the United States in an
effort to reach as many people as possible .
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell thanked the fans for their
support but said it was time to develop a new international
strategy , terming the move to fold NFL Europa the ``best business
decision . ''
The league reportedly was losing about $ 30 million a
season .
" From now on we will focus on regular - season games and use new
technologies to make NFL more popular worldwide , " he said .
NFL team owners decided in October to play up to two
regular - season games outside the United States .
The first such game
is Oct. 28 in London between the Miami Dolphins and the New York
Giants .
The league said it is looking toward other regular - season games
in Germany , Mexico and Canada , with Germany a strong candidate for
2008 .
" NFL Europa has created thousands of passionate fans who have
supported that league and our sport for many years , " said Mark
Waller , senior vice president of NFL International .
" And we look
forward to building on this foundation as we begin this new phase
of our international development . "
The league began in 1991 as the World League of American
Football , with 10 teams from the United States and Europe ,
spreading from Scotland to Spain .
After closing for two seasons in
1993 and 1994 , the league returned with six European teams and
retained the same format until the end .
The league was used by NFL teams to test young talent and
produced players such as quarterback Kurt Warner , who led the St .
Louis Rams to the 2000 Super Bowl championship and won two NFL Most
Valuable Player awards ; Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake
Delhomme ; and star Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri .
NFL Europa managing director Uwe Bergheim said the league had
succeeded in establishing a fan base for football in important
European markets .
" Despite the great support of fans , business partners and the
cities where we were active , we decided that it was time to change
the strategy , " Bergheim said .
Fitzgerald wants Libby jailed now , while Secretary Rice hints at pardon Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 12 , 2007 Print This Email This Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald sought the immediate imprisonment of former top White House Adviser I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby in papers filed Tuesday with a federal district court .
At the same time , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hinted at the possibility of a pardon from President George W. Bush for the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney .
" Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald urged a federal judge Tuesday not to delay former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby 's 2 1/2 - year prison sentence in the CIA leak case , " wrote AP 's Matt Apuzzo on Tuesday morning .
" Fitzgerald , in court documents filed Tuesday , said an appeals court is unlikely to overturn Libby 's conviction because the evidence against him was so overwhelming . "
Due to the possibility of an appeal , Federal District Judge Reggie B. Walton has yet to set a date for Libby 's sentence to begin .
Last week , the top White House aide was sentenced to 30 months in prison .
Earlier this year , he was convicted of five counts of perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements during a federal investigation into the outing of former covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
At the same time , a Monday afternoon report at Editor and Publisher pointed to an interview of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by the Wall Street Journal 's editorial board .
At first , Rice said she did n't want to get involved in the deliberations .
" Look , I 'm not going to get involved in trying to give the President advice on how he ought to think about this .
You know , he has to think about what he wants to do , " she said .
But , Rice seemed to hint at the desire for a pardon of Libby for his crimes .
" Let me tell you what I think about Scooter Libby .
I think he 's served the country really well .
I think he did it to the best of his ability , " Rice said when asked " You think he should go to jail ? "
She went on , " I think that he is going through an extremely difficult time with his family and for him .
And you know , I 'm just desperately sorry that it 's happening to him and I -- you know , the legal system has spoken , but I tell you , this is a really good guy who is a good public servant and ought to be treated in accordance with that . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Central Intelligence Agency is declassifying hundreds of pages of documents on secret operations from over three decades ago , CIA Director Michael Hayden said .
The so - called “ Family Jewels ” document overseas assassination attempts , domestic spying , kidnapping and infiltration of leftist groups from the 1950s to the 1970s , according to a summary posted on the Web site of the National Security Archive at George Washington University .
The documents to be released next week also include accounts of break -ins and theft , surveillance of U.S. journalists , the agency ’s opening of private mail to and from China and the Soviet Union , and “ behavior modification ” experiments on “ unwitting ” U.S. civilians .
“ Much of it has been in the press before , and most of it is unflattering , but it ’s the CIA ’s history , ” Hayden said in a speech on Thursday to the American Foreign Relations Conference .
“ This is about telling the American people what we have done in their name , ” Hayden said .
The CIA chief said the documents provide a glimpse of “ a very different time and a very difference agency . ”
Hayden said 147 documents , 11,000 pages of analysis done between 1953 and 1973 , would be available on the CIA ’s Web site .
After being put on guard at his company 's shareholders meeting , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs fired back with a defense of his controversial stock options .
Jobs quickly became the primary focus of the Q&A session at the end of the annual event , which created the first challenge for the Apple boss after otherwise rolling smoothly through the meeting agenda , in which his Board of Directors saw reelection and all shareholder resolutions were voted down .
Brandon Reese , a shareholder working on behalf of the AFL - CIO union federation was the most eager to grill Jobs on the matter , firing off a string of questions about the many elements surrounding the now - ended stock options scandal at Apple .
" What did you know and when did you know it ? , " the union spokesman asked .
Rather than answer the question directly , however , Jobs instead pointed to the SEC exoneration issued late last month — at one point deliberately re-reading the government body 's statement to underscore his view that the firm 's cooperation spoke for itself .
The implication that there could be more to the story was rejected as irrelevant .
" Unless you think there 's a conspiracy with the SEC too , I do n't know what to say , " Jobs replied .
The CEO also dismissed suggestions that he should compensate his company for the questionable profits he made from his late 2001 stock options .
He took care to note that one grant he received in October of 2001 had in fact been approved in August , when shares were significantly lower and ultimately shortchanged him on potential gains .
" I did n't ask the company to pay me back , " he said .
Apple has already dealt with an $ 84 million options expense late in 2006 to make amends for questionable grants handed out between 1997 and 2002 .
Jobs was further keen to correct notions of a bitter feud between himself and former CFO Fred Anderson in the wake of Apple 's official statement .
He rebuffed the departed executive for his criticisms regarding the financial controversy .
" Fred Anderson is an awfully good guy , " said Jobs .
" I thought his comments were a little wrong . "
While those investors posing the questions were seldom pleased with the response from Jobs , the Apple co-founder 's charisma appeared to have the intended effect of pleasing most of the investors gathered at the company 's Cupertino - based campus .
At points during the meeting , Jobs even triggered laughter uncharacteristic of the normally sober occasions .
He drew a particularly warm response when deflecting a Teamsters Union agent 's question about how Apple linked executive pay and performance , referring to his now legendary $ 1 annual salary .
As someone who favored the Kosovo War , I sure am glad Bill Clinton did n't Take Tom Friedman 's advice ( April 23 , 1999 ) and bomb Serbia into the 14th century :
Like it or not , we are at war with the Serbian nation ( the Serbs certainly think so ) , and the stakes have to be very clear :
Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set back your country back by pulverizing you .
You want 1950 ?
We can do 1950 .
You want 1389 ?
We can do 1389 too .
The actual policy was , obviously , not without deleterious consequences on the lives of ordinary Serbians , but certainly much less harsh than the Friedman " send a war criminal to catch a war criminal " collective punishment approach would have been .
And it more - or - less succeeded in getting Milosevic to back down .
It 's amazing what war fever and a desire to prove one 's masculinity by demanding that other people kill additional other people can do to someone .
In Friedman 's defense , the actual point of the column was to argue against those calling for an immediate ground invasion , so perhaps he felt the need to cover his left flank with that little bloody - minded reverie .

Peter Withe is no longer manager of Thailand 's national football team , as we stated in the article below .
He left Thailand in 2002 and managed Indonesia 's national side until January this year .
As the seafront beat officer in the kiss - me - quick resort of Great Yarmouth , Gary Pettengell built up quite a local following , sorting out lost kids , checking teenage high spirits and pointing holidaymakers in the direction of ice cream , cash machines or loos .
But it is n't until you see him out and about in the small Baltic nation of Lithuania that you understand where his fame really lies .
The modest , happily married PC from Norfolk constabulary has been voted the country 's personality of the year .
" I know you , do n't I ? " says the woman in the next seat to him on the flight to Vilnius , the country 's capital .
Camera crews are waiting at the airport and a couple of small boys in the street want his signature - and helmet if possible .
All this before a ceremony to honour him in the presence of the great and the good at St Catherine 's church in Vilnius , a baroque masterpiece .
Like other unexpected Britons , from Norman Wisdom in Albania to Mr Bean in Iran , PC Pettengell has become an icon overseas for work which has been honoured only locally in Britain .
The man who put him on a path to a ceremony with Valdas Adamkus , the president of Lithuania , EU commissioners and a foot - stomping crowd in Vilnius last week , was a Norfolk inspector , and a gentle piece of career advice .
" I was thinking about my next step in the police a year or two back , " says PC Pettengell , " and my chief in Yarmouth called me in and said ' How you do fancy being a ward beat manager ( WBM ) ? '
We all use long words now , but that really meant being the seafront bobby on the beat . "
It was a post to die for locally ( " Except between December and March , " he points out ) but the new WBM soon found an unexpected side to the fresh air and fun .
The resort 's long - established communities of Greek Cypriots and Portuguese had been newly joined by a puzzled , disorientated and often desperate group of new arrivals - Lithuanians on dodgy contracts which left them ignorant of British rules on employment and health and safety as well as frequently skint .
" I remember going into a room to meet a group and at the sight of the uniform they shrank away and clammed up , " he says .
" I thought : no , that is n't how we do policing here . "
Within the week , he was on the internet , checking out Teach Yourself Lithuanian courses .
By the end of the month , he took delivery of a set of CDs .
What he found as he went more deeply into the world of immigrant labour , newly possible for the Lithuanians through EU entry , shook him .
He recalls : " They did n't speak English , they worked together in factories , they lived in rooms together , they had to pay for minibuses to work , they were going to be the first to go if the economy had a downturn .
" A lot of them had been promised a pot of gold but I came across people who literally had n't eaten for a week .
And that way , we got people coming into the criminal justice system - like for stealing a loaf of bread - who simply should n't have been there . "
PC Pettengell 's answer , after mastering enough Lithuanian to break the ice , was to start a programme of basic help , on a one - to - one level and by setting up a " Welcome to Norfolk " website .
He obtained the funds himself from the Criminal Justice Board and started posting up the info which he knew was most needed .
" I 'd found myself answering the same questions again and again , simple things like : how do you open a bank account ?
Easy ?
Not when you share a room and can't produce a utility bill .
And then there was how do you get a national insurance card ?
Or first , what is a national insurance card ? "
The work did n't go unnoticed .
Last year PC Pettengell , 42 , whose wife , Sarah , is also a Norfolk PC , was nominated for Norfolk 's community officer of the year award , and he won .
That did n't go unnoticed either .
Local Lithuanians spread the word back home , and he faced the biggest test of his Lithuanian to date - when Vilnius newspapers and the country 's Channel 3 TV flew over to interview him .
" It turned out I 'd been put up for this award , " he says .
" They came and filmed me and some of the people here , and then they showed it over there , with similar films about the other candidates , and , well , I won . "
The field for the Pride of Lithuania ceremony 's various categories included a scientist saving orangutans in Sumatra , lifesavers , a priest rehabilitating drug abusers and families who had coped with disasters .
Tens of thousands of Lithuanians voted and the British bobby was their man .
Norfolk police were understandably chuffed .
Chief Superintendent Charlie Hall said : " We are really pleased , especially as we did n't put him up for it .
It was the Lithuanian people who picked up on the work he has done with the community in Yarmouth .
That work has had great benefits from a policing perspective in understanding the community 's issues and needs . "
Back home , after an official guided tour of Lithuania with Sarah , plus front page pictures in the mass circulation Lituvos Rytas newspaper , PC Pettengell now wants to lose the limelight and focus on his new job , dealing with domestic violence and hate crimes .
He learned a lot about the effects of scaremongering and racism during his Lithuanian project .
He also has a small admin job .
" Excuse me , " he says , " but I 've got to get a report in about what happened to my helmet . "
There was a boy at the awards who had overcome dire domestic and other problems , and he really wanted Gary 's headgear .
He got it .

Now everyone knows her in Hollywood .
Thailand
Does anyone talk about Peter Withe at English grounds these days ?
They do in Thailand where the ex Liverpool and Aston Villa striker coaches the national team .
They treat him like a king .
In the autumn of 2000 I went on honeymoon to Somerset — a beautiful rural region in the south - west of Britain .
Unfortunately , our trip coincided with widespread fuel blockades , and many petrol stations had run dry .
We had enough fuel to drive to Somerset , and enough to get back , but very little to spare for travelling around during our stay .
This did n’t bother us too much ( we were planning to do a lot of walking anyway ) , but when the weather was bad it presented a bit of a challenge .
On one particularly drizzly day , we found a flyer for the Bakelite Museum .
I think that the unspoken thought in both of our minds was , “ It will probably be a bit boring , but at least it will be dry . ”
As it turned out , we were utterly wrong about the appeal of Bakelite : it ’s fascinating stuff .
Great Balls of Fire
Around the turn of the 19th century , some plastics were already in use .
Early plastics were not wholly synthetic , even though that ’s how we think of plastics today .
Instead , they were formed from a mixture of synthetic and organic compounds .
The realisation that natural materials like ivory , horn , and tortoiseshell were becoming scarce because of over - exploitation prompted chemists to search for synthetic alternatives .
Cellulose nitrate ( more commonly known as celluloid ) was the first commercially successful product , and was developed by the British inventor Alexander Parkes .
Produced by reacting cellulose ( the organic part derived from plant cell walls ) with nitric acid ( the synthetic component ) , celluloid was a very adaptable material .
It was thermoplastic , meaning that it could be moulded into almost any shape with the application of heat and pressure .
It could also be coloured with dyes and pigments so that the products did not need to be painted , and had a tough , durable finish .
Celluloid was soon being used to replace ivory in objects like billiard balls , but there was one big drawback ; celluloid is highly flammable and sometimes explosive .
An enthusiastic break in billiards sometimes resulted in exploding balls — something that in my opinion would considerably improve its appeal as a spectator sport today .
Early celluloid cinematographic film also had the tendency to burst into flames , burning down cinemas and causing problems even today for the conservation of early films .
This also meant that celluloid was useless as an electrical insulator , something that was becoming increasingly sought after as the early electrical industries flourished .
The compound used for electrical insulation at the time was shellac .
This was a lacquer manufactured from the resin secreted by a small south - east Asian insect , Laccifer lacca .
It was a labour - intensive and expensive process , requiring around 300,000 insects to produce 1 kg ( about 2.2 lb ) of shellac .
With the new electrical industries booming , supply was not keeping up with demand .
Chemists around the world began to see that anyone who developed a synthetic substitute for shellac would become very rich .
Promising Goo
Leo Baekeland ( 1863 –1944 ) was a Belgian inventor who emigrated to the United States in 1889 .
He had developed ( pardon the pun ) a photographic paper called Velox which could be exposed using artificial light rather than sunlight , giving photographers much greater control over the process .
He sold the full rights to Velox to George Eastman of the Kodak corporation in 1899 for a staggering US $ 1 million , and used the money to set up a laboratory in Yonkers , New York .
There , he worked on the “ synthetic shellac ” problem .
He had an idea that the reaction between phenol ( derived from coal tar ) and formaldehyde might be promising .
The German chemist Adolf von Baeyer had already noted that such reactions resulted in a sticky substance that he dismissively called Schmiere ( “ goo ” ) .
Von Baeyer ’s interest was in dyes rather than insulators ( he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905 for his synthesis of indigo ) , but Baekeland saw the potential of the “ goo . ”
He experimented with different combinations of the raw products subjected to heat and pressure in an iron pressure cooker he invented called a ‘ bakelizer , ’ and finally found the magic combination in 1907 .
The Magic Plastic Bullet
Bakelite turned out to be extraordinarily versatile .
It was a thermosetting plastic , which meant that once heat and pressure had been applied to mould the material into a particular form , it could not be reversed .
It would not burn or melt ( which made it a great insulator ) , nor could it be readily dissolved with the common solvents or acids of the time .
If ‘ fillers ’ like fine sawdust or other fibres were mixed in before the mixture was set , the resulting Bakelite could be as strong as wood or even steel .
It could be moulded or carved into almost any shape .
Early Bakelite made with phenol tended to be dark brown or black , but a later process combining urea and formaldehyde produced a colourless resin which could be dyed with bright colours .
The colourful age of plastics had begun .
The Age of Design
Bakelite enabled a new era of mass production .
The moulding process meant that — while the initial investment in making the mould was very high — each item produced in the mould could be made relatively cheaply .
The maximum return on the investment could be gained by producing as many items from the same mould as possible .
At the same time , design became an important element in the marketing of products .
The products were cheaper and the appearance of an item became as important in convincing customers to part with their money as its function .
The Art Deco style of the 1920s and 1930s , with its sweeping curves and bold , geometric designs , was perfect for Bakelite .
Almost anything that you can imagine being made of plastic today would have been available in Bakelite , but radios , telephones , clocks , jewellery , kitchen utensils , cameras , combs , and brushes were particularly popular .
The new , colourful , glossy materials developed in symbiosis with the Art Deco style to form a confidently modern style , quite different from anything that had been seen before .
Bakelite was eventually superseded by newer plastics which were less brittle and cheaper to produce , but you can still find Bakelite items in many places today .
Wandering around the Bakelite Museum was like seeing the distilled essence of five decades .
The museum was packed with household objects of every kind from Bakelite condiment sets to an extraordinary Bakelite coffin , and I kept recognising things from my grandmother ’s house .
In particular , a set of fluted egg cups in 1950s pastel colours took me right back to having breakfast at my grandmother ’s when I visited for the weekend as a child .
All that nostalgia from something that starts off as sticky goo .
Editor ’s note :
As of early 2019 , the Bakelite Museum is temporarily closed for relocation .

This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on May 2 , 2005 .
Reader Helen DeWitt writes in with the following description of the U.S. military ’s current system of officer promotion , as told to her by an Air Force officer who just returned from Baghdad :
Officers rise through the system without relevance to merit ; promotions are based on the length of time the officer has been in the system .
( Up to the rank of Lieutenant - Colonel , anyway — to make Colonel you have to have done more than serve time . )
Enlisted men are subject to a completely different rule : you see them studying for months , mastering the contents of a book this thick ( makes gesture , thumb and fingers about three inches apart ) .
To be an officer you must either have been to one of the military academies or to college .
Because promotion is not based on merit , smart officers get frustrated and leave for jobs where they can make better money ; less able officers have every reason to stay , since incompetence is no impediment to career advancement .
Since the effect of the system is to retain the least able , it perpetuates the elimination of the able : the norm is for smart young officers to find themselves reporting not to superiors like themselves ( the ablest left early in frustration at the stupidity of the system ) , but to superiors who a ) were not frustrated by the system and b ) feel threatened by clever subordinates …
And that ’s how we get the leadership of our defense services .
Untapped resource : oceans contain 97 % of the planet 's water
A report by the environmental group said a growth in the energy intensive technology would increase emissions and damage coastal and river habitats .
More attention should instead be paid to conserving supplies , it suggested .
The study was published as Australia announced plans to build one of the world 's biggest desalination plants to supply drinking water to Melbourne .
" Desalinating the sea is an expensive , energy intensive and greenhouse gas emitting way to get water , " said Jamie Pittock , director of WWF 's global freshwater programme .
" It may have a place in the world 's future freshwater supplies but regions still have cheaper , better and complementary ways to supply water that are less risky to the environment . "
The report called for greater emphasis on managing existing supplies before the go - ahead was given to major water projects .
It added that new desalination plants , which were primarily located in coastal areas , should also be subject to tighter impact assessments to minimise damage to the marine environment .
Advances in technology meant that it was also possible to develop alternative " manufactured water " systems , such as treating waste water , the authors wrote .
Securing supplies
Desalination plants already play a major role in providing water for drinking and irrigation in areas such as the Middle East , where freshwater supplies are scarce .
Water supply , on a global basis , is a problem
Professor Richard Bowen , Royal Academy of Engineering fellow
But many other nations , including the US , China and Spain are turning to the technology to meet growing demands .
" Water supply , on a global basis , is a problem , " commented Richard Bowen , a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering .
" Desalination is set to become more important because the demand for water is going to increase , and a large percentage of the world 's population is situated in coastal areas . "
Professor Bowen , from the University of Wales ' School of Engineering , Swansea , said the environmental impact of desalination was well understood by the industry .
" The basic problem is that by taking sea water and producing fresh water , you are going to get a stream of fresh water , which is what you want , but you also produce a concentrated salt stream , " he explained .
" You have to be very careful what you do with that concentrated stream and where you put it back into the environment .
" There have been quite careful studies into the effects of this , so it is a consideration in the development of a new plant . "
The government in the Australian state of Victoria on Tuesday announced plans to build one of the world 's biggest desalination plants near Melbourne .
The project , which is expected to be completed by 2011 , is part of a scheme to " drought - proof " water supplies to the nation 's second largest city .
Southern Australia has been in the grips of a six - year drought , the worst on record .
The WWF report acknowledges that the technology had a " limited place in water supply " , but each project should be assessed on a case - by - case basis , it argued .
It recommended : " Desalination plants ... should only be constructed where they are found to meet a genuine need to increase water supply and are the best and least damaging method . "
The British government is weighing a plan that would require civil servants – including social workers and doctors – to report people deemed likely to commit acts of violence in the interest of stopping crimes before they are committed , according to a leaked official document .
The Times of London reports that the British Home Office 's internal document on " multi-agency information sharing " – which the newspaper received from a senior British official – would allow government agencies better access to information on potential threats .
Public bodies will have access to valuable information about people at risk of becoming either perpetrators or victims of serious violence .
Professionals will obviously alert police or other relevant authority if they have good reason to believe [ an ] act of serious violence is about to be committed .
However , our proposal goes beyond that , and is that , when they become sufficiently concerned about an individual , they must consider initial risk assessment of risk to / from that person , and refer [ the ] case to [ a ] multi-agency body .
The Times noted that the document says nothing of what would happen to those deemed likely to commit crimes , or their likely victims , were the proposal to be enacted .
Danger signs used to identify an individual as a potential perpetrator might include a violent family background , heavy drinking or mental health problems .
A potential victim might come to the attention of the monitoring agency on seeking treatment for stress - related conditions from a GP .
The Guardian compares a society with the plan enacted to the science fiction film Minority Report , in which Tom Cruise stars as a policeman in a " ' pre- crime ' unit who arrests would - be perpetrators before they can carry out crimes . "
Privacy advocates ' criticism shows similar concerns .
A [ spokesman for the British human rights group Liberty ] said the reports were worrying .
' What does the Home Office propose to do with the people who have committed no crime , but who fit a worrying profile ?
How far are we willing to go in pursuit of the unrealistic promise of a risk - free society ? '
But the Guardian noted that supporters of the plan say it could be used for good , citing its ability to identify threats like " killer Ian Huntley , who had been subject to complaints of violent behaviour which were not circulated to authorities in Cambridgeshire , where he became a school caretaker . "
Mr. Huntley was found guilty of the murder of two schoolgirls in the English town of Soham in 2002 , and is currently serving two life sentences .
A Home Office spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph that it did n't want to comment on leaked documents , but that the proposals are still in development , by a working group it has convened .
The Times report on the proposal comes amid a spate of criticism of Britain 's increasing use of closed - circuit ( CCTV ) cameras to watch the nation 's streets .
Deputy Chief Constable Ian Redhead of Hampshire expressed concerns on a BBC program that the country may soon face " an Orwellian situation . "
" I 'm really concerned about what happens to the product of these cameras , and what comes next ? " he said .
" If it 's in our villages , are we really moving towards an Orwellian situation where cameras are at every street corner ?
" And I really do n't think that 's the kind of country that I want to live in . "
The Daily Telegraph reports that a growing number of senior officials have spoken out against the proliferation of CCTV monitoring .
Acting Chief Constable Colin Langham - Fitt of Suffolk called for public debate about the use of CCTV in a recent newspaper interview , while Nick Clegg , the home affairs spokesman of the Liberal Democrat party , said that " Something is wrong when police officers , rather than Government ministers , seem more concerned about the protection of our customary British liberties . "
The Telegraph notes that there are some 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain , an average of one for every 14 people .
The latest tool goes even further , taking surveillance to the skies .
The Press Association reports the launch of a helicopter drone that will keep watch over Merseyside .
" The drone is only a metre wide , weighs less than a bag of sugar , and can record images from a height of 500m . "
Ecstasy use is widespread
They have drawn up an alternative system which they argue more accurately reflects the harm that drugs do .
The new ranking system places alcohol and tobacco in the upper half of the league table , ahead of cannabis and several Class A drugs such as ecstasy .
The study , published in The Lancet , has been welcomed by a team reviewing drug research for the government .
The Academy of Medical Sciences group plans to put its recommendations to ministers in the autumn .
A new commission is also due to undertake a three - year review of general government drug policy .
The new system has been developed by a team led by Professor David Nutt , from the University of Bristol , and Professor Colin Blakemore , chief executive of the Medical Research Council .
HAVE YOUR SAY I would say that on balance , many ' illegal ' drugs are less harmful than the two ' legal ' drugs available

It assesses drugs on the harm they do to the individual , to society and whether or not they induce dependence .
A panel of experts were asked to rate 20 different drugs on nine individual categories , which were combined to produce an overall estimate of harm .
In order to provide familiar benchmarks , five legal drugs , including tobacco and alcohol were included in the assessment .
Alcohol was rated the fifth most dangerous substance , and tobacco ninth .
Heroin was rated as the most dangerous drug , followed by cocaine and barbiturates .
Ecstasy , however , rated only 18th , while cannabis was 11th .
Arbitrary ranking
CURRENT DRUG CLASSIFICATION
Class A Cocaine / crack Heroin Ecstasy LSD Magic mushrooms Crystal meth ( pending ) Class A / B Amphetamines Class C Cannabis Ketamine
Drugs key facts Crystal meth to be Class A
The researchers said the current ABC system was too arbitrary , and failed to give specific information about the relative risks of each drug .
It also gave too much importance to unusual reactions , which would only affect a tiny number of users .
Professor
Nutt said people were not deterred by scare messages , which simply served to undermine trust in warnings about the danger of drugs .
He said : " The current system is not fit for purpose .
Let 's treat people as adults .
We should have a much more considered debate how we deal with dangerous drugs . "
He highlighted the fact that one person a week in the UK dies from alcohol poisoning , while less than 10 deaths a year are linked to ecstasy use .
Professor Blakemore said it was clear that current drugs ' policies were not working .
" We face a huge problem .
Illegal substances have never been more easily available , or more widely abused . "
He said the beauty of the new system , unlike the current version , was that it could easily be updated to reflect new research .
Professor Leslie Iversen , a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences group considering drug policy , said the new system was a " landmark paper " .
He said : " It is a real step towards evidence - based classification of drugs . "
Professor Iversen said the fact that 500,000 young people routinely took ecstasy every weekend proved that current drug policy was in need of reform .
Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker said : " We have no intention of reviewing the drug classification system .
" Our priority is harm reduction and to achieve this we focus on enforcement , education and treatment . "
He said there had been " unparalleled investment " of £ 7.5 billion since 1998 , which had contributed to a 21 % reduction in overall drug misuse in the last nine years and a fall of 20 % in drug related crime since 2004 .
But he added : " The government is not complacent and will continue to work with all of our partners to build on this progress . "
Regarding April 26th 's dance incident in the Rose Garden : George has clearly been on a conga line or two .
Or three .
But if this dance was meant to raise awareness for Malaria ( and it was ) , it 's failed on two counts .
First , his handlers clearly cut off the Kankouran West African Dance Troupe just as soon as the President really busted out ( see original at youtube ) and second , the clip has fallen way short of its potential as a viral phenomenon .
Fortunately , a few people have risen to the occasion , presented below .
Can you believe I could only find one video remix of this magic moment ?
If anybody finds or makes more versions , let me know or add links in the comments section and I 'll add them here .
The so - called solar tsunami rolls across the Sun after being kicked up by a major flare on Dec. 6 , 2006 .
A major flare on the Sun earlier this week generated what scientists are calling a solar tsunami .
The tsunami - like shock wave , formally called a Moreton wave , rolled across the hot surface , destroying two visible filaments of cool gas on opposite sides of the visible face of the Sun .
Astronomers using a prototype of a new solar telescope in New Mexico recorded the action .
" These large scale ' blast ' waves occur infrequently , however , are very powerful , " said K. S. Balasubramaniam of the National Solar Observatory ( NSO ) in Sunspot , NM , " They quickly propagate in a matter of minutes covering the whole Sun , sweeping away filamentary material . "
It is unusual to see such an event from a ground - based observatory , Balasubramaniam said .
And it was also unusual that it occurred near solar minimum , when the Sun is at its least active during an 11 - year cycle .
But solar activity can come at any time .
Flares like this one are spawned by sunspots , which are dark , cool regions that cap magnetic activity below .
When the caps pop , colossal doses of superheated matter and radiation are unleashed .
Sunspot 929 began kicking up flares Tuesday , when a major X - 9 event was detected by a space - based observatory .
When another flare erupted Wednesday , the NSO 's Optical Solar Patrol Network ( OSPAN ) was watching .
A shock wave propagated like the splash from a rock thrown into a pond .
This was seen as a brightening from compressed and heated hydrogen gas .
Astronomers enhanced the contrast of the images to bring out the detail , and they created an animation of the event .
Later , the shock wave swept across two dark filaments widely seprated on the solar surface , and they disappeared for a few minutes .
Scientists are unsure whether the filaments were blown off or were compressed so they were temporarily invisible , according to an NSO statement .
Forecasters say there is a 40 percent chance of more major flares through this weekend .
Skywatchers in Alaska , Canada and the very northernmost United States should be on the lookout for colorful Northern Lights generated by the space storminess .

Philip Marshall asks that Anthony Marshall be removed as Mrs. Astor ’s legal guardian and replaced by Annette de la Renta , a friend of Mrs. Astor ’s who is married to the designer Oscar de la Renta , and JPMorgan Chase Bank , according to an article published Wednesday in The Daily News that quoted the court papers .
On Wednesday morning , Justice John E. H. Stackhouse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered that the papers be sealed .
Image Brooke Astor with her son , Anthony Marshall , in 2003 on the way to the premiere of  I Am My Own Wife ,  which Mr. Marshall produced .
Credit ... Bill Cunningham / The New York Times
The allegations shocked the circles in which Mrs. Astor once moved , simply because they involved Mrs. Astor , who , though she was one of the most public figures in New York , always guarded her privacy carefully .
Her name alone denoted power and old wealth .
She is said to have thrown a would - be mugger off balance by saying : “ Excuse me , we ’ve not been introduced properly .
I ’m Mrs. Astor . ”
She became Mrs. Astor with her third husband .
She had divorced the first , and the second had died .
The third , Vincent Astor , was the son and heir of John Jacob Astor , who died on the Titanic , and whose fortune had begun in fur trading and real estate .
Vincent Astor bequeathed Mrs. Astor $ 60 million for herself and an equal amount for a foundation “ for the alleviation of human suffering . ”
But it is her suffering that Philip Marshall describes in the court papers quoted by The News .
There are allegations that her son vetoed purchases of a new outfit when she turned 104 , of cosmetics , of hats and socks .
There are allegations that he had curbed her physical therapy sessions and stopped her injections for anemia .
Included with Philip Marshall ’s allegations were affidavits from David Rockefeller , who planned her 100th birthday party , and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger .
Philip Marshall could not be reached on Wednesday , despite many attempts .
His lawyer , Ira Salzman , said the fight was being waged over concern for Mrs. Astor ’s care .
He said others might suggest it is a dispute over who would be Mrs. Astor ’s heir .
“ The short answer , ” Mr. Salzman said , “ is it ’s not . ”
Anthony Marshall , reached last night by telephone , said he would not comment .
David Richenthal , who produced three Broadway plays with Anthony Marshall , defended him and disputed the allegations as “ the most fabricated bunch of nonsense I ’ve ever read . ”
But especially in my efforts to live - blog the trial , I also felt the crush of details that can keep journalistic observers from seeing the larger context of the topics being discussed -- and , perhaps more importantly , those that are not -- as well as the comfortable cocoon of conventional wisdom that can harden into a permanent concrete barrier , preventing initial convictions from ever being questioned or reconsidered .
The ironic result , I think , is that even as you 're gathered together absorbing the minutiae of the Libby trial and reporting the day - to - day news as it progresses , all of you are missing a front - page / top - of - the - broadcast story that is just sitting there , waiting for whichever reporter has the initiative to nail it down .
So I 'm going to outline it for all of you here , in front of all your colleagues , just to see whose competitive juices get stirred up enough to complete the puzzle .
Let 's start with something that , if not quite a proven fact , is a clear inference from the trial so far : Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald suspects that Vice President Dick Cheney told Libby to leak Valerie Plame Wilson 's employment at the CIA to reporters during a flight aboard Air Force Two on July 12 , 2003 .
In a post on Friday at Firedoglake , I excerpted a searing line of questioning from Libby 's second grand jury appearance ( in March 2004 ) in which Fitzgerald stacked up one reason after another why Cheney might have made such a recommendation , faced with an unexpected and unceasing media firestorm over the false intelligence behind the Iraq war .
But maybe that 's not news to you -- after all , is n't it implicit in Libby 's subsequent calls to Matt Cooper and Judith Miller , during which he discussed Plame ?
Then again , consider this : both Cooper and Miller already had been told that Plame worked for the CIA , Cooper by Karl Rove and Miller by Libby himself .
Was all that strategizing aboard Air Force
Two merely devoted to telling two people something they already knew ?
Now consider Libby 's perverse " alibi , " in which he falsely confessed to more leaking than he actually engaged in .
He claimed to have told Matt Cooper independently about where Joseph Wilson 's wife worked , when according to Cooper 's testimony all he said was , " I 've heard that too , " in response to the reporter 's query ?
He also recalled telling the same story to Judy Miller , who never wrote about the leak and whose knowledge of Plame would have remained unknown in a less aggressive investigation , and the Washington Post 's Glenn Kessler , whom it appears was never leaked to at all .
Why ?
Libby 's motive with regard to Matt Cooper is apparent : his false admission provided a convenient -- and presumably intentional -- cover for Karl Rove 's failure to admit any conversation with Cooper .
( If there really was a plan to " sacrifice " Libby to protect Rove , Scooter seems to have been a willing co-conspirator . )
And evidence brought out during the trial implies a similar role for the Kessler confession .
Libby had kept and underlined passages in an October 12 , 2003 Washington
Post article which stated that a WaPo reporter had received a leak about Plame , along with an explanation that the White House considered her husband 's trip to Niger ( to investigate claims of Iraq seeking uranium ) a " boondoggle " set up by her .
In a passage from his grand jury testimony that inspired some mirth in the press gallery , Libby demurred from Fitzgerald 's repeated hints that he might be the leaker in question , then suddenly said , come to think of it , Kessler had used the term in asking Libby about the trip .
( The conversation got more hilariously strained from there . )
Scooter appears to have wanted Fitzgerald to believe that he was indeed the " leaker " described in the article , but that the context was far more innocent than reported .
In fact , given that the October 12 Post story reiterated a claim from a previous article that " two top White House officials disclosed Plame 's identity to least six Washington journalists , " the multiple ( and exaggerated ) confessions by Libby seem likely to be an effort to cover for the actual leakers there just as he did with Rove .
He wanted his questioners to think , " Oh , that 's me , you got your man , even if there was a bit of a misunderstanding .
Guess you do n't need to look any further . "
An enterprising reporter would take this as a challenge to , indeed , go further .
For all that has been written about the Plame leak , the many of the events of July 12 are still largely a mystery -- one made all the more tantalizing by the visible reluctance of Fitzgerald 's prosecution to address them .
For instance , the trial testimony of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer walked up to the edge of discussing a batch of phone calls that he and fellow flack Dan Bartlett were preparing to make to reporters from Air Force One as it flew back from Africa that day ... but neither side asked Ari to explain what was said during those calls , and particularly whether Valerie Plame Wilson 's job at the CIA was mentioned .
Similarly , judging from the rough play - by - play at Firedoglake , it seems Judith Miller was asked next to nothing about her July 12 , 2003 conversations with Libby , save for whether Plame was discussed -- no context at all .
And Matt Cooper , asked about his allusions to an additional source for the leak he received , stated that he was " trying to answer carefully " as he ascribed them to colleague John Dickerson .
If you 're a journalist , does n't all that tiptoeing signal something that should be looked into ?
Now consider those calls Fleischer did n't explain -- battling a still - rising tide of press criticism , and both knowing about Plame , can there be any doubt that Ari and Dan Bartlett included her CIA connection as part of their overall case against Wilson , just as the 10/12/03
Post article says ?
If so , would n't that obviously constitute " two top White House officials disclos[ing ]
Plame 's identity to least six Washington journalists " ?
And if Cheney had somehow authorized the calls in that fateful strategy session on Air Force Two , would n't Libby be motivated to cover them up ?
Although I 've expressed this theory since shortly after Libby was indicted , that 's neither here nor there at this point .
I 'm just an amateur blogger playing sleuth , without the sources to nail down my theories as wrong or right .
But now , with the evidence from the Libby trial pointing in this direction , where are the mainstream reporters chasing this potential career - making scoop ?
Perhaps there 's some tacit agreement or herd instinct keeping you from seeing the clues right in front of you .
So , now that I 'm back home and safely away from any personal backlash ( hey , I never said I was brave ) , I hope you do n't mind if I challenge your competitive instincts a little bit after laying down the leads in a venue that all of you are likely reading ( or can be tipped off by someone else who is ) .
How about it , Carol Leonnig and Amy Goldstein ?
Tired of your stories appearing on pages A3 and A4 of the Washington Post ?
Clinching the Veep 's involvement in outing a CIA agent will get you on the front page .
And Neil Lewis , David Stout , and company -- you 're the freaking New York Times , for crying out loud !
How do you want your paper to be remembered in connection with this scandal ?
For the immolation of Judith Miller 's tattered career ?
And all the rest of you -- what are you waiting for ?
AP's Matt Apuzzo has to file multiple stories every day , by the law of averages , is n't he likely to hit this angle sooner or later ?
And Shuster from " Hardball " -- you know Shuster 's going to be all over this , right ?
Do you really intend to let them scoop you ?
( Even worse , do you intend to let some obscure blogger get away with talking smack to you like this as he points out clues you have n't followed ?!)
In case you 've forgotten , here 's the issue again : Besides Libby 's chats with Matt Cooper and Judy Miller , what other leaks of Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity occurred on July 12 -- the one to Walter Pincus , and what else ?
Did the Vice President of the United States authorize these leaks , and what evidence does special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald have to this effect ?
Ladies and gentlemen , start your journalistic engines ... and now , go !

NEW YORK , United States —
The Baha'i International Community has obtained a document that appears to confirm double - dealing by Iran in its policy towards Baha 'i students seeking higher education .
The document , a 2 November 2006 letter from the headquarters of Payame Noor University to its regional branches , states that it is government policy that Baha 'i students " cannot enroll " in Iranian universities and that if they are already enrolled , " they should be expelled . "
" This document provides proof of Iran 's duplicitous behavior regarding Iranian Baha 'i students , " said Bani Dugal , the Baha'i International Community 's principal representative to the United Nations .
" In its public face , Iran claims that it has finally opened the doors to Baha 'i students , after some 25 years of keeping them out of public and private universities in Iran , " said Ms. Dugal .
" But , as evidenced by this confidential memorandum from the Payame Noor central office , the real policy is apparently to simply expel Baha 'is as soon as they can be identified . "
Indeed , the content of the letter sharply contradicts denials issued last week by an Iranian government spokesperson when asked to comment on figures released by the Baha'i International Community showing that a large number of Baha 'i university students have been expelled so far this year , solely because of religious discrimination .
According to a report by Reuters on 28 February 2007 , a spokesperson for the Iranian mission to the United Nations , who had requested his name not be used , was asked about the high percentage of expelled students and replied : " No one in Iran because of their religion has been expelled from studying . "
Until two years ago , all Baha 'i students were kept out of universities by the requirement that everyone list their religion on entrance examination forms .
Baha 'is were automatically rejected .
After pressure from the international community and human rights organizations , Iran changed its policy and dropped the religious affiliation requirement .
Last autumn , hundreds of Baha 'is passed the examination and some 178 were admitted into the university of their choice .
So far this school year , however , at least 70 Baha 'i students have been expelled as universities have learned that they were Baha 'is .
The 2 November letter was issued on the letterhead of Iran 's Ministry of Science , Research and Technology , and goes out from Payame Noor 's " Central Protection Office " to directors of the university 's regional centers .
" With respect , according to the ruling of the Cultural Revolutionary Council and the instructions of the Ministry of Information and the Head Protection Office of the Central Organization of Payame Noor University , Baha 'is cannot enroll in universities and higher education centers , " states the letter .
" Therefore , such cases if encountered should be reported , their enrollment should be strictly avoided , and if they are already enrolled they should be expelled . "
Payame Noor University is " the largest state university in terms of student numbers and coverage , " according to the university 's website , with some 467,000 students in 74 degree programs at 257 study centers and units throughout the country .
So far this year , at least 30 Baha 'i students have been expelled from Payame Noor .

WASHINGTON , May 31 — A top Russia expert at the State Department issued an unusually sharp public criticism on Thursday of Moscow ’s behavior under President Vladimir V. Putin , describing the Kremlin as bullying its neighbors while silencing political opponents and suppressing individual rights at home .
The comments , approved by the White House , are the latest volley of criticism between Washington and Moscow in recent days .
Although the White House said this week that President Bush would play host to Mr. Putin on July 1 at the Bush family compound in Maine , the speech is likely to add tension at a time when the broader dialogue between Washington and Moscow is already taking the most caustic tones since the collapse of communism .
“ We do no one any favors , least of all the Russian people and even their government , by abstaining from speaking out when necessary , ” the Russia expert , David Kramer , the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs , said in a speech Thursday night before the Baltimore Council on Foreign Affairs .
The speech came a day after Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia accused the United States of fomenting a dangerous new arms race and implicitly threatened to block any effort by the United States and Europe to win broader diplomatic recognition for Kosovo .
On Thursday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , a scholar of Russian affairs , used a speech in Potsdam , Germany , to describe the American - Russian relationship as one of “ cooperation and competition , of friendship and friction . ”
Faster Than Light
by I. E. Lester
What would mankind do if we suddenly discovered that extra-terrestrial life existed ?
The answer depends upon how we find out .
Unlike the experiences of Mulder and Scully in the X - Files , our first encounter with alien life is not likely to be in the form of a visiting life form ( an " Extraterrestrial - Biological - Entity " if you like ) stepping out of his / her / its ship and doing something typically alien .
You know , like saying " Take Me to Your Leader " or abducting some poor hick from a back - road and probing him .
Our first encounter is much more likely to be in one of two forms .
First , we might discover the by - products of life .
Various scientists across the globe are attempting to find " irrefutable " proof of extraterrestrial life by analysing the spectrum of extrasolar planets ' atmospheres .
If elements and compounds such as Oxygen , Ozone , Carbon Dioxide , Methane , or Nitrous Oxide are found to exist on other worlds , they could indicate that biological processes are taking place .
The second possible indication is in the form of radio signals – although a deliberate " Hello Earth " broadcast is very unlikely .
If an alien civilisation has evolved out there it is likely we will notice their internal communications long before receiving a deliberate greeting .
We 've been broadcasting signals on Earth capable of reaching deep space for over seven decades .
If any species out there has developed a civilisation it would seem reasonable to assume that they too would have developed some means of mass communication .
If either of these things happened what would mankind do ?
Our choices are a little restricted .
We do not have a handy spaceship capable of Warp Speed parked in orbit – much as having our own Starship Enterprise might come in handy .
Neither are we capable of opening a wormhole and piloting our sub - light capable ship through this " short - cut " in space .
If we detect signs of organic life in a planet 's spectra then the likely response is a more targeted future mission to learn as much about the planet as we can by means of telescopes and space probes .
If we receive radio signals – continuing ones that is – it is likely that a large scale study will be conducted involving sociologists , linguists and similar experts , to try to interpret these signals , learn their language (s ) , understand their societies etc .
We might at some point send a signal back and attempt communication .
This kind of communication , though , is likely to be extremely difficult and not very productive .
We have to consider distance .
Our galaxy , the Milky Way , is about 100,000 light years across .
We are about 28,000 light years from the centre .
That means if life exists elsewhere in our galaxy , it could be on a world up to 78,000 light years distant .
Even the nearest star to us ( other than our Sun ) is over 4 light years away , and there are only about a dozen or so within ten light years .
Any signal we send out to an alien civilisation will be limited by the speed of light , so even if we got lucky and found life existing on a near neighbour we would still be waiting years to get a reply to each communication .
Each answer would be received by the next generation from the one asking the question ( or maybe several generations further down the line ) .
Faster Than Light ?
How could we speed this up a bit ?
And could we even make the trip there to meet them ?
To make interstellar communications and travel possible we need to be able to send messages ( or ourselves ) across these vast distances in considerably less time that it takes for light or conventional radio waves to make the journey .
When Einstein published his theory of Special Relativity in 1905 , contrary to a popular misconception about his theory , he did not state that travel faster than light is impossible .
However , his theory included the following equation :
( E is energy , m is mass , v is velocity and c stands for the speed of light .
This is the equation more commonly represented as E=mc2 , simplified for objects at rest , velocity being zero . )
As velocity approaches the speed of light the lower half of this equation tends to zero , and the energy requirement tends towards infinity .
This means that accelerating to speeds greater than light using conventional means would require more than infinite energy , and hence it is not possible to accelerate from less than to greater than light speed .
Hence , we would need to find a mechanism to allow the distances to be covered in less time than light would travel in a direct line between the two points without actually exceeding the speed of light locally to the traveller , or the message .
Science Fiction has two popular ways of achieving this - Warp Drive and Wormholes .
But are these methods actually feasible ?
Warp Drive
In 1994 Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre decided to investigate if a Star Trek type Warp Drive could be created , achieving superluminal speeds ( faster than light ) without breaking the rules of relativity .
His starting point was the curving of space caused by gravity .
He postulated that if you distort spacetime by greatly extending it behind the spacecraft whilst simultaneously contracting it in front of the craft , then the craft itself could travel inside this region of distorted space at sub - light speeds whilst achieving superluminal speeds when compared to objects in normal space .
This warp " bubble " would shield the craft and its occupants from the effects of the massive acceleration and deceleration of the journey , and would mean that the travellers would not experience time dilation effects .
The downside of this method is it requires the use of Exotic Matter – matter with a negative energy density .
Physicists are not convinced this matter even exists – the laws of quantum physics suggest it might , but no proof has yet been found .
Even if it does exist , it might not be possible to collect enough to build a working Warp Drive .
Wormholes
Wormholes are a well - known and frequently proposed mechanism for achieving FTL travel .
Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen were the first to describe wormholes in 1935 ( they were originally known as Einstein - Rosen bridges ) .
Physicist John
Wheeler would coin the term " wormhole " in 1955 ( and would also invent the terms " black hole " and " quantum foam " ) .
The concept can be described simply .
If you imagine the universe as the skin of an apple , then to get from a point on the surface to a second point on the far side we would have to travel around the edge .
However , if we were to burrow through the apple just like a worm might , then we get there much more quickly .
If we could burrow in this way through the spacetime of the universe then we could move at sub - light speeds directly through the tunnel crossing the distance in a far shorter time than light travelling in regular space could manage .
We would have achieved our objective without having to break that pesky light - speed barrier .
But exactly how could a wormhole be opened ?
Michael Morris , Kip Thorne , and Uri Yertsever working at the California Institute of Technology published a paper in 1987 describing Traversable Wormholes .
Space has an underlying energy , known as Vacuum Energy , even when it appears totally empty of matter : the empty space of a vacuum is not actually empty if you look at it at the quantum level .
Even in a total vacuum , Virtual Particles are continually being created , always as particle / antiparticle pairs , living brief lives and then mutually annihilating each other .
These Virtual Particles are also known as Vacuum Fluctuations in the Vacuum Energy .
As well as these Virtual Particles a vacuum is teeming with violent but incredibly small - scale fluctuations in space - time itself , ultra - small wormholes that are continually being created and destroyed in an instant .
However these wormholes could be kept stabilised by using exotic matter to keep their entrances open .
Exotic matter exerts a negative pressure – if you were to attempt to inflate a balloon using exotic matter you would find that the more you pumped into the balloon the less inflated it would become .
If you were to thread the entrance of a wormhole with such material , then this negative pressure would prevent the mouth 's collapse .
Once stabilised it may be possible to move these entrances across vast areas whilst maintaining their link .
The initial trip would , by necessity , need to be made at normal velocities , but once the entrances were installed at their respective destinationis we could then have FTL communication and possibly travel through this wormhole .
The theory does allow for the entrances to be expanded to the macroscopic by adding energy .
However there is a hurdle to overcome with this method , aside from discovering these tiny wormhole entrances .
The force required to keep the entrance open is huge .
So great , in fact , that it may well tear apart anything trying to pass through the wormhole .
But they may provide a useful means of communicating with a ship moving at Subluminal speeds ( slower than light ) away from Earth .
Is the Speed of Light Constant ?
There are other possibilities that might help us .
We could make light travel faster , and so be able to achieve greater velocities without having to travel FTL .
This sounds a little like Scotty 's famous line on Star Trek about the laws of physics , but it could be possible .
Vacuum Fluctuations fill ( in a virtual sense ) a vacuum , with particle / anti-particle pairs continuously being created and annihilated .
If a photon strikes these pairs it is absorbed , to be re-emitted when the pair self - destructs .
This slows down the photon .
In 1990 Klaus Scharnhorst of the Humboldt - Universität zu Berlin in East Germany and Gabriel Barton of the University of Sussex , working independently , explored what would happen to photons travelling perpendicularly to two parallel plates placed extremely close together ( roughly one micrometer of separation ) in a vacuum .
This degree of separation is less than the wavelengths of some of the Virtual Particles and so lowers the density of the Virtual Particles in the vacuum .
This lowering of Vacuum Energy results in the photon being less likely to encounter Virtual Particles and therefore being able to travel faster than our accepted speed of light .
This phenomenon has been called the Scharnhorst Effect .
This is on an incredibly small scale , but if we could expand the range and effect of this we could be able to travel faster than light outside the local area of effect whilst not actually breaking the restrictions imposed by relativity .
Quantum Entanglement
Quantum
Theory allows for two particles to interact , such that the quantum states of the particles are joined forming a single entangled state .
This results in the two particles being not completely independent of the other , so that affecting one of the entangled pair would produce a result in the other .
This would occur irrespective of the extent of spatial separation between the two particles .
So could these entangled particles be used for superluminal communications ?
To achieve this we would need to create two or more identical ( or cloned ) particles and then separate them physically from each other .
Then if we were to act on one of the particles , an observer of the second should be able to detect an effect .
Then introducing a code ( such as Morse Code ) would mean we should be able to communicate at greater than the speed of light .
Such a thing is unfortunately impossible .
In 1982 physicists Bill Wootters , Wojciech H. Zurek and Dennis Dieks introduced the No Cloning Theorem .
This theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state .
As cloning is a requirement of using these entangled particles for superluminal communication , we have to rule this method out .
Tachyons
Relativity might state that we cannot accelerate from sub - light speeds to super - light speeds , but it does not explicitly forbid the existence of particles travelling faster than light .
Tachyons are theoretical particles that travel at speeds greater than light , but are not capable of slowing to below light - speed ( the barrier operates in both directions ) .
If such particles exist ( and there is some doubt amongst physicists ) then could they be used to transmit messages ?
The problem would be how to detect them , and how then to affect them in such a way as to send our message .
In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov was investigating the effects of radiation in liquids .
Light travels through water at a speed far less than it does in a vacuum .
This means that it is possible for a particle to travel through water at speeds greater than that of light in the same medium .
Cherenkov noticed that when a charged particle does exceed the speed of light in this medium , the water glowed blue .
This effect is known as Cherenkov Radiation .
If there are charged Tachyons moving through the vacuum we should be able to detect this Cherenkov Radiation .
So far no such Tachyons have been discovered , and many physicists doubt their existence .
From the subluminal perspective , fast moving charged particles interacting with other particles would lose energy and slow down .
For charged Tachyons these interactions would also cause them to lose energy .
The problem for charges Tachyons is that relativity states that moving closer to the speed of light requires more and more energy .
Hence , if tachyons move faster than the speed of light , losing energy would cause them to accelerate , resulting in more and more collisions and a runaway reaction of speed increase and energy loss until the Tachyon would have infinite velocity .
So we must assume that if Tachyons exist then they cannot be electrically charged .
If we assume Tachyons do exist and that we can control them , could we use them to transmit messages faster than light ?
To do this we would need to encode the message on a localised Tachyon field , one confined to a definable region of spacetime .
Once encoded we can then transmit this field to its intended recipient .
However , there is a problem with this .
Relativistic quantum mechanics examines the wave properties of Tachyons by means of the Klein - Gordon equation , a relativistic method of describing particles .
There are two possible solutions to this equation for Tachyon disturbances .
The first has the particles ' momentum being lower than their energy .
This solution states that the disturbances are localised , but also that they are propagated at speeds less than that of light .
The second solution , with energy exceeding momentum , does indeed produce waves at superluminal velocities .
The problem however is that we cannot localise the wave , which would mean we cannot use the wave to transmit a message .
So , even if Tachyons do exist , they do not seem to present us with a method of faster - than - light communication .
Unfortunately , with our current knowledge of physics , if we want to get to another solar system it will take a long , long time .
On January 23rd 2006 NASA 's New Horizons Space Mission was launched .
This is speeding towards Pluto at 58,000 kilometres per hour .
Even using a slingshot from Jupiter to gain more speed this probe will not arrive at Pluto until 2015 .
Pluto is about 4.28 billion kilometres form Earth at its closest .
The nearest star other then our Sun is Proxima Centauri at over 40 trillion kilometres .
It takes light 4.2 years to cross the distance between the solar systems .
If New Horizons had been aimed at Proxima Centauri it would not arrive for thousands of years .
But science has been advancing at ever increasing rates .
It 's only just over a hundred years since the Wright Brothers built the first craft capable of flight , and we have already landed men on the moon and sent probes to the other seven planets in our Solar System .
Another hundred years might see such advances that could see mankind leave this solar system .
Some gadgets are good for painting with , while others are good for a fiery good time , but these five are definitely the coolest ride ’em creations we ’ve come across .
View them all after the break .

Bipartisan bill bans warrantless wiretapping of US citizens Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Members of Congress from both parties succeeded on Friday in passing legislation that restricts the wiretapping of US citizens by the National Security Agency without warrants .
" When Congress said the Administration must get court approval for domestic surveillance , we meant it .
Today , Congress reaffirmed that basic protection , " said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) , who co-sponsored legislation included in the intelligence authorization bill that Congress passed .
Schiff , with Rep. Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , sponsored the NSA Oversight Act in January to " retain court supervision over domestic electronic surveillance , " according to a release the two Congressmembers sent to RAW STORY .
They further explained that their bill " reiterates that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( FISA ) continues to be the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information may be conducted .
The amendment also makes clear that only an explicit change in the law can provide an exception to FISA . "
Flake emphasized that the FISA process needed to be respected .
" Many of us in Congress have tried to update and improve FISA , " said Flake .
" However , until we codify those changes into law , FISA must be respected . "
In February , RAW STORY reported on Schiff 's concern that the intelligence community had gone too far in its spying activities during the Bush administration .
Schiff had suggested that a process comparable to the Church Committee , which uncovered abuses of power by the Nixon administration and earlier presidencies , might need to be be constituted by the current Congress .
Schiff and Flake noted in their release that last year they failed to advance a measure on a close vote which would have " cut funding to any program that conducted domestic surveillance outside of FISA . "
However , it was not clear at press time whether the two representatives would sponsor this measure again .
Compact Fluorescent Lamp ( CFL )
Menu
Compact fluorescent lamps have some benefits in comparison with classic light bulbs .
It is lower power consumption ( to 80 % ) and much longer lifetime ( 5 to 15 times ) .
Disadvantages are longer starts mainly at more expensive types , impossibility to use darker and price .
Fluorescent lamps are available usually in these color temperatures :
Warm white ( 2700 K )
Cool white ( 4000 K )
Daylight ( 6000 K )
Most often we meet with " warm white " , which is close to classic bulb and which is most pleasant to people .
Compact fluorescent lamp use vacuum pipe similar to classic strip lamp and princip of energy transformation to light is same .
Tube has on both ends two electrodes faced with Barium .
Kathode has high temperature about 900 degree Celsius and generates many electrons which are accelerated by voltage between electrodes and hits atoms of Argon and Mercury .
There arise low temperature plasm .
Overflowing energy mercury radiate in a UV light form .
Inner side of tube is faced with luminophore , which transform UV light in to the visible light .
Tube is powered by alternating current , so that function of electrodes ( cathode and anode ) is still changing .
Because there are used switched converter , which works on tens of kilohertz , that CFL lamp does n't " blink " in comparison to classic strip tube lamp .
Converter , which is present in a screw cap , substitute classic ballast with a starter .
Princip of function we explain on a LUXAR 11W lamp .
Circuit contains supply section , which includes interference suppressor L2 , fuse F1 , bridge rectifier from 1N4007 diodes and filtering capacitor C4 .
Starting section includes D1 , C2 , R6 and diac .
D2 , D3 , R1 , R3 have protect function .
Other parts have normal operation function .
R6 , C2 and DIAC mades first pulse to base of transistor Q2 and cause his opening .
After start is this section blocked by diode D1 .
After every opening of Q2 is discharged C2 .
There is not possible to collect enough energy for reopening of diac .
Next are transistors excitated over very small transformer TR1 .
It consists of ferrite ring with three windings ( 5 to 10 coils ) .
Now are filaments powered over capacitor C3 from voltage rises from resonant circuit from L1 , TR1 , C3 and C6 .
Than the tube lights up is resonation frequency specified by capacity of C3 , because he has much lower capacity than C6 .
In this moment is voltage on a C3 over 600V in a relation to used tube .
During start is peak collector current about 3 to 5 times bigger than during normal operation .
When the tube is damaged , there are hazard of transistor destroying .
When the gas is ionisated in a pipe , C3 will be practically shorted and thanks to this frequency goes down and changer is now drived only by C6 and changer generates much lower voltage but enough to keep the light on .
In a normal situation , when transistor opens , that current to TR1 increasing until his core is saturated and next his feedback to base drop away and transistor closes .
Now opens second transistor which is excitated by reversly connected windind of TR1 and all process repeats .
Common failure is broken capacitor C3 .
it is possible mainly at cheap lamps , where are used cheaper components for lower voltage .
Whet the pipe does n't lights up on time , there are risk of destroying transistors Q1 and Q2 and next resistors R1 , R2 , R3 and R5 .
When lamp starts , changer is very overloaded and transistors usually does n't survive longer temperature overloading .
When the pipe serve out , electronics is usually destroyed too .
When the pipe is old , there can be overburned one of filaments and lamp does n't lights up anymore .
Electronics usually survives .
Sometimes can be pipe broken due to internal tension and temperature difference .
Most frequently lamp fails , when power on .
Repair of electronics usually means change of capacitor C3 if he is brobek .
When burns fuse , probably will be damaged transistors Q1 , Q2 and resistors R1 , R2 , R3 , R5 .
You can replace fuse with resistor 0R5 .
Failures can be multiplied .
For example , when is shorted capacitor there can be thermally overloaded transistors and will be destroyed .
Best transistors for replacing of original types are MJE13003 , but it is not easy to find them .
I replaced them with BD129 , but they are not available now .
There exists other variants like a 2SC2611 , 2SC2482 , BD128 , BD127 , but I am not sure if they will be long - life .
Original transistors are not available on our market .
If does n't matter size of case TO220 , it 's possible to use transistors MJE13007 .
Lamp is usually compounded of two parts .
One is plastic cover with holes for pipe and bills .
Tube is agglutinated to it .
Second much bigger piece has slots for bills from the inner side .
Inside is printed circuit board with components and wires from tube .
From the upper side of PCB are wires to top of lamp , where are soldered or stamped to the contact .
Both plastic parts are clicked to himself and sometimes glued .
Usually you can carefully leverage with a small screwdriver sequently to round to the gap between both plastic pieces for releasing of glue .
Next you must leverage more to the opening lamp .
For closing of lamp you can only click both plastic pieces to himself .
Look at photo of opened lamp .
Most of these compact fluorescent lamps use same or very similar wiring .
more expensive lamps use a little complicated wiring with electrode preheating and thanks to it they have longer lifetime .
Repairing of these lamps not pay off , because price of cheaper types are very low now and price of human work is much higher .
Wiring diagrams originates while repairing of lamps and they are only for study or repair uses .
Informations are from retracing of lamps and from sources in a link section .

Compact fluorescent lamp Bigluz 20W use classic wiring with a small changes .
Values of parts are modified for bigger power .
Photo of opened lamp Bigluz 20W .
Lamp Isotronic 11W use a little modified wiring , where does n't exists starting circuit with a diac .
Lamp starts probably thanks to capacitor C1 .
Lamp Luxtek 8W use classic wiring with a small changes .
Interesting is only thermistor , which probably makes light start and filament preheating .
Photo of board with a electronics and upper side of cover .
Lamp Maway 11W use different wiring too like Isotronic lamp .
Lamp Maxilux 15W use classic wiring .
Lamp Polaris 11W has a small thread and changes some values of components .
Wiring is classic .
BrownieX 20W lamp has a simplified wiring like a Isotronic lamp .
Lamp PHILIPS ECOTONE 11W use again simplified wiring like a Isotronic lamp .
This lamp compared to other has a right dimensed components , that electronics probably can live longer .
Wiring is less cheated than others .
It has coil L2 for blocking HF interference and capacitor C1 for voltage 1200V , which is very much stressed .
Tube is superior compared to a no - name types .
Light color " warm white " brings light of classic bulb and does n't have a small pink tone like others .
Tube is a little longer and have much light compared to others 11 W types .
All these lamps , which I have from several series have identical color tone and brilliance .
Compared to lamps MAWAY , where every item have different color tone , some have destroyed electronics , some have pipe with a lost vacuum etc ...
It is seen , that lamps from marked manufacturers have guaranteed parameters and better quality than no-name .
Photography of opened Philips lamp .
Lamp IKEA 7W has classic wiring like a Luxar 11W .
Component values are modified to a lower power .
Parts are enough voltage dimensed .
Failure was overburned one of filaments .
Lamp was on continuous for one year , which is over 8500 hours .
Life time corresponds to a label specifications .
Photography of opened lamp IKEA 7W
Lamp OSRAM DULUX EL 11W has again classic wiring with only few changes .
She has a small thread and was a fully functional .
Lamp OSRAM DULUX EL 21W has a classic wiring diagram .
In contrast to a previous OSRAM lamp does n't have thermistor for slow start .
She has overburned one filament .
Lamp EUROLITE 23W has a classic wiring diagram .
For schematics thanks to Mard .
Electronic ballast SINECAN 5 for two fluorescent tubes has identical circuit like most of compact fluorescent lamps .
Little differency is in powering tubes before D6 diode and wiring of start capacitors C10 a C11 about tubes .
I do n't understand exactly why this is wired this way .
Ballast does n't have fuse , but only thin wire .
Ballasts was broken due to blowed electrolytic capacitors .
It breaks transistors and resistors R3 , R4 , R5 and R6 .
Photography of open ballast .
This bulb is only interesting with power value 25 W .
Circuit is classic .
Philips Genie bulbs I am using for many years .
I am satisfied with them .
Their advantage is very compact size of tube which allow installing in to the lamp with small space for bulb .
It lights up immediately after power - up .
I did n't see any negative effect on their lifetime .
Disassembled light bulb .
This bulb has almost identical circuit to their 11W variant .
It has two additional protect dioded D6 and D7 .
Values of few components are a little changed .
Transistors are more powerful types 13003 .
Nuno Sucena Almeida succesfully repaired ellectronic ballast and sent me his schematics which I now show to you .
Schematics is very similar to many other lamp ballasts .
Interesting for me is using of voltage doubler because lamp is for 120V but electronics is designed for 230V .
Here is original authors article : http://slug.blog.aeminium.org/2012/03/01/electronic-ballast-repair/
Next lamp with classic design .
Only his miniature construction is interesting .
It has broken one heat filament .
Disassembled OSRAM lamp .
What 's Advertagg ?
It all started about 2 weeks ago when I decided to see what makes Digg.com so special .
Digg is a social news sharing site where people vote or " digg " the stories they find most interesting .
Digg recieves hundreds of thousands of hits per day .
It was originally intended for technology and geek news , which it 's still known for .
Digg members are the first to get leaks about everything .
I started posting on Digg and watched my web traffic go through the roof .
Here is an example of one of my best days last week .
I did alright on Digg until I was unable to post blog entries anymore .
I can link to everything else but my own site .
That sucks !
You see , Digg members police themselves and report " spam " .
Of course my entries are going to seem like spam , I write about advertising .
It just came to light that over 50 of the top Digg users are on the payroll of a PR firm .
I did a little research and found out that the " social news " trend is on the rise .
Remember Netscape , they are n't just a search engine anymore , they are a social news engine .
There is a also Spanish Digg clone called meneame .net .
I was n't spamming on Digg , though I was promoting my site .
I first started blogging in late August , as an experiment to look further into blogs and the " new " web .
Posting on Digg was an experiment in Web 2.0 .
This leads me into Advertagg.com .
Advertagg.com is my social news experiment .
I figure I can't get kicked out of my own network .
Advertagg is about creativity , innovation , and communication .
It is as much about advertising , marketing , and technology as it is about design and art .
I also made sure to include a section for amatuer and student work .
It 's still in the works but , I just finished making the beta version thanks to Pligg , a site that designed shareware to create these types of networks .
I 'm tired .
So please , take a look , join , and post an article or two .
I would like to remind you that I am not a programmer so this whole thing still needs work .
I just started testing it today .
Feedback is greatly appreciated and if there are any designers out there that can work with smarty codes and CSS , I could use a lil help .
Good night !

Islamic groups condemned the strike across Pakistan
There were angry scenes as they were buried - with denunciations of Monday 's attack by Islamists , who say most of the 70 - 80 people who died were pupils .
But officials insist the victims were fighters .
The raid occurred in a remote tribal area near the Afghan border .
The region is said to provide refuge for al - Qaeda and Taleban militants .
A local leader with suspected links to al - Qaeda , Faqir Mohammed , addressed a crowd of 10,000 mourners .
" The government attacked and killed our innocent people on orders from America , " he is quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
" It is an open aggression . "
Thousands took part in protests against Pakistan 's alliance with the US , chanting " Death to Bush " and burning American flags , the Associated Press news agency reported .
A cabinet minister from Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province , Siraj ul - Haq , said he would resign in protest at the strike .
" This is a very wrong action .
They [ the victims ] were not given any warning , " Mr ul - Haq told AP .
No deal
There was widespread condemnation of the air strike from Islamic groups in other parts of Pakistan , including Peshawar and Lahore .
The MMA , a coalition of religious parties , called a protest on Tuesday in Karachi , the country 's largest city .
The army said the religious school , or madrassa , was used as a military camp .
Army spokesman Gen Shaukat Sultan said the strike that destroyed it had killed militants only .
" There was no collateral damage , " he said .
The attack came as the government was due to sign a peace deal with pro-Taleban militants in the area , which now appears to have failed .
There is sympathy for the Taleban and al - Qaeda among tribesmen in Bajaur and that is believed to translate into active support , the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says .
Pakistan has deployed nearly 80,000 troops along the border .
They are there to hunt militants who sought refuge after the ousting of the Taleban in Afghanistan in 2001 .
' Saddened '
President Pervez Musharraf has pledged to reform madrassas after many were criticised for supporting Islamic militancy .
The leader of the madrassa , radical cleric Maulana Liaqat , was among the dead .
At least three helicopters were reportedly involved in the attack
An eyewitness told the BBC that the madrassa was filled with about 80 local students who had resumed studies after the Muslim Eid holidays .
Journalists trying to get to the scene were being turned back as they tried to enter the Bajaur region .
The attack came two days after local militants attended a rally in the area where they declared the al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and Taleban chief Mullah Muhammad Omar as their heroes .
Bajaur , which borders Afghanistan 's insurgency - plagued eastern province of Kunar , was the scene of a controversial US air strike in January , believed to be aimed at al - Qaeda number two Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The 13 January raid killed at least 18 people , mostly civilians .
In May , Pakistani authorities said a senior al - Qaeda figure , Abu Marwan al - Suri , had been killed in Bajaur during a clash with local police .

What do you do if you are a 17 - year - old programming genius living in Seattle , in the US ?
Do you work for Microsoft , the largest software company in the world with billions of dollars in resources and a clear career path ?
Or do you move away from your family , 800 miles south to San Francisco and single - handedly build a photo - sharing website that will eventually have 100,000 users around the world ?
Kris Tate , a softly - spoken and impossibly polite teenager , did the latter .
Now 18 years old , Tate is the coding expert responsible for Zooomr , one of the most popular photo websites on the net .
He has been using computers since he was four years old - and not just bashing his fingers on a keyboard as though it were a toy .
" At four I was working with my dad 's Apple Mac .
He brought home Code Warrior programming software and compilers and I started coding .
I liked seeing how things ticked .
" I was able to build things and share it with other people . "
Nascent internet
After experimenting with connecting computers together physically , he took full advantage of the nascent internet .
" I really like language and communication .
Two years ago I had been doing interesting stuff with linguistics and talking with people around the world on the net .
" My photography was also really important to me as a way to round myself out and express myself . "
Tate moved to San Francisco because he felt the city was at the heart of web development .
" Even though Seattle is very tech - centric there was a lot more web stuff going on here .
A lot more opportunity .
" Through my childhood San Francisco was always a really interesting place .
We travelled through it a few times , over the Golden Gate bridge , and it always seemed like a mystical place in California . "
A lot of lines ( of code ) are created in cafes .

He was talking to Yahoo in Silicon Valley about a job when a personal dilemma took him in a new direction .
" On my journey to the Bay Area I took a lot of photos but it was hard to share these universal pieces of work with my friends and family around the world .
" I would go to English - centric photo - sharing sites and friends would be able to see these sites but were not able to interact with them , to join in with the experience .
" That 's how Zooomr started - an accumulation of my prior knowledge of computing and web applications , with knowledge of HTML and how databases work .
' Past experiences '
" Zooomr is a combination of all my past experiences , bringing them all together into one solution . "
Tate built Zooomr initially for friends but launched it to the world soon after .
The site was mentioned on prominent technology blog TechCrunch and within hours picked up buzz on the blogosphere .

" It was interesting to see different time zones light up and start using Zooomr .
" Within a matter of five hours or so we were swamped .
The site went down because the response was quite significant . "
That response attracted the attention of prominent angel investor Ron Conway , who put in $ 50,000 ( £ 25 , 400 ) after meeting Tate .
Within a few months he had gone from an unemployed coder living in a strange city to the founder and sole engineer behind a start - up with investment and a growing user base .
One-man coding
Little about Tate is typical .
Zooomr is still a one - man coding operation but well - known blogger and photographer Thomas Hawk has gone from evangelist for the site to chief executive , helping with the business administration side of the enterprise .
Rather than rent a space in the SOMA district of San Francisco - where many other start - ups are located - Tate continues to develop Zooomr from his home or wherever he can find wi-fi access .
" A lot of lines ( of code ) are created in cafes .
It happens anywhere - just as long as I have my Macintosh with me I can just do it . "
Tate is about to release a new version of Zooomr , built from the ground up with new features to help differentiate it from the rest of the market .
One of the key features will be the ability for users to monetise their photos as stock photography .
" We feel our users are creating some great photos and not just for sake of consuming this media but also showing what is going on all round the world .
Upload photos
" We want to allow our users to make money and revenue off their work and only share 10 % of the sales ourselves . "
Tate and Hawk believe the stock photography business is a $ 2bn ( £ 1.01 bn ) market .
They also see it as a way for Zooomr to break even ; the site does not charge users to upload photos and there are no limits on how many pictures can be hosted .
Tate says : " We want to take just enough to break even .
We want to grow the site rather than become a huge profit machine .
" We really want to help people all round the world in all walks of life share their photography . "
But what about the competition ?
Zooomr may have 100,000 users but it is dwarfed by the scale of Flickr , which is owned by Yahoo , and the 800lb gorilla in the marketplace .
" Flickr is a different service ; we are on our own path , " says Tate .
" We are truly world wide and more internationalised and there are localised versions of Zooomr in 18 different languages .
" Flickr is very anglocentric - there is a lot of inside English and blurb dialogue that is very colloquial .
" It was hard for people who did n't speak fluent English to know what has been going on . "
His family have supported his career and lifestyle path and Tate 's ambitions are in line with the morals and guidelines built around notions of community and selflessness they instilled in him .
He says : " We are two guys trying to help the community and provide a solution that communicates to the world . "
It certainly chimes with the mystical sense of San Francisco that Tate had when crossing the Golden Gate bridge some years before as a child .

The vast majority of the 860 + species in the genus Erica ( heaths / heather ) are endemic to southern Africa .
Plants from this genus do n't respond well to being dug up and relocated and very few specimens were seen in Europe before the late 1700s .
Discovery voyages eventually included botanists and specialist plant collectors and handlers .
They could successfully preserve , dry or nurture Erica species and their parts , enabling samples to survive the rigours of a three month sea voyage to Europe .
An indication of the proliferation over time of African species of heather in Europe can be seen in this graph of ~publications on Erica species .
The first large peak corresponds to the array of heath plants described in the book series from which the illustration plates below were selected .
By way of clarification : the Ericaceae family consists of two very similar genera : Erica ( aka winter heather ; and more likely called heath ) and Calluna ( aka summer heather , consisting of one species , , from which the many popular heather varietals - domestic shrubs - have been bred ) .
The species depicted below are from the Erica genus .
by HC Andrews is a 4 - volume series from the early 19th century , and is particularly noteworthy because the author is believed to have also taken on the roles of artist , engraver , publisherhand - colourist .
That level of multi-tasking is fairly rare in the world of scientific publishing , at least in my experience .
The full title of Henry Charles Andrews ' publication is : .
It appears Andrews was author - publisher of some six or eight botanical works in total ( including a few multi- volume series ) ; most on Erica / heath species , together with monographs on some rare plants and flowers .
His name (s ) make (s ) tracking down his publishing record difficult to say the least .

Forty years after The Beatles ' Sergeant Pepper LP was released , a housewife from Surbiton is claiming she inspired the track Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds .
Lucy Vodden , 43 , was at nursery school in Weybridge with John Lennon 's son Julian , who one day took home a drawing of a girl surrounded by
stars .
When John asked him to describe he said , " It 's Lucy in the sky with diamonds , " .
Scroll down for more ...
Julian later confirmed this : " I do n't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings , but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age .
" I used to show dad everything I 'd built or painted at school , and this one sparked off the idea for a song about Lucy in the sky with diamonds . "
Beatles biographers and account by band members confirm that she is the most likely source of the song .
Mrs Vodden said : " I can imagine him saying ,
' That 's Lucy at school , ' and his father asking questions like " What 's that in the sky ? ' "
There has been much specualtion about the song , many believe that it is an ode to LSD .
" When I told a couple of friends that Lucy in the sky with diamonds was about me , they said , ' No , it ca n't be , it 's to do with LSD . '
I was too embarrased to tell them that I did n't know what LSD was . "
Julian 's mother Cynthia has said that she has kept the picture .
A study that will appear in the Journal of Computer - Mediated Communication later this year analyzes failures to secure computerized personal records .
One of its authors , Phil Howard , was kind enough to provide Ars with a draft copy of the paper .
The analysis suggests that both the public understanding of these leaks and the legislative response to them are focusing on the wrong targets .
The study used press reports to identify incidents in part because there is no centralized reporting mechanism , and in part because many of the incidents have not resulted in prosecutions .
The authors did require independent verification of incidents , and used the lowest figure for the number of records compromised when reports did not agree .
Even by these conservative standards , the results were enormous : over 1.9 billion records exposed , or an average of 9 records for every American citizen .
That figure is almost certainly an extreme underestimation .
State laws requiring a reporting of personal information loss only came into effect within the past three years .
Almost certainly as a result , there were more reported incidents in 2005 and 2006 than all the previous years combined .
The researchers separated the incidents according to a number of criteria , including the cause ( hacker , lost hardware , etc. ) and the organization that did the losing .
Their analysis suggests that we 're both misidentifying the cause of the losses , and incorrectly targeting our legislative responses accordingly .
Hackers : the security folk devil
In a recent dissection of the connection between gaming and violence , the term " folk devil " was used to describe something that can be labeled dangerous in order to assign blame in a case where the causes are complex and unclear .
The new paper suggests that hackers have become the folk devils of computer security , stating that " even though the campaign against hackers has successfully cast them as the primary culprits to blame for insecurity in cyberspace , it is not clear that constructing this target for blame has improved the security of personal digital records . "
Part of this argument is based on the contention that many of the criminal groups that engage in illicit access to records are culturally distinct from the hacker community and that the hacker community proper is composed of a number of subcultures , some of which may access personal data without distributing it .
But , even if a more liberal definition of hacker is allowed , they still account for far less than half of the data losses .
The report states that " 60 percent of the incidents involve missing or stolen hardware , insider abuse or theft , administrative error , or accidentally exposing data online . "
Those figures come from analyzing the data while eliminating a single event , the compromise of 1.6 billion records at Axciom .
The Axciom data loss is informative , as it reveals how what could be categorized as a hack involves institutional negligence .
The records stolen from the company were taken by an employee that had access to Axciom servers in order to upload data .
That employee gained download access because Axciom set the same passwords for both types of access .
Legislation : punish the hackers and victims
These figures suggest that there is a substantial institutional component to data losses , a contention the paper supports by noting the fact that medical and military institutions , which have a history of privacy and security concerns , account for a total of 12 percent of the total incidents .
In contrast , educational institutions , which have a mission focused on sharing information , account for 30 percent of the total incidents .
Institutions , however , are not the target of much legislation related to privacy breaches .
The USA Patriot Act reinforced long - term trends of targeting hackers with severe punishments ; some unauthorized hacking offenses now carry more severe penalties than violent crimes .
In contrast , those maintaining the databases have only recently been subject to notification laws , and remain largely unpunished for poor security .
In fact , the notification laws largely shift the burden of action back to the victims of the crimes ; those whose identities have been compromised .
The legislative free ride for the operators of computerized records servers is the exact opposite of the legal approach used in other matters of Internet data availability .
In cases of pornography and online gambling , prosecution has focused on those running the servers from which the activity originates .
Arguments have been raised that the market will find a solution to security issues , but it 's not clear why minimum standards of safety are acceptable in some fields , but not when it comes to digital data .
Ultimately , as the report notes , " As a society , how we assign responsibility will ultimately shape the responses that we collectively devise to manage the use of these electronic personal records . "
Given that its data suggests that a significant portion of the blame should go to those who hold the data , the report argues forcefully for legislation that requires they meet minimum data safety standards .

Judge throws out Plame lawsuit Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email
This A federal judge threw out a civil lawsuit former CIA agent Valerie Plame filed against members of the Bush administration , but the dismissal does not close all Plame 's legal avenues .
The court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds without ruling on the constitutional issues brought by Plame .
The wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , Plame had accused Vice President Dick Cheney and others of conspiring to leak her identity in 2003 .
U.S. District Judge John D. Bates dismissed the case against defendants Cheney , Karl Rove and I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Plame 's name was disclosed by syndicated columnist Robert Novak in July of 2003 .
The lawsuit contend the exposure of her then - classified role with the CIA was meant as retaliation for a column Joseph Wilson wrote earlier that year exposing misinformation pushed by President Bush relating to Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Saying the administration officials ' actions " may have been highly unsavory , " Bates nonetheless ruled " there can be no serious dispute " that speaking to the press to rebut Wilson 's criticism was " within the scope of defendants ' duties as high - level Executive Branch officials . "
The court ruled it lacked jurisdiction over Plame 's case because she has not exhausted administrative remedies under the Federal Tort Claims
Act , which is the " proper , and exclusive , avenue for relief on such a claim . "
The act provides a waiver from the government 's immunity from being sued in certain situations when its employees act negligently within the context of their jobs .
The lawsuit that was dismissed Thursday was aimed at individuals within the Bush administration , rather than the government itself as FTCA actions are required to be .
Plame 's lawyers expected the decision to be thrown out anticipate filing an appeal , according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , whose executive director is representing Joseph and Valerie Wilson .
But the couple does not plan to pursue legal action under the FTCA , a CREW spokeswoman told RAW STORY .
" While we are obviously very disappointed by todays decision , we have always expected that this case would ultimately be decided by a higher court , " said Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director .
" We disagree with the court 's holding and intend to pursue this case vigorously to protect all Americans from vindictive government officials who abuse their power for their own political ends . "
Bates , who was appointed by President Bush , is the same judge who threw out a case regarding the release of Cheney 's Energy Taskforce records , Think Progress notes .

IN THE waning days of the second world war , Vannevar Bush , science adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt , penned a report that served as the blueprint for what would become America 's enormously successful information - technology industry in the second half of the 20th century .
With the grandiose title “ Science , The Endless Frontier ” , Bush ( no relation to the current president ) laid out a vision for government - funded science and engineering that would unite academia , industry and ( this being wartime ) the armed forces .
This it achieved by , in effect , keeping them apart .
Under Bush 's plan , universities researched basic science and then industry developed these findings to the point where they could get to market .
The idea of R&D as two distinct activities was born .
Firms soon organised themselves along similar lines , keeping white - coated scientists safely apart from scruffy engineers .
This approach was a stunning success .
AT&T's Bell Labs ( pictured above ) earned six Nobel prizes for inventions such as the laser and the transistor .
IBM picked up three , two from its Zurich Research Laboratory alone .
And Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Centre ( PARC ) devised the personal computer 's distinctive elements , including the mouse , the graphical user interface and the Ethernet protocol for computer networking ( although it was criticised for failing to commercialise such leaps forward ) .
Now the big corporate laboratories are either gone or a shadow of what they were .
Companies tinker with today 's products rather than pay researchers to think big thoughts .
More often than not , firms hungry for innovation look to mergers and acquisitions with their peers , partnerships with universities and takeovers of venture - capital - backed start - ups .
The traditional separation of research and development enshrined by Bush in 1945 is rapidly disappearing , especially in the information - technology industry .
Does this mean the days when companies came up with big breakthroughs are over , too ?
Not necessarily .
The approach to R&D is changing because long - term research was a luxury only a monopoly could afford .
In their heyday , the big firms dominated their markets .
AT&T ran the telephone network , IBM dominated the mainframe - computer business and Xerox was a synonym for photocopying .
The companies themselves saw the cost of basic scientific research as a small price to pay for such power .
Modern technology firms are much less vertically integrated .
They use networks of outsourced suppliers and assemblers , which has led to the splintering of research divisions .
Even though big American firms still spend billions of dollars on R&D , none has any intention of filling the shoes left empty by Bell Labs or Xerox PARC .
The research and development that Bush tore asunder are once again becoming entwined .
Old - fashioned R&D is losing its ampersand .
“ The lesson learnt is that you do n't isolate researchers , ” says Eric Schmidt , the boss of Google , who started his career as a computer scientist at Bell Labs and later at Xerox PARC .
The “ smart people on the hill ” method no longer works , he adds .
Instead , researchers have become intellectual mercenaries for product teams : they are there to solve immediate needs .
This view is shared by other industry veterans .
“ The corporate research labs of the old days are really not going to be the basis of what is new , ” says John Seely Brown , the director of Xerox PARC for over a decade until 2000 .
“ This is getting to be a new kind of game . ”
On the surface , American innovation has never been stronger .
American firms spend around $ 200 billion on R&D annually , much of it on computing and communications .
Microsoft , for example , spent around $ 6.6 billion last year ; IBM and Intel about $ 6 billion each ; and Cisco Systems and Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) around $ 4 billion each .
Most of this money went into making small incremental improvements and getting new ideas to market fast .
For example , IBM has eight laboratories on three continents , each with its own personality and expertise .
At its Zurich Research Laboratory around 300 scientists representing over 20 nationalities concentrate on areas such as microelectronics , nanotechnology and computer security .
Only a few years ago researchers were judged on the basis of patents and papers , but today they roll up their shirtsleeves and work alongside the company 's consultants , explains Douglas Dykeman , one of the laboratory 's managers .
This reflects IBM 's transition into “ services science ” .
The services business is becoming commoditised , as hardware did before it , and IBM knows it must add intellectual property to its offerings .
Putting its researchers on the case is one way to charge clients a premium .
“ Some days I used to sit there thinking ‘ does anybody really care ? ' ” recalls Mr Dykeman about some past projects .
Now the laboratory has to apply science to real and immediate concerns .
Often the distinction between “ R ” and “ D ” is blurred .
For instance , a recent research paper from the laboratory about the bonding of gold atoms smacks of pure science .
But as semiconductors move to the atomic scale , answering this sort of question will solve production problems ten years out .
The new science
In Redmond , Washington , Microsoft Research houses 400 researchers ; it boasts another 300 around the world .
Nearly all of their budget is spent on commercially orientated projects .
In a windowless office Steven Drucker , a researcher on media applications , is unable to get his laptop to work with the projector .
So he explains the future of home entertainment with a video on the computer screen .
He envisages a world where people will take telephone calls from their television sets , interact with content online and receive relevant advertisements .
But making this vision work technically is hard .
Academics , he says , cannot do this , since they continually struggle for funds .
This forces them into projects of just one or two years — even shorter than industry horizons .
“ It 's insane , ” says Mr Drucker .
He reckons it means corporate research can look farther ahead , do bigger things and risk more money for a big payout .
“ In the real world , it is not just a big ‘ D ' and a big ‘ R ' — it 's a continuum , ” explains Rick Rashid , who oversees Microsoft Research worldwide .
The company , he says , does perform basic research .
“ But we also work with our product teams to move those technologies into our products . ”
Microsoft has a team of a dozen people whose sole responsibility is to handle technology transfer .
Sometimes researchers move from the laboratories to work with product teams , as Mr Drucker recently did .
The distinction between development and research is intentionally blurred at HP , epitome of the research - driven organisation .
At its base in Palo Alto , the offices of its founders , “ Bill ” and “ Dave ” , are preserved in the laboratories where they pioneered products and principles like open - plan cubicles for employees and “ management by walking around ” .
Among the company 's senior scientists is Bernardo Huberman , a physicist and former PARC researcher , whose work bridges computer science , economics and sociology .
Instead of looking at fundamental questions about the universe , Mr Huberman 's prolific papers identify how “ prediction markets ” can be used to identify successful projects inside companies ; how to price a unit of grid - computing ( broadly the harnessing of the collective processing power of many computers ) and how to vie best for internet users ' attention .
The old model of research , of “ putting people in a bubble ” , is over , he says .
The most interesting research is now done “ where technology touches people ” .
Having researchers work more closely with customers pays off in other ways .
For example , HP's work for DreamWorks Animation SKG , a film studio , required a highly sophisticated video - conferencing system so executives could regularly talk face - to - face without having to leap on an aeroplane .
What the HP laboratories came up with was so successful that the company commercialised the system as a product , called Halo .
This is now used by other companies , including PepsiCo and AMD , a chipmaker .
Such schemes represent the primacy of “ D ” over “ R ” .
“ Is that a bad thing ? ” retorts Shane Robison , who oversees HP 's technology strategy , with every pore visible on his three - foot - long face over the Halo teleconferencing system .
Decisions about investment research are made by betting where the industry is heading , he says .
HP still does some basic research , adds Dick Lampman , who heads HP Laboratories , but when people “ celebrate the other model , they lose sight of what it takes to take a good idea and make it into an exciting product . ”
The fusion of research and development is meant to solve the central shortcoming of Bush 's plan : how to turn ideas into commercial innovations .
Great ideas may moulder without a way to develop them .
In America the link between industry and government - funded research was reinforced in the 1980 Bayh - Dole Act .
This expected recipients of federal funding to patent their innovations as an incentive for them to leave the laboratory .
So , for example , when Google listed its shares in 2004 , Stanford University received around $ 200 m worth since research by Google 's co-founders on search algorithms had been partly financed by the National Science Foundation .
Moreover , the rise of venture capital has smoothed the progress of new ideas into products .
But inside large companies the transfer has been so difficult that it provided a huge incentive to join the two churches of “ R ” and “ D ” together .
“ The idea devalues itself over time if you do n't get it to market quickly , ” says Paul Horn , who oversees IBM 's research .
“ Everything we do is aimed at avoiding a ‘ handoff ' — there is no ‘ technology transfer ' .
It is a bad phrase at IBM . ”
Research teams stay with their ideas all the way through to manufacturing .
The epitome of this practical emphasis may be Intel .
The chipmaker relies on universities for much of its basic science and takes a highly disciplined approach when selecting and overseeing the projects it backs .
Staff scientists are intimately familiar with manufacturing .
Many of its patents cover making chips , not basic science .
Research is better “ the closer the development is to the brutal market reality , ” says Sean Maloney , an Intel executive .
“ Our people have that tattooed on their tonsils . ”
One reason for the shift towards more commercially minded research in technology companies is that the nature of IT has changed so much .
In Bush 's time the science that went into computing was itself closer to basic research .
By contrast , many of the big scientific questions in computing have been answered — at least well enough for companies to find that innovation emerges from new ways of arranging today 's technologies rather than inventing new ones .
Dell 's innovation was a business model that used extreme supply - chain efficiency to create bespoke computers .
Likewise , Apple 's iPod is a new interface atop standard industry parts .
Bush 's approach also presumed that research was costly , if only because computing machines back then were expensive and huge .
Moreover , he presumed that cycle times for development were long .
Researchers as developers
Today , innovation comes more from software than hardware , computing costs are extremely low and development times are very fast — almost immediate , in fact , when the internet is used to deliver them .
That explains why the boundary between research and development is blurring most for web - based companies , where competition is fierce and the time to market can be instantaneous .
The Google method means researchers are part of development , says Mr Schmidt .
The company employs very small teams to work on a small number of ideas , some of which may turn into big hits .
Failure is an essential part of the process .
“ The way you say this is : ‘ Please fail very quickly — so that you can try again ' , ” says Mr Schmidt .
Its headquarters , the “ Googleplex ” , is an environment for employees to wander around intellectually .
Google has many projects competing for users ' attention .
By being a free service , and using the internet to reach customers immediately at low cost , online firms like Google can experiment in ways that were once impossible .
Meanwhile at Yahoo ! , researchers are also close to the practical needs of the business .
At the opening of the company 's new European research centre in Barcelona in October , the laboratory took up offices just across the hall from the business and marketing divisions .
Yahoo !'s corporate research unit , like others , has hit upon a strategy to tap into fresh ideas and young talent at universities .
The laboratory is also located in the same building as the Barcelona Media Innovation Centre , which is affiliated with the nearby Universitat Pompeu Fabra .
According to Mr Brown , the former PARC director and now a senior fellow at the Annenberg Centre for Communication at the University of Southern California , internet companies benefit from a “ combinatorial ideation platform ” .
By this , he means that ideas can be tried out fast , directly on consumers , who can also combine them with ideas of their own to do new , unanticipated things — and all with immediate market feedback .
The post - war R&D model needs updating not simply because of the new way of innovating , but also because companies now have a greater choice of where to shop for ideas .
“ If you go back to that period of AT&T , there was n't the same kind of engineering going on at universities , and Bell Labs could not rely on an external cadre of engineers for their research — they really had to do it internally , ” says Charles Giancarlo of Cisco .
He admits his company has long been accused of “ R&D by M& A ” — but he does not see why that should be a problem .
Cisco spends $ 4.3 billion a year on employing over 16,000 engineers around the world , in addition to tapping into the venture - capital industry 's start - ups .
Basic research inside companies is impossible in a competitive industry , according to Mr Giancarlo .
“ We might decry this on a public - policy basis , but at least as far as public markets are concerned it is a Darwinian world .
You live or die by that . ”
Industry 's abandonment of the split between R&D comes as computer scientists complain about a decline in basic research or its distortion by commercial influence .
The National Science Foundation and DARPA ( the Pentagon 's research arm ) , two of the grant - giving institutions inspired directly by Bush 's vision , have been chided for turning away from basic research in favour of later - stage work , with an emphasis on homeland security — just as industry has done .
At the same time , America 's venerated national laboratories are coming under partial industry control .
Some in industry regret the melding of R&D into one activity and the demise of the big corporate laboratory .
At IBM , some researchers are not impressed by “ services science ” .
And although Google 's engineers can devote 20 % of their work - time to their own projects provided it helps the company , the footsoldiers roll their eyes and admit that such time is usually found on Sunday afternoons .
The new model of R&D turns researchers into the shock - troops of innovation .
Bell Labs , now a part of France 's Alcatel - Lucent , is turning its attention almost entirely towards development .
It reached a low point in 2003 when it had only some 1,000 researchers and a $ 115 m budget .
Half a century ago it claimed 25,000 researchers and its own physics laboratory .
In 2002 Xerox PARC became an independent subsidiary able to provide research services and intellectual property to outside clients , not just its parent .
Some private institutions have sought to enter the field of “ basic science with a business plan ” , so to speak .
But their success remains to be seen .
In the 1990s Paul Allen , one of Microsoft 's founders , set up Interval Research to great fanfare , but closed it within a decade after spending $ 100 m with little to show .
More recently , Nathan Myhrvold , Microsoft 's former chief technology officer , created Intellectual Ventures , to come up with futuristic technologies and license them widely .
It has filed over 800 patent applications , but has yet to publicise any big innovation .
Perhaps all this would have made Bush weep .
“ Industry is generally inhibited by preconceived goals , by its own clearly defined standards , and by the constant pressure of commercial necessity , ” he wrote in 1945 .
“ Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends . ”
But the message from mammon is different .
“ When I started out running PARC , I thought 99 % of the work was creating the innovation , and then throwing it over the transom for dumb marketers to figure out how to market it , ” says Mr Brown .
“ And now I realise that there is at least as much creativity in finding ways to take the idea to market as coming up with the idea in the first place .
I would have spent my time differently had I figured this out early on . ”

Scientists have sounded the death knell for the plug and power lead .
In a breakthrough that sounds like something out of Star Trek , they have discovered a way of ' beaming ' power across a room into a light bulb , mobile phone or laptop computer without wires or cables .
In the first successful trial of its kind , the team was able to illuminate a 60 - watt light bulb 7ft away .

{ Q} The team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who call their invention ' WiTricity ' , believe it could change the way we use electricity and do away with the tangle of cables , plugs and chargers that clutter modern homes .
It could also allow the use of laptops and mobile phones without batteries .
The inspiration came when the lead researcher , Dr Marin Soljacic , was standing in his kitchen at night staring at his mobile phone .
" It was probably the sixth time that month that I was awakened by my cell phone beeping to let me know that I had forgotten to charge it .
It occurred to me that it would be so great if the thing took care of its own charging , " he said .
To turn this dream into reality , Dr Soljacic needed a way of transmitting power wirelessly .
Scientists have known for nearly two centuries that it is possible to transfer an electrical current from one coil of wire to another without them touching .
The phenomenon , called electromagnetic induction , is used in power transformers and electric motors around the world .
However , the coils in motors and transformers have to be close for power to pass from one to another .
Attempting to transfer power over distances is impossible .
The breakthrough came when Dr Soljacic realised there was another way of transferring energy through the air .
Rather than sending power from a transmitter to a receiver as a conventional electromagnetic wave - the same form of radiation as light , radio waves and microwaves - he could use the transmitter to fill a room with a ' non-radiative ' electromagnetic field .
Most objects in the room - such as people , desks and carpets - would be unaffected by the electromagnetic field .
But any objects designed to resonate with the electromagnetic field would absorb the energy .
It sounds complicated , but the result demonstrated by the American team this month was a dramatic success .
Using two coils of copper , the team transmitted power 7ft through the air to a light bulb , which lit up instantly .
The scientists say the technique works only over distances of up to 9ft .
However , they believe it could be used to charge up a battery within a few yards of the power source connected to a receiving coil .
Placing one source in each room could provide enough power for an entire house .
The receiver and transmitter would not have to be in view of each other .
Professor Peter Fisher , another of the researchers , said : " As long as the laptop is in a room equipped with a source of wireless power , it would charge automatically without having to be plugged in .
In fact , it would not even need a battery to operate inside such a room . "
The researchers believe there is little to worry about on safety grounds , saying that magnetic fields interact weakly with living organisms and are unlikely to have any serious side effects .
Dr Soljacic said : " When my son was about three years old , we visited his grandparents ' house .
They had a 20 - year - old phone and my son picked up the handset asking , ' Dad , why is this phone attached with a cord to the wall ? '
That is the mindset of a child growing up in a wireless world .
" Hopefully we will be getting rid of some more wires and batteries soon . "
The Wifi Camera is a camera that takes " pictures " of spaces illuminated by wifi in much the same way that a traditional camera takes pictures of spaces illuminated by visible light .
The camera reveals the electromagnetic space of our devices and the shadows that we create within such spaces , in particular our wifi networks which are increasingly found in our daily lives , in coffee shops , offices and homes throughout cities of the developed world .
With the camera we can take real time " photos " of wifi ( and we 're working towards having video too ) .
These show how our physical structures are illuminated by this particular electromagnetic phenomenon and we are even able to see the shadows that our bodies cast within such " hertzian " spaces .
Matt has made changes to the site since he was contacted
Matt Parker , from Cheltenham , set up a website to help Londoners rent out their homes during the games .
He said he has been asked to close the site because he is using the London 2012 Olympic title brand and is not affiliated to the games with a sponsor .
The London 2012 Organising Committee declined to comment .
Mr Parker said he was " disappointed " .
" It 's me and my website and I hope they reconsider and take a more lenient stance , " he said .
But he also said he did not want to breach copyright , and has since changed parts of the site .
In France , Islamic clerics issued a Fatwa ( religious ruling ) condemning the street violence of young Moslems over the last two weeks .
Fortunately , or unfortunately , most of the thugs on the streets are not very religious .
The violence is more ethnic and economic , than religious , with a major criminal element ( the gangs , like the IRA , know they will thrive if the police can be driven from their neighborhoods ) .
There 's a generation gap , as well , between the wild child element in the street , and the mainline Islamic leadership , who remember the hard life in the old country .
While overall unemployment in France is ten percent , it is much higher in immigrant communities .
That 's because French law makes it very difficult to fire anyone , which means employers are very reluctant to hire anyone .
This makes jobs precious , and rare , commodities .
The migrant families do n't have the connections and clout to compete with native French families when it comes to getting jobs for their young .
Thus , a disproportionate number of young men from Middle Eastern and African countries are unemployed .
Those without jobs are not happy .
A job provides status , and the means to make a good marriage .
Actually , a lot of these Moslem men have succeeded , many going to college or getting tech school educations .
Most have jobs .
But these are not the guys out in the street every night burning and stealing .
Many of those guys on the streets have taken to a life of crime .
Many of the criminal gangsare run by Moslems .
This means being a Moslem has become synonymous with belonging to organized crime .
Drug gangs are very common , with young Moslems being out front selling and distributing the illegal substances .
There 's another serious problem , and that is the French approach to property crimes .
The cops are inclined to concentrate on crimes against people ( assault , murder , rape ) , and look the other way when it comes to property crimes .
The courts , or at least many judges , are lenient when it comes to Moslems and property crimes .
It 's sort of group guilt among the French upper crust .
They brought the Moslems in half a century ago , to do the dirty work .
But now many of those manual jobs have been automated , and the Moslems do n't want to go back to the Middle East or Africa .
Why should they ?
France provides generous social benefits to the permanently unemployed .
Compared to the old country , France ( even with the local drug gangs ) , is a much safer place to live .
Thus , the street violence is partly a lark , because the kids know the cops are not going to use lethal force , and anyone who gets caught will , at worst , do maybe a year in the slammer ( for burning cars looting stores ) .
The drug gangs encourage the violence as a way to intimidate the cops .
When the violence dies down , the gang bosses can threaten the local cops with a revival , if the cops do not back off ( when it comes to the drug trade ) .
There are some Islamic radicals running around in all this , but they are a minority .
The Moslem kids like to talk about respect and payback , but very few see this as a religious war .
It 's become a sport , with various groups competing to cause the most destruction .
Text messaging , Internet bulletin boards and email made it possible for the rioters to stay in touch and compare notes .
The media coverage also encouraged the violence , giving the kids some positive ( for them ) feedback .
But now , nearly two weeks of street violence have thoroughly embarrassed the government so much that curfews and more arrests have taken some of the joy out of these Autumn Antics .
But it 's not jihad , and never has been .
I was struck , the other day , by how much I had to think when attempting to heat up my sandwich in the microwave .
There are so many controls : a clock , a set of food - specific buttons , defrost and timer controls , and of course a full numeric keypad .
Quick !
What do you press ?
I wonder if older microwaves were n't a better , simpler design , with their single giant analog knob .
I noticed that every microwave for sale at Target , even the most inexpensive ones , now use a complete set of digital controls .
This is progress ?
Maybe something to think about , the next time you 're about to add just one more field , button , or link to that form .
It 's time the media asked the American Family Association , the Family Research Council , and the Concerned Women for America why they are promoting a known " hate group " on their Web sites .
Who says they are promoting a known hate group ?
Why , none of than the same expert on American hate groups just interviewed on ABC's World New Tonight : the Southern Poverty Law Center .
ABC reports that the number of hate groups has risen 40 % since the year 2000 .
One of those hate groups , as documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center , is Paul Cameron 's " Family Research Institute . "
Cameron 's specialty is concocting phony " science " that dehumanizes gays .
Cameron has discussed the extermination of all gay people .
The Southern Poverty Law Center lists Cameron 's Family Research Institute alongside the neo -Nazis and the Klan - that 's how bad he is .
So with hate groups on the rise in America , why are 3 of the top 4 religious right organizations in America - the American Family Association , the Family Research Council , and the Concerned Women for America - promoting Cameron and his research on their Web sites as I write this ?
They are promoting a known hate groups that has been likened to the Klan and neo -Nazis .
The Southern Poverty Law Center says that " Cameron 's ' science ' echoes Nazi Germany . "
America 's lead religious right organizations are using their Web sites to promote " science " that " echoes Nazi Germany . "
Think about that .
And these are n't fringe groups .
These are THE groups - the people who meet with George Bush , who pull the Republicans ' strings in Congress .
They are n't the fringe of the religious right - they ARE the religious right .
How in God 's name are these organizations quoted by American media , welcomed into the offices of Republicans in Congress , and invited to meet with George Bush 's White House staff when they cavort with hate ?
And why do the American Family Association , the Family Research Council , and the Concerned Women for America continue to promote on their very public Web sites the Nazi science of a known " hate group " ?
Is their hatred for gay Americans so great that they would promote the work of a group akin to the Klan ?
You can read much more about this , including links to all the original sources I cite above , here .
Rest assured we will continue to document how long the religious right leaders continue to promote this known hate group .
It 's a fact that every member of Congress should discuss during their floor speeches about the hate crimes bill tomorrow in the House .
These are the faces of the people who oppose the hate crimes bill .
These are the faces of hate enablers .
It makes me sick as a Christian that these extremists claim to speak for me .
Only a few days after I linked ( again ) to the J - Walk Blog , John Walkenbach writes today that he ’s shutting it down :
It ’s been a fun and interesting ride .
I ’ve been doing this for about 11 months .
I was hoping to keep it going for a full year , but it did n’t work out .
Yesterday , I was mowing the lawn and decided to call it quits .
No real reason .
I think it ’s just time to move on to something else ( but I have no idea what that something else is ) …
Well , hopefully he ’ll decide to come back sometime in the future .
Have fun , John …
Update : he ’s back .
Whew .

RUGAO , China ( Reuters ) - Zhou Fenying is a living witness to the dark history that still poisons China ’s relations with Japan more than 60 years after World War Two .
Park Ok - ryun , 89 , who said she was forced to become a comfort woman by the Japanese military during World War Two , sits in her room at a comfort women 's shelter " The House of Sharing " in Gwangju , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) southeast of Seoul , June 23 , 2007 .
The U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs will vote June 26 on a resolution demanding that Japan accept historical responsibility and apologize for the comfort women issue , a committee official said .
Picture taken June 23 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Han Jae-ho
When Zhou was 22 , Japanese soldiers came to her village in eastern China , grabbed her and her sister - in - law and carted them off to a military brothel , she says .
Now 91 , Zhou has broken decades of silence to speak of her traumatic experience as a “ comfort woman ” -- the euphemism the invading Japanese used to describe women forced into sex slavery .
“ I hid with my husband ’s sister under a millstone .
Later , the Japanese soldiers discovered us and pulled us out by our legs .
They tied us both to their vehicle .
Later they used more ropes to tie and secure us and drove us away , ” she told Reuters in her home village in Jiangsu province .
“ They then took us to the ‘ comfort woman lodge ’ .
There was nothing good there , ” she said , speaking through a local government official who struggled to translate her thick dialect into Mandarin .
“ For four to five hours a day , it was torture .
They gave us food afterwards , but every day we cried and we just did not want to eat it , ” Zhou added , sitting in her sparsely decorated home .
The Chinese government says Japan has yet to atone properly for its war crimes , which it says included massacres and forcing people to work as virtual slaves in factories or as prostitutes .
In 2005 , a push by Japan for a permanent U.N. Security Council seat sparked sometimes violent anti-Japanese street protests in cities across China , with demonstrators denouncing Tokyo and demanding compensation and an apology for the war .
“ OF COURSE I HATE THEM ”

Zhou -- neatly dressed in a dark blue traditional Chinese shirt , her graying hair combed back into a bun -- avoided saying what had happened to her in the brothel , except that she was there with at least 20 other Chinese women .
But her son , Jiang Weixun , 62 , said she had told him they were repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers on a daily basis .
This harrowing experience has left a deep scar on Zhou ’s life .
She cannot forget , and nor can she forgive .
“ If it were you , would n’t you hate them ?
Of course I hate them .
But after the war , all the Japanese went home .
I ’m already so old .
I think they are all dead by now , ” Zhou said .
Zhou said she had served as a “ comfort woman ” for two months before a local town official rescued her by paying off the Japanese .
She went back to her husband of 10 years , Ni Jincheng , who later died fighting the Japanese .
Zhou remarried and lives with her son , Jiang , from her second marriage .
Jiang said his mother had been moved to tell her story after learning of the death of Lei Guiying , a well - known former Chinese comfort woman .
Lei died of a brain hemorrhage in April .
She had gone public with her experiences last year after hiding the ordeal from her family for 60 years .
Jiang said he was not ashamed of his mother , one of only an estimated 50 former Chinese sex slaves still alive today .
He said her experiences should highlight to the world the extent of the wartime crimes committed by the Japanese .
“ When my mother told me about this , as her son , I do not hate her for that .
The Japanese are the ones I should be hating .
The Japanese are those who committed the crimes .
The Japanese are responsible for this , they raped all of the women , ” he said .
Tokyo has not paid direct compensation to any of the estimated 200,000 mostly Asian women forced to work in brothels for the Japanese military before and during World War Two , saying all claims were settled by peace treaties that ended the war .
Instead , in 1995 , Tokyo set up the Asian Women ’s Fund , a private group with heavy government support , to make cash payments to surviving wartime sex slaves .

( This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit at Stanford . )
The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers — partly because investors are so unlike hackers , and partly because they tend to operate in secret .
I 've been dealing with this world for many years , both as a founder and an investor , and I still do n't fully understand it .
In this essay I 'm going to list some of the more surprising things I 've learned about investors .
Some I only learned in the past year .
Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second most important thing we do at Y Combinator .
The most important thing for a startup is to make something good .
But everyone knows that 's important .
The dangerous thing about investors is that hackers do n't know how little they know about this strange world .
1 . The investors are what make a startup hub .
About a year ago I tried to figure out what you 'd need to reproduce Silicon Valley .
I decided the critical ingredients were rich people and nerds — investors and founders .
People are all you need to make technology , and all the other people will move .
If I had to narrow that down , I 'd say investors are the limiting factor .
Not because they contribute more to the startup , but simply because they 're least willing to move .
They 're rich .
They 're not going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart hackers there they could invest in .
Whereas hackers will move to the Bay Area to find investors .
2 . Angel investors are the most critical .
There are several types of investors .
The two main categories are angels and VCs : VCs invest other people 's money , and angels invest their own .
Though they 're less well known , the angel investors are probably the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley .
Most companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels had n't invested first .
VCs say between half and three quarters of companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside investment already . [ 1 ]
Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs .
They also give valuable advice , because ( unlike VCs ) many have been startup founders themselves .
Google 's story shows the key role angels play .
A lot of people know Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia .
What most do n't realize is how late .
That VC round was a series B round ; the premoney valuation was $ 75 million .
Google was already a successful company at that point .
Really , Google was funded with angel money .
It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded by angels , but this is not so surprising .
Risk is always proportionate to reward .
So the most successful startup of all is likely to have seemed an extremely risky bet at first , and that is exactly the kind VCs wo n't touch .
Where do angel investors come from ?
From other startups .
So startup hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace effect , but shifted in time : startups are there because startups were there .
3 . Angels do n't like publicity .
If angels are so important , why do we hear more about VCs ?
Because VCs like publicity .
They need to market themselves to the investors who are their " customers " — the endowments and pension funds and rich families whose money they invest — and also to founders who might come to them for funding .
Angels do n't need to market themselves to investors because they invest their own money .
Nor do they want to market themselves to founders : they do n't want random people pestering them with business plans .
Actually , neither do VCs .
Both angels and VCs get deals almost exclusively through personal introductions . [ 2 ]
The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business plans over the transom , but so they win deals when competing against other VCs .
Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition , because ( a ) they do fewer deals , ( b ) they 're happy to split them , and ( c ) they invest at a point where the stream is broader .
4 . Most investors , especially VCs , are not like founders .
Some angels are , or were , hackers .
But most VCs are a different type of people : they 're dealmakers .
If you 're a hacker , here 's a thought experiment you can run to understand why there are basically no hacker VCs :
How would you like a job where you never got to make anything , but instead spent all your time listening to other people pitch ( mostly terrible ) projects , deciding whether to fund them , and sitting on their boards if you did ?
That would not be fun for most hackers .
Hackers like to make things .
This would be like being an administrator .
Because most VCs are a different species of people from founders , it 's hard to know what they 're thinking .
If you 're a hacker , the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high school .
Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your way to the lab .
But do n't underestimate them .
They 're as expert in their world as you are in yours .
What they 're good at is reading people , and making deals work to their advantage .
Think twice before you try to beat them at that .
5 . Most investors are momentum investors .
Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people , they generally do n't understand what you 're doing .
I knew as a founder that most VCs did n't get technology .
I also knew some made a lot of money .
And yet it never occurred to me till recently to put those two ideas together and ask " How can VCs make money by investing in stuff they do n't understand ? "
The answer is that they 're like momentum investors .
You can ( or could once ) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock prices .
When a stock jumps upward , you buy , and when it suddenly drops , you sell .
In effect you 're insider trading , without knowing what you know .
You just know someone knows something , and that 's making the stock move .
This is how most venture investors operate .
They do n't try to look at something and predict whether it will take off .
They win by noticing that something is taking off a little sooner than everyone else .
That generates almost as good returns as actually being able to pick winners .
They may have to pay a little more than they would if they got in at the very beginning , but only a little .
Investors always say what they really care about is the team .
Actually what they care most about is your traffic , then what other investors think , then the team .
If you do n't yet have any traffic , they fall back on number 2 , what other investors think .
And this , as you can imagine , produces wild oscillations in the " stock price " of a startup .
One week everyone wants you , and they 're begging not to be cut out of the deal .
But all it takes is for one big investor to cool on you , and the next week no one will return your phone calls .
We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to hot in a matter of days , and literally nothing has changed .
There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon .
If you 're feeling really confident , you can try to ride it .
You can start by asking a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money , and then after generating interest there , ask more prestigious VCs for larger amounts , stirring up a crescendo of buzz , and then " sell " at the top .
This is extremely risky , and takes months even if you succeed .
I would n't try it myself .
My advice is to err on the side of safety : when someone offers you a decent deal , just take it and get on with building the company .
Startups win or lose based on the quality of their product , not the quality of their funding deals .
6 . Most investors are looking for big hits .
Venture investors like companies that could go public .
That 's where the big returns are .
They know the odds of any individual startup going public are small , but they want to invest in those that at least have a chance of going public .
Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies , most of which fail , and one of which is Google .
Those few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments .
What this means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you 're a potential Google .
They do n't care about companies that are a safe bet to be acquired for $ 20 million .
There needs to be a chance , however small , of the company becoming really big .
Angels are different in this respect .
They 're happy to invest in a company where the most likely outcome is a $ 20 million acquisition if they can do it at a low enough valuation .
But of course they like companies that could go public too .
So having an ambitious long - term plan pleases everyone .
If you take VC money , you have to mean it , because the structure of VC deals prevents early acquisitions .
If you take VC money , they wo n't let you sell early .
7. VCs want to invest large amounts .
The fact that they 're running investment funds makes VCs want to invest large amounts .
A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions of dollars .
If $ 400 million has to be invested by 10 partners , they have to invest $ 40 million each .
VCs usually sit on the boards of companies they fund .
If the average deal size was $ 1 million , each partner would have to sit on 40 boards , which would not be fun .
So they prefer bigger deals , where they can put a lot of money to work at once .
VCs do n't regard you as a bargain if you do n't need a lot of money .
That may even make you less attractive , because it means their investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors .
Angels are in a different position because they 're investing their own money .
They 're happy to invest small amounts — sometimes as little as $ 20,000 — as long as the potential returns look good enough .
So if you 're doing something inexpensive , go to angels .
8. Valuations are fiction .
VCs admit that valuations are an artifact .
They decide how much money you need and how much of the company they want , and those two constraints yield a valuation .
Valuations increase as the size of the investment does .
A company that an angel is willing to put $ 50,000 into at a valuation of a million can't take $ 6 million from VCs at that valuation .
That would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between them ( since the option pool would also come out of that seventh ) .
Most VCs would n't want that , which is why you never hear of deals where a VC invests $ 6 million at a premoney valuation of $ 1 million .
If valuations change depending on the amount invested , that shows how far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company .
Since valuations are made up , founders should n't care too much about them .
That 's not the part to focus on .
In fact , a high valuation can be a bad thing .
If you take funding at a premoney valuation of $ 10 million , you wo n't be selling the company for 20 .
You 'll have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5 x return , which is low to them .
More likely they 'll want you to hold out for 100 .
But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting bought at all ; many companies can buy you for $ 10 million , but only a handful for 100 .
And since a startup is like a pass / fail course for the founders , what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome , not the percentage of the company you keep .
So why do founders chase high valuations ?
They 're tricked by misplaced ambition .
They feel they 've achieved more if they get a higher valuation .
They usually know other founders , and if they get a higher valuation they can say " mine is bigger than yours . "
But funding is not the real test .
The real test is the final outcome for the founder , and getting too high a valuation may just make a good outcome less likely .
The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution .
But there is another less sexy way to achieve that : just take less money .
9 . Investors look for founders like the current stars .
Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates .
This was a mistake , because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup .
They started almost as a contract programming operation , and the reason they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in their lap .
Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey .
This is a good trend , because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal startup founders .
Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to be an expert in business .
So they were willing to fund teams of MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their product for them .
This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope that the programmer he 'll hire is Bill Gates — kind of backward , as the events of the Bubble showed .
Now most VCs know they should be funding technical guys .
This is more pronounced among the very top funds ; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs .
If you 're a hacker , it 's good news that investors are looking for Larry and Sergey .
The bad news is , the only investors who can do it right are the ones who knew them when they were a couple of CS grad students , not the confident media stars they are today .
What investors still do n't get is how clueless and tentative great founders can seem at the very beginning .
10 .
The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated .
Investors do more for startups than give them money .
They 're helpful in doing deals and arranging introductions , and some of the smarter ones , particularly angels , can give good advice about the product .
In fact , I 'd say what separates the great investors from the mediocre ones is the quality of their advice .
Most investors give advice , but the top ones give good advice .
Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated .
It 's to everyone 's advantage to let the world think the founders thought of everything .
The goal of the investors is for the company to become valuable , and the company seems more valuable if it seems like all the good ideas came from within .
This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with founders .
In a company founded by two people , 10 % of the ideas might come from the first guy they hire .
Arguably they 've done a bad job of hiring otherwise .
And yet this guy will be almost entirely overlooked by the press .
I say this as a founder : the contribution of founders is always overestimated .
The danger here is that new founders , looking at existing founders , will think that they 're supermen that one could n't possibly equal oneself .
Actually they have a hundred different types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible . [ 3 ]
11 . VCs are afraid of looking bad .
I 've been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are .
They seem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners , and perhaps also to the limited partners — the people whose money they invest .
You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to take .
You can tell they wo n't make investments for their fund that they might be willing to make themselves as angels .
Though it 's not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks .
They 're less willing to do things that might look bad .
That 's not the same thing .
For example , most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup founded by a pair of 18 year old hackers , no matter how brilliant , because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and say " What , you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18 year olds ? "
Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by three former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource their product development — which to my mind is actually a lot riskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds — he could n't be faulted , if it failed , for making such an apparently prudent investment .
As a friend of mine said , " Most VCs ca n't do anything that would sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds . "
Angels can take greater risks because they do n't have to answer to anyone .
12 . Being turned down by investors does n't mean much .
Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by investors .
They should n't take it so much to heart .
To start with , investors are often wrong .
It 's hard to think of a successful startup that was n't turned down by investors at some point .
Lots of VCs rejected Google .
So obviously the reaction of investors is not a very meaningful test .
Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial reasons .
I read of one VC who turned down a startup simply because they 'd given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required too many signatures to close . [ 4 ]
The reason investors can get away with this is that they see so many deals .
It does n't matter if they underestimate you because of some surface imperfection , because the next best deal will be almost as good .
Imagine picking out apples at a grocery store .
You grab one with a little bruise .
Maybe it 's just a surface bruise , but why even bother checking when there are so many other unbruised apples to choose from ?
Investors would be the first to admit they 're often wrong .
So when you get rejected by investors , do n't think " we suck , " but instead ask " do we suck ? "
Rejection is a question , not an answer .
13 . Investors are emotional .
I 've been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be .
You 'd expect them to be cold and calculating , or at least businesslike , but often they 're not .
I 'm not sure if it 's their position of power that makes them this way , or the large sums of money involved , but investment negotiations can easily turn personal .
If you offend investors , they 'll leave in a huff .
A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup we 'd seed funded .
Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested .
They were so afraid that they'd be rejected in favor of this other firm that they gave the startup what 's known as an " exploding termsheet . "
They had , I think , 24 hours to say yes or no , or the deal was off .
Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device , but not uncommon .
What surprised me was their reaction when I called to talk about it .
I asked if they 'd still be interested in the startup if the rival VC did n't end up making an offer , and they said no .
What rational basis could they have had for saying that ?
If they thought the startup was worth investing in , what difference should it make what some other VC thought ?
Surely it was their duty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best opportunities they found ; they should be delighted if the other VC said no , because it would mean they 'd overlooked a good opportunity .
But of course there was no rational basis for their decision .
They just could n't stand the idea of taking this rival firm 's rejects .
In this case the exploding termsheet was not ( or not only ) a tactic to pressure the startup .
It was more like the high school trick of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you .
In an earlier essay I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls .
A few VCs have joked about that characterization , but none have disputed it .
14 . The negotiation never stops till the closing .
Most deals , for investment or acquisition , happen in two phases .
There 's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions .
If this succeeds you get a termsheet , so called because it outlines the key terms of a deal .
A termsheet is not legally binding , but it is a definite step .
It 's supposed to mean that a deal is going to happen , once the lawyers work out all the details .
In theory these details are minor ones ; by definition all the important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet .
Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel that when they have a termsheet , they have a deal .
They want there to be a deal ; everyone acts like they have a deal ; so there must be a deal .
But there is n't and may not be for several months .
A lot can change for a startup in several months .
It 's not uncommon for investors and acquirers to get buyer 's remorse .
So you have to keep pushing , keep selling , all the way to the close .
Otherwise all the " minor " details left unspecified in the termsheet will be interpreted to your disadvantage .
The other side may even break the deal ; if they do that , they 'll usually seize on some technicality or claim you misled them , rather than admitting they changed their minds .
It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all the way to the closing , because the most effective pressure is competition from other investors or acquirers , and these tend to drop away when you get a termsheet .
You should try to stay as close friends as you can with these rivals , but the most important thing is just to keep up the momentum in your startup .
The investors or acquirers chose you because you seemed hot .
Keep doing whatever made you seem hot .
Keep releasing new features ; keep getting new users ; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs .
15 . Investors like to co-invest .
I 've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals .
You might think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to themselves , but they seem positively eager to syndicate .
This is understandable with angels ; they invest on a smaller scale and do n't like to have too much money tied up in any one deal .
But VCs also share deals a lot .
Why ?
Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier : after traffic , VCs care most what other VCs think .
A deal that has multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close , so of deals that close , more will have multiple investors .
There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal :
Any investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could fund a competitor .
Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia did n't like splitting the Google deal , but it did at least have the advantage , from each one 's point of view , that there probably would n't be a competitor funded by the other .
Splitting deals thus has similar advantages to confusing paternity .
But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear of looking bad .
If another firm shares the deal , then in the event of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice — a consensus decision , rather than just the whim of an individual partner .
16 . Investors collude .
Investing is not covered by antitrust law .
At least , it better not be , because investors regularly do things that would be illegal otherwise .
I know personally of cases where one investor has talked another out of making a competitive offer , using the promise of sharing future deals .
In principle investors are all competing for the same deals , but the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition .
The reason , again , is that there are so many deals .
Though a professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder he invests in than with other investors , his relationship with the founder is only going to last a couple years , whereas his relationship with other firms will last his whole career .
There is n't so much at stake in his interactions with other investors , but there will be a lot of them .
Professional investors are constantly trading little favors .
Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power of investors as a whole .
So you will not , as of this writing , be able to get investors into an auction for your series A round .
They 'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs competitively bidding against one another .
An efficient startup funding market may be coming in the distant future ; things tend to move in that direction ; but it 's certainly not here now .
17 . Large - scale investors care about their portfolio , not any individual company .
The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also has equity .
The only way any of them can succeed is if they all do .
This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction , subject to differences of opinion about tactics .
The problem is , larger scale investors do n't have exactly the same motivation .
Close , but not identical .
They do n't need any given startup to succeed , like founders do , just their portfolio as a whole to .
So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to do is to sacrifice unpromising startups .
Large - scale investors tend to put startups in three categories : successes , failures , and the " living dead " — companies that are plugging along but do n't seem likely in the immediate future to get bought or go public .
To the founders , " living dead " sounds harsh .
These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards .
But they might as well be from a venture investor 's point of view , and they suck up just as much time and attention as the successes .
So if such a company has two possible strategies , a conservative one that 's slightly more likely to work in the end , or a risky one that within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the company , VCs will push for the kill - or - cure option .
To them the company is already a write - off .
Better to have resolution , one way or the other , as soon as possible .
If a startup gets into real trouble , instead of trying to save it VCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio companies .
Philip Greenspun said in Founders at Work that Ars Digita 's VCs did this to them .
18 . Investors have different risk profiles from founders .
Most people would rather a 100 % chance of $ 1 million than a 20 % chance of $ 10 million .
Investors are rich enough to be rational and prefer the latter .
So they 'll always tend to encourage founders to keep rolling the dice .
If a company is doing well , investors will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers .
And indeed , most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better .
But it 's still hair - raising for the founders , because they might end up with nothing .
When someone 's offering to buy you for a price at which your stock is worth $ 5 million , saying no is equivalent to having $ 5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette wheel .
Investors will tell you the company is worth more .
And they may be right .
But that does n't mean it 's wrong to sell .
Any financial advisor who put all his client 's assets in the stock of a single , private company would probably lose his license for it .
More and more , investors are letting founders cash out partially .
That should correct the problem .
Most founders have such low standards that they 'll feel rich with a sum that does n't seem huge to investors .
But this custom is spreading too slowly , because VCs are afraid of seeming irresponsible .
No one wants to be the first VC to give someone fuck - you money and then actually get told " fuck you . "
But until this does start to happen , we know VCs are being too conservative .
19 . Investors vary greatly .
Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same .
And in fact they do all look the same .
They 're all what hackers call " suits . "
But since I 've been dealing with VCs more I 've learned that some suits are smarter than others .
They 're also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and losers to keep losing .
When a VC firm has been successful in the past , everyone wants funding from them , so they get the pick of all the new deals .
The self - reinforcing nature of the venture funding market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different world from , say , the hundredth .
As well as being smarter , they tend to be calmer and more upstanding ; they do n't need to do iffy things to get an edge , and do n't want to because they have more brand to protect .
There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from , if you have the luxury of choosing : the " top tier " VCs , meaning about the top 20 or so firms , plus a few new ones that are not among the top 20 only because they have n't been around long enough .
It 's particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you 're a hacker , because they 're more confident .
That means they 're less likely to stick you with a business guy as CEO , like VCs used to do in the 90s .
If you seem smart and want to do it , they 'll let you run the company .
20 .
Investors do n't realize how much it costs to raise money from them .
Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups can least afford it .
It 's not unusual for it to take five or six months to close a funding round .
Six weeks is fast .
And raising money is not just something you can leave running as a background process .
When you 're raising money , it 's inevitably the main focus of the company .
Which means building the product is n't .
Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demo day , and is successful in raising money from them , closing the deal after a comparatively short 8 weeks .
Since demo day occurs after 10 weeks , the company is now 18 weeks old .
Raising money , rather than working on the product , has been the company 's main focus for 44 % of its existence .
And mind you , this an example where things turned out well .
When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding round finally closes , it 's as if they were returning to work after a months - long illness .
They 've lost most of their momentum .
Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they invest in by taking so long to do it .
But companies do .
So there is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests smaller amounts at lower valuations , but promises to either close or say no very quickly .
If there were such a firm , I 'd recommend it to startups in preference to any other , no matter how prestigious .
Startups live on speed and momentum .
21 . Investors do n't like to say no .
The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that investors can't make up their minds .
VCs are not big companies ; they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to .
But they usually let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks .
The reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier .
Most do n't try to predict whether a startup will win , but to notice quickly that it already is winning .
They care what the market thinks of you and what other VCs think of you , and they can't judge those just from meeting you .
Because they 're investing in things that ( a ) change fast and ( b ) they do n't understand , a lot of investors will reject you in a way that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection .
Unless you know this world , you may not even realize you 've been rejected .
Here 's a VC saying no :
We 're really excited about your project , and we want to keep in close touch as you develop it further .
Translated into more straightforward language , this means :
We 're not investing in you , but we may change our minds if it looks like you 're taking off .
Sometimes they 're more candid and say explicitly that they need to " see some traction . "
They 'll invest in you if you start to get lots of users .
But so would any VC .
So all they 're saying is that you 're still at square 1 .
Here 's a test for deciding whether a VC 's response was yes or no .
Look down at your hands .
Are you holding a termsheet ?
22 . You need investors .
Some founders say " Who needs investors ? "
Empirically the answer seems to be : everyone who wants to succeed .
Practically every successful startup takes outside investment at some point .
Why ?
What the people who think they do n't need investors forget is that they will have competitors .
The question is not whether you need outside investment , but whether it could help you at all .
If the answer is yes , and you do n't take investment , then competitors who do will have an advantage over you .
And in the startup world a little advantage can expand into a lot .
Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he thought they had a few weeks ' lead over their competitors .
That may not have mattered quite so much as he thought , because Google came along three years later and kicked Yahoo 's ass .
But there is something in what he said .
Sometimes a small lead can grow into the yes half of a binary choice .
Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup , it will start to be possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding .
There are certainly costs to raising money .
But as of this writing the empirical evidence says it 's a net win .
23 . Investors like it when you do n't need them .
A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their permission to start a company — as if it were like getting into college .
But you do n't need investors to start most companies ; they just make it easier .
And in fact , investors greatly prefer it if you do n't need them .
What excites them , both consciously and unconsciously , is the sort of startup that approaches them saying " the train 's leaving the station ; are you in or out ? " not the one saying " please can we have some money to start a company ? "
Most investors are " bottoms " in the sense that the startups they like most are those that are rough with them .
When Google stuck Kleiner and Sequoia with a $ 75 million premoney valuation , their reaction was probably " Ouch !
That feels so good . "
And they were right , were n't they ?
That deal probably made them more than any other they 've done .
The thing is , VCs are pretty good at reading people .
So do n't try to act tough with them unless you really are the next Google , or they 'll see through you in a second .
Instead of acting tough , what most startups should do is simply always have a backup plan .
Always have some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor says no .
Having one is the best insurance against needing one .
So you should n't start a startup that 's expensive to start , because then you 'll be at the mercy of investors .
If you ultimately want to do something that will cost a lot , start by doing a cheaper subset of it , and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more money .
Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear war are cockroaches , because they 're so hard to kill .
That 's what you want to be as a startup , initially .
Instead of a beautiful but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube to support itself , better to be small , ugly , and indestructible .
Notes
[ 1 ] I may be underestimating VCs .
They may play some behind the scenes role in IPOs , which you ultimately need if you want to create a silicon valley .
[ 2 ] A few VCs have an email address you can send your business plan to , but the number of startups that get funded this way is basically zero .
You should always get a personal introduction — and to a partner , not an associate .
[ 3 ] Several people have told us that the most valuable thing about startup school was that they got to see famous startup founders and realized they were just ordinary guys .
Though we 're happy to provide this service , this is not generally the way we pitch startup school to potential speakers .
[ 4 ] Actually this sounds to me like a VC who got buyer 's remorse , then used a technicality to get out of the deal .
But it 's telling that it even seemed a plausible excuse .

Most Important Question for Tomorrow's AG Hearing Marty Lederman
The folks over at Talking Points have a pretty good one .
But it wo n't reveal any useful answers ( because the AG truly was out of the loop ) .
For purposes of actually getting to the bottom of the scandal ( rather than simply confirming how removed from the process the AG was ) , here 's a better one :
Mr. Attorney General , in your written statement to this Committee , you insist that " [ w ] e must ensure that all the facts surrounding the situation are brought to full light . "
Truer words were never spoken .
Because it is now beyond doubt that officials in the White House had significant involvement in the creation and development of the list that was presented to you -- and because the ultimate decision to remove the U.S. Attorneys was made by the President -- we would need full disclosure of communications within the White House , and between White House and DOJ officials , in order to bring all the relevant facts to " full light . "
The President ordinarily does not assert Executive privilege without a recommendation to that effect from the Attorney General .
Will you assure us today that you will recommend to the President that he not assert any alleged privilege in order to withhold from Congress communications that occurred within the White House ( and in RNC databases ) that would shed light on those facts ?

President George W. Bush has pardoned 14 criminals , including several drug dealers and a man convicted for bombing a coal mine , but he refused to pardon two U.S. Border Patrol agents sentenced to prison for intercepting an illegal immigrant drug smuggler at the Texas - Mexico border last year .
Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were guarding the Mexican border near El Paso in February 2005 when they intercepted a van loaded with 743 pounds of marijuana .
The admitted drug smuggler , an illegal alien named Osvaldo Aldrete - Davila , tried to flee and one of the agents shot him in the buttocks though he still got away .
Federal prosecutors actually went to Mexico and offered the drug dealer immunity to testify against the Border Patrol agents who were subsequently convicted on charges of causing serious bodily injury , assault with a deadly weapon , discharge of a firearm and violating the drug smuggler 's civil rights .
The agents were sentenced to 11 and 12 - year prison terms .
The Department of Justice claims that the defendants were prosecuted because they fired their weapons at a man who had attempted to surrender by holding his open hands in the air , causing the man to run in fear of what the agents would do to him next .
One U.S. Attorney involved in the case said that it is a violation of Border Patrol regulations to go after someone who is fleeing , even if it is a drug kingpin or a terrorist .
Lawmakers from both parties were outraged and one Congressman called the convictions a travesty of justice beyond description .
The White House has received at least 50 requests for presidential pardons from members of Congress and hundreds of thousands of additional requests from outraged citizens who feel the agents have been wrongly punished for doing their job .
One group alone , calling it an outrageous injustice , got more than 130,000 signatures requesting a presidential pardon .
The president has ignored the pleas , instead freeing a bunch of drug dealers and a violent criminal while two Border Patrol agents go to prison for protecting their country from drug smugglers .
Story Highlights • Prosecutors appeal ruling to throw out Genarlow Wilson 's sentence
• Appeal means Wilson will stay behind bars
• Judge earlier voided Wilson 's 10 - year prison term Monday
• Wilson in prison for consensual oral sex at age 17 with 15 - year - old girl
Adjust font size :
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Jubilation turned to anger Monday after Georgia 's top prosecutor vowed he would fight a judge 's order that would have set free Genarlow Wilson , a Georgia man serving a 10 - year prison sentence for a consensual sexual encounter he had as a teenager .
Wilson 's attorney , B.J. Bernstein , said her client would not accept a proposed plea bargain that would get him out of prison because it would require Wilson to plead guilty to a felony .
A judge ruled Monday that his conduct should have been punished as a misdemeanor .
" We 're going to keep fighting , " Bernstein told reporters at a news conference at the state Capitol .
She was flanked by civil rights leaders and black lawmakers , who expressed anger at the decision by Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker to block Wilson 's release by filing an appeal of the judge 's ruling .
Joseph Lowery , former president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , called Baker 's decision " unnecessary , unjust and unfounded . "
" We do n't understand the reasoning or rationale of the attorney general on this issue , " Lowery said .
( Watch Lowery call the top prosecutor 's action absurd and unjust )
Wilson is black , as is Baker .
Law changed but Wilson not included
Wilson , 21 , was convicted of aggravated child molestation for having consensual oral sex with a 15 - year - old girl when he was 17 , during a 2003 New Year 's Eve party in Douglas County , just west of Atlanta , Georgia .
Wilson was also charged with raping a 17 - year - old girl at the party -- who prosecutors maintained was too intoxicated to consent -- but jurors acquitted him on that charge .
Under the state law in effect at the time , Wilson received a mandatory 10 - year sentence and has already served more than two years .
Partly as a result of Wilson 's conviction , state legislators changed the law to make such consensual conduct between teenagers a misdemeanor , rather than a felony .
But that change was n't made retroactive , so it did not affect Wilson .
Monday , acting on a petition filed by his attorneys , Monroe County Superior Court Judge Thomas Wilson ruled that Genarlow Wilson 's punishment was cruel and unusual and voided it on constitutional grounds .
The judge reduced the sentence to one year and said Wilson should not be put on Georgia 's sex offender registry , as the old law required .
Wilson 's attorneys hoped to use the ruling to free him from state prison .
But shortly after it was handed down , Baker announced he would appeal the decision , a move that keeps Wilson behind bars .
In a statement announcing his decision , Baker said he filed the appeal to resolve " clearly erroneous legal issues , " charging that the judge did not have the authority " to reduce or modify the judgment of the trial court . "
' The ultimate abuse of power '
Baker also said prosecutors in Douglas County had offered a plea deal that would reduce Wilson 's sentence , possibly to time already served , and place him in a program for first - time offenders .
Once his sentence was complete , his conviction would be removed from his record , and he would be taken off the sex - offender registry , the attorney general said .
But Bernstein said Wilson would not accept the proposed deal because it would still require him to plead guilty to a felony with a 15 - year sentence , which would hang over him until the sentence had been served .
" That 's the ultimate abuse of power as a prosecutor , " said Bernstein .
" I want this child out .
Enough already . "
Bernstein said Wilson 's attorneys are now trying to get him released on bond while Baker 's appeal makes its way through the courts ; but , so far , they have not been successful .
Wilson 's plight has drawn national attention and pleas for his release , including from former President Jimmy Carter , a former Georgia governor , and even some of the jurors who convicted him .
But late last year , the Georgia Supreme Court , on a 4 - 3 vote , turned down Wilson 's appeal , and both Douglas County District Attorney David McDade and Baker have opposed moves by his attorneys to have him released .
Legislation that would make the change in Georgia 's child molestation law retroactive in order to free Wilson failed to win approval earlier this year .
Several months ago , I discovered that I was being “ considered for deletion . ”
Or rather , the entry on me in the Internet behemoth that is Wikipedia was .
For those of you who are ( as uncharitable Wikipedians sometimes say ) “ clueless newbies , ” Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia .
But it is like no encyclopedia Diderot could have imagined .
Instead of relying on experts to write articles according to their expertise , Wikipedia lets anyone write about anything .
You , I , and any wired - up fool can add entries , change entries , even propose that entries be deleted .
For reasons I ’d rather not share outside of therapy , I created a one - line biographical entry on “ Marshall Poe . ”
It did n’t take long for my tiny article to come to the attention of Wikipedia ’s self - appointed guardians .
Within a week , a very active — and by most accounts responsible — Scottish Wikipedian named “ Alai ” decided that … well , that I was n’t worth knowing about .
Why ?
“ No real evidence of notability , ” Alai cruelly but accurately wrote , “ beyond the proverbial average college professor . ”
Wikipedia has the potential to be the greatest effort in collaborative knowledge gathering the world has ever known , and it may well be the greatest effort in voluntary collaboration of any kind .
The English - language version alone has more than a million entries .
It is consistently ranked among the most visited Web sites in the world .
A quarter century ago it was inconceivable that a legion of unpaid , unorganized amateurs scattered about the globe could create anything of value , let alone what may one day be the most comprehensive repository of knowledge in human history .
Back then we knew that people do not work for free ; or if they do work for free , they do a poor job ; and if they work for free in large numbers , the result is a muddle .
Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger knew all this when they began an online encyclopedia in 1999 .
Now , just seven years later , everyone knows different .
The Moderator
Jimmy
Wales does not fit the profile of an Internet revolutionary .
He was born in 1966 and raised in modest circumstances in Huntsville , Alabama .
Wales majored in finance at Auburn , and after completing his degree enrolled in a graduate program at the University of Alabama .
It was there that he developed a passion for the Internet .
His entry point was typical for the nerdy set of his generation : fantasy games .
In 1974 , Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson , two gamers who had obviously read The Lord of the Rings , invented the tabletop role - playing game Dungeons & Dragons .
The game spread largely through networks of teenage boys , and by 1979 , the year the classic Dungeon Master ’s Guide was published , it seemed that every youth who could n’t get a date was rolling the storied twenty - sided die in a shag - carpeted den .
Meanwhile , a more electronically inclined crowd at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign was experimenting with moving fantasy play from the basement to a computer network .
The fruit of their labors was the unfortunately named MUD ( Multi - User Dungeon ) .
Allowing masses of players to create virtual fantasy worlds , MUDs garnered a large audience in the 1980s and 1990s under names like Zork , Myst , and Scepter of Goth .
( MUDs came to be known as “ Multi- Undergraduate Destroyers ” for their tendency to divert college students from their studies . )
( This article originally appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Oct. 21 , 1993 )
The past few years have seen the downfall of one once - dominant business after another : General Motors , Sears and IBM , to name just a few .
But in every case the main cause has been at least one of the five deadly business sins- avoidable mistakes that will harm the mightiest business .
The first and easily the most common sin is the worship of high profit margins and of " premium pricing . "
The prime example of what this leads to is the near - collapse of Xerox in the 1970s .
Having invented the copier -- and few products in industrial history have had greater success faster -- Xerox soon began to add feature after feature to the machine , each priced to yield the maximum profit margin and each driving up the machine 's price .
Xerox profits soared and so did the stock price .
But the vast majority of consumers who need only a simple machine became increasingly ready to buy from a competitor .
And when Japan 's Canon brought out such a machine it immediately took over the U.S. market -- Xerox barely survived .
GM 's troubles -- and those of the entire U.S. automobile industry -- are , in large measure , also the result of the fixation on profit margin .
By 1970 , the Volkswagen Beetle had taken almost 10 % of the American market , showing there was U.S. demand for a small and fuel - efficient car .
A few years later , after the first " oil crisis , " that market had become very large and was growing fast .
Yet the U.S. auto makers were quite content for many years to leave it to the Japanese , as small - car profit margins appeared to be so much lower than those for big cars .
This soon turned out to be a delusion -- it usually is .
GM , Chrysler and Ford increasingly had to subsidize their big -car buyers with discounts , rebates , cash bonuses .
In the end , the Big Three probably gave away more in subsidies than it would have cost them to develop a competitive ( and profitable ) small car .
A couple of days ago , tempting fate , I mentioned that our chargeback rate was 0 % .
Some people speculated that I was rounding , and really meant , say , 0.45 % .
Nope , I really meant zero .
None .
As soon as I wrote this , some wise guy decided to dispute a charge .
Now , a long time ago , I wrote some custom software to screen - scrape our credit card processor ’s online information system , and reconciles the transactions it finds there with QuickBooks , where we do the rest of our bookkeeping .
So today , for the first time in the history of that app running , it finds a chargeback on the statement , and does n’t know what to do with it .
So it stops and says , “ Unrecognized entry : I do n’t know what account VISA CHARGEBACK should be posted to . ”
We had to modify the software .
And that ’s how I know we ’ve never had a chargeback … until today !
" Nothing there , " is what Case Western Reserve University physicists concluded about black holes after spending a year working on complex formulas to calculate the formation of new black holes .
In nearly 13 printed pages with a host of calculations , the research may solve the information loss paradox that has perplexed physicists for the past 40 years .
Case physicists Tanmay Vachaspati , Dejan Stojkovic and Lawrence M. Krauss report in the article , " Observation of Incipient Black Holes and the Information Loss Problem , ” that has been accepted for publication by Physical Review D .
" It 's complicated and very complex , " noted the researchers , regarding both the general problem and their particular approach to try to solve it .
The question that the physicists set out to solve is : what happens once something collapses into a black hole "
If all information about the collapsing matter is lost , it defies the laws of quantum physics .
Yet , in current thinking , once the matter goes over the event horizon and forms a black hole , all information about it is lost .
" If you define the black hole as some place where you can lose objects , then there is no such thing because the black hole evaporates before anything is seen to fall in , " said Vachaspati .
The masses on the edge of the incipient black hole continue to appear into infinity that they are collapsing but never fall over inside what is known as the event horizon , the region from which there is no return , according to the researchers .
By starting out with something that was nonsingular and then collapsing that matter , they were determined to see if an event horizon formed , signaling the creation of a black hole .
The mass shrinks in size , but it never gets to collapse inside an event horizon due to evidence of pre-Hawking radiation , a non-thermal radiation that allows information of the nature of what is collapsing to be recovered far from the collapsing mass .
" Non -thermal radiation can carry information in it unlike thermal radiation .
This means that an outside observer watching some object collapse receives non-thermal radiation back and may be able to reconstruct all the information in the initial object and so the information never gets lost , " they said .
According to the researchers , if black holes exist , information formed in the initial state would disappear in the black hole through a burst of thermal radiation that carries no information about the initial state .
Using the functional Schrodinger formalism , the researchers suggest that information about the energy from radiation is long evaporated before an event horizon forms .
" An outside observer will never lose an object down a black hole , " said Stojkovic .
" If you are sitting outside and throwing something into the black hole , it will never pass over but will stay outside the event horizon even if one considers the effects of quantum mechanics .
In fact , since in quantum mechanics the observer plays an important role in measurement , the question of formation of an event horizon is much more subtle to consider . "
The physicists are quick to assure astronomers and astrophysicists that what is observed in gravity pulling masses together still holds true , but what is controversial about the new finding is that " from an external viewer 's point it takes an infinite amount of time to form an event horizon and that the clock for the objects falling into the black hole appears to slow down to zero , " said Krauss , director of Case 's Center for Education and Research in Cosmology .
He continued " this is one of the factors that led us to rethink this problem , and we hope our proposal at the very least will stimulate a broader reconsideration of these issues . "
If black holes exist in the universe , the astrophysicists speculate they were formed only at the beginning of time .

Now both Universal and Warner Music Group are said to be kicking the tires of Sanctuary , an independent British music and artist management company whose roster includes Iron Maiden and Elton John .
The owners of all four of the major record companies also recently have chewed over deals to diversify into merchandise sales , concert tickets , advertising and other fields that are not part of their traditional business .
Even as the industry tries to branch out , though , there is no promise of an answer to a potentially more profound predicament : a creative drought and a corresponding lack of artists who ignite consumers ’ interest in buying music .
Sales of rap , which had provided the industry with a lifeboat in recent years , fell far more than the overall market last year with a drop of almost 21 percent , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
( And the marquee star 50 Cent just delayed his forthcoming album , “ Curtis . ” )
In other genres the picture is not much brighter .
Fans do still turn out ( at least initially ) for artists that have managed to build loyal followings .
The biggest debut of the year came just last week from the rock band Linkin Park , whose third studio album , “ Minutes to Midnight , ” sold an estimated 623,000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan data .
But very few albums have gained traction .
And that is compounded by the industry ’s core structural problem :
Its main product is widely available free .
More than half of all music acquired by fans last year came from unpaid sources including Internet file sharing and CD burning , according to the market research company NPD Group .
The “ social ” ripping and burning of CDs among friends — which takes place offline and almost entirely out of reach of industry policing efforts — accounted for 37 percent of all music consumption , more than file - sharing , NPD said .
The industry had long pinned its hopes on making up some of the business lost to piracy with licensed digital sales .
But those prospects have dimmed as the rapid CD decline has overshadowed the rise in sales at services like Apple ’s iTunes .
Even as music executives fret that iTunes has not generated enough sales , though , they gripe that it unfairly dominates the sale of digital music .
Partly out of frustration with Apple , some of the music companies have been slowly retreating from their longtime insistence on selling music online with digital locks that prevent unlimited copying .
Their aim is to sell more music that can be played on Apple ’s wildly popular iPod device , which is not compatible with the protection software used by most other digital music services .
EMI led the reversal , striking a deal with Apple to offer its music catalog in the unrestricted AAC format .

George is not what you would call a stud .
When I visited him in 1985 , he was thought to be a relatively young adult , maybe 50 years old , but he was already a confirmed bachelor .
He had n’t shown any interest in two females of a similar species placed in his pen .
One had flipped over and drowned in the wading pool .
The keepers were n’t positive that George had driven this tortoise to her death , but he definitely had n’t been doing any Barry White serenades .
A few years later , in 1993 , there was briefly a companion known as “ Lonesome George ’s girlfriend , ” but she was not a tortoise .
She was a 26 - year - old graduate student in zoology from Switzerland named Sveva Grigioni .
By coating her hands in the genital secretions of female tortoises and gently stroking him , she managed to demonstrate a couple of times ( in the course of several months ’ work ) that George was capable of an erection .
But whereas her touch could induce other male tortoises to reach orgasm within a few minutes , with George she never managed to collect any sperm .
Her ministrations — or maybe it was the pheromones in the secretions — did seem to pique George ’s interest in the female tortoises , as Ms. Grigioni reported to Henry Nicholls , the author of the definitive new biography , “ Lonesome George : The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon . ”
But George ’s temporary interest did not translate into performance .

“ He started to try copulation , ” Ms. Grigioni said , “ but it was like he did n’t really know how to . ”
To be fair to George , he ’s never been observed with a female of his race , Geochelone nigra abingdoni .
( It has been traditionally classified a subspecies of giant tortoise , but many biologists now consider it a separate species . )
After the news last week , I sought a prognosis from Ms. Grigioni on the prospects for abingdoni love .
“ No one knows how George would react , ” she replied tactfully .
“ The only way to know is to try .
It is possible that he would recognize abingdoni pheromones , but there is no evidence that different species have different pheromones . ”
That did n’t sound too promising , but Ms. Grigioni tried to be optimistic .
If a Pinta female arrives in George ’s pen , she said , “ nature will do the best she can . ”
FORT MOTT STATE PARK , N.J. —
When mutant , muscle - bound puppies started showing up in litters of champion racing whippets , the breeders of the normally sleek dogs invited scientists to take DNA samples at race meets here and across the country .
They hoped to find a genetic cause for the condition and a way to purge it from the breed .
It worked .
“ Bully whippets , ” as the heavyset dogs are known , turn out to have a genetic mutation that enhances muscle development .
And breeders may not want to eliminate the “ bully ” gene after all .
The scientists found that the same mutation that pumps up some whippets makes others among the fastest dogs on the track .
With a DNA screening test on the way , “ We ’re going to keep the speed and lose the bullies , ” Helena James , a whippet breeder in Vancouver , British Columbia , said .
Free of most of the ethical concerns — and practical difficulties — associated with the practice of eugenics in humans , dog breeders are seizing on new genetic research to exert dominion over the canine gene pool .
Companies with names like Vetgen and Healthgene have begun offering dozens of DNA tests to tailor the way dogs look , improve their health and , perhaps soon , enhance their athletic performance .
SAN JOSE , Calif . —
Less than three years after going public , Google is confronting one of the more confounding consequences of its phenomenal success : a potential brain drain if its earliest — and richest — employees quit after earning the right to cash in the last of the stock options that made them millionaires .
Hundreds of the 2,300 Googlers hired before the Internet juggernaut ’s initial public offering in August 2004 are hitting their fourth anniversary .
When they do , they ’ll be free to cash in the final portions of their pre-IPO options , collectively worth an estimated $ 2.6 billion before taxes .
So far , the exodus has been limited to a “ handful of people , ” said Stacy Savides Sullivan , Google ’s chief culture officer and a 43 - year - old pre-IPO millionaire herself .
“ We anticipated more because we think it would only be natural .
We worry every day about this and hope we can stay ahead of it . ”
Senior executives have viewed this problem as a significant risk and have been taking aggressive and innovative steps to retain early employees , including mixing in other forms of stock compensation and rolling out a first - of - its - kind , in - house market this month that will enable workers to sell even “ underwater ” options _ those with a grant price higher than the current stock price .
Google also is working on softer issues , from conducting an annual “ happiness ” survey to outright coddling of critical talent .
Still , Google executives know some people will leave anyway : some because their jobs no longer seem challenging , others to start a restaurant , found a non -profit or build a dream house .
Despite the mind - boggling dollar figures , Google ’s story is no anomaly .
Every Silicon
Valley start - up that dishes up stock options to lure workers faces a similar predicament if an initial public offering is successful .
“ This is what any of these companies struggle with , ” said Steve Patchel , a tech - industry pay consultant in Watson Wyatt ’s Santa Clara , Calif . , office .
“ There are all these moving parts .
Nobody can ever get it perfect . ”
Google ’s story is also a case study of how companies must learn to manage overnight millionaires who think more like “ volunteers ” because they ’re no longer motivated primarily by pay and can quit at any moment .
Google ’s pre-IPO crew , for instance , is sitting on $ 2 billion worth of options that have vested already and can be cashed in at a moment ’s notice .
And that does n’t count the riches they took off the table last year alone by exercising more than 6 million options with strike prices ranging from a penny to the $ 85 IPO price .
Their good fortune could stir jealousies as less - fortunate later hires park their Hondas next to a cube - mate ’s Ferrari , then head into the office to shoulder an equal share of the workload .
And when the stock price tails off after years of explosive growth , somehow companies like Google must reformulate their mix of pay , stock and perks to retain those already - wealthy workers and attract new recruits because options wo n’t continue to have a big payoff .
For now , though , hundreds of Google ’s pre-IPO crew are still bound with “ golden handcuffs . ”
Under Google ’s vesting rules , employees typically earn the right to cash in 25 percent of their options when they hit their first anniversary , then the rest in monthly chunks over the next three years .
For example , if Google gave an employee 10,000 options in 2003 _ a figure some experts say is on the low side _ the typical pre-IPO Googler ’s shares are worth an estimated $ 4.7 million , before taxes , based on last week ’s closing stock price of $ 471.51 and recent grant - price data from Google .
In that case , sticking it out until the fourth anniversary would be worth about $ 98,000 a month , $ 3,200 a day or $ 400 an hour .
That ’s on top of regular salary and any other options , restricted stock or bonuses .
That kind of money would make anyone rethink their lives .
With that in mind , Google also has drawn up lists of its most valuable pre-IPO “ old - timers ” and is pressing managers to keep tabs on their mood swings and professional goals .
These workers are encouraged to speak up if they want to tackle a new job , work part time or take a leave before they start feeling burned out , for example .
“ We always have to be understanding where their heads are at , ” Sullivan said .
Google already has lost some key early employees .
Among them are Doug Edwards , the marketing guy who named the “ Adwords ” advertising product that is Google ’s golden goose , and Charlie Ayers , the chef who concocted the secret sauce of yummy food and old - fashioned fun that became a hallmark of Google ’s corporate culture .
“ There ’s the notion that it ’s not as much fun and that you do n’t have to stay there if you do n’t want to , ” said Edwards , who resigned in 2005 , shortly after his boss left .
“ You start looking for excuses , and they are not hard to find . ”
Ayers said he always planned to leave Google after his options vested .
“ I joined Google for one reason , ” he said .
“ I would n’t work that hard for anyone else ever again .
I would only work that hard for myself . ”
Ayers is writing a cookbook , working as a consultant to various companies and preparing to open a restaurant in Palo Alto , the Calafia Cafe , which will feature a menu of locally grown organic foods , similar to meals he whipped up at Google .
So far , most of the pre-IPO Googlers are hanging in there even after the initial grant that made them rich has vested .
Susan Wojcicki , who joined Google shortly after the founders moved out of their first home in her Menlo Park garage , says she loves building new products .
It is no coincidence , of course , that her title is vice president , product management .
Wojcicki says she stays because Google is a stimulating environment and because she has been able to comfortably balance her family with her job .
“ It ’s always been exciting , but this time is as exciting if not more exciting than it was in the past , ” she said .
“ I have personal goals about what I want to achieve at the company , things I want to build . ”
Sullivan can relate .
Hired when Google had only about 50 employees , her first stock options finished vesting in 2003 , though she said she did n’t mark the milestone because her husband handles their finances .
People ask her all the time why she bothers to keep working .
“ I know this sounds corny , but I still have fun here , ” Sullivan said , then adds a remark that cuts to the heart of Google ’s challenge .
“ That ’s the only reason I stay .
If it were n’t enjoyable , I would leave . ”

Being socialable is a very easy thing to do , and it should n’t be something you ’re either good at or not .
You can learn to become a more social person – if you want to .
Generally extroverts will have less trouble getting out and talking to new people , but that ’s to be expected .
Do n’t think , however , that outgoing people do n’t make mistakes either .
There are ways to make life easier while you ’re out and about .
To Do :
Initiate conversation – A lot of people , while out , wait for other people to talk to them .
Becoming the person that initiates conversation and breaks the ice is , as they say , half the battle .
When you feel more comfortable doing this , you ’ll find yourself meeting more and more interesting people and gaining fruitful friendships .
It can be somewhat daunting at first because of fear of rejection or being shut down .
This will almost never happen .
At worst you ’ll receive a closed yet polite response .
Just remember , people are out to be social .
You have small groups of people who are sticking to themselves , but that does n’t mean they do n’t want to meet new people .
Smile –
If you look like you ’re unhappy you ’ll be less approachable .
This is an easy step to appearing open and social .
When you initiate conversation , your smile should be mirrored and rapport will build from there .
Enjoy your company –
When you look like you ’re having fun you are instantly more likable .
People want to know fun people , someone who enjoys company .
While out with friends , have a good time .
It may seem obvious , but many groups of people head out and do nothing but scan the room .
Advertising
If you ’re enjoying yourself , people will notice and want in on the action .
Acknowledge randoms –
This can be as simple as a smile and a nod .
When you make eye contact with a stranger , acknowledge it .
If your smile is reciprocated , this will be an easy introduction .
Later , initiate the conversation .
One of my favorite things to do while out is make friends with random people .
How else do you make new friends ?
You ’ll find the most fun and personally suitable people come from these random encounters .
Dress the part – I do n’t find this the most important step , but it does make life a lot easier when you look like you belong somewhere .
Now , I do n’t mean losing any individuality .
I mean do n’t go out of your way to look unapproachable .
If you just came from work , for instance , loosen up .
Unless it ’s an after - work crowd you ’ll find yourself out of place and more likely not to be approached .
Personally , I do n’t adhere to this rule very much , but it will make yourself that much approachable .
Then again , individuality goes a long way .
Be yourself .

Listen – People enjoy talking about themselves .
The worst , however , is when someone only waits for you to stop talking so they can begin again .
Take a genuine interest in people .
People are very interesting , so actively engage in a conversation .
There is a lot to talk about in this world , small talk is n’t all that necessary – particularly because it can be painfully boring .
Converse , do n’t rant –
The best way to get good responses out of people is to ask good questions .
Avoid ‘ what do you do ’ and ‘ nice weather ’ etc .
Talk about something that interests you .
People love explaining things they know , so when you do n’t know what someone is talking about , ask them .
Do n’t pretend like you know , they will be more than happy to teach you .
Keep eye contact – Do n’t scan the room while talking to someone .
It is a clear indication you ’re not interested in the conversation .
If you really have no interest in what someone is saying , change the topic .
Or excuse yourself .
There ’s a million reasons to end the encounter ; not every conversation has to be meaningful .
Being able to look someone in the eyes is directly related to some recognizing honesty
Keep open body language – Whether alone or not , avoid closing yourself off by crossing your arms etc .
Remain open , remain active [ see Closed Body Language ] .
People will generally not approach wallflowers .
And in any case , what fun is there to be had just standing around ?
Do stuff – It ’s hard to talk about your day when you have n’t done anything .
Do n’t think that you do n’t need to do any work in a conversation .
Try to engage the other person and be interesting .
Call on another time you were at this particular venue .
Did you read something interesting today ?
Mention it and ask opinions .
Everyone ’s got them .
The Don’ts :
Sit on your phone – If in conversation , or in good company , I generally ignore my phone .
Unless it is to arrange meetings etc , I ’ll let it go and return the call when appropriate .
There is something very rude about being in the middle of a discussion and being shut off by a phone call .
You ’re left in the lurch , sipping your drink with no one around .
If I can see that the call will be longer than 30 seconds , I ’ll usually get up and go for a wander .
It ’s not to be rude .
I ’ll excuse myself and join someone else , maybe make a call myself .
Advertising
Ignore randoms –
As previously stated , meeting random people is excellent fun .
You do n’t need to launch into a discussion right away , or even really care about the person at all .
But being polite and open to interaction will go a long way .
First of all , you might make a new friend .
You might score a few free drinks or have a hilarious interaction .
Secondly , if you are open to anyone approaching you , low and behold , you will look more approachable and find more people initiating conversation with you .
You ’re making life easier !
Dwell on smalltalk – I ’m quite adverse to smalltalk .
You really do n’t need to ask the standard ‘ interview ’ questions .
“ What do you do ? ” etc .
A lot of people have fairly uninteresting jobs and know that .
People are out to forget their work lives , so why bring it up ?
Granted , it ’s an easy way to get a general picture of someone , but do you need it ?
Would n’t it be better to ask more pertinent questions like , “ How is your night going ? ” or “ Have you seen this DJ before ? ”
Ask what someone is drinking or where they bought their shoes .
Smalltalk indicates almost no general interest until you come up with something out of the ordinary – like “ I write blogs for a living ” .
Likewise , if you ’re a student , do n’t talk about school [ If you must see How To Make Small Talk ] .
Get blind –
If you ’re out to be social , becoming a drunken zombie will do you no good .
I ’m not going to say it never happens to me , but if you want a fruitful evening , stay at least somewhat conscious .
It ’s easier to talk that way .
Advertising
Criticize –
It ’s OK to give your critique of the music or selection of beers , but do n’t let it get you down .
No one has any fun with someone that ’s continually upset about little things .
You might be at a dive , but still enjoy yourself .
You generally have the best times in the worst places possible .
Judge people –
You ’re making it very hard for yourself when you are continually judging people before talking to them .
Almost no - one ’s personality matches their look .
Just because someone is n’t enjoying their company – as mentioned above – does n’t mean they want to be shut out .
Go out of your way to approach wallflowers and people who are n’t smiling .
You may not get a great , or even polite , response but do n’t let that deter you .
Some people do n’t realize they are putting out particular signals [ with body language etc ] and you ’ll be pleasantly surprised when they suddenly brighten up by your witty comments .
Most important :
Do n’t feel like you have to do anything .
You ’re out for your own reasons and want to do your own thing .
Different things work for different people .
For instance , you might never feel comfortable approaching strangers .
Find your own groove and be yourself .
Next week we ’ll talk about How To Initiate Conversation in more detail .
Anything you do n’t agree with ?
Jon Stewart mocks
Pat Robertson 's law school
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday April 27 , 2007 Print This Email This
Jon Stewart took aim at televangelist Pat Robertson 's law school , Regent University , on ' The Daily Show . '
The House Judiciary Committee , investigating the U.S. Attorney firings scandal , voted to grant immunity to former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Monica Goodling .
Goodling is a graduate of Regent .
" There are over 150 other Regent alumni currently working in the Bush administration with her , " says Stewart .
It 's not surprising , he says , " since the latest U.S. News & World Report ranks Regent as a ' Tier Four ' school , out of what must be hundreds of ... oh , there 's only four tiers .
" Well , certainly four must be the best tier of the ... eh , it 's the worst tier , " adds Stewart , to laughter .
" Apparently , I 'm being told that Regent is tied with Jiffy Law . "
Lasers in today 's electronics generally come in red — in everything from DVD players to bar - code scanners — but a new result may point the way to making the lasers in a rainbow of hues .
Conventional electronic lasers are made from layers of semiconductor .
Now researchers have engineered crystalline semiconductor specks to produce laser light far more easily than before .
The result brings the tiny flakes , called nanocrystals , a crucial step closer to fulfilling their promise of tailoring a laser 's color just by changing the size of the crystal , which could lead to more powerful tools for detecting chemicals or sending information via flickers of light .
The color of laser light depends on the light - emitting material .
Specifically , a semiconductor offers electrons a choice of two energy states , lower or higher , sort of like a ladder with two rungs .
The band gap , or difference in energy between rungs , determines the wavelength of light emitted .
" In nanocrystals , the gap changes with their size — the smaller the size , the larger the gap , " says physicist Victor Klimov of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
The challenge was getting the nanocrystal 's electrons to cooperate .
Laser light occurs when most of a material 's electrons are in an excited , or higher , energy state .
An incoming photon will then knock an electron from the top to bottom energy rungs , kicking out two identical photons in the process and causing amplification of light .
In the nanocrystals , which range from two to 150 nanometers wide , only two electrons per crystal may hop between energy rungs .
When both members of the pair became excited , one of them would normally fall to the lower rung before being struck by an incoming photon , producing no photon along the way and leaving too few excited electrons to make laser light .
Klimov and colleagues overcame this hurdle by splitting the nanocrystal into a cadmium sulfide core and a zinc selenide shell .
The core trapped excited electrons for two nanoseconds — 50 times longer than normal and long enough to be hit by an outside photon — according to a report published this week in Nature .
Before this result , nanocrystal lasers needed their own superpowerful laser to get them going , says chemist Todd Krauss of the University of Rochester .
He adds that if such two - layer crystals are long lasting and efficient enough to be melded with electronics , " you open up a complete array of applications . "
Nanocrystal lasers might be cheaper , more efficient and versatile compared with today 's kind , Krauss says , perhaps leading to chemical sensors or optical communications devices capable of rapidly switching between laser colors .
" The potential is there , " he says .

sort : put the elements in order , i.e. " Haeklls " .
group : group consecutive elemnts , i.e. [ " H " , " a " , " e " , " k " , " ll " , " s " ] .
It would be entirely reasonable to have a groupSet function that did grouping of non-consecutive elements , and I often use such a function .
maximumBy ( comparing length ) : find the maximum value , looking only at the number of elements in each list , i.e. " ll " .
head : take a representative value from the list , i.e. 'l ' .
Haskell has great support for abstraction : small functions can be written which do one general thing .
Haskell also has great support for composition : putting small functions together is easy .
On IRC today someone asked for a function that computes theof a list .
This is the same as finding the most common element in a list .
One simple solution is a nice display of composition of smaller abstraction functions :
And a single example : To read the function , it is best to read from right to help :
If asked to write the same function in Javascript ( say ) , I would have started with a Hash table that looped counting the number of occurrences of each letter , then done a loop through this to find the maximum .
The code would have been longer , and more prone to bugs .
It is easy to see that by combining functions that have already been written , tested and documented , it is possible to come up with very succinct operations .
This has been a Cuties presentation
Your brain sees and does more than you know , according to a new study that points to the mysterious workings of the unconscious mind .
To come to this heady conclusion , scientists had to zap the brains of healthy volunteers ( and rather brave ones , we might add ) and temporarily shut down the part of the brain that processes visual information .
For a fraction of a second , a pulse of energy called transcranial magnetic stimulation shut down each person 's visual cortex .
That 's the part of the brain known to process what we see .
The volunteers stared at a computer screen during this moment of blindness while a simple image flashed for an instant .
See that ?
The scientists then asked the study subjects if they had seen a horizontal or vertical line in one test , and a red or green dot in the other .
All nine of them said they 'd seen nothing each time .
When asked to guess what they 'd seen , however , they did significantly better than 50 - 50 .
Those who'd been blind witness to a line guessed its orientation accurately 75 percent of the time .
Those who'd been shown a dot guessed its color right in 81 percent of the cases .
" Even though the human primary visual cortex activity was temporarily shut down , it 's clear that detailed visual information was still being processed unconsciously , " said Tony Ro , a psychologist at Rice University and leader of the study .
Experts had thought all color information was processed in a certain region of the brain 's thalamus , governor of all incoming sensory information .
But there must be multiple pathways in the brain through which visual information flows , the results indicate .
The unconscious mind
The new study is detailed this week in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It contributes to a growing pile of evidence that has yet to reveal what consciousness is .
Ro said his team 's findings provide evidence for a longstanding and controversial speculation made by Sigmund Freud and others that the brain churns some information without us being aware .
Freud called it " unconscious processing . "
Previous studies in patients with brain damage reached similar conclusions : Patients who said they could n't see an object could , when pressed , identify its shape and location .
Researchers call the phenomenon blindsight , and some say it indicates the brain has an unconscious mode that might be at the root of transcendental experiences for which the conscious mind can't account .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Should smokers and ex-smokers get an annual screening test for lung cancer ?
With experts divided , patients may be left on their own to decide .
A panel of experts on Friday showed that the issue may not be resolved any time soon , leaving doctors and patients to weigh the risks and benefits .
Currently , a large clinical trial is underway to see if using advanced X - rays called spiral CT scans will improve the odds for people to survive lung cancer .
The researcher who has led the drive for screening told a meeting of the National Lung Cancer Partnership in Chicago that the study is flawed , and urged public health experts to recommend annual screening for people at risk for lung cancer .
“ Screening using low dose CT reduces death from lung cancer .
It finds it early and early treatment is better than later treatment , ” said Dr. Claudia Henschke of the New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
Henschke said the lung screening trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute -- which aims to settle the debate over whether the screening saves lives -- is unlikely to prove anything because it will not screen patients for long enough .
The screening is scheduled to be completed in 2009 .
However other experts say the trial is necessary to prove benefits of the more sensitive screening that could result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures by identifying spots that do not pose a risk .
Henschke last fall published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that supports the argument that yearly computed tomography or CT scans could have a dramatic impact on lung cancer death rates .
In 1999 , she and other researchers found that spiral CT scanning could spot 85 percent of small lung tumors while they could still be surgically removed .
Currently , when lung cancer is detected , the disease has already spread outside the lung in 15 percent to 30 percent of cases .
Once it has spread , it is rarely curable .
Dr. Denise Aberle of the University of California - Los Angeles , who is a lead researcher in the screening trial , said the study -- which is to be completed in 2009 -- is needed to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks .
“ The benefit of screening has n’t been proven , ” she said in an interview .
“ It ’s important the public understand that . ”
CT scans can detect a number of problems that may or may not pose a risk , Aberle said .
“ Most of the findings will not be clinically significant , yet they convert the ostensibly healthy individual into a patient , ” Aberle said .
Some studies have shown the scans result in a tenfold increase in operations .
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related deaths .
It kills 164,000 Americans a year and 1.3 million people a year globally .
The warning by General Sir Richard Dannatt , chief of the general staff , to fellow defence chiefs comes at a time when the army is asking for a big increase in reservists to be deployed in Afghanistan , reflecting a crisis in Britain 's armed forces .
In a secret memorandum he says : " We now have almost no capability to react to the unexpected . "
Reinforcements for emergencies or for operations in Iraq or Afghanistan were " now almost non-existent " .
He adds : " The enduring nature and scale of current operations continues to stretch people " .
Gen Dannatt warns the army had to " augment " 2,500 troops from other units for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to bring up the total force to the 13,000 needed there .
This remained " far higher than we ever assumed " , he says .
He continues : " When this is combined with the effects of under - manning ( principally in the infantry and Royal Artillery ) and the pace of training support needed to prepare units for operations , the tempo of life in the Field Army is intense . "
While the current situation was " manageable " , Gen Dannatt said he was " concerned about the longer term implications of the impact of this level of operations on our people , equipment and future operational capability " .
The general 's warnings , in a document leaked to the Daily Telegraph , come at a time when the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury are finalising spending plans for the next three years in the comprehensive spending review expected to be revealed in October .
The three service chiefs are arguing among themselves about how the money should be spent .
The navy is expected next week to be told it will get two new aircraft carriers at a cost of between £ 2bn and £ 3bn and fewer destroyers and frigates than it wants .
Gordon Brown , the prime minister who as chancellor fought regularly with the MoD , has told defence chiefs to sort out a deal among themselves , according to defence sources .
As the army has been forced to call up 600 reservists for Afghanistan there is only one Spearhead battalion of 500 troops , available for an emergency .
Gen Dannatt 's memo says Britain 's other rapid deployment unit , the Airborne Task Force , made up mainly of Paras , was unable to fully deploy " due to shortages in manpower , equipment and stocks " .
It is not the first time Gen Dannatt has expressed concern about pressure on the army .
Soon after he took up his post last August he told the Guardian that the army was " running hot " and called for a national debate on defence .
Top 10 Least Intelligent Dogs :
10 . Basset Hound
The Basset Hound ( right ) is well known for its scenting ability and endurance when tracking .
They are also very well behaved and even tempered , and great with children .
Housebreaking and training a Basset Hound can be difficult , but what they lack in intelligence is more than made up for in their devotion to their work ( just try to distract a Basset Hound when it is trailing a scent ! ) and gentle , sweet nature .
Learn more about the Basset Hound ( History and health issues )
9. Beagle
The Beagle ( right ) is another breed that can be a challenge to train .
Not so much due to their intelligence level , but more for their independent and willful nature .
Beagles make great family pets , and love company and affection .
They are great with children and other dogs , but be careful socializing Beagles with other household pets such as cats .
A good idea is to socialize a Beagle with other pets when they are young , to avoid any problems in the future .

8. Mastiff
The Mastiff ( below ) originated in Britain over two thousand years ago , and is one of the largest breeds of dog .
They have a gentle nature , but at the same time make excellent guard dogs .
Mastiffs can be quite stubborn at times , which some may confuse with a lack of intelligence .
When training a Mastiff , try keeping the sessions short ( around ten to fifteen minutes ) but frequent ( two or three times a day . )
Because Mastiffs are quite sensitive , you will have better results if you train using an excited and happy voice .
Be sure to practice your training often , even for tricks your Mastiff has already learned .

7. Pekingese
The Pekingese ( left ) are one of the most difficult dogs to train .
They have a very independent and dominating nature that requires firmness and consistency .
Although wary of strangers , they are very affectionate with their masters .
The Pekingese are extremely brave for their size , and make surprisingly good watchdogs !
Not recommended for young children .

6. Bloodhound
The Bloodhound ( left ) may not be the most intelligent of dogs , but what a nose !
These dogs can track any scent , even a scent trail that is over one hundred hours old .
The Bloodhound is extremely determined , and has an outstanding work ethic .
They are gentle , affectionate , and great with kids .
Training requires a firm hand and plenty of patience .

5. Borzoi ( aka Russian Wolfhound )
The Borzoi ( left ) is a breed of dog that is surprisingly cat - like in its free thinking and independent nature .
They keep themselves very clean , and arent as driven to please their masters as most dogs .
This makes them a little bit harder to train , but they make up for this in their loyalty and affectionate nature with people they know well .

4. Chow Chow
Another dog who displays cat - like characteristics is the Chow Chow ( right ) , most commonly kept as an indoor companion dog .
They are extremely loyal to their family , and can be quite jealous of visitors to its masters home .
Chow Chows have a dominant nature and require a strong - willed owner and firm hand , or they will quickly take charge of the household !
Again , this dogs extreme stubbornness may be mistaken for a lack of intelligence .

3. Bulldog
Bulldogs ( right ) are well known for their extreme courage , dependability , and amazing guarding skills .
Along with their menacing appearance , not many burglars would want to mess with a dog that is bred to guard , control , and bait bulls !
Conversely , Bulldogs are also among the most gentle of breeds , who are very affectionate and gentle with children .
Bulldogs are great family dogs that require a lot of human attention and affection to ensure their happiness .

2. Basenji
The Basenji ( right ) is most known for its unique bark , which can often sound like a human being laughing or crying .
Some even refer to the Basenji as a barkless  dog .
They are another dog that display cat - like characteristics , often grooming themselves and / or staring out the window for hours a day !
But if you live in an apartment or condominium and think a Basenji would be perfect for you , think again .
Basenjis are a very active dog that require frequent walks or , at the very least , a spacious backyard .
They can be a bit temperamental ( A lot of human contact from the puppy stage helps with this ) and harder to train than most dogs .

1. Afghan Hound
The Afghan Hound ( left ) is known by many as the king of dogs , and are one of the most ancient breeds .
They are sweet , affectionate , and sensitive , with a low dominance level .
But at the same time , they are quite noble and courageous when they need to be .
Their low obedience level is well known among dog breeders and trainers .
But like a few of the other breeds on this list , the Afghan Hound has many cat - like personality traits .
So this begs the question : are Afghan Hounds really the least intelligent dog , or the most independent thinking ?
And with their sweet nature , does it really matter ?
We dont think so !

In 1994 , nearly 200 judges from the Canadian and U.S. Kennel Clubs were asked to complete a questionaire about the characteristics of various dog breeds , most notably the intelligence level of these breeds .
The intelligence ratings were based on how many repetitions it took for a certain breed to master a new command .
The breeds on our list took at least 80 repetitions ( or more ) to learn a new command , and tended to obey first commands less than 25 per cent of the time .
By the way , if your dog is on the list , do n't despair , it does n't make him love you any less !

WASHINGTON , Sept. 22 - Prince Saud al - Faisal , the Saudi foreign minister , said Thursday that he had been warning the Bush administration in recent days that Iraq was hurtling toward disintegration , a development that he said could drag the region into war .
" There is no dynamic now pulling the nation together , " he said in a meeting with reporters at the Saudi Embassy here .
" All the dynamics are pulling the country apart . "
He said he was so concerned that he was carrying this message " to everyone who will listen " in the Bush administration .
Prince Saud 's statements , some of the most pessimistic public comments on Iraq by a Middle Eastern leader in recent months , were in stark contrast to the generally upbeat assessments that the White House and the Pentagon have been offering .
But in an appearance at the Pentagon on Thursday , President Bush , while once again expressing long - term optimism , warned that the bloodshed in Iraq was likely to increase in the coming weeks .
HAT KHRAI , Thailand -
The monster fish announced itself with four huge whacks of its tail , thrashing against the net that had trapped it in the pale brown water of the Mekong River .
It was a rare giant catfish the size of a grizzly bear , and it took five boatmen an hour to pull it in and 10 men to lift it when they reached the shore in this remote village in northern Thailand .
Only after their catch had been chopped into pieces and sold did they learn how special it was .
At nine feet in length and weighing 646 pounds , it may be the biggest freshwater fish ever recorded .
But in one of the world 's more surprising mysteries , nobody really knows which is the biggest species of fish lurking under the waters of the Mekong or the Amazon or the Yangtze or the Congo or the Colorado or Lake Baikal .
In 2002 , both KDE and GNOME released their last major revisions ; KDE released KDE 3.0 on 3rd April , while GNOME followed shortly after with GNOME 2.0 on 27th June .
For the Linux desktop , therefore , 2002 was an important year .
Since then , we have continiously been fed point releases which added bits of functionaility and speed improvements , but no major revision has yet seen the light of day .
What ’s going on ?
Both KDE and GNOME have some serious problems which cannot be solved easily .
Gtk+ has an alarming shortage of core maintainers , and you do not need a degree at MIT to understand what that means : less quality assurance , and a slower bug fixing pace .
Gtk+ of course is the base on which GNOME is built , and hence any problems with the Gtk+ project will have their effects on GNOME .
The second big problem with GNOME is that it lacks any form of a vision , a goal , for the next big revision .
GNOME 3.0 is just that - a name .
There is not even one line of code for GNOME 3.0 , not even a goal or feature description .
All GNOME 3.0 has are some random ideas by random people in random places .
There is nobody actually working on defining what GNOME 3.0 should become , and hence the chances that GNOME 3.0 sees any light of day in the coming two years is highly dubious .
GNOME 3.0 is supposed to be a radical departure from GNOME - current , and you just do n’t do something like that in a 6 month release cycle .
GNOME 3.0 wo n’t be on your desktop until at least 2009 , which will mean that by then , GNOME will not have seen a major revision in 7 years .
On the other side of the river the future may seem a little brighter , but do not let appearances fool you .
KDE might have a vision for what KDE 4.0 should become , but with vision alone you will not actually get anywhere .
KDE developers are indeed planning big things for KDE4 – but that is what they are stuck at .
Show me where the results are .
KDE4 was supposed to be fleshed out by now , with a release somewhere early 2007 .
However , if you now take a look at the latest KDE4 development build – it is just KDE3 , but uglier .
We ’ve been hearing Plasma this and Appeal that for a very long time now ; however , nothing Solid ( that really is a lame joke , my sincere apologies ) has emerged .
KDE ’s biggest problem is a lack of manpower and financial backing by big companies .
In the past , both Mandrake and SUSE were the major driving forces behind KDE development , but now , SUSE is part of the GNOME - centric Novell family , and Mandrake Mandriva has been delegated to the sidelines .
All the wonderful ideas behind KDE4 ( and the accompanying slick websites ) are just that– ideas and websites .
There are no development builds that truly show these ideas in a usable state .
KDE4 is supposed to be released in the first half of 2007 , but if all they have to show now is KDE3 + , KDE4 is more likely to see release somewhere in 2008 – Q3 / Q4 rather than Q1 / Q2 .
This will mean 6 years without a major revision of KDE .
In the meantime , the competition has not exactly been standing still .
Apple has continuously been improving its Mac OS X operating system , adding new and sometimes even innovative features , while also increasing the OS ’s speed with every release .
Leopard is scheduled for the first half of 2007 , and even though what we have been showed so far is not really revolutionary , Steve Jobs has promised us some ‘ top secret ’ features .
I think Apple ’s recent track record in delivering allows us to believe his words .
Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels either .
Windows Vista is already available to some people ( including me ) , and by the end of January , basically every new computer sold will come with this new operating system .
Many anti-MS fanboys complain that Vista is nothing more than XP with a new coat , but anyone with an open mind who used it for an extensive period of time ( including me ) realises this is absolutely not the case– in any case , we can say that many people used to XP will at least perceive Vista as a major upgrade , and in the end , that is what really matters .
The Linux desktop world will not have any answers ready to Microsoft ’s and Apple ’s big releases for at least the coming two years .
Has the desktop Linux bubble burst ?
I would not go as far as saying that ; however , it is certainly about to , and unless the KDE and GNOME team get a move on , it will do so shortly .
Which is a shame .

Congress passed the law in response to the court ’s ruling in the Nebraska case , responding specifically to the majority ’s insistence in that case that the law must include an exception for circumstances when the banned procedure was necessary for the sake of a pregnant woman ’s health .
Congress provided an exception only to save a pregnant woman ’s life , as Nebraska had , declaring that the procedure was never necessary for a woman ’s health .
Justice Kennedy , in addressing the need for the health exception , said on Wednesday that it was acceptable for Congress not to include one because there was “ medical uncertainty ” over whether the banned procedure was ever necessary for the sake of a woman ’s health .
He said that pregnant women or their doctors could assert an individual need for a health exception by going to court to challenge the law as it applied to them .
Justice Ginsburg said that this approach was unrealistic and “ gravely mistaken . ”
She said that requiring “ piecemeal ” litigation “ jeopardizes women ’s health and places doctors in an untenable position . ”
Clarke D. Forsythe , president of Americans United for Life , a leading anti-abortion group , said approvingly that while the court did not technically overturn the Nebraska decision , the new ruling “ effectively gutted it . ”
Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart , the Nebraska doctor who challenged both the state law in 2000 and the federal law in this case , Gonzales v. Carhart , No. 05-380 , said that “ those who support this law are trying to outlaw all abortions , one step at a time . ”
In his discussion of the court ’s precedents , Justice Kennedy went so far as to suggest that the new ruling was in fact compelled by the court ’s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the 1992 case that reaffirmed the basic holding of Roe v.
Wade that women have a constitutional right to abortion .
Justice Kennedy supported that result and helped write the decision ’s unusual joint opinion .
On Wednesday , he said that “ whatever one ’s views concerning the Casey joint opinion , it is evident a premise central to its conclusion — that the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life — would be repudiated were the court now to affirm the judgments of the courts of appeals ” that struck down the federal law .
Crunch warning as oil nears $ 80
As oil prices approach last year 's all - time high of $ 78.65 a barrel , the leading world energy body has warned that a major crunch looms in five years ' time as booming demand outstrips supply .
In its monthly oil market report released today , the International Energy Agency predicts that pressure on oil supplies will ease next year .
But in its medium - term outlook the IEA said a supply crunch will take hold of the market towards 2012 as demand rises faster than expected .
It predicts demand will rise by an average of 2.2 % a year between 2007 and 2012 , driven by strong economic growth , particularly in China , the Far East and India .
Ted Scott , manager of the F&C UK Growth & Income Fund , warns that the China factor can only accelerate : ' China is only a few years into its industrialisation programme and the number of cars in the country is still a very small fraction of those in the US .
This could dramatically change in the next few years , hugely increasing demand for oil , ' he said .
' There is also a growing political risk in the oil sector .
Countries such as Russia and Venezuela are making it increasingly difficult for Western companies to access and export their oil . '
Supply , however , will not be able to keep pace .
With nations outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries adding only 1 % to world supply each year , it all depends on Opec .
And the IEA foresees that Opec will face capacity constraints .
Investment to develop new extraction techniques is also affecting profitability .
' It is becoming increasingly difficult , and much more expensive , to find new sources of supply for oil , ' says Scott .
' The most accessible areas to have already been exploited and oil companies are being forced to explore less attractive areas .
What this reports shows is that oil reserves have been generally overestimated . '
The IEA medium - term report set the oil market off into a nervy week , with Brent ticking steadily up from $ 73.80 to threaten the all - time high .
It stabilised at $ 77.27 by noon today with the release of the IEA 's more optimistic view for next year .
It predicts Opec 's production capacity will rise by 1 m barrels per day ( bpd ) and also that refinery capacity will expand sufficiently to meet increasing demand with more ease than in the past two years .
Ten Opec members began cutting production in 2006 to stem a drop in prices .
The IEA has repeatedly urged Opec to raise supply and the report pointed to a higher need for the group 's oil by the fourth quarter .
Opec officials maintain they are not to blame for near - record oil prices and point the finger at a global shortage of refinery capacity and international political tension .
The Financial Times noted in an editorial yesterday : ' In many ways , the rising oil price points to a market at work : demand is up , supply is lagging and prices rise .
That high price should fuel a search for alternative sources of energy and lead to more exploration and exploitation of oil supplies . '
However , the IEA also warns that production and adoption of alternative fuel types such as ethanol and other biofuels is not sufficiently advanced to fill the gap within the next five years .
Economists and policymakers are growing increasingly concerned that the surge in oil prices will feed through into higher price inflation , leaving the Bank of England little option but to raise rates even higher in order to meet its long - term objective of getting consumer price index inflation back down to 2 % .
Monetary policy committee member Dr Andrew Sentence earlier this week warned that rising world commodity prices would soon force the Bank into another rate rise to 6 % .
Through a Rapist 's Eyes ( No Joke ) A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they look for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts :
1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle .
They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed .
They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair .
Women with short hair are not common targets .
2) The second thing men look for is clothing .
They will look for women who 's clothing is easy to remove quickly .
Many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing .
3) They also look for women on their mobile phone , searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking , because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered .
4) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape woman is in the early morning , between 5 and 8:30 a.m.5 )
The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location , where they do n't have to worry about getting caught6 )
Only 2 % said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3 - 5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15 - 20 years .
7 ) If you put up any kind of a fight at all , they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you is n't worth it because it will be time - consuming .
8 )
These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas , or other similar objects that can be used from a distance , in their hands .
Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon .
So , the idea is to convince these guys you 're not worth it .
9 ) Several defense mechanisms he taught us are :
If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in a lift or stairwell , look them in the face and ask them a question , like what time is it , or make general small talk , " I ca n't believe it is so old out here , we 're in for a bad winter " .
Now you 've seen their face and could identify them in a line - up , you lose appeal as a target .
10 ) If someone is coming toward you , hold out your hands in front of you and yell " Stop " or " Stay back ! "
Most of the rapists talked to said they 'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back .
Again , they are looking for an EASY target .

The world 's first creationist museum , which tells visitors the Earth is only about 6,000 years old , has opened its doors in the American midwest .
The Creation Museum claims dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex lived alongside ancient civilisations but were strictly vegetarian before the Fall of Man and that the Grand Canyon was created by Noah 's flood .
Some 4,000 people visited the Kentucky museum on its first day yesterday while demonstrators protested outside and a plane towing a banner reading " Thou shalt not lie " circled overhead .
Critics say the $ 27 m ( £ 14 m ) centre , whose motto is " Prepare to believe ! " , will be the first museum in the world whose exhibits are almost entirely fake .
It is seeking to convince visitors of the truth of its belief in the account of the world 's creation in the book of Genesis through a mixture of animatronic models and tableaux .
Mark Looy , a co-founder of the privately funded centre , said : " The guests were very happy with the museum experience .
" Of course , we had some naysayers come through and engage us in conversation , and that 's fine - we want them . "
Lawrence Krauss , an author and physicist at Cleveland 's Case Western Reserve University , decided to view the museum first - hand .
" It 's really impressive , and it really gives the impression that they 're talking about science at some point , " said Mr Krauss .
Awarding marks out of five , " I 'd give it a four for technology , five for propaganda .
As for content , I 'd give it a negative five , " he said .
The museum features hi-tech exhibits designed by former theme - park artist Patrick Marsh , including animatronic dinosaurs and a wooden ark at least two stories tall , plus a special effects theatre and planetarium .
Some exhibits show dinosaurs aboard Noah 's ark and assert that all animals were vegetarians until Adam committed the first sin in the garden of Eden .
When Mr Marsh was asked to explain the existence of fossilised remains of man 's ancestors , he replied : " There are no such things .
" Humans are basically as you see them today .
Those skeletons they 've found , what 's the word ?
They could have been deformed , diseased or something .
" I 've seen people like that running round the streets of New York . "
Construction of the complex began with a prayer meeting for workers , all of whom signed a contract saying they agreed with creationism .
Ken Ham , the museum 's Australian director , is equally defiant .
He revealed he had " skipped through " a copy of Richard Dawkins ' latest book , but he said : " The thing is , Dawkins does not have infinite knowledge or understanding himself .
" He 's got a position , too , it 's just a different one from ours .
The Bible makes sense and is overwhelmingly confirmed by observable science .
It does not confirm the belief in evolution . "

Did you hear about the Wisconsin man who is charged with having sex with a dead deer that he found in a ditch ?
http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1122061deer1.html
His defense was that the deer was already dead , so it was n’t technically an “ animal ” when the sex happened .
The judge disagreed and ruled that a dead deer is still an animal .
This decision sets a dangerous precedent .
By the judge ’s reasoning , any guy who gets aroused while wearing leather pants has – in the strictest legal terms – his wiener in a cow .
The story does n’t mention if the dead dear was male or female .
That ’s important because I want to know if the perpetrator was gay .
Without that information , I do n’t know how fascinated I should be .
And lord help me , I ca n’t stop wondering what specific kind of sex he had .
Did he arrange the deer in missionary position – which is the way I prefer to imagine it – or was he just getting a little antler ?
Was he whispering sweet nothings , or was he having angry sex and yelling something along the lines of “ I… TOLD … YOU …TO …STAY …OUT…OF …THE…ROAD !!!! ”
The story does n’t mention if the perpetrator tapped the deer where he found it in the ditch or if he dragged it home and put lipstick on it first .
My guess is that he got busy right in the ditch , based on three facts :
1 . Deer are heavy .
2 . He got caught .
3 . If a man is horny enough to fornicate with a dead deer , he ’s probably too horny to wait until he gets it home .
I ’m trying to picture the cop arriving on the scene .
The deer - humper looks up from the ditch , sees the cop looking down at him , and asks himself this question : “ Is there any point in stopping ? ”
It seems to me that the legal punishment for man- on - deer sex would be exactly the same whether you finish or not .
I picture him holding up two fingers and saying to the cop , “ Just two minutes .
Almost done . ”
The cop would n’t mind waiting .
He ’d be busy covering his entire body and the back seat of his cruiser with plastic gloves before he handcuffed the guy .
I also wonder what the cop was thinking .
If I were the cop , I ’d be worrying that this would be the exact time I had a coincidental heart attack , rolled into the ditch , and became part of this guy ’s threesome .
This is why people like me do not become cops .
I worry about all the wrong things .
Some people might say this was a victimless crime , but I think that depends on whether the perpetrator has recently broken up with a girlfriend .
If so , I would say she ’s not too happy about this development .
It ’s one thing to lose your guy to a cheerleader , but it really has to sting when you lose your guy to road kill .
How did he break it to her ?
“ It ’s not you , baby , it ’s me …and a carcass I noticed on route 9 . ”
Anyway , the moral of this story – and there is one – is that if you ever see a dead deer in a ditch , and you are aroused by it , your best strategy is to pass the buck .
Or get a windowless van .
A metaprogram is a program that generates other programs or program parts .
Hence , metaprogramming means writing metaprograms .
Many useful metaprograms are available for Linux ; the most common ones include compilers ( GCC or FORTRAN 77 ) , interpreters ( Perl or Ruby ) , parser generators ( Bison ) , assemblers ( AS or NASM ) and preprocessors ( CPP or M4 ) .
Typically , you use a metaprogram to eliminate or reduce a tedious or error - prone programming task .
So , for example , instead of writing a machine code program by hand , you would use a high - level language , such as C , and then let the C compiler do the translation to the equivalent low - level machine instructions .
Metaprogramming at first may seem to be an advanced topic , suitable only for programming language gurus , but it 's not really that difficult once you know how to use the adequate tools .
Source Code Generation
In order to present a very simple example of metaprogramming , let 's assume the following totally fictional situation .
Erika is a very smart first - year undergraduate computer science student .
She already knows several programming languages , including C and Ruby .
During her introductory programming class , Professor Gomez , the course instructor , caught her chatting on her laptop computer .
As punishment , he demanded Erika write a C program that printed the following 1,000 lines of text : 1 . I must not chat in class .
2 . I must not chat in class .
... 999 . I must not chat in class .
1000 .
I must not chat in class .
An additional imposed restriction was that the program could not use any kind of loop or goto instruction .
It should contain only one big main function with 1,000 printf instructions — something like this : # include < stdio.h > int main ( void ) { printf ( " 1 . I must not chat in class .
" ) ; printf ( " 2 . I must not chat in class .
" ) ; /* 996 printf instructions omitted . */ printf ( " 999 .
I must not chat in class .
" ) ; printf ( " 1000 .
I must not chat in class .
" ) ; return 0 ; } Professor Gomez was n't too naive , so he basically expected Erika to write the printf instruction once , copy it to the clipboard , do 999 pastes , and manually change the numbers .
He expected that even this amount of irksome and repetitive work would be enough to teach her a lesson .
But , Erika immediately saw an easy way out — metaprogramming .
Instead of writing this program by hand , why not write another program that writes this program automatically for her ?
So , she wrote the following Ruby script : File.open (' punishment.c' , 'w ' ) do |output| output.puts '# include < stdio.h >' output.puts ' int main ( void ) {' 1.upto( 1000 ) do |i| output.puts " printf ( \ " #{i} . " +
" I must not chat in class . \
\ " ) ; " end output.puts ' return 0 ; ' output.puts ' } ' end
This code creates a file called punishment .c with the expected 1,000 + lines of C source code .
Although this example might seem a bit fabricated , it illustrates how easy it is to write a program that produces the source of another program .
This technique can be used in more realistic settings .
Let 's say that you have a C program that needs to include a PNG image , but for some reason , the deployment platform can accept one file only , the executable file .
Thus , the data that conforms the PNG file data has to be integrated within the program code itself .
To achieve this , we can read the PNG file beforehand and generate the C source text for an array declaration , initialized with the corresponding data as literal values .
This Ruby script does exactly that : INPUT_FILE_NAME = ' ljlogo.png '
OUTPUT_FILE_NAME = ' ljlogo.h '
DATA_VARIABLE_NAME = ' ljlogo ' File.open(INPUT_FILE_NAME , 'r ' ) do |input| File.open( OUTPUT_FILE_NAME , 'w ' ) do |output| output .
print " unsigned char #{DATA_VARIABLE_NAME} [ ] = { " data = input.read.unpack ('C* ' ) data.length.times do |i| if i % 8 == 0 output. print "
" end output . print ' 0x%02X ' % data [ i ] output .
print ' , ' if i < data.
length - 1 end output.puts "
} ; " end end This script reads the file called ljlogo.png and creates a new output file called ljlogo .h.
First , it writes the declaration of the variable ljlogo as an array of unsigned characters .
Next , it reads the whole input file at once and unpacks every single input character as an unsigned byte .
Then , it writes each of the input bytes as two - digit hexadecimal numbers in groups of eight elements per line .
As should be expected , individual elements are terminated with commas , except the last one .
Finally , the script writes the closing brace and semicolon .
Here is a possible output file sample : unsigned char ljlogo [ ] = { 0x89 , 0x50 , 0x4E , 0x47 , 0x0D , 0x0A , 0x1A , 0x0A , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x0D , 0x49 , 0x48 , 0x44 , 0x52 , /* A few hundred lines omitted .
*/ 0x0B , 0x13 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x49 , 0x45 , 0x4E , 0x44 , 0xAE , 0x42 , 0x60 , 0x82 } ;
The following C program demonstrates how you could use the generated code as an ordinary C header file .
It 's important to note that the PNG file data will be stored in memory when the program itself is loaded : # include < stdio.h > # include " ljlogo.h " /*
Prints the contents of the array ljlogo as hexadecimal byte values .
*/ int main ( void ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < sizeof ( ljlogo ) ; i++) { printf ( " %X " , ljlogo [ i ] ) ; } return 0 ; } You also can have a program that both generates source code and executes it on the spot .
Some languages have a facility called eval , which allows you to translate and execute a piece of source code contained within a string of characters at runtime .
This feature is usually available in interpreted languages , such as Lisp , Perl , Ruby , Python and JavaScript .
In this Ruby code : x = 3 s = 'x + 1 ' puts eval(s )
The string 'x + 1 ' is translated and executed when the code is run , printing 4 as a result .
Note that even the value bound to variable x is available during the runtime evaluation .
The following Ruby code demonstrates a contrived way to find the result of adding all the integer numbers between 1 and 100 .
Instead of using a normal loop or iteration method , we generate a big string containing the expression “ 1+2+3 +... +99+100 ” and then proceed to evaluate it : puts eval ( ( 1..100 ).to_a.join ( '+' ) )
The eval function should be used with care .
If the string used as the argument to eval comes from an untrusted source ( for example , from user input ) , it can be potentially dangerous ( imagine what could happen if the string to evaluate contains the Ruby expression rm -r * ) .
In many cases , there are alternatives to eval that are more flexible , less insecure and do not require the speed hit of parsing code during runtime .
Quines
A quine is special kind of source code generator .
The jargon file defines a quine as “ a program that generates a copy of its own source text as its complete output ” .
You might be right if you think this lacks any practical value by itself , but as a brain - teaser , it can be mind - blowing .
Here 's a quine written by Ryan Davis , which is one of the shortest ones for the Ruby language : f= " f= % p;puts f % % f " ; puts f %f Run this program , and you will get it as output .
You might even try something like this from a shell prompt : ruby -e ' f = " f= % p; puts f % % f " ; puts f%f ' | ruby
Here we 're using the -e option from the command line to specify one line of Ruby source to execute , and then we use a pipe to send its output to another instance of the Ruby interpreter .
The output is once again the same program source .
Modifying Programs during Runtime Dynamic languages , such as Ruby , allow you to modify different parts of your program easily during runtime without having to generate source code explicitly as we did previously .
Ruby 's core API and frameworks , such as Ruby on Rails , employ this facility to automate common programming tasks .
For example , in a class definition , you can use the attr_accessor method to produce the read / write access methods automatically for a given attribute name .
Thus , the following code : class Person attr_accessor : name end
is equivalent to this more verbose code : class Person def name @name end def name = ( new_name ) @name = new_name end end
The previous code has a minor drawback : the corresponding instance variable @name is not really created until you first set its value .
This means you 'll get a nil value if you happen to read the name attribute before writing to it .
If you 're not careful , this could introduce a few subtle bugs into your programs .
The easiest way to avoid this problem is to set the @name instance variable to a reasonable value in the Person#initialize method .
Because this is a quite common scenario , would n't it be nice to have this method generated automatically , in addition to the read / write accessors ?
Let 's define an attr_initialize method that 'll do that using Ruby 's metaprogramming facilities .
First , let 's briefly address two methods that are key to performing our desired metaprogramming magic : cls.define_method( name ) { body }
This adds a new instance method to the receiving class .
It takes as input the method 's name ( as a symbol or string ) and its body ( as a code block ) : obj.instance_variable_set( name , value )
The above code binds an instance variable to the specified value .
The name of the instance variable should be a symbol or string , and it also should include the @ prefix .
Now , we 're ready to define the attr_initialize class method as an extension to the Object class so that any other class can use it : require ' generator ' class Object def Object.attr_initialize( * attrs ) define_method ( : initialize ) do |*args| if attrs.length != args.length raise ArgumentError , " wrong number of arguments " + " ( #{args.length} for #{attrs.length} ) " end SyncEnumerator.new ( attrs , args ) . each do |attr , arg| instance_variable_set ( " @#{attr} " , arg ) end end attr_accessor * attrs end end The attr_initialize method takes as input a variable number of attribute names ( attrs ) .
Each attribute name has the same position reserved for it in the dynamically created initialize method parameter list ( args ) in order to set its initial value .
We start the new method 's code by checking that the number of arguments being received are the same as the number of attributes we originally specified .
If not , we raise an error with a descriptive message .
Afterward , we use a SyncEnumerator object ( from the generator library ) to iterate at the same time over the declared attributes list ( attrs ) and the actual arguments list ( args ) so as to perform a one - by - one attribute - argument binding using the instance_variable_set method .
Finally , we delegate to the attr_accessor method in order to create the read / write access methods for all the declared attributes .
Here 's how we can use the attr_initialize method : class Student attr_initialize :name , :id , : address end s = Student.new ( ' Erika ' , 123 , ' 13 Fake St ' ) s.address = ' 13 Wrong Rd ' puts s.name , s.id , s.address
The expected output would be : Erika 123 13 Wrong Rd
Conclusion
Once you 're familiar with the techniques , metaprogramming is not as complicated as it might sound initially .
Metaprogramming allows you to automate error - prone or repetitive programming tasks .
You can use it to pre-generate data tables , to generate boilerplate code automatically that can't be abstracted into a function , or even to test your ingenuity on writing self - replicating code .

Albuquerque , N.M. - Fifty years after the dawn of the space age , hundreds of people have flown into space .
A dozen of those left their bootmarks on the Moon 's surface , and several nations now are planning to sendastronauts back to the Moon and then beyond .
So you would think the expansionof humanity ever deeper into the Cosmos is a sure bet .
But thenotion that human explorers are destined to become an interstellar species isfar from a sure thing as far as Roger Launius is concerned .
Morelikely , humans , and the machines they use to explore space , are going to evolvetogether in ways that are hard to predict at this early stage in the opening ofthe space frontier , said Launius , an eminent space historian and chair for the Division of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington .
Multi-PlanetSpecies
Speaking toa crowd of space professionals at the Space Technology and ApplicationsInternational Forum ( STAIF 2007 ) in Albuquerque Feb.
12 , Launius said humans aredestined to become a multi-planetary species , but that word may take on a wholenew meaning as time evolves .
Given thatthere will be the first child born on the Moon , as well as Mars , will thatperson be a Homo sapien , he asked .
Could thedifferences of gravity , radiation exposure mean those children would be unable to return to Earth ?
" I think that 'sproblematic , " Launius said , and in some respects might this be an evolutionaryroad not unlike that taken by amphibian creatures that departed their waterworld to become land creatures .
" There isthe possibility of the evolution of human species into something different , " Launius said .
He and fellow space researcher , Howard McCurdy of The AmericanUniversity in Washington , have authored a book on thesubject to be published later this year .
Electronics/digitalrevolution
One areawhere all spaceflight visionaries of the past failed to make meaningfulpredictions was in the rapidly advancing capabilities of robotics andelectronics , Launius said .
Forexample , when noted science fiction / fact writer , Arthur C. Clarke , envisioned geosynchronoustelecommunications satellites in 1945 , he believed that they would requirehumans working on board a manned space station because he thought it would benecessary to change the vacuum tubes .
" Some ofthe most forward - thinking spaceflight advocates ... utterly failed to anticipatethe electronics / digital revolution then just beginning , " the space historiannoted .
" With therapid advance of electronics in the 1960s , however , some began to question therole of humans in space exploration .
It is much less expensive and risky to send robotexplorers than to go ourselves .
This debate reached saliency early on andbecame an important part of the space policy debate by the latter twentiethcentury , " Launius pointed out .
Presently , there is a significant merger ofhumans and machines into something different and enhanced , he said .
Self-inducedtransformations
Launiussaid one possibility is the evolution of the human species into somethingdifferent via self - induced transformations : Create an Earth - like environmentfor astronauts to live in ... or change the astronauts in ways that they will bemore capable of surviving in new and different regions of space .
For thelatter , that smacks of a CYBernetic ORGanism , or Cyborg , whereby somephysiological processes are assisted or controlled by mechanical or electronicdevices .
" We mayalready be Cyborgs , " Launius pointed out , looking out into an audience filledwith people wearing glasses , hearing aids and sporting hip and kneereplacements -- not to mention those clinging to their hand - held mobile phonesand other communication devices .
Projectinghundreds of years into the future , Launius said he believed that it is likelyhumans will evolve in ways that cannot be fathomed today , into a form ofspecies perhaps tagged Homo sapiens Astro .
" Will our movement to places likethe Moon and Mars hasten this evolutionary process ? ... I do n't know the answer , " he said .
In closing , Launius suggested that the old paradigm for human space exploration -- ultimately becoming an interstellarspecies --" is outmoded and ready for replacement . "
The CEO Of the Lego Group claims they 're now " very open source , " re-oriented to lovers of the Lego brand .
Of course , he 's " adjusted " the business costs , but mostly they 've made a return to their traditional emphasis on " the joy of building and the pride of creating things .
" I 'm not convinced .
As an educator who 's been using Legos to teach kids for over a decade ( advance high school stuff , like how to build catapults and the physics it demonstrates ) , and despite the CEO 's new interview , I feel an urgent need to express where Lego has gone wrong .
I can remember when the owner of Lego promised they would never promote or create war toys .
For me this was a big selling point : a toy that was n't destructive , and in fact did n't promote destructive behavior in their advertising !
Sure , kids might build a tank or a mock gun , but it was a product of their own imagination , not the building plans !
Our motto in the after school centers was : " Peaceful , Positive and Practical .
" Over the last decade , I 've seen Lego 's themes take them gradually to war .
It started with minor " minifig " characters and then fully developed violence - based pirates / soldiers / knight themes .
Then there was a shift to Galidor 's " Defenders of the Outer Dimension " tie-ins , and Bionicle fighting the evil Makuta .
Now there 's full - fledged futuristic mecha-war machines in Exo-Force !
When Lego first started down this road — with knights — the owner of Lego explained they were highlighting the " romance of the knights , " and not emphasizing violence .
With the wave of new themes , this is n't really true anymore .
Years ago , there was a brouhaha about an artist who created a Lego kit based on holocaust scenes .
Lego would never produce such kits .
However , I do predict that Lego will continue to produce war - based themes , and it's only a matter of time before they produce " tank " models or other modern war machines .
Lego always seemed to be something greater than a retail product .
I attended a conference at MIT where I heard it argued that Lego should be considered a new category of Froebel 's Gift .
( The " free play " educational toys designed for kindergartens in 1840 . )
The boxes were always fairly generic , and emphasized interesting constructions for different age groups .
But over the last decade we 've seen countless movie tie-ins and multiple product spin - offs .
Lego has unleashed waves of comic books , candy , movies , video games , and waffles .
Children will refer to a kit as " Batman Legos . "
It used to be that I could walk into a toy store and immediately identify the Lego section .
Today , they 're interchangeable with other popular construction toys .
A related trend is the rapid phase - in and phase - out of kits .
Lego 's goal seems to be to whet the appetites of collectors by producing hosts of special kits , and then promptly discontinuing them .
This is frustrating when a particularly well - done or interesting kit suddenly becomes unavailable .
Part of the beauty of Lego was that you could keep adding to your collection of generic interchangeable elements , to build larger and more complex projects .
We 've seen a trend towards specialized decorative elements , likely as a result of movie and TV tie-ins .
We 've seen Lego move to smaller elements — perhaps in an effort to save money by using less plastic .
In any case , any retail Lego collection fills rapidly with gobs of sorta-useable decorative elements .
It 's a far cry from the construction kits of the past .
I admit I am biased , and I understand that because of globalized production , the world is flat .
Yet , there was a romance with Lego .
They were made in Denmark .
( Though some bricks were produced in the United States . )
Now they have moved manufacturing to Eastern Europe and China .
This undoubtedly saves them money , but it destroys some of the romance .
What 's the difference between a knock - off brick made in China and a Lego brick made in China ?
Lego even let many of their U.S. developers go !
There was the " farmhouse " — in Connecticut I think — where Lego geniuses planned new kits and themes .
They were all let go .
It makes me wonder if the pseudo - move to open source is really a way to keep overhead down by not having any developers on hand .
Lego still has a variety of wonderful kits and themes .
The RCX / NXT trends are awesome !
That said , they are a shadow of the fantastic constructive elements I worked with a decade ago .
There was a day when other constructive toys were not even in the same league with Legos as a tool for education .
Lego has debased , diluted , and devalued their product to such an extent that other constructive toys are becoming far more attractive .
In his interview , Jorgen Vig Knudstorp described how Lego started producing cars that required less construction ... and they have come back to creating kits that require much construction .
That spoke to me .
But the website says the interview is at the company 's " Innovation Centre " in Billund , Denmark .
It reminded me of that website where someone took images from porn movies and removed the people , leaving generic , almost sterile rooms .
I think that says something about Lego .

Eclipse Europa is the annual release of Eclipse projects in 2007 .
Like last year 's Callisto release , the Europa release is a coordinated release of different Eclipse project teams .
This year , the annual release includes 21 projects .
By releasing these projects at the same time , the goal is to eliminate uncertainty about version compatibility and make it easier to incorporate multiple projects into your environment .
While Europa is about the simultaneous release of twenty one projects , it is not a unification of the projects - each project remains a separate open source project operating with its own project leadership , its own committers , and its own project plan .

Britain ' shas a story proclaiming “ The wrath of 2007 : America ’s great drought ” .
It argues that : “ America is facing its worst summer drought since the Dust Bowl years of the Great Depression .
Or perhaps worse still . ”
Bad news sells .
You get into the story and it says the main impact of this “ great drought ” is “ restrictions on hose pipes and garden sprinklers in eastern cities . ”
I do n’t remember a summer when that did n’t happen for some of the time .
As usual the report has a couple of quotes from the “ climate - change - is - happening - now ” crowd .
As usual no one who disputes that is quoted .
Perhaps the worst section was the closing paragraph which describes the Dust Bowl of the 1930s .
“ When drought hit , the soil dried , became dust , and blew eastwards , mostly in large black clouds .
This caused an exodus from Texas , Arkansas , Oklahoma , and the surrounding Great Plains , with more than half a million Americans left homeless in the Great Depression . ”
Now it is unclear what he is saying but it appears to suggest , or can be interpreted as saying , that the drought of the 1930s caused the Great Depression .
Of course the Depression came first .
The major potential problem for the US from any temporary drought is to crops .
So I looked at the Crop Moisture Index of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration .
You will see it below .
The first thing that strikes me about it is that the vast majority of the United States is in the normal to moist range .
This is especially true of the major food production areas .
When I last blogged on Gore ’s claims about drought I noted that the Southeast had dry conditions mainly in Georgia and the Carolinas .
If you now look at the index here you will see that the Carolinas are all recovered and back to normal and that the dry conditions moved westward .
Half of Georgia is back to normal .
It is now mainly Alabama that is dryer than normal .
The last week saw heavy rainfall across both Florida and Georgia .
The Tampa Bay area got 7 inches of rain with most the region getting 3 to 6 inches .
More moderate rainfall came to the Carolinas as well .
Again the one region that remains very dry is the one region that remains very dry almost every year .
California , Nevada , Arizona and Utah are , and always have been , very dry states .
Southern California has always relied on water imports .
And Arizona is famously dry and warm , that is one reason people move there .
But even there the monsoon season is about to hit as it normally does .
Crop moisture is one thing and rain is another .
So what do we find when it comes to rain ?
Here is the Standard Precipitation Index for the last 9 months , until the end of May .
Again the vast majority of the United States is normal .
And more areas have more rain than normal than have less rain than normal .
You see Georgia , Florida and Alabama are drier than normal , something last weeks storms mitigated , as are California , Oregon and Nevada .
Arizona , that was prominently mentioned as being abnormally dry in the Independent is actually shown as having had normal rainfall over the last 9 months .
But normal in Arizona is still relatively dry .
The claim made by the Church of Anthropogenic Warming is that drought conditions are getting worse as rainfall declines due to climate change .
And the Independent makes this claims specifically for the summer season .
Yet as this chart shows the rainfall trends in the United States , over the summer season , has been toward increased rainfall .
You can see that from 1900 to 1910 rainfall was above average , In the 1930s it was below average .
But for the 1990s , the decade of “ warming ” , we see above normal rainfall which continues right up to the end of this chart in 2006 .
And if we look a historic charts regarding drought in the United States we do n’t see this increased drought .
Here is the chart of which areas were dry in the early 1990s .
The 1990s were much better than the late 70s as this chart shows .
On the other hand the mid 1950s were very bad .
Remember this is before the major “ impact of global warming ” .
The 1930s were not particularly good either .
Again this is prior to supposed man-made warming .
What is actually interesting is that the historic maps of drought areas show wide variability .
In the early 1900s it was mainly Arizona and Utah that had drought .
The next decade showed drought mainly in Texas
In the 1920s drought was mainly in Nevada .
In the 1930s it was mainly Oklahoma , Colorado , Idaho , Montana and the Dakotas .
In the 40s there was little to no drought anywhere .
For the early 1950s there was massive drought covering about half the continental US but by the late 1950s most of it had cleared .
The 1960s saw most of the US spending less than 20 % of the time in drought conditions .
And the 1970s were much improved over that .
The 1980s were moderate in terms of drought with the regions hit mainly the Pacific Northwest and the northern Plain states .
Themakes much to do about Lake Okeechobee in Florida being relatively dry .
But they ignore the reality of the lake .
It is not a lake in the traditional sense of the word .
It is large , second only to Lake Michigan in size but it is extremely shallow , averaging only 9 feet in depth .
Much of it is only 1 foot deep and at the deepest it is the depth of most built - in swimming pools .
It is encompassed by a 20 foot dike that was built in the 1930s .
So it is a very shallow lake .
Thereported : “ Nothing , though , was so strange as the fires that broke out over about 12,000 acres on the northern edge of the lake at the end of May . ”
Considering that entire sections of the lake are normally just one foot deep one would expect sections to dry out completely , during a dry spell , making a possible fire not particularly strange at all .
However , the lake is drier than normal .
But if the Church of AGW are correct this should n’t be the case .
Lake Okeechobee relies heavily on storms hitting the Florida coast .
The Church of AGW , Archbishop Al Gore in particular , have been claiming that warming will increase the number and severity of hurricanes hitting the United States thus bringing more rainfall to Florida not less .
But last year not a single hurricane hit the United States .
So that means that Florida did n’t get the rainfall it normally would and that means Lake Okeechobee would be drier than normal .
This damned - if - you do , damned - if - you - do n’t attitude is what irks me about this global warming religion .
Lake Okeechobee is drier than normal due , in large part , to the absence of hurricanes last year .
But they tell us it is drier due to global warming and long term climate change .
At the same time they argue that increased hurricanes are a result of man-made warming .
So if the lake is full , due to hurricanes , they are right .
And if the lake is lower than normal , because of few or no hurricanes , they are right .
They have their bets hedged in such a way that anything that happens seems to prove man-made warming .
Personally I get the impression that anything that happens is considered proof of man-made warming .

Stuart Staniford has been working independently on the same problem and will post his results next week .
This article was too large for a single post and has been split in two .
Part 2 - " The Results " will follow very shortly .
A two dimensional ( 2D ) volumetric reservoir model has been developed for the Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia which is the world ’s largest field producing over 5 million barrels of oil per day .
This represents 6 % of global oil supplies .
Understanding the current status of this super giant is central to the peak oil debate and to understanding the security of future global energy supplies .
Introduction
Stuart Staniford ( SS ) has led a very lively debate about Saudi Arabian oil supplies on the TOD in recent weeks .
Stuart ( who now has 6 posts on the subject ) has adopted a position describing a current crisis in Saudi oil supplies .
I have adopted a counter position of “ business as usual ” in the Saudi oil industry .
To date I only have two posts on the subject and this article in part is intended to lay out my views in more detail .
A list of all recent Saudi posts on TOD is given at the end of this article ( at the end of Parts 1 and 2 ) .
Saudi Arabia , together with most other Middle East ( ME ) OPEC countries are secretive about their oil resources and this tends to obscure the actual position on their reserves and their productive capacity .
The main issue with ME OPEC reserves estimates is that they were substantially raised in the 1980s , and since then reserves have not been declined for annual production ( Figure 1 ) .
Neither of these practices should be acceptable to analysts based in the OECD .
Publication of Twilight in the Desert , authored by merchant banker Matthew Simmons caused quite a stir in Saudi Aramco , the state owned Saudi oil company .
Simmons described a Saudi oil industry teetering on the brink of decline and raised concerns about the impact of falling Saudi oil production upon the Global economy .
This seems to have prompted Aramco to release more data , so much in fact that it is now possible to make this independent assessment of the oil reserves remaining in Ghawar .
Figure 1 . Saudi Arabian oil reserves since 1980 ( BP statistical review ) show a sharp rise in 1988 and since then reserves have not been properly adjusted for production , discoveries or revisions ( the flat blue line ) .
Since 1980 , the red line tracks reserves decline for production ( BP statistical review ) pointing to a current figure of around 95 billion barrels ( 2005 , not adjusted for revisions and discoveries ) .
Prior to 1980 , Saudi Aramco was still part owned by American companies and the 1980 reserves figure , therefore , is probably the most objective figure available .
Between 1973 and 1980 , there was a rolling program of nationalisation of oil resources in Saudi Arabia .
The red line has been extrapolated back from 1980 to 1936 using SPE centennial data ( 1936 to 1965 ) and BP data from 1965 to 1980 .
This points to an initial Saudi reserve figure of 211 billion barrels , not adjusted for revisions and discoveries made since 1980 .
Ghawar
Ghawar , located close to the Arabian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia is the largest oil field in the world ( Figure 2 ) .
At 164 miles long and about 16 miles wide , it is difficult even for experienced geologists to comprehend the size of this colossal structure ( Figure 3 ) .
Figure 2 . The location of Ghawar in eastern Saudi Arabia showing main geological faults .
This map contains latitude markers that point to the field being 162 miles long ( SS ) .
Map Source Total Petroleum Systems of the Paleozoic and Jurassic , Greater Ghawar Uplift and Adjoining Provinces of Central Saudi Arabia and Northern Arabian - Persian Gulf . ( large pdf ) .
Figure 3 . Map comparing Ghawar to major North Sea oil and gas fields .
Most North Sea fields have higher porosity than Ghawar , and many have stacked reservoirs ( e.g. Brent Group lying above Statfjord Formation ) .
Therefore , areal extent is not the only guide to reserves .
But the scale of Ghawar is still immense .
Note how the undrained crests of N and S Ain Dar are still comparable in area to giant North Sea fields .
North Sea base map grabbed from PESGB Millennium atlas .
The main oil bearing reservoir in Ghawar is the upper Jurassic Arab D limestone .
This is of the order 250 to 300 ft thick and the depositional facies ( geological type ) of limestone varies both vertically and laterally across the structure ( Fig 4 ) .
Superimposed upon this depositional variance is a network of fractures and combined these features influence the productivity and production problems from one area to the next .
Figure 4 . Stratigraphic section for the Arab D . The reservoir comprises those beds with significant porosity and permeability .
Reservoir beds are separated from each other by low porosity / permeability beds that are non-reservoir ( Saner and Sahin ( 1999 ) Lithological and Zonal Porosity - Permeability Distributions in the Arab - D Reservoir , Uthmaniyah Field , Saudi Arabia .
AAPG Bulletin v83 , p230-243 ) .
Zone 1 is transitional between reservoir limestone and the anhydrite ( calcium sulphate ) top seal and has poor / non-reservoir qualities .
The reservoir section in this well is around 250 feet thick and divided into zones 2A , 2B , 3A and 3B .
Note how the upper section , Zone2 , has significantly better reservoir quality than the underlying Zone 3 .
Greg Croft provides average net reservoir thickness values .
These net thicknesses are presumed to be for the producible reservoir and not for the gross Arab D section .
The gross thickness of the reservoir is small compared to the scale of the structure and in the various 3D renderings of Ghawar ( e.g. Figure 5 ) the reservoir should be viewed as a thin skin coating the surface of the structure .
Ghawar may be sub - divided into 6 main production areas defined by structural closures ( structural relief ) and reservoir properties .
From north to south ( Figure 5 ) :
North ‘ Ain Dar
South ‘ Ain Dar
Shedgum
Uthmaniyah
Hawiyah
Haradh
In general terms , reservoir quality and hence productivity decreases from north to south .
The key parameter that varies is permeability – 700 mD average in the north , 100 mD average in the south .
As we shall see , the highly productive north will shortly be fully depleted and most of the remaining reserves are in the south and this will inevitably mean lower production rates during the final chapter of Ghawar ’s history .
Figure 5 . The " Linux " map showing oil saturations in Ghawar ( hat tip Bob Shaw ) .
The blue areas are interpreted to represent dry oil at the top of Arab D Zone 2 .
The yellow areas are interpreted to be swept , water wet at the top of Arab D Zone 2 .
The effects of 50 + years production in northern Ghawar are there for everyone to see ( Linux Clusters driving step changes in interpretation simulation .
( pdf ) .
Transferring the data from this 3D image onto the 2D Croft map is subject to considerable uncertainty .
On the large scale , the Linux map illustrates gravitational equilibrium , i.e. the undrained areas lie in the structure highs .
However , on the smaller scale there is evidence for gravitational dis-equilibrium with areas of water lying above areas of oil on the flanks of Shedgum and S Ain Dar .
This may reflect local geology , faults , Super K zones and variations in reservoir quality etc .
In transferring the Linux data into 2D I have in many cases simply contoured unswept areas – presuming overall gravitational control .
Note the presence of oil in the saddle between Shedgum and S Ain Dar .
The date of this image is uncertain .
It was published in 2006 and refers to a simulation run in 2004 .
It is possible , however , that the data used pre-dates 2004 which may be significant with respect to any debate about the timing of production decline .
Ghawar has been developed using a large number of oil production and water injection wells ( Figure 6 ) .
The principal reason for injecting water is to maintain reservoir pressure above bubble point .
Formation of secondary gas caps in N and S ‘ Ain Dar are most likely due to re-injection of produced gas .
The principal production problem in Ghawar is premature water break through whereby seawater injected down the flanks is prematurely conducted to production wells up the flanks via fracture networks .
This creates a variety of problems discussed later in this article .
Figure 6 .
Map showing the distribution of water injection wells ( blue ) production wells ( black ) and gas injection wells ( red ) .
( Source is Voelker , J. PhD thesis 2004 ) .
The small number of wells in southern Haradh suggests this map pre-dates the Haradh II and III GOSP developments ( Figure 5 ) , which came on stream 2003 and 2006 respectively .
Note that Hawiyah has been fully developed along the flanks , presumably using vertical wells and this ties in with OWC movement observed in Figure 5 .
It is also worth noting that that the tongue of oil in Uthmaniyah ( Figure 5 ) lies in an area that lacks wells on this map .
The crest of Shedgum and S Ain Dar and the ridge axis of Hawiyah and Haradh are essentially undrilled .
Data sources
The main data sources used in compiling the reserves estimates and production model are :
Greg Croft Inc web site
Linux super cluster 3D rendering of produced zones ( pdf )
Water Management in North ' Ain Dar , Saudi Arabia , SPE 93439 , March 2005 .
Water Production Management Strategies in North Uthmaniyah Area , Saudi Arabia , SPE 98847 , June 2006 .
Optimizing Maximum Reservoir Contact Wells : Application to Saudi Arabian Reservoirs , SPE 10395 , Nov 2005 .
A large number of ancillary data sources have also been used .
Greg Croft provides a contoured map of the Ghawar structure that dates from 1959 .
This map provides a scaled area of the structure .
Croft also provides average net reservoir thickness and petrophysical data for the reservoir in the various producing regions , described below , including average porosity and formation volume factor .
All this information is used in compiling the reserves estimates and it is therefore assumed that the information is broadly reliable .
Croft ’s map would appear to be based upon a map published by “ Arabian American Oil Company Staff ” in the Bulletin of The American Association of Petroleum Geologists ; vol 43 , no 2 , 1959 ( Figure 7 ) .
This map , is produced by company professionals , is published in a reputable journal , but is inevitably based on old and perhaps out dated data .
Figure 7 . The Arabian - American map of Ghawar dating from 1959 .
The contour map looks like it is the base map used by Croft and has a better scale bar .
Measuring four easily identifiable dimensions on this map gave the exact same lengths as Croft ’s map indicating that the scale bars on these two maps are compatible with each other – but both may be wrong .
Note that Arabian American Oil Company was the predecessor to Saudi Aramco .
The Linux 3D rendering of Ghawar ( hat tip Bob Shaw ) is believed to show areas of the reservoir that have been produced and are now water wet ( coloured yellow in Figure 5 ) versus those that have not been produced ( coloured blue ) .
This 3D image is not an official Aramco data release and was published ( by accident ? ) in an obscure source .
Furthermore , what this image shows is subject to conjecture .
The Linux image looks highly plausible from geological and engineering perspectives and it is possible to cross link observations from this image to other more reliable sources .
For example , the elongate tongue of oil in Uthmaniyah ( Figure 5 ) can be correlated with unswept oil zones in oil saturation profiles published in SPE papers and other sources ( Figure 8 ) .
Furthermore , zones of unswept oil correlate with zones that lack production wells ( Figure 6 ) , e.g .
The crests of Shedgum and S ‘ Ain Dar and the unswept tongue of Uthmaniyah .
My interpretation of the Linux super cluster image is that yellow areas are swept , and will have high water saturation .
With respect to primary and secondary ( water drive ) oil production , these areas are now essentially dead , though they may continue to produce oil with very high water cut for decades .
The blue areas I interpret to be essentially dry oil at top reservoir ( accept Ain Dar ) .
As we shall see in the story of the 10 ft oil column , top reservoir is the top of Zone 2 that is not the top of the Arab D ( see below ) .
Gas caps in N and S ‘ Ain Dar ( Figure 11 , hat tips to Stuart Staniford and Fractional_Flow ) means that gas replaces dry oil in the crest of these structures and this is taken into account in the reserves estimates .
Should this interpretation of the Linux Super cluster visualisation be incorrect then it will render as meaningless all estimates produced in this report .
SPE papers provide information on oil and water saturations in the vicinity of the water flood front .
This provides insight to recovery mechanism , controlling the flows of produced water and to recovery factor .

Ghawar was discovered in 1948 and production began in 1951 so the provenance of the 1940 vintage data is dubious and is presumed to denote pre-production data .
The 1980 profiles show a zone of low oil saturation along the base of the profile ( yellow colour ) which may reflect poor quality zone 3 reservoir .
The 2004 profiles show the east and west flanks are swept and that water is climbing over the east ridge leaving a tongue of dry oil in the saddle axis that corresponds with the tongue of oil observed in the Linux visualisation ( Figure 5 ) .
The preponderance of dark blue colours along the west flank in 2004 suggests a very high recovery factor in this area that translates to high recovery factors being used for Uthmaniyah in the reserves presented below .

These profiles are believed to lie just to the N of the small crest illustrated in Figure 5 of this SPE paper .
They are therefore believed to mount the ridge well below the crest area of N Ain Dar .
The 10 foot oil column
In the period March – April 2007 , there was much debate on TOD about the significance of water saturation profiles for N ‘ Ain Dar showing a single 10 ft layer of oil at the top of a predominantly water swept section ( Water Management in North ' Ain Dar , Saudi Arabia , SPE 93439 , March 2005 . , Figure 9 ) .
Many argued that these sections showed only 10 ft of oil remaining at the crest of the S ‘ Ain Dar structure .
The position I adopted was that these profiles were from the flanks of the structure and said nothing about the height of the oil column at the crest ( this conservative point of view did not receive much support ) .
Hat tip to F_F who dug up SPE paper 81567 ( Asphaltene Precipitation in High Gas - Oil Ratio Wells , SPE 81567 , June 2003 . ) showing gas caps at the crest of N and S ‘ Ain Dar . ( Figure 11 ) .
Transferring this data and that contained in SPE 81567 onto Croft ’s contoured map suggests that the secondary gas caps are in excess of 100 ft thick .
So much for the 10 ft oil layer and I hope this data lays this debate to rest once and for all .
Further to the above , SS has described via e.mail that the uppermost layer (s ) of the Arab D are a transitionl depositional facies between the limestone reservoir ( highly permeable ) and the overlying anhydrite ( calcium sulphate ) seal that has virtual zero permeability .
This transitional boundary layer ( about 10 ft thick ) has low permeability and porosity .
The buoyancy pressure produced by a 1300 ft + oil column has been sufficient to force oil into this boundary layer , but extreme poor reservoir quality means that this layer is by passed by the water flood front ( see Figures 10 ) .
So there is a default tendency for the uppermost 10 ft layer to remain oil saturated .
This is significant for the interpretation of the Linnux Supercluster 3D visualistaion .
My interpretation is that this shows top reservoir ( Top Zone 2 ) and not top Arab D – as the uppermost layer is non-reservoir .
Others may choose too interpret this differently .
The water / oil saturation profiles from Shedgum ( Figure 10 ) and Uthmaniyah ( Figure 8 ) are useful in providing an indication of oil column thickness .
However , I have tended to use these in conjunction with contour intervals on Croft ’s map to guide guesswork about oil column height .
Figure 10 .

The annotations illustrate water control strategies described in the text .

The profile is presumed to be from the flanks , and contouring the dry oil areas from the Linux map onto Croft ’s map would suggest a full oil reservoir still exists on the crest of Shedgum that in Figure 6 still had a small number of wells .
Modelling the geometry of mobile contacts is problematic and subject to uncertainty .
In the Base Case reserves model , oil column thickness is reduced by 20 % across the whole dry oil area to account for contact geometry along the flood front .
Water flood , secondary recovery , water handling strategies
The natural aquifer under Ghawar is not sufficiently active to provide pressure support to production .
Producing oil , therefore , causes the reservoir pressure to drop .
In the early 1960s , a program of peripheral water injection was initiated to maintain reservoir pressure above bubble point – the pressure at which solution gas comes out of the oil which has negative impact upon reservoir productivity .
The distribution of peripheral water injection wells is shown in Figure 6 and the movement of the mobile oil water contact resulting from oil production is illustrated for Shedgum in Figure 10 .
We have had some debate about the dynamics of flow in this reservoir .
Some have argued for a purely gravity driven system – water floating on oil with vertical movement of the flood front .
However , the Arab D reservoir is layered ( it is not a uniform tank ) and contains low permeability horizons that inhibit vertical flow ( Figure 4 ) .
These impermeable baffles may be kilometres across but lack the extent and geometry to form actual seals within the reservoir .
Furthermore , production pressure gradients tend to be horizontal with higher pressure around the periphery related to water injection draining laterally towards the low - pressure sinks associated with producing wells .
Layering , and pressure gradients therefore in my opinion give rise to a strong lateral flow component .
The effect of layering on channelling flow can bee seen in Figure 10 where step changes in oil saturation occur across some but not all layer boundaries .
These step changes are associated with high water saturation layers down dip .
The flood front is neither horizontal ( gravity driven ) nor vertical ( piston layer driven ) but has a shape consistent with a dynamic equilibrium between these two processes .
Figure 10 , will show only a tiny segment of the Shedgum reservoir .
You can imagine that a few years ago the whole section would be coloured red and in a few years time it will be coloured green and blue .
As the flood front passes through a vertical production well , it will start to produce water from the base of the well .
As water begins to replace oil throughout the oil column ( fractional flow ) the water cut increases due to increasing ingress of swept reservoir at the base and progressively higher water cuts above the mobile flood front .
Eventually , as the flood front passes through , the water cut will get too high and the well may be retired or abandoned altogether .
Handling water production on Ghawar is one of the greatest challenges facing Aramco today .
Various strategies have been deployed to manage water cut .
In the early years , they could simply go and drill new wells in dry areas and balance wet area with dry area production .
In more recent years , they have deployed two strategies in the wet areas to reduce water cut in wet area production .
One has been to set cement plugs in the well to cut off water production from the base ( Figure 10 ) .
The other has been to drill short radius horizontal wells at the top to increase the well contact area with dry oil ( Figure 10 , Water Management in North ' Ain Dar , Saudi Arabia , SPE 93439 , March 2005 . ) .
Both of these are temporary measures because once the flood front passes through , the well will be “ totally watered out ” .
When this happens , it is time to drive a few miles up the road and drill new wells in dry areas .
As the areas of dry production shrink in Northern Ghawar , the ability to maintain water cut at the target 40 % will become increasingly difficult – and this may be significant in determining oil flow rates in the immediate future .
High contact area horizontal wells will be deployed to counter this problem – but this represents the final roll of the dice in Northern Ghawar .
Figure 11 .
N and S Ain Dar have secondary gas caps formed as a result of gas injection aimed at improving reservoir sweep .
The presence of gas caps gives rise to a complex geometry for the remaining oil reservoir in these areas ( Figure 14 ) .
Westexas has on very many occasions mentioned on these pages thinning oil columns sandwiched between oil - water and gas - oil contacts .
In N and S ‘ Ain Dar this is indeed the case .
These thin ( 50 to 200 ft thick ? ) oil horizons will lend themselves ideally to production via multi-lateral horizontal wells in a manner analogous to that used in the W Troll Field , Norway ( see Figure 3 ) .
At the time SPE 93439 was written , only one such well had been drilled on N ‘ Ain Dar and Aramco said they were planning to drill more .
This will be the last roll of the dice for dry oil production in the Ain Dar area .

Methodology
The Arab D and net reservoir
The Arab D section shown in Figure 4 has a gross thickness of around 250 ft ( Uthmaniyah ) for Zones 2 and 3 combined .
The average net reservoir thickness for Uthmaniyah given by Croft is 180 feet .
The net reservoir only includes producible beds and the cut off between producible and non-productive layers can be somewhat arbitrary .
Figure 4 shows that the best quality reservoir is Zone 2 and the 180 feet of pay in Figure 4 is most likely distributed as 150 feet in Zone 2 ( near 100 % pay ) and 30 feet distributed throughout Zone 3 .
Zones 2 and 3 have very different reservoir qualities .
It is to be expected that Zone 2 should be uniformly swept and more efficiently swept than Zone 3 .
Zone 3 , on the other hand should experience uneven sweep owing to inter - bedded good and poor quality reservoir .
The saturation profiles for N Ain Dar ( Figure 9 ) and Shedgum ( Figure 10 ) do not display the variability expected if these represented full Zone 2 + 3 sections and it is considered more likely that they portray Zone 2 only , which is expected to have a uniform sweep .
The saturation profiles for Uthmaniyah ( Figure 8 ) exhibit more heterogeneity , and in particular , the 2004 , W flank section appears less well swept in the lower half , suggesting these profiles may represent the full Zone 2 and 3 interval .
In summary , the net reservoir figures from Croft are interpreted to represent producible beds from Zones 2 and 3 with the producible beds concentrated in Zone 2 .
One of my reviewers pointed out that with the advent of horizontal drilling over the last 25 years , many companies view of net pay has become more generous .
This is because horizontal wells allow greater recovery from poor permeability rock .
It is possible , therefore , that horizontal wells may allow greater recovery from Zone 3 than assumed at the time Croft ’s figures were compiled .
This will be booked as one possible source of underestimation in my reserves figures .
Scaling factors
All the volumetric calculations presented here hinge on the accuracy of Croft ’s map and the scale bar on that map which is best described as a bit scrappy .
Measuring the length of Ghawar from the tip of Fazran to the toe of Haradh yields a length of 164 miles using Croft ’s scale bar .
However , in his text Croft says that Ghawar is 174 miles long and this raises concern about the reliability of that scale bar .
SS sourced a second map produced by “ Arabian American Oil Company Staff ” ( Fig 7 ) that had a better scale bar attached and measuring 4 easily identifiable dimensions on this map yielded the exact same dimensions as Croft .
It would seem that the “ Arabian American Oil Company Staff ” map was probably the base map used by Croft , so this agreement is not surprising .
What it does show is that the scale bars on these two maps are compatible with each other – but they may both be wrong .
A second contoured map came to light from a confidential industry report .
On this map , Ghawar is 181 miles long and is proportionally wider in the north relative to Croft .
This map therefore has a significantly larger surface area than Croft ’s map – very approximately 24 % larger area .
This would clearly have a significant impact upon volumetric calculations .
The Ghawar wells map ( Figure 6 ) showing the distribution of oil production and water injection wells was overlaid on both of these maps .
This provides a good fit with the Croft map , the injectors fit snugly around the map outline in Haradh , Hawiyah , Uthmaniyah and N Ain Dar ( Figure 12 ) .
The fit is less good to the east of Shedgum and to the west of South Ain Dar and in the large saddle area between Ain Dar , Shedgum and Uthmaniyah .
The fit of the injector well profile to the confidential map was good in Uthmaniyah and Hawiyah but it was not good in the north with most injector wells lying inside the structure outline .
Figure 12 .
Wells map ( Figure 6 ) overlaid upon Croft ’s map ( Figure 16 ) .
The wells map had to be rotated anti-clockwise and rescaled ( constant x-y axes scaling ) to produce the fit of water injectors around the peripheral contour on Crofts map believed to be the oil water contact .
The fit is excellent around Haradh , Uthmaniyah , N Ain Dar and the northern rim of Shedgum .
The fit is not so good down the W margin of S Ain Dar and the E margin of Shedgum or in the large saddle area suggesting that Croft ’s map may be a bit narrow across S Ain Dar – Shedgum .
Working in 2D
The main uncertainty working in 2D arises from what are known as edge wedge effects .
Where the reservoir plunges through the OWC working with 3D cubes breaks down as shown in Figure 13 .
On Ghawar , these edge wedge effects are estimated to penetrate about 1.1 miles from the edge of the structure ( 300 ft thick Arab D section , 2.8 degrees dip ) and this will result in overestimation of reserves working in 2D .
In the Arab D reservoir the upper Zone 2 has superior reservoir quality to the underlying Zone 3 ( Figure 4 ) and as illustrated in Figure 13 , the overestimation resulting from the edge wedge is mainly the poorer quality Zone 3 reservoir .
Very roughly the edge wedge comprises 25 % Zone 2 and 75 % Zone 3 .
This will significantly reduce errors arising from ignoring the edge wedges where this has been done in calculating initial reserves and the remaining reserves in South Ghawar .
In the Base Case scenario , edge wedge effects , and contact dip effects have been accounted for by reducing column height by 20 % in Ain Dar and Shedgum .
In Uthmaniyah , owing to the unpredictability of the underlying shape of that tongue of oil , oil layer heights have been reduced by 33 % in both Base and High Cases to account for this and for edge wedges .
Figure 13 .
Diagram illustrating errors arising from edge wedge effects at the OWC whilst working in 2D .
The area counted will tend to overestimate reserves .
However , in the Arab D reservoir , good quality productive horizons are concentrated in the top half of the reservoir and this tends to reduce errors arising from edge wedges as illustrated .
Secondary gas caps in N and S ‘ Ain Dar
The presence of secondary gas caps in N and S ‘ Ain Dar has a significant impact upon the volume of reservoir that is now occupied by oil .
These gas caps have formed as a result of re-injection of produced gas .
This is an efficient way of displacing oil and is a commonly used secondary recovery mechanism .
Figure 14 illustrates how the gas caps and volume of underlying oil rim has been modelled in North and South Ain Dar .
This exercise is subject to large uncertainties .
200 ft thick gas caps have been assumed leaving a complex oil volume geometry as illustrated in Figure 14 .
Modelling this as cubes will tend to underestimate oil remaining oil volumes .
Note that thin oil layers below gas in N and S ‘ Ain Dar occur in poorer quality Zone 3 reservoir and present ideal drilling targets for high contact area horizontal wells .
Note also , that the model for S ‘ Ain Dar actually shows gas on water at the south end of the closure ( Figure 16 ) – indicating how close we may be to the final stages of primary oil production in this area .
Figure 14 .
Diagram illustrating errors arising from measuring oil rims below the gas caps of N and S Ain Dar .
In these structures , the area of gas has been deducted form the area of oil and a “ cuboid ” volume of oil determined on that basis .
In reality , the oil volume has complex geometry with larger volume than the cuboid .
Recovery factor
The recovery factor is the percentage of the initial oil in place that may be recovered .
Recovery factors have been estimated from the published water saturation sections for N ‘ Ain Dar , Shedgum and Uthmaniyah ( Figures , 8 , 9 and 10 ) .
The procedure followed is to estimate the initial oil saturation ( Soi ) and the minimum final residual oil saturation ( Sor ) .
Note that water saturation Sw = 1 – So .
This allows a value to be calculated for the mobile oil that is recovered .
The recovery factor then equals Soi-Sor / Soi. ( Figure 15 ) .
This provides an estimate for optimum recovery in the most efficiently swept zones , and not all zones will be swept by this optimum efficiency .
Thus the recovery factor is multiplied by an efficiency factor .
In the base case scenario a sweep efficiency of 80 % has been assumed whilst for the high case a sweep efficiency of 95 % has been assumed .
Figure 15 .
Diagram illustrating how recovery factors have been estimated .
The recovery factor = mobile oil / initial oil * a sweep efficiency factor .
Mobile oil = the residual water saturation ( Swr ) minus the initial water saturation ( Swi ) .
Minimum Swi and maximum
Swr have been estimated from the saturation profiles in N Ain Dar , Shedgum and Uthmaniyah ( Figures 8 , 9 and 10 ) .
This provides a picture of optimum recovery that will not likely be achieved throughout the whole reservoir owing to uneven sweep .
The base case model uses a sweep efficiency factor of 0.8 and the high case model a sweep efficiency factor of 0.95 .
Reserves Calculation
The following methodology was used to obtain a Base Case and High Case for the remaining recoverable oil reserves in Ghawar .
The Base Case is based on what are considered to be conservative assumptions .
The High Case is based on more optimistic assumptions that are more closely aligned with Aramco ’s input data .
Step 1
The oil saturation data on the Linux visualisation was transferred by hand onto the 2D Greg Croft map ( Figure 16 ) .
No bias between base case and high case .
Step 2
The total areas of N ‘ Ain Dar , S ‘ Ain Dar , Shedgum , Uthmaniyah , Hawiyah and Haradh were measured by counting squares on a square mile grid overlaid on the map .
The process was repeated for the unswept areas ( Figure 16 ) .
No bias between base case and high case .
The total map area determined in this way is 1625 square miles .
Stuart S has made the same measurement using computer code and got 1663 square miles .
This is considered to be extremely good agreement .
Step 3
Oil rock volumes were determined for initial and remaining reserves .
The details are on the spreadsheet .
In short , the main difference between high and base cases is that thinner oil layers have been used in the latter , especially in N and S ‘ Ain Dar and Shedgum .
Step 4
Oil rock volumes calculated in cubic feet are converted to barrels by dividing by 5.615 .
Step 5
Hydrocarbon pore volumes are calculated using the average porosity data for each area provided by Greg Croft ( no bias between high and base case ) and oil saturation data .
Initial oil saturation data has been estimated from the published saturation profiles for the North .
In the south , with the absence of independent data , the 89 % So values from Croft have been used .
These seem appropriately lower for the poorer reservoir quality in the southern area .
The initial oil saturations used are as follows ( no bias between high and low case ) :
N Ain Dar 95 %
S Ain Dar 95 %
Shedgum 95 %
Uthmaniyah 96 %
Hawiyah 89 %
Haradh 89 %
Step 6
Dividing the hydrocarbon pore volume by the formation volume factor yields stock tank barrels in place ( STOIP ) .
Note that the volume of oil shrinks under surface conditions owing to degassing and cooling .
No bias between high and base cases .
Step 7
Recoverable reserves are determined by multiplying STOIP by a recovery factor ( see above ) .
In the North , recovery factors are based on the published saturation profiles using methodology described above ( Figure 15 ) .
In Haradh , High Case recovery factor is calculated using 900,000 bpd for 30 years as a percentage of STOIP yielding 53 % .
This factor is then applied to Hawiyah .
The Base Case recovery factor in the south has been assumed to be 45 % .
In summary , the net recovery factors are as follows :
Base Case High Case N Ain Dar 59 % 70 % S Ain Dar 59 % 70 % Shedgum 54 % 64 % Uthmaniyah 67 % 80 % Hawiyah 45 % 53 % Haradh 45 % 53 %
The recovery factors calculated for Uthmaniyah are very high .
The saturation profiles ( Figure 8 ) suggest very high recovery and in the absence of other evidence this has been accepted at face value .
Note that a sweep efficiency of 95 % is assumed for the High Case and 80 % is assumed for the Base Case .
The main differences between high and base cases are :
Base Case High Case
Oil coulmn thickness reduced in north full reservoir ( accept Uthmaniyah )
Recovery factor lower higher

Sexual infidelity is widely regarded as one of the most dishonorable assaults against the sanctity of an intimate relationship .
Yet , we all seem to be mesmerized by it .
Infidelity makes a love story more intense , a song or poem more passionately tragic , and forms the foundation for which the immensely popular celebrity gossip industry firmly holds the attention of millions worldwide .
If infidelity is so appalling , then why are we all so consumed with the notions of the act ?
At some point in time everyone involved in an exclusive relationship experiences a momentary thought of infidelity .
It ’s the flirtatious glimmer in your eye that indicates a brief superficial curiosity for someone of the opposite sex , the simple act of wondering .
For that split second your values misalign , placing shallow emotion ahead of your true moral character .
This momentary shift is a direct reflection of your instinctual emotion splitting away from your moral values .
When your sound moral values and your fickle emotion are disconnected , your mind is divided and thus your judgment is muddled .
Most people ’s acts of infidelity are innocent , left hanging to expire in brief , insignificant moments of thought .
It is the strength of our character that realigns this momentary disconnect and prevents innocent thought from transgressing into an act of infidelity .
Reliability , honesty , and trustworthiness can be directly measured by one ’s strength of character .
When the act of infidelity occurs , it has nothing to do with love ; it is solely related to the shameful weakness of one ’s character … weakness that is driven by senseless emotion .
People whom have never actually taken part in the act of infidelity would probably also deny the allegation of ever experiencing a momentary thought of infidelity .
This can be attributed to the fact that the thought never actually enters the conscious mind , but instead lingers in our subconscious .
The thought process is a natural instinct , and although we may be oblivious to it , our minds are instinctually aware of it .
It ’s the combination of this subconscious awareness and our general human curiosity that will continue to foster the mass market interest and popularity of infidelity .
I ’ll wrap it up with a quote from one of my favorite artists :
Already this year researchers have announced the discovery of a bunch of new species : 6 types of bats , 15 soft corals , thousands of mollusks and 20 sharks and rays , to name a few .
If a report issued in 2006 by the Census of Marine Life — conducted by more than 2,000 scientists in 80 countries — is any indicator , we will see a bumper crop of new animals in the years ahead , too .
These discoveries , from the Hortle 's whipray to the Bali catshark , are partly the fruits of new technology like DNA bar coding , which allows scientists to use genetic differences to tell one species from another .
But that is n't the only reason : Evolution actually speeds up in the tropics , research has found , and global warming is making it happen that much faster .
The planet is heating up at a very rapid rate ; by the year 2100 , scientists predict an increase of anywhere from 2 to 12 degrees .
This is not the first time earth has gone through a warming phase , however .
About 50 million years ago — 10 million years after the dinosaur 's demise — the planet went through a period called the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum in which temperatures rose 12 degrees in 10,000 years .
That increase changed rainfall patterns and ocean acidity , causing a massive species extinction .
But many species survived and evolved into their modern descendants .
Right now might mark the very beginning of a similar period of every - species - for - itself , as plants and animals adapt to climate change with striking quickness .
The advantage in this evolutionary race goes to warm - weather animals , who are taking territory and precious food sources from their cool - weather cousins .
" Species that typically would be restricted to the tropics or subtropics are increasingly found north of where they were , " says evolutionary biologist Stephen Palumbi of Stanford University , author of The Evolution Explosion .
Swordfish traditionally seen in the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean have been spotted off the coast of Norway ; shallow - water squid that normally call California waters home have been found as far north as Alaska .
As these and other species commandeer space and resources , they bring with them their arsenal of DNA , so that their descendants will be even better biologically suited for warmer conditions .
Evolutionary biologist Shane Wright of the University of Auckland , New Zealand , has shown that species evolve more than twice as fast in tropical zones as in temperate areas .
As squid encounter warmer weather , for example , their bodily functions speed up and they reproduce more often , says Wright .
As their population explodes , so does their genetic diversity .
This , in turn , means more chances for genetic mutations to show up in subsequent generations , specializing creatures to certain waters .
Eventually they become so unique that they 're different species altogether .
In the past , it 's taken millions of years for an organism to evolve the genetic differences necessary to be considered a separate species .
( The general distinction for a new species is that it cannot , or will not , breed with its parent species . )
But lately there has been evidence that plants and animals are changing much faster than that .
Take the weed field mustard .
After just seven generations around California 's global warming - related droughts , the mustard flowers earlier than normal , says evolutionary biologist Art Weis of University of California , Irvine .
Plants like the resilient field mustard , " may be put in a superior position , " in a warming environment , he says .
" Some exotic species that now are not quite invasive could be pushed over that threshold to become invasive simply because they 're able to keep up with the climate . "
Invasive plants and animals can destroy an entire ecosystem , however , and many of the most adaptable animals — rats , cockroaches , jellyfish , mosquitoes — are not necessarily the most desirable neighbors .
Weedy field mustard will outlast maple trees .
Canadian squirrels , breeding sooner because of early springs , will outlast New Hampshire loons that neglected winter migration this year when lakes did n't freeze as normal .
Still , nature is nothing if not an innovator , and an explosion of invasive species has beneficial repercussions for some animals .
The temperature spike 50 million years ago created an insect boom , and as insects diversified and thrived , bats did the same .
This is when many bat species evolved their unique aviation and sonar abilities to locate specific kinds of insects .
Of course , even the best chef can only handle so much heat in the kitchen .
Tropical animals will do well , but only to a certain point .
Corals need warm water to thrive , for example , but when the heat gets so high that the ocean begins to acidify — as it did during the last period of climate change — they too begin to die .
As Wright puts it , " There can be too much of a good thing . "

I previously wrote about rules I thought contractors should follow in order to have a happy life .
Of course , contractors themselves are only part of the equation .
Everybody else has their part to play .
This post contains suggestion for people currently employing or planning to employ contractors .
The rules covered below are based on my experiences in a range of workplaces ; some handled contractors very well ( and are used as positive examples ) and some failed badly ( and provided the negative examples ) .
First and foremost , make sure you actually need contractors .
Ideally your project planning will be well thought out enough to see staff and skill shortages coming .
When you identify such a gap , consider a range of options to fill it .
Would it be covered by providing additional training to existing staff ( and so boost your long - term advantage ) ?
Is the need an ongoing one and so needs a permanent solution ?
Can the need be covered by some reshuffling of existing staff and / or project schedules ?
In other words , do n’t just wake up one day and go “ Oh god , we ’re shorthanded .
I ’d better hire some contractors . ”
Do everyone a favour and go out and read “ The Mythical Man Month . ”
This may sound a bit counter - intuitive , a contractor saying do n’t rush to hire contractors , but I ’m saying it for a number of reasons .
Mainly I ’m saying it because being hired onto a project as an act of desperation means I ’m going to be dumped in a pile of crap .
I like to think I ’m good but I can’t work miracles .
Plus , it tends to piss off existing staff if contractors are brought in as “ saviours ” before they are given the proper opportunities to deal with the situation themselves .
And rightly so .
Also , I know I can say this without affecting my future job prospects because I can safely say not enough employers are going to listen to change to change anything .
I ’m sounding cynical ( hard for any of my regular readers to believe , I know ) but I ’ve been doing this sort of work for around 15 years ( 10 as a contractor ) and I ’m yet to see any significant improvements in management practices .
And speaking of pissing off staff , another time when you really should n’t hire contractors is when the disparity in pay between the contractor and your permanent staff is too high .
If you ca n’t get a contractor without paying them double what corresponding permanent staff get , then you should be paying your permanent staff more .
I covered this issue in more detail in my previous post but in short , avoid increasing the pay - based antagonism between contract and permanent staff .
Short term , I am thinking of my own interests – I do n’t like working in negative , resentful environments .
Long term , it serves any company to have a stable , satisfied workforce .
The simple act of not hiring people who seem to swoop in , scoop up piles of cash and then fly out can really help the job satisfaction of permanent staff .
There are always the exceptions to the rule , the super - consultants whose knowledge is so deep and / or specialised that they can command over a grand a day in any job market .
This is n’t me but I ’ve heard these creatures are not totally mythical .
But bear in mind this sort of pay disparity is rarely justified .
If you find yourself in this situation you ’re either not paying your permanent staff enough or you ’re paying the contractor too much .
Most likely compounded by very poor resource planning on your part .
But let ’s think positive , when are the right times to hire a contractor ?
The obvious times to hire a contractor are when there is a skill or experience gap in your team that you ca n’t fill internally or when you simply need some extra hands for a set period of time .
Notice I said a set period of time .
It ’s a common mistake to say “ we ’re overwhelmed so we needs some contractors ” without thinking it through .
The one sentence summary of the book I mentioned before , The Mythical Man Month , is that you ca n’t make a project go faster simply by throwing more people at it – the management and communication overhead for larger groups ( among other things ) counters the benefit of having extra people on board .
And for the sake of everyone involved , make knowledge / skills transfer part of the planned engagement for the contractor .
It benefits the business overall by increasing the skill set permanently available , it benefits permanent employees by helping them develop new skills ( and almost everybody in IT wants to increase their skill set ) and , speaking personally , it can help make the contractor feel involved with the workplace .
Set this sort of goal at the interview stage and if you discover a potential contractor who resists the idea , this is a very good reason to not hire them .
Any contractor insecure enough to try to hold on to “ secret knowledge ” probably is n’t all that good anyway .
Another important rule for employers dealing with contractors : if the contractor has been hired through an agency you DO NOT discuss pay rates with the contractor .
EVER .
You discuss work issues with the contractor .
You discuss contract issues ( including rates ) with the agency .
The agency discusses contract issues with the contractor .
It ’s like the separation of church and state .
Except more important .
And do n’t ever say anything along the lines of “ is n’t that why you get paid so much ” to a contractor .
Not even in passing , not even as a joke .
The rate was set when the contract was signed and should n’t be discussed again unless the contract is up for renewal .
Plus , it hurts .
Most of the time , most contractors will let it go but they should n’t have to .
Any discussion about performance etc. should focus on professional expectations .
Talking about money is unprofessional and is almost certain to damage the working relationship , however slightly .
There are a thousand legitimate things that can strain a working relationship without introducing unnecessary crap like this .
It ’s only human for an employer to expect more from a contractor than from an equivalent permanent employee .
But set these expectations at the interview stage and confirm them in writing with the contract .
Do n’t add things in after the fact and keep piling the contractor with more and more work “ because they ’re paid for it . ”
It ’s unprofessional and nine times out of ten it will result in a worse performance from the contractor , not a better one .
A final word of advice , do n’t be scared to ask the contractor for input on what they should be doing .
No matter how unique a situation seems to you , most contractors will have seen something very similar before .
You ’re hiring this person as an expert or at least for their additional experience and expertise .
Use that wisely .

Flu viruses are constantly evolving
US scientists have found the 1918 virus shares genetic mutations with the bird flu virus now circulating in Asia .
Writing in Nature , they say their work underlines the threat the current strain poses to humans worldwide .
A second paper in Science reveals another US team has successfully recreated the 1918 virus in mice .
We are revealing some of the secrets that will help us predict and prepare for the next pandemic
Julie Gerberding
Seventh Indonesian bird flu death
The virus is contained at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under stringent safety conditions .
It is hoped to carry out experiments to further understand the biological properties that made the virus so virulent .
The virus was recreated from data produced by painstaking research by a team from the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology .
Lung tissue samples
Working on virus samples from the remains of victims of the 1918 pandemic , the researchers were able to piece together the entire genetic sequence of the virus .
They found the virus contained elements that were new to humans of the time - making it highly virulent .
And analysis of the final three pieces of the virus ' genetic code has revealed mutations that have striking similarities to those found in flu viruses found only in birds , such as the H5N1 strain currently found in south east Asia .
This strain has so far killed at least 65 people .
Many experts believe it is only a matter of time before H5N1 , or a similar strain , causes many deaths in humans - possibly after combining with a human flu strain .
Crucially , the mutations identified by the US researchers were found in genes which control the virus ' ability to replicate in host cells .
The researchers say these mutations may have helped the 1918 virus replicate more efficiently .
At this stage , they say the H5N1 strain shares only some , and not all , of these mutations .
Increased virulence
But these mutations may be enough to increase the virus ' virulence - and give it the potential to cause serious human infection without first combining with a known human flu strain .
The researchers believe the two other major flu pandemics of the 20th century - in 1957 and 1968 - were caused by human flu viruses which acquired two or three key genes from bird flu virus strains .
But they believe the 1918 strain was probably entirely a bird flu virus that adapted to function in humans .
Julie Gerberding , director of the US Centers for Disease Control , said : " By unmasking the 1918 virus we are revealing some of the secrets that will help us predict and prepare for the next pandemic . "
And Dr Jeffery Taubenberger , lead researcher of the Nature study , said : " Determining whether pandemic influenza virus strains can emerge via different pathways will affect the scope and focus of surveillance and prevention efforts . "
Warning
Professor John Oxford , an expert in virology at Queen Mary College , London , said the suggestion that the virus had the potential to jump between humans without first combining with a human virus made it even more of a threat .
" This study gives us an extra warning that H5N1 needs to be taken even more seriously than it has been up to now , " he said .
Dr Terrence Tumpey , of the US CDC , defended the decision to recreate the 1918 flu virus .
He said : " We felt we had to recreate the virus and run these experiments to understand the biological properties that made the 1918 virus so exceptionally deadly .
" We wanted to identify the specific genes responsible for its virulence , with the hope of designing antivirals or other interventions that would work against virulent pandemic or epidemic influenza viruses . "
Mouse wheel programming in JavaScript
Quick links : source · test page · long test page ( with scrollbars ) · compatibility
Though many people still find this page useful , there have been some changes in the browsers since last update of this page , and I generally consider some information here to be outdated .
However , I suggest using MooTools or other general Javascript frameworks that provide portable and maintainable basis for writing Javascript code .
Web applications are becoming more and more like “ normal ” desktop applications .
Of course , they are more and more functional , but smooth user interface acts the primary role .
So we have drag and drop , autocompletition , and much more .
Many of those nice features got possible only with help of AJAX .
This page , however , is not about AJAX ( or any other buzzword ) .
It is about rather simple user input method -- mouse wheel .
I believe it would now be difficult to find a mouse without wheel .
Vast majority of users are used to the wheel as a control for scrolling in lists , zooming etc .
Rather few web applications , however , make smart use of mouse wheel .
This page is to provide you with general information about handling mouse wheel - generated events in JavaScript programming language .
Annotated code
Below is annotated javascript code , which should explain the magic behind mouse wheel generated events .
There is also plain version for copy and paste .
/**
This is high - level function .
*
It must react to delta being more / less than zero . */ function handle ( delta ) { if ( delta < 0 ) … ; else … ; } /**
Event handler for mouse wheel event .
*/ function wheel ( event ) { var delta = 0 ; if (! event ) /* For IE . */ event = window .
event ; if ( event .wheelDelta ) { /* IE / Opera . */ delta = event .
wheelDelta/120 ; } else if ( event .detail ) { /** Mozilla case .
*/ /**
In Mozilla , sign of delta is different than in IE .
* Also , delta is multiple of 3 . */ delta = - event .detail/3 ; } /**
If delta is nonzero , handle it .
* Basically , delta is now positive if wheel was scrolled up , * and negative , if wheel was scrolled down .
*/ if ( delta ) handle ( delta ) ; /**
Prevent default actions caused by mouse wheel .
*
That might be ugly , but we handle scrolls somehow * anyway , so do n't bother here .. */ if ( event.preventDefault ) event.preventDefault( ) ; event.returnValue = false ; } /** Initialization code . *
If you use your own event management code , change it as required .
*/ if ( window .addEventListener ) /** DOMMouseScroll is for mozilla . */ window .addEventListener ( ' DOMMouseScroll ' , wheel , false ) ; /** IE / Opera . */ window .onmousewheel = document .onmousewheel = wheel ;
Handler function
In the code above , there is “ handle ” function which is , of course , meant to be written by you .
As you have noticed , it takes on parameter , delta .
It is called so , because mouse wheel has no absolute system , and we only capture scrolling deltas , that is wheel angle changes .
Practically , you only have to watch for positive and negative values of delta .
These cases are pictured on the left .
If delta is positive , wheel was scrolled up .
Otherwise , it was scrolled down .
Note that in applications , scrolling up usually means page is scrolled down etc .
You might wonder , what will the actual values of delta be .
In fact , the code above is adjusted in such a way that you should get - 1 or +1 in 99 % of all cases .
Though , for instance , I have seen ±3 in Firefox if you scroll very fast .
Someone in Digg reported delta of 14 , and Geoffrey Kruse was able to get 76 on his Powerbook trackpad . :-)
Of course , that depends on sensivity that you 've set for your mouse .
There is also subtlety in Firefox ( at least ) : if you start scrolling the wheel fast and then push the right mouse button for the menu , large value of delta is reported , e.g. 30 .
Robert Gerlach writes about his experience on Safari , MacOS X : “ For a single turn its +- 0.1 , if you roll it faster , the values become bigger .
This is because of Mac OS ' mouse / wheel - acceleration .
You move / turn it one time , it moves / scrolls 1 pixel .
Then you move / turn it three times fast and it moves / turns 30 pixel ”
He also writes about Camino , which is based on Gecko , the same engine that Firefox uses : “ much like Safari ( +- 0.3 to +- Infinity ) , which astonishes me , since it is based on the same engine as Firefox , which only shows +- 2.666666 despite the speed . ”
You are also welcome to see test page and also long test page , i.e. with scrollbars – that shows how preventing default behaviour works .
Compatability
I have written first version of this code in January 2006 .
Back then , Firefox and Internet Explorer 6 were only supported browsers .
Older Internet Explorer version do not work .
Thanks to Kane Barton for reporting that this works since Firefox 1.0.7 ( so possibly since 1.0 ) .
I would like to thank Jean - Luc Milot for contributing notes on how to make the code work properly in Opera 9 .
That version of Opera is relatively new ( as of July 2006 ) ; previous versions of Opera do not support mouse wheel .
I am also grateful to Юрій Чайковський ( Yurij Chaikovsky ) for pointing out that in newer versions of Opera ( at least from 9.20 and up ) you no longer have to invert the sign of delta .
So the behaviour is the same as in Internet Explorer .
I am a bit worried about compatability with older versions of Opera ( though Opera forcibly recommends its users to update once new version is out ) but after some time passes I will remove the conditional code that was written specifically for Opera .
Also thanks to Andrew Shearer , Dorian and Geoffrey Kruse for pointing out that the code works in Safari .
Andrew mentions version 2.0.4 , but I am not sure about earlier versions .
Markus Rothenbacher wrote me telling that Konqueror ( at least till version 3.5.4 ) does not have support for mouse wheel .
Daniel Davis from Developer relations team at Opera contacted me in September 2011 to inform me that it is no longer needed to invert the delta values on recent Opera versions .
While I am not very committed to updating this page , I 've gladly agreed to update the code snippet and remove the offending lines .
Preventing default behaviour code comes from phpspot.org and Johan Sundström .
You can see how their code works in long test page ( i.e. with scrollbars ) .
Still , it works in IE / Firefox .
It should also work in Opera since version 9.02 .
( Thanks to Jarkko Rantavuori for pointing this out . )
It is useful to note , however , that Opera , Safari and Firefox include automated upgrade systems that prompt users to upgrade to newer versions of the browser once it gets released , so you can be prepared to the fact that more and more internet users will have browsers for which this mouse wheel code works .
Mouse wheel currently works on : ( with earliest version known to work )
Internet Explorer 6
Firefox 1.0
Opera 9 .
Safari .
Unsupported browsers : ( no existing version supports mouse wheel )
Konqueror
OmniWeb
iCab
Usability
( Few “ do n't ”s . )
Do n't make wheel act unexpectedly .
Users know that wheel scrolls the list of files .
If there is list of files in your web application , use it .
Some map programs use wheel for zooming ( and so does Google Maps ) .
So use it .
Do n't force users to depend on having wheel working .
Just as it is bad practice to rely on JavaScript .
Try to get rid of global scrollbars , because mixing them with this code might cause frustration to the users .
Real world examples
If you know more practical and interesting examples , please mail me a link .
Google Maps uses mouse wheel for zooming in and out .
ACME Mapper combines more data sources than original Google Maps .

House Intelligence Committee to probe phone companies cooperation with NSA wiretapping Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email This The House Intelligence Committee has announced that it will investigate the cooperation of telephone companies with the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping activities .
" One of [ Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell 's ] proposals is to grant immunity to individuals who and companies that facilitated electronic surveillance activities that were part of the NSA surveillance program disclosed by the President in December 2005 , " said Rep. Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) , Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in a press release sent to RAW STORY .
" Before granting immunity for any activities , it will be important to review what those activities were , what was the legal basis for those activities , and what would be the impact of a grant of immunity . "
A number of lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies for their alleged cooperation with the NSA 's domestic eavesdropping program .
The lawsuit filed by the Electronic Freedom Foundation against AT&T exemplifies the kind of cases that the Director of National Intelligence is seeking to keep out of court .
" EFF 's lawsuit alleges that AT&T has given the NSA unchecked backdoor access to its communications network and its record databases .
On behalf of a nationwide class of AT&T customers , EFF is suing to stop this illegal conduct and hold AT&T responsible for violating the law and the fundamental freedoms of the American public , " said a release at the privacy group 's website .
Two New Jersey - based attorneys also sued Verizon on a similar basis in 2006 .
EFF noted at their website that attempts to seek immunity had already been rejected in the federal court system .
" AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal , " Federal District Judge Vaughn Walker wrote .
Reyes announcement of hearings on the NSA 's spying programs was released in response to an op - ed written by McConnell in the Washington Post on Monday in which he described the need to ' modernize ' the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" Technology and threats have changed , but [ FISA ] remains essentially the same .
If we are to improve our ability to protect the country by gathering foreign intelligence , this law must be updated to reflect changes in technology and the ways our adversaries communicate with one another , " he wrote .
While McConnell has called for immunizing the telecommunications companies in other settings , he did not do so in the Monday op - ed .
Critics of the Intelligence Community 's domestic spying program have assailed the op-ed for being unnecessarily vague about the Director of National Intelligence 's plans .
" McConnell 's editorial also suspiciously declines to specify at all what changes the Administration wants , " wrote Ryan Singel at Wired 's ' Threat Level ' blog .
Reyes noted that he would call a variety of officials before the House Intelligence Committee , including Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , former Attorney General John Ashcroft , former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey , and other top Intelligence Community officials in addition to McConnell .
He added , " Certain hearings may have to occur in closed session , but a major hearing on legislative proposals - featuring Administration witnesses and outside experts - will occur in open session .
Changes to public laws should be debated in public . "
We all know the story by now .
Panicked by the consequences of dismissing the threat of international terrorism as hoohaw ginned up by the " Democrat CIA " , and disdainful of even the most fundamental human rights required by democracy , Bush and Cheney 's response to the attacks on 9/11/2001 was to " work the dark side . "
Kidnapping , torture , coercion , collective punishment , indefinite imprisonment , assassination -- nothing would be off the table .
Anyone who objected was marginalized ; many had their careers ruined ; many more were held up for public ridicule as cowards , traitors , " soft on terror " .
Before we begin let me just say it plainly : DIck Cheney is a madman and a tyrant .
Only a madman declares that a one - percent risk demands a preemptive 100 % response .
Only a tyrant declares himself to be above the law and beyond the reach of ethical limits .
There is no better example of Cheney 's tyrannical madness than the gulag at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba and no more damning departure from our founding traditions than the so - called legal system that has been created there .
Imagine : you are scooped up off the street by agents a foreign power , tortured , shipped thousands of miles from home , denied access to friends , family , anyone you 've ever known ; then , years later , you are dragged before a panel of foreign military offices who are there to determine your " status " and thereby decide whether you can be imprisoned for life with no hope of ever proving your innocence .
You are not allowed a lawyer but are given a " personal representative " who works for the same military that is trying you in the first place .
You are not permitted to see the evidence against you and you cannot call witnesses in your own defense .
Such was the nature of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals held for 558 prisoners at GITMO in 2004 and 2005 .
From the outside , these tribunals were mostly a mystery ; we have had little more than rosy official government pronouncements about their " fairness " to go on .
Until last Friday , that is .
First , from the AP wire :
An Army officer with a key role in the U.S. military hearings at Guantanamo Bay says they relied on vague and incomplete intelligence and were pressured to declare detainees " enemy combatants , " often without any specific evidence .
His affidavit , released Friday , is the first criticism by a member of the military panels that determine whether detainees will continue to be held .
Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham , a 26 - year veteran of military intelligence who is an Army reserve officer and a California lawyer , said military prosecutors were provided with only " generic " material that did n't hold up to the most basic legal challenges .
Despite repeated requests , intelligence agencies arbitrarily refused to provide specific information that could have helped either side in the tribunals , according to Abraham , who said he served as a main liaison between the Combat Status Review Tribunals and those intelligence agencies .
" What were purported to be specific statements of fact lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence , " Abraham said in the affidavit , filed in a Washington appeals court on behalf of a Kuwaiti detainee , Fawzi al - Odah , who is challenging his classification as an " enemy combatant . "
To summarize : a 26 - year veteran of Army intel , a man hand - picked to sit on one of the super - secret three - member panels and who acted as the middleman between those panels and the intelligence community just filed an affidavit in the DC Court on behalf of one of the prisoners .
Recall that 558 prisoners were brought before these tribunals .
The Washington Post reports that , of those , 520 were found to be " enemy combatants " who should continue to be held in Bush and Cheney 's legal limbo .
That 's a 93 percent .
Surely the government 's cases must have been bulletproof , right ?
According to Abraham , not so much :
In his affidavit , Abraham said there was considerable pressure from commanders for officers serving on the tribunals to determine that detainees were enemy fighters .
He also said that it was " well known " that those officers who concluded otherwise would have to explain their findings to McGarrah and his top aides .
He said he and two fellow panel members were closely questioned by McGarrah and his deputy after they decided that there was not enough evidence to conclude that a prisoner was an enemy fighter , and were then ordered to hold an expanded hearing to reconsider their conclusion .
The AP makes the same point this way :
Abraham was asked to serve on one of the panels , and he said its members felt strong pressure to find against the detainee , saying there was " intensive scrutiny " when they declared a prisoner not to be an enemy combatant .
When his panel decided the detainee was n't an " enemy combatant , " they were ordered to reconvene to hear more evidence , he said .
This is the same behavior we 've seen from this administration in many areas from the pre-Iraq
War intel to scientific reports about climate change : give them an answer they do n't like -- no matter how factual -- and they send you back to " look again " until you come back with the " right " answer .
Those who stick by what they know is right are marginalized , and those who go on to take their complaints to the public are smeared and degraded .
And that 's just what 's happening with Lt. Col.
Abraham .
First the marginalization :
Ultimately , [ Lt. Col. Abraham 's ] panel held its ground , and he was never asked to participate in another tribunal , he said .
Then the smear :
Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler , a Pentagon spokesman , said yesterday that the tribunal process is " fair , rigorous and robust . "
Two defense officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said Abraham does not have sufficient experience to give an authoritative account of the process , having served on just one review panel .
Nice bit of circular logic there , no ?
" We pushed him out for not playing ball so you should n't listen to him when he says he was pushed out for not playing ball . "
Travesty morphs into total absurdity when you connect this story to the recent findings that these tribunals may be moot in the first place since they declared those 550 souls " enemy combatants " when , per the god-awful Military Commissions Act , Cheney , Inc. 's legal limbo only applies " unlawful enemy combatants " .
Think about that for a minute : they went to all the trouble of creating a new classification of enemy for which the rule of law and the Geneva Conventions do n't apply , set up a star chamber to stick that made - up label on people they were already holding in prison , and then did n't even get the labels right in the finding from their little custom - made extra-legal courts .
Its Kafka meets the Three Stooges .
It did n't have to be this way .
Those involved in attacking the US on 9/11/2001 could have been tried and convicted as the criminal murderers they are .
Those captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan could have been rightly held as prisoners of war .
But no .
We have a tyrannical madman at the helm of our national security policy and a dimbulb president who is too weak and too stuck in his own messianic fantasy world to ever reign him in .
Kudos to Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham for standing up and speaking the truth .
Congress must finally step in and end this madness and getting Abraham on the record in an open hearing seems to be the next logical step .
smintheus has more at unbossed .

I 've proved that the central XMonad StackSet module is safe on several occasions , as the code keeps evolving .
Each time I take the source code , run Catch on it , and send an email back to the XMonad list giving the results .
So far only one other person ( Spencer Janssen ) has taken the time to download and install Catch and run the tests to validate my result .
The reason for this is that building Catch is slightly tricky , due to the Yhc and Yhc .
Core dependencies .
I 'm working on putting together a proper release for Hackage , expect that within a month - all the code works , its just the packaging and user interface thats lacking .
The other day dons asked me how he could " get an idea " of what Catch is doing .
If you blindly accept a formal proof , its hard to get a feel of whether its correct , or if you are proving what you expect .
The detailed answer is going to appear in my thesis ( and hopefully as a paper beforehand ) , but I thought it may help to give a very light overview of what thoughts go through Catch .
The concept behind Catch is that each function has athat must hold in order for the function to execute without error .
If a functioncalls a functionwhich has a precondition , then the precondition formust guarantee that the precondition toholds .
If you set this up so thathas the precondition False , then you have a pattern match checker .
The second concept is that given aon a function , you can transform that to aon the arguments to the function .
If there is a requirement that the result ofmeets a certain condition , then this can be expressed as conditions on the variablesandBefore all this machinery can be put into action , it is first necessary to perform many transformations on the source code - filling in default pattern matches , doing simplifications , removing higher - order functions and abstracting some library functions .
All these transformations are performed automatically , and are intended to set up the Catch machinery to do the best job it can .
As it happens , most of the pattern matches that are checked in XMonad are relatively trivial - and do not push the power of Catch to its full potential .
A few are slightly more complex , and one of these is ( XMonad code evolves very fast , so this may not be the current darcs version ! ) :
Catch identifies two separate potential pattern match errors in this statement .
Firstly the lambda expression passed as the second argument tois potentially unsafe - as it does not mention theconstructor .
A quick look at thefunction shows that by this stage the value must be a .
The way Catch solves this is by transforming the code , bringing the two pices of code together .
Once the case expression withinis merged with the one in the lambda , pattern match safety is a simple transformation of elimating redundant alternatives .
The second potential error is in the where statement .
Ifis empty then the pattern will not match .
This is a perfect example of the postconditions in action , the generated postcondition is thatmust be a ( :) constructed value .
Using the machinery in Catch , this condition is transformed into the condition thatmust be a ( :) value .
Looking at the alternatives , Catch can see this is always the case , and declares the pattern safe .
In order to prove the entire module , Catch requires 23 properties , and 12 preconditions .
The process takes 1.16 seconds are requires 1521.05 Kb of memory .
Catch is an automated tool - no user annotations are required - which means that some people may feel excluded from its computational thoughts .
If a user does wish to gain confidence in the Catch checking process , a full log is produced of all the preconditions and postconditions required , but it is n't bedtime reading .
Hopefully this post will let people get an idea for how Catch works at a higher level .
I am very glad that Catch is an automated tool .
XMonad is a fast changing code base , with many contributors .
In a manual system , requiring proofs to remain in lockstep with the code , the pace of progress would be slowed dramatically .
Hopefully Catch can give cheap verification , and therefore verification which can be of practical user to non-experts .
Remember , God designed us to grow old and die .

The Problem with Both
At the outset of my professional career in the Sixties , I lived and worked in New York City and its suburbs .
There I witnessed the rise of libertarianism as Ayn Rand and her disciples frequently appeared on TV , talk radio and public forums , at which I was an occasional participant .
( Rand was in fact a libertarian who rejected the label , as many self - described “ libertarians ” failed to subscribe fully to her “ objectivist ” catechism ) .
This was , at the same time , the high tide of liberalism as Lyndon Johnson ’s “ Great Society ” rolled through Congress and as Barry Goldwater , the “ conscience of conservatism ” suffered a crushing defeat in the 1964 election .
The clash between the liberals and the libertarians generated heated and exciting debates , whereby both contesting ideologies were refined and clarified .
Little did the liberals suspect then that three and four decades hence , libertarianism would become a significant player in American politics .
Today , many liberals insist ( and I concur ) , that the ascendance of libertarianism is the result , not of the cogency of its ideology , but of the overwhelming financial and media resources that have promoted it .
Where liberals and libertarians meet — and part .
Libertarianism does not fit in comfortably with either the Democrats or the Republicans , which explains the determined , if futile , persistence of the Libertarian Party .
However , when faced with the forced choice of the lesser of two evils , most Libertarians have sided with the Republicans .
Now that is beginning to change , as many libertarians are deserting the GOP and joining the liberal Democrats in a fragile alliance of convenience .
They are doing so as they find their principles of minimal government , personal autonomy , fiscal responsibility and church - state separation massively betrayed by the theocrats and crypto-fascists that have taken control of the Republican Party .
At the same time , the Republicans continue to proclaim the libertarian ideals of the free market and privatization , as they cut back on government services .
The common ground between the liberals and libertarians is found in their endorsement of personal autonomy , as articulated by John Stuart Mill : “ Over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign . ”
( On Liberty , Ch. 1 ) .
Accordingly , the libertarians ( and less enthusiastically , the liberals ) , oppose the criminalization of so - called “ victimless crimes , ” such as prostitution , homosexuality , and “ recreational ” drug use , and both insist that the government has no business interfering with a woman ’s personal decision whether or not to continue a pregnancy .
Notwithstanding this ground of common agreement , the differences between liberalism and libertarianism are fundamental and irreconcilable .
To begin , the libertarian ’s advocacy of completely unfettered individual “ sovereignty ” extends to property rights and economic activity .
Thus the libertarian is steadfastly opposed to zoning restrictions or to seizure of property by eminent domain .
And the libertarian endorses , without qualification , the unrestricted free market , confident that the summation of individual “ capitalist acts by consenting adults ” ( Robert Nozick ) will result in optimal results for all .
On the other hand , the liberal , while not hostile to free markets and private property , insists that both must be regulated and occasionally be curtailed “ in the public interest . ”
And why should n’t one extend unrestricted personal liberty to include property and a liberty of economic activity ?
What justifies the liberal ’s insistence upon government regulation of the economy ?
The answer lies in two principles endorsed by both liberals and libertarians .
First , the “ no harm principle : ” “ the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised … is to prevent harm to others .
( J. S. Mill ) .
And second , the “ like liberty principle : ” “ Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all . ” ( John Rawls )
The liberal will argue that the libertarian fails to recognize the full implications of these principles , for , if he did , the libertarian would find that an unconstrained free market results in harm to others and to a loss of their liberties .
Furthermore , unconstrained free markets are self - eliminating , since they lead to cartels and monopolies .
Thus the necessity for regulation and anti-trust laws .
The liberal ’s insistence that unrestricted property rights and unregulated free markets can be socially harmful and contrary to the public interest leads to another fundamental and irreconcilable difference with the libertarian :
Society and “ The Public . ”
Simply stated , the libertarian denies the existence of “ society ” and “ the public . ”
If this sounds outlandish , consider the following observations by three prominent libertarians .
First , Margaret
Thatcher : “ There is no such thing as society – there are individuals and there are families . ”
Next Ayn Rand : “ There is no such entity as ‘ the public , ’ since the public is merely a number of individuals . ”
Finally , Frank Chodorov : “ Society is a collective concept and nothing else ; it is a convenience for designating a number of people . ”
The implications of these pronouncements are radical in the extreme , for if there is no such thing as “ a public , ” it follows that there are no “ public goods ” or “ public interest , ” apart from summation of private goods and interests .
Moreover , if there is no society , it follows that there are no “ social problems , ” there is no “ social injustice , ” and there are no “ victims of society . ”
The poor presumably choose their condition ; poverty is the result of “ laziness ” or , as the religious right would put it , a “ sin . ”
There are further implications .
Since there is no such thing as a “ public , ” taxation for the support of such “ so - called ” public institutions as education , libraries , the arts , parks and recreation , is coercive seizure of private property , or “ theft . ”
The liberal replies that this denial of the very existence of “ society ” and “ the public ” is reductionism , plain and simple — what the Brits call “ nothing - buttery . ”
It is comparable to saying that Hamlet is “ nothing but ” words , that Beethoven ’s music is “ nothing but ” notes , and that the human brain is “ nothing but ” cells and electro - chemical events .
Refutation of this keystone of libertarianism is simple and straightforward .
If we can cite cases in which advantages to each individual harms the interest of all individuals , and conversely that harm to each individual benefits all individuals , then , by distinguishing “ each ” and “ all ” we have demonstrated the existence of an “ all - entity , ” “ society , ” that is distinct from a summation of “ each ” individual .
Because I have devoted two chapters of my book in progress to proving that society is more than the sum of its component members ( “ good for each , bad for all , ” and “ bad for each , good for all ” )
I will let just two examples suffice here .
Antibiotics :
The over -use of antibiotics “ selects ” resistant “ super - bugs , ” decreasing the effectiveness of antibiotics for all .
But just one more anti-biotic prescription for a trivial , “ self - limiting ” bronchial infection wo n’t make a significant difference “ in general , ” while it will clearly benefit the individual patient .
But multiply that individual doctor ’s prescription by the millions , and we have a serious problem .
“ Good for each patient , bad for the general population . ”
The solution : restrict the use of antibiotics to the seriously ill .
Individuals with trivial and non-life - threatening ailments must “ tough it out . ”
“ Bad for each , good for all . ”
Traffic laws :
We all agree that traffic laws can be a nuisance .
But if you believe that traffic lights constrain your freedom of movement , try to drive across Manhattan during a power outage !
In the blackouts of 1965 and 1977 in the eastern United States and Canada , traffic began to move only after the police and a few citizen volunteers stood at the intersections and directed traffic .
( I was in Manhattan during both events ) .
The decision of each driver to accept constraints worked to the advantage of all .
So too with the traffic lights and stop signs that we encounter daily .
We are all freer to move about only because we have collectively agreed to restrict our individual freedom of movement .
“ Bad for each , good for all . ”
To sum up : “ society ” is not , as the libertarians would have us believe , simply a physical location where autonomous private individuals “ do their own thing , ” from which activity somehow , “ as if by an invisible hand ” ( Adam Smith ) , benefits for all accrue without foresight or planning .
On the contrary , the liberal insists , a society is more than the sum of its individual parts .
A society is , as John Rawls puts it , “ a cooperative venture for mutual advantage [ which ] makes possible a better life for all than any would have if each were to live solely by his own efforts . ”
As the anti-biotics and traffic examples illustrate , common goods are achieved through individual constraint and sacrifice .
“ Bad for each , good for all . ”
Conversely , unconstrained self - serving behavior by each individual can harm society as a whole .
“ Good for Each , Bad for all . ”
The liberal does not deny that self - serving individual behavior , for example by scientists , entrepreneurs and artists , often or even usually results in benefits for all .
( “ Good for each , good for all ” ) .
Instead , the liberal insists that this is not a universal rule .
In innumerable instances , such as the two presented above , it can be clearly shown that social benefit requires individual constraint and sacrifice .
Concerning Rights .
The libertarian recognizes three fundamental rights : to life , liberty and property .
All three are “ negative rights ” — rights to non-interference by others .
From these rights are derived the only legitimate functions of government : protection of life , liberty and property from within ( the police ) , from abroad ( the military ) , and the adjudication of property disputes ( the civil courts ) .
And because these are the only legitimate functions of government , all other existing government services and property should be privatized .
The liberal , while accepting the libertarian triad of negative rights , also proclaims the citizens ’ “ positive rights ” — to an education , to employment with a living wage and safe working conditions , to a clean and safe environment , etc .
These rights arise from the fact that the liberal , unlike the libertarian , recognizes social benefits and public interests .
Communities flourish , the liberal insists , when they include an educated work force , when the citizens are assured that their basic needs for livelihood and health - care are met , and when the citizens share the conviction that the society is their society and that they have a role in its governance .
And because the communal activity produces more wealth than would be obtained by the sum of individual efforts , members of the community have positive rights to a share of that wealth , and to community assistance in case of misfortune .
Accordingly , Ayn Rand ’s ubermensch , John Galt , is a fantasy .
There is no fully “ self - made man , ” morally free of all responsibility and obligation to the society that nurtured him and sustains him .
On the contrary , as the nineteenth century sociologist , W. T. Hobhouse observed :
The organizer of industry who thinks he has ‘ made ’ himself and his business has found a whole social system ready to his hand in skilled workers , machinery , a market , peace and order — a vast apparatus and a pervasive atmosphere , the joint creation of millions of men and scores of generations .
Take away the whole social factor , and we have not Robinson Crusoe with his salvage from the wreck and his acquired knowledge , but the native savage living on roots , berries and vermin .
Moral perspective .
As we have noted above , human rights are at the center of both the libertarian and the liberal ideologies .
And from this pivotal center , the two ideologies diverge .
They diverge because libertarians and progressives articulate their moral and political philosophies from radically different perspectives .
* The Libertarian : From the point of view of the individual ( “ the egocentric point of view ” ) .
“ Good for each . ”
From this perspective , the individual is enjoined to “ live for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself . ” ( Ayn Rand ) .
* The Progressive : From the perspective of an unbiased benevolent spectator of society ( “ the moral point of view ” ) .
“ Good for all . ”
Thus the libertarian ( who , recall , denies the very existence of “ society ” ) advocates the maximum liberty for each individual .
The liberal , on the other hand , seeks to maximize the amount of liberty extant in the society .
The liberal argues that , paradoxically , the egocentric point of view can not accomplish the libertarian goal of maximizing individual liberty .
It fails , because individual liberties , and especially the liberties enjoyed by the privileged , powerful and wealthy , constrain the liberties and diminish the welfare of others .
In other words , they violate the “ no harm ” and “ like liberty ” principles . ”
“ Good for each , bad for all . ”
Furthermore , the libertarian ’s egocentric perspective fails because political and economic problems are not problems of individuals , they are problems of groups ( i.e. , of “ all ” ) , and therefore the interests of all affected individuals must be taken into account .
The liberal proposes that these interests are best “ taken into account , ” fairly and equally , from the perspective of a hypothetical individual who is unbiased and benevolent — seeking the best result for all while respecting the inalienable rights of each .
In fact , no such neutral observer is actually necessary , for each moral agent , and the agent ’s surrogate , the government , is quite capable of adopting the point of view of the hypothetical “ unbiased benevolent observer . ”
Indeed , we did just that as we found solutions to the aforementioned problems , the use of anti-biotics and traffic control , whereby constraints upon each resulted in benefits to all .
There we found that the astute moral agent would , as a “ the unbiased benevolent observer , ” perceive that all would benefit from antibiotics if these drugs were not prescribed for inconsequential ailments , and the same observer would conclude that the freedom of vehicular movement for all is enhance by imposing constraining rules upon each .
The perspective of the “ unbiased neutral observer ” has a name — in fact , numerous names , since it is one of the most familiar concepts in the history of political theory and moral philosophy : “ the impartial spectator ” ( Adam Smith ) , “ the ideal observer ” ( John Stuart Mill ) , “ the general will ” ( Rousseau ) , “ the view from nowhere ” ( Thomas Nagel ) , “ the original position ” ( John Rawls ) , and my personal favorite , “ the moral point of view ” ( Kurt Baier , Kai Nielsen and many more ) .
And who or what is most appropriately entitled to adopt the perspective of the “ unbiased , benevolent observer ? ”
What else than an agency selected and acting by the consent of the people , an agency that enacts and administers laws to the benefit of all , an agency constituted to “ establish Justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty . ”
That agency has a name : “ democratic government . ”
And in case you did n’t notice , the above quotation is from the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States .
The Menace of Libertarianism .
Libertarianism appears , at last , to be succumbing to the consequences of its own “ success . ”
We are discovering at last that this stark and simple theory cannot accommodate itself to social and political realities .
For there is , in fact , such a thing as a “ society , ” and there is a “ public interest . ”
Social problems are not solved , and social justice is not obtained , through the egocentric point of view — the pursuit of self - interest by each individual in a mythical “ free market . ”
Instead , as we have seen and as the liberal insists , the public interest is best perceived through the “ moral point of view ” — the perspective of the unbiased benevolent observer ” of society .
Libertarianism , a fascinating intellectual diversion and challenge in the sixties , has become a menace in this new century .
The denial of the very existence of society and the public interest is an invitation to chaos , which must result in the unraveling of civilization and the just society , and in its place a government of , by , and for the privileged , the powerful , and the wealthy .
Proving libertarianism wrong and immoral is not difficult .
However , removing the libertarians from power and repairing the damage that they have caused , will be horrendously difficult .
And there is no guarantee that these efforts will succeed .
There has not been a peep in our news about this story , nor about the results of a number of recent clinical trials in Britain that have tested childhood obesity prevention programs based on increasing activity levels in children .
The results are not surprising to those who understand the physiology of the development of body sizes , but probably sound unbelievable to anyone who ’s relied on mainstream media for their information .
The BBC News reported :
Obesity study “ needs more funds ”
The EarlyBird programme in Plymouth has won acclaim after tracking the development of hundreds of children .
Its findings fundamentally challenge the government 's strategy to prevent obesity by raising activity levels .
Researchers taking part in the study , based at Derriford Hospital , are painstakingly mapping the development of more than 300 children from across the social spectrum ....
Every year the children are fitted with accelerometers , which record activity over the course of a week .
They are worn around the waist like pedometers , measuring movement ten times a second .
The BBC story exampled two pre-teen girls , one a long - distance runner active in local track and another who hates sports and loses her breath when she tries to exercise .
But the researchers found that the overall activity level of the second girl is actually higher than the girl perceived as more active !
Dr. Terence Wilkin , M.D. , FRCP , FRCPEd , professor of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Peninsula Medical School , Plymouth , and Early Bird program director , said the reason is because the amount of activity children get is genetically set and has nothing to do with sports or structured physical activities .
" Those children who had little opportunity at school to undertake activity were bouncing around after school whereas those who'd had a lot of opportunity during the course of the school day settled down , and did relatively little , " he said .
" The most important thing ( was ) if you added the in - school activity to the out - of - school activity , they were exactly the same . "
That is not the only surprise .
Professor Wilkin said children 's activity levels had no bearing on their body mass index - their risk of obesity .
" Even looking over a period of years , because we repeat these measures year by year in these children , we have been unable to show any relationship between the physical activity that a child undertakes and his BMI . " ... [ T] hese findings cast serious doubts on the government 's strategy to halt the increase in childhood obesity by the end of the decade , largely by encouraging physical activity .
Professor Wilkin said it was based on unproven prejudice - that today 's children do not exercise as much as previous generations .
The body of evidence has consistently shown that no physical activity - based childhood obesity intervention effort — no matter how intensive , comprehensive or long - lasting — has ever been able to show a reduction in childhood obesity rates .
Not here , not anywhere .
Last October , for example , the results of another randomized controlled trial were reported in the British Medical Journal .
While children in 36 preschools in Glasgow , Scotland , engaged in physical activity programs in school plus home - based health education aimed at increasing physical activity through play and reducing sedentary activities , after one year , there was no significant effect on reducing body mass indexes among the children .
Dr. Wilkin and other doctors from Penninsula Medical School wrote in the British Medical Journal that claims that the amounts of physical activity just need to be further increased in duration or intensity before BMIs can be affected are an unproven hypothesis .
[ T ] here is an alternative , possibly more compelling , explanation – that the physical activity of children is regulated internally by an ‘ activitystat ’ , and not externally by opportunity .
There is a growing literature to support the ‘ Activitystat Hypothesis ’ ....
The Activitystat Hypothesis has been tested both in and out of school .
In a study of more than 200 children wearing MTI accelerometers in three schools providing very different opportunity , school one provided 9.0 hours per week of timetabled PE , school two provided 2.2 hours and school three 1.8 hours .
Activity in school was greater among the children attending S1 compared with S2 or S3 , but the reverse was true out of school , such that total daily activity was the same for all three ( difference less than 0.3 % ) .
Indeed , < 1 % of the four - fold variation in activity of the children could be explained by the five - fold variation in opportunity provided .
In a second study , the energy cost of being driven to school amounted to 16 % during the hours of the ‘ school run ’ ( 8 - 9 am and 3 - 4 pm ) , but total activity was the same between those who walked and those who did not ( difference less than 0.1 % ) .
Again , the difference was made up at other times during the week .
These two studies , and other data reported by the EarlyBird study , suggest that the activity of children follows a set - point that is individual to the child .
The four - fold range of activity observed among young children appears to represent their range of set - points , not their environments .
Most activity is unstructured , and children seem to use it to compensate for the impact of structured or imposed activity .
It is important to recall that many studies are able to show a temporary rise in physical activity following exercise intervention that does not last long - term , nor once the intervention has been withdrawn .
....
While the evidence has continued to not support the effectiveness of popular physical activity programs believed to " prevent childhood obesity , " calls for more and bigger programs , and more funding for them , do continue .

MOSCOW , May 18 —
The computer attacks , apparently originating in Russia , first hit the Web site of Estonia ’s prime minister on April 27 , the day the country was mired in protest and violence .
The president ’s site went down , too , and soon so did those of several departments in a wired country that touts its paperless government and likes to call itself E- stonia .
Then the attacks , coming in waves , began to strike newspapers and television stations , then schools and finally banks , raising fears that what was initially a nuisance could have economic consequences .
The attacks have peaked and tapered off since then , but they have not ended , prompting officials there to declare Estonia the first country to fall victim to a virtual war .
“ If you have a missile attack against , let ’s say , an airport , it is an act of war , ” a spokesman for the Estonian Defense Ministry , Madis Mikko , said Friday in a telephone interview .
“ If the same result is caused by computers , then how else do you describe that kind of attack ? ”
The space rock , dubbed 2006 VV2 , came within 2.1 million miles of hitting us - which is a near miss in space terms , even though that 's about nine times farther away than the moon .
The asteroid was flying past Earth on Friday night , at 11 p.m. ( PDT ) , and on Saturday 7 a.m. GMT for Europe .
There was no danger of collision .
And that 's a really good thing .
This space rock , named 2006 VV2 , is more than a mile wide ( about 2 kilometers ) , according to the Web site .
If one that big hit Earth , it would blow a crater the size of London and wipe out a whole country ; it would derail global commerce and create a climate change unlike anything seen in modern history .
Jay Tate , who runs Spaceguard UK , said : " Asteroids are a very real danger .
We need to find and track them .
Dinosaurs are extinct because they could n't do anything about the asteroid hazard .
We face precisely the same risk . "
The best viewing locations were in the Americas , as the rock passed directly over Southern California , and though it has been far too dim to see with the naked eye , amateur backyard astronomers were able to spot it with good - sized telescopes and CCD cameras .
But one asteroid called Apophis will pass very close to Earth in the year 2029 and has a minor chance of hitting the planet in 2036 , though it will most likely come close to the earth .
In fact , this asteroid will be the first in human history to be clearly visible to the naked eye .
The asteroid is said to have the power of 65,000 Hiroshima bombs .
Also , it has the power to wipe out a small country , and churn up a tidal wave that could become 800 ft ( 244 m ) high .
These are things that could happen if Apophis hits the earth .
As for now , with the little risk that the asteroid has to hit the Earth , NASA has decided to hold off on devising any plans until they can get a more accurate idea of what is in store for Apophis , the asteroid .

McGirk :
Were there any officers ?
Memo :
By asking if there was an officer on scene the reporter may be trying to identify a point of blame for lack of judgment .
If there was an officer involved , then he may be able to have his My Lai massacre pinned on that officer ’s shoulders .
...
Image
In the reporter ’s eyes , military officers may represent the U.S. government and enlisted marines may represent the American People .
Given the current political climate in the U.S. at this time concerning the Iraq war and the current administration ’s conduct of the war , the reporter would most likely seek to discredit the U.S. government ( one of our officers ) and expose victimization of the American people by the hand of the government ( the enlisted marines under the haphazard command of our “ rogue officer . ” )
Unfortunately for McGirk , this is not the case .
One common tactic used by reporters is to spin a story in such a way that it is easily recognized and remembered by the general population through its association with an event that the general population is familiar with or can relate to .
For example , McGirk ’s story will sell if it can be spun as “ Iraq ’s My Lai massacre . ”
Since there was not an officer involved , this attempt will not go very far .
We must be on guard , though , of the reporter ’s attempt to spin the story to sound like incidents from well - known war movies , like “ Platoon . ”
In “ Platoon , ” Sergeant Barnes , the movie ’s antihero , is depicted as a no - nonsense , war - haggard platoon sergeant who knows how to get things done in the bloody jungles of Vietnam — and it ai n’t always pretty .
During one scene , Sergeant Barnes is shown on the verge of committing war crimes in front of his platoon by threatening to kill women and children as a means of interrogation .
This is a classic “ runaway sergeant ” storyline wherein the audience is supposed to be sickened by the sergeant ’s brutality and equally sickened by the traumatic effects war has on soldiers .
This schema is especially fruitful for Mr. McGirk because if he tries to adapt our situation to this model it simultaneously exposes a “ war crime cover - up ” and shows the deteriorative ( albeit exaggerated ) effects of war on U.S. marines ( the best of the best ) , which could be expanded by the general press as a testament for why the U.S. should pull out of Iraq .
[ Colonel Chessani later shortened this answer to “ No . ” ]
•
McGirk :
How many marines were involved in the killings ?
Memo :
First off , we do n’t know what you ’re talking about when you say “ killings . ”
One of our squads reinforced by a squad of Iraqi Army soldiers were engaged by an enemy initiated ambush on the 19th that killed one American marine and seriously injured two others .
We will not justify that question with a response .
Theme : Legitimate engagement : we will not acknowledge this reporter ’s attempt to stain the engagement with the misnomer “ killings . ”
“ The desire of the parole board was not to infringe on his freedom of speech , ” said Mr. Marlan .
“ What they do n’t want is him offering information on how to build the device he has previously used for such things or how to create a system to assist in suicide . ”
Image After serving 8 years , Dr. Jack Kevorkian today walked out of prison and into the predictable media frenzy .
Credit ... Carlos Osorio / European Pressphoto Agency
Mr. Kevorkian ’s release sparked a flurry of reaction among those focused on the issues of assisted suicide and dying .
When he entered prison in 1999 , Mr. Kevorkian was viewed by critics as a scary , peculiar symbol of those who favored assisted suicide ; some questioned whether the more than 100 ill people he claimed to have helped die were truly capable of making the decision to end their lives .
Supporters , meanwhile , viewed him as a bold , fearless advocate of a movement intended to spare some terminally ill Americans from gruesome , painful ends .
As he emerged today , assisted suicide and death choices — spurred in part by the case of Terri Schiavo in Florida — were still being fought over ; in California , legislators are expected to vote on a “ Compassionate Choices Act ” next week .
Oregon remains the only state in the country with a law that allows a terminally ill patient to ask a doctor to prescribe a lethal amount of medication under certain circumstances .
Other states , including Vermont , have rejected such proposals .
Mr. Kevorkian must check in with a parole officer every week , and is to reside in Bloomfield Hills , where he is expected to live on about $ 900 a month from a pension and Social Security benefits , Mr. Marlan said .
You wo n't be seeing one of these sensors in your fashioncam any time soon .
Canon has built a 50 megapixel CMOS monstrosity , which is reportedly almost twice the resolution of its nearest competition , and is prepping it as a sort of large format surveillance camera for monitoring large , busy areas such as parking lots and theme parks , along with detailed work like factory part inspections .
Despite the sensor 's clear industrial - end aims , Canon has managed to build its prototype at 19 x 28 mm in size , the same dimensions of the sensors in its DSLR cameras , so who knows where this tech could end up in the long run .
So far Canon has n't even announced release plans for this current incarnation , so we are n't going to go hawking our existing shooter just yet .

No wonder YouTube is so popular .
All the effort to boost children ’s self - esteem may have backfired and produced a generation of college students who are more narcissistic than their Gen X predecessors , according to a new study led by a San Diego State University psychologist .
And the Internet , with all its MySpace and YouTube braggadocio , is letting that self - regard blossom even more , said the analysis , titled “ Egos Inflating Over Time . ”
In the study being released today , researchers warn that a rising ego rush could cause personal and social problems for the Millennial Generation , also called Gen Y .
People with an inflated sense of self tend to have less interest in emotionally intimate bonds and can lash out when rejected or insulted .
Advertisement
“ That makes me very , very worried , ” said Jean Twenge , a San Diego State associate professor and lead author of the report .
“ I ’m concerned we are heading to a society where people are going to treat each other badly , either on the street or in relationships . ”
She and four other researchers from the University of Michigan , University of Georgia and University of South Alabama looked at the results of psychological surveys taken by more than 16,000 college students across the country over more than 25 years .
The Narcissistic Personality Inventory asks students to react to such statements as : “ If I ruled the world , it would be a better place , ” “ I think I am a special person ” and “ I like to be the center of attention . ”
The study found that almost two - thirds of recent college students had narcissism scores that were above the average 1982 score .
Thirty percent more college students showed elevated narcissism in 2006 than in 1982 .

Twenge said she and her coauthors are not suggesting that more students today have a pathological narcissistic personality disorder that needs psychiatric treatment .
Still , traits of narcissism have increased by moderate but significant amounts , said Twenge , who last year published a book titled “ Generation Me : Why Today ’s Young Americans Are More Confident , Assertive , Entitled -- and More Miserable Than Ever Before . ”
The narcissism report is under review for publication in a scholarly journal , which would give it the stamp of academic recognition it now lacks .
It was released , Twenge said , in connection with the upcoming paperback edition of her book and with a student affairs workshop today at the University of San Diego at which she and another speaker will discuss how today ’s college students approach education .
Some of the increase in narcissistic attitudes was probably caused by the self - esteem programs that many elementary schools adopted 20 years ago , the study suggests .
It notes that nursery schools began to have children sing songs that proclaim : “ I am special , I am special .
Look at me . ”
Advertisement
Those youngsters are now adolescents obsessed with websites , such as MySpace and YouTube , that “ permit self - promotion far beyond that allowed by traditional media , ” the report says .
Other trends in American culture , including permissive parenting , increased materialism and the fascination with celebrities and reality TV shows , may also heighten self - regard , said study coauthor W. Keith Campbell , psychology professor at the University of Georgia .
“ It ’s part of a whole cultural system , ” he said .
The researchers seek to counter theories that current college students are more civic - minded and involved in volunteer activities than their predecessors .
Because many high schools require community work , increases in volunteering “ may not indicate a return to civic orientation but may instead be the means toward the more self - focused goal of educational attainment , ” the report says .
An annual survey of U.S. college freshmen by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA has found growing interest in public service and social responsibility , presumably in response to Hurricane Katrina and other disasters around the world .
Advertisement
But that survey also showed that current freshmen are much more interested in financial success and less in “ a meaningful philosophy of life ” than students were in the 1970s .
At Cal State Long Beach on Monday , an informal survey produced divided opinions about Gen Y personality traits .
Students and teachers said they often see examples of inflated egos on campus : students who converse in the computer center while others are trying to concentrate , preen in front of the reflecting windows of the economics building or expect good grades simply for showing up at class .
Laura Rantala , 26 , a sociology major , said the phenomenon got in the way of a survey she conducted last semester on the attitudes of men and women about jury duty .
Advertisement
“ It took about three minutes to complete the survey , ” she recalled .
“ But many students were so self - absorbed they did n’t want to participate .
“ I think it ’s because we all have our own cellphone and iPod with which we ’re doing our own thing in our own little world , ” she mused .
Some students seeking degrees in finance and management said , however , that they had good reason to stress confidence and esteem .
James Coari , a lecturer in the College of Business Administration , agreed , to a point .
In an interview in his office , Coari said , people looking for jobs “ have to be concerned about image because competition is fierce . ”
Advertisement
Marc Flacks , an assistant professor of sociology , said that he believed that narcissism was too harsh a description for current students and that it was more important to discuss why “ we have a society in which narcissistic behavior is a good quality to have . ”
“ This is a bottom - line society , so students are smart to seek the most direct route to the bottom line , ” he added .
“ If you do n’t have a me - first attitude , you wo n’t succeed . ”
Flacks summed up the attitudes he often encounters in students , who expect a tangible payoff from their education :
“ The old model was a collegial one in which students and professors alike sought knowledge for knowledge ’s sake .
The new model is ‘ I paid my money , give me my grade and degree . ’
It makes me want to ask [ students ] , ‘ Want fries with that order ? ’ ”

The Statesmen reports that Paul Wolfowitz , head of the World Bank , is embroiled in a nepotism scandal .
Apparently his longtime girlfriend , Shaha Riza , a communications officer for godsakes , has been receiving some pretty large pay raises that have n't been approved by the ethics committee as they 're supposed to be .
By large , I mean an extra $ 47,300 , bringing her up to $ 180,000 , since Wolfowitz arrived .
Then she got another $ 13,590 last year .
Now everyone is wondering why these raises were ordered and bypassed around the ethics committee .
Well , now we know .
At the risk of turning this into a tabloid , occurrences like this are particularly regrettable because it reflects on the entire organization .
Wolfowitz went into the World Bank promising to clean up corruption and make it actually , you know , work so that its goals are achievable .
Politicians and bureaucrats , especially at the international level , are all sleazy .
It 's no wonder that hookers line the streets of New York in force when political conventions and conferences come to town .
Speaking of which , would n't it be cheaper from the World Bank to get Wolfowitz one of those rather than boost his girlfriend 's salary by over $ 60,000 ?
Now , Dr. Posner and others said , new research on hypnosis and suggestion is providing a new view into the cogs and wheels of normal brain function .
One area that it may have illuminated is the processing of sensory data .
Information from the eyes , ears and body is carried to primary sensory regions in the brain .
From there , it is carried to so - called higher regions where interpretation occurs .
For example , photons bouncing off a flower first reach the eye , where they are turned into a pattern that is sent to the primary visual cortex .
There , the rough shape of the flower is recognized .
The pattern is next sent to a higher -- in terms of function -- region , where color is recognized , and then to a higher region , where the flower 's identity is encoded along with other knowledge about the particular bloom .
The same processing stream , from lower to higher regions , exists for sounds , touch and other sensory information .
Researchers call this direction of flow feedforward .
As raw sensory data is carried to a part of the brain that creates a comprehensible , conscious impression , the data is moving from bottom to top .
Bundles of nerve cells dedicated to each sense carry sensory information .
The surprise is the amount of traffic the other way , from top to bottom , called feedback .
There are 10 times as many nerve fibers carrying information down as there are carrying it up .
These extensive feedback circuits mean that consciousness , what people see , hear , feel and believe , is based on what neuroscientists call " top down processing . "
What you see is not always what you get , because what you see depends on a framework built by experience that stands ready to interpret the raw information -- as a flower or a hammer or a face .
The top - down structure explains a lot .
If the construction of reality has so much top - down processing , that would make sense of the powers of placebos ( a sugar pill will make you feel better ) , nocebos ( a witch doctor will make you ill ) , talk therapy and meditation .
If the top is convinced , the bottom level of data will be overruled .
Whether your goal is to reduce oil imports , lower carbon dioxide emissions , or just save money , geothermal heat pumps MAY be an answer for you .
In many places and under many circumstances , this heat source makes economic sense without any need for subsidy ( although , in some places , you can get a subsidy as well ) .
Moreover , we can convert our heating to electricity much faster than we can convert our cars since the houses are permanently attached to the electric grid .
In a sense geothermal heat is something for nothing .
You do n’t really create heat with your heat pump the way you do with a furnace , you pump existing heat out of the air or ground and use a compressor to step it up to the temperature you want to achieve .
The trouble with air - source heat pumps is that the air outside is liable to be pretty cold just when you need heat in your house the most – especially here in Vermont .
But ground - source ( geothermal ) heat pumps get their heat from somewhere in the ground or under water .
The deeper you get , the more the temperature stays the same year round .
BTW , heat pumps also work for cooling – same principal .
But we do n’t do much air conditioning in Vermont residences so I have n’t looked at that in any detail .
Obviously , if you do also use energy for air conditioning , it can only improve the case I ’m about to make .
OK , the numbers : suppose you use 1000 gallons of oil to heat your home ( that ’s how most of us heat here in the Northeast despite the fact that we do n’t like refineries ) .
At $ 3.00 / gallon ( my guess for next winter ) , that costs $ 3000 ( duh ) .
According to my favorite government spreadsheet , there are 138,690 BTUs in each gallon of No. 2 fuel oil so you ’re buying about 140 million BTUs to keep you warm .
However , because even a good furnace is only 78 % efficient , only 108 million of those BTUs do you any good .
If you were to create all the useful BTUs with conventional electric heat , you ’d need to buy about 32,000 kilowatt - hours ( 3412 BTUs per kWh ) .
At the $ .16 / kWh we ’ll be paying here next winter , that ’s $ 5000 dollars .
Stick with oil !
Forget that advice this winter ( 2008 ) : even conventional electric heat at typical Vermont electric rates is competitive with $ 5.00 gallon heating oil ( updated numbers here ) .
But , according to the same spreadsheet , geothermal is 3.3 times as efficient as conventional heat ( because you ’re just pumping up what you need ) .
With geothermal you ’ll need less than 10,000 kWhs and pay about $ 1500 ; you save 50 % compared to oil !
According to Excel , the present value of $ 1500 per year over 20 years at 6.5 % interest ( actually your heat pump system should last longer ) is a little more than $ 16,000 .
If you can get a heat pump system with the capacity you need installed for that amount or less , you ’ve got yourself a bargain – no subsidies involved .
Actually , if it ’s a new installation then you have to take into account what a furnace and fuel tanks would have cost as well .
Distributing the heat inside the house is best done with circulating water but can be done with hot air as well .
Either you already have a system to do that or you ’d need to pay for one anyway .
You can also get your domestic hot water from the heat pump and save a little more .
If the price of oil goes up faster than electricity , you save more – and vice versa .
Can you get geothermal heat with this capacity installed for this amount ?
Depends .
It depends on whether you have land that ’s easily dug down into , a well , or a pond .
If your house is on cold rock and you have no well or a small one , the collection system in the ground will drive your costs up .
Does n’t work at all for people in apartments or condominiums .
On the other hand could be much cheaper if the heat source is readily accessible .
You wo n’t be emitting any carbon dioxide from your heat pump , of course .
But what you ’re doing for total emissions depends on where your electricity is coming from .
Much of the electricity in the US comes from coal , a lot from natural gas , relatively little from oil , and some is carbon - free hydro and nuclear .
Here in Vermont the vast majority of our power comes from Hydro Quebec and Vermont Yankee ( nuclear ) so there ’s clearly less emission when electricity is used for heat than oil or even natural gas .
I suspect there ’s a net reduction in emissions for oil and gas produced electricity as well as when geothermal replaces combustion but I have n’t done the math – maybe later .
If you ’re trying to stop the flow of oil dollars from here to the worst of places , geothermal is a good place to start .
In 2005 we in the US burned over 63 4.9 billion gallons of oil to create heat for residences .
As you may have guessed , we ’re looking into geothermal .
Will let you know how it goes in practice .
Now have our heat pump installed .
Preliminary observations and pictures here .
A tool for estimating your annual fuel savings if you switch to radiant or geothermal electric heat is here .
The Economics of Science Fiction by Robin Hanson
Academic discussion of the non-immediate future seems almost non-existent .
Yet the topic is of widespread popular interest .
Why ?
The explanation seems obvious : it seems very hard to say anything rigorous about the topic , and individual academics avoid the topic in order to distinguish themselves from the sloppy wishful thinkers who seem to dominate the topic .
Most discussion of the non-immediate future seems to take place in science fiction , and the small subset of science fiction where authors try hard to remain realistic is called hard science fiction .
Loosely associated with hard science fiction is an intellectual community of people who try to make projections which are true to our best understanding of the world .
They work out the broad science and engineering of plausible future space colonies , starships , virtual reality , computer networks , survellience , software assistants , genetically engineered people , tiny machines made to atomic accuracy , and much more .
Unfortunately , few if any people of these people know much social science .
So their projections often combine reasonable physics or computers with laughable economic assumptions .
This often seriously compromises their ability to make useful projections .
Professional economists , on the other hand , do understand social science , and often do talk about the future .
Quite a few of them are even paid a lot to think about what the next hot technology will be .
Economists , however , seem to almost completely ignore the longer - term implications of specific envisionable technologies .
When looking more than a few years out , they almost always abstract away from specific technologies and think in terms of aggregate economic processes , which are assumed to keep on functioning much as they do today .
This leaves an unfilled niche , which I call the " economics of science fiction " , or the " economics of future technology . "
This is economic analysis of the sorts of assumptions typically explored in science fiction .
It is distinguished from the typical hard science fiction analysis by using the tools of professional economics , rather than the intuitive social science of the typical engineer .
And it is distinguished from most economics by taking seriously the idea that we can now envision the outlines of new technologies which may have dramatic impacts on our society .
The best way to explain what I mean in more detail is to give some examples of it .
Here is a collection of articles by others I think of as examples .
Paul Krugman , " The Theory of Interstellar Trade " July 1978 .
Jeffrey A. Frankel , " Is There Trade With Other Planets ? " Univ. of Michigan , Oct. 1978 .
Marc R. Reinganum , " Is Time Travel Impossible ?
A Financial Proof " , Journal of Portfolio Management 13( 1) :10 - 12 , Fall 1986 .
Current economic conditions rule out the possibility of past , present , or future time machines .
The interest rate would always be zero if time travel were possible , because of the arbitrage opportunities that time travel would permit .
Positive rates of interest are positive proof that time travel , unlike space flight , is pure fantasy .
13 ( 1):10 - 12 , Fall 1986 .
There are maybe a half dozen articles on the economic theory of telecommuting .
Most economists have viewed technological progress as an incremental process .
A few have focused on the role of drastic innovations - those that introduce a discontinuity .
The contributors to this volume are concerned with the type of drastic innovation called general purpose technologies ( GPTs ) .
A GPT has the potential to affect the entire economic system and can lead to far - reaching changes in such social factors as working hours and constraints on family life .
Examples of GPTs are the steam engine , electricity , and the computer .
The study of GPTs is relatively new .
A universal theoretical framework for dealing with GPTs does not yet exist .
The essays in this book both further our understanding of GPT - driven economic growth and lay the foundation for further developments of the available frameworks .
Economic Growth Given Machine Intelligence , Oct. 1998 .
A simple exogenous growth model gives conservative estimates of the economic implications of machine intelligence .
Machines complement human labor when they become more productive at the jobs they perform , but machines also substitute for human labor by taking over human jobs .
At first , expensive hardware and software does only the few jobs where computers have the strongest advantage over humans .
Eventually , computers do most jobs .
At first , complementary effects dominate , and human wages rise with computer productivity .
But eventually substitution can dominate , making wages fall as fast as computer prices now do .
An intelligence population explosion makes per-intelligence consumption fall this fast , while economic growth rates rise by an order of magnitude or more .
These results are robust to automating incrementally , and to distinguishing hardware , software , and human capital from other forms of capital .
Burning the Cosmic Commons : Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar Colonization , Mar . ' 98
Attempts to model interstellar colonization may seem hopelessly compromised by uncertainties regarding the technologies and preferences of advanced civilizations .
If light speed limits travel speeds , however , then a selection effect may eventually determine frontier behavior .
Making weak assumptions about colonization technology , we use this selection effect to predict colonists ' behavior , including which oases they colonize , how long they stay there , how many seeds they then launch , how fast and far those seeds fly , and how behavior changes with increasing congestion .
This colonization model explains several astrophysical puzzles , predicting lone oases like ours , amid large quiet regions with vast unused resources .
What if we someday learn how to model small brain units , and so can " upload " ourselves into new computer brains ?
What if this happens before we learn how to make human - level artificial intelligences ?
The result could be a sharp transition to an upload - dominated world , with many dramatic consequences .
In particular , fast and cheap replication may once again make Darwinian evolution of human values a powerful force in human history .
With evolved values , most uploads would value life even when life is hard or short , uploads would reproduce quickly , and wages would fall .
But total wealth should rise , so we could all do better by accepting uploads , or at worse taxing them , rather than trying to delay or segregate them .
Economic growth is determined by the supply and demand of investment capital ; technology determines the demand for capital , while human nature determines the supply .
The supply curve has two distinct parts , giving the world economy two distinct modes .
In the familiar slow growth mode , rates of return are limited by human discount rates .
In the fast growth mode , investment is limited by the world 's wealth .
Historical trends suggest that we may transition to the fast mode in roughly another century and a half .
Can some new technology switch us to the fast mode more quickly than this ?
Perhaps , but such a technology must greatly raise the rate of return for theworld 's expected worst investment project .
It must thus be very broadly applicable , improving almost all forms of capital and investment .�
Furthermore , investment externalities must remain within certain limits .
Brad De Long has combined standard world product time series with older population time series , to construct a history of world product from one million B.C. to today .
After modifying De Long ’s series to reflect more recent estimates of prehistoric population , we model this product history as both a sum of exponentials , and as a constant elasticity of substitution ( CES ) combination of exponentials .
World product history since two million B.C. is reasonably described as a CES combination of three distinct exponential growth modes : “ hunting , ” “ farming , ” and “ industry . ”
Each mode seems to have grown over one hundred times faster than its predecessor .
The CES parameters describe how much each mode substituted or complemented its neighbors .
Farming seems to have strongly substituted for hunting , making for a sharp transition , while industry more complemented farming , making for a smoother transition .
If it is possible for the economy to again transition to a faster mode , and if modes are comparable in terms of how much the economy grows when they dominate and how much faster new modes are , then the next century could see a transition to a growth mode where the doubling time is measured in weeks , not years .
Could Gambling Save Science ?
Encouraging an Honest Consensus . with Reply to Comments .
Social Epistemology 9(1):3-33,45-48 , 1995 .

The pace of scientific progress may be hindered by the tendency of our academic institutions to reward being popular , rather than being right .
A market - based alternative , where scientists more formally " stake their reputation " , is presented here .
It offers clear incentives to be careful and honest while contributing to a visible , self - consistent consensus on controversial ( or routine ) scientific questions .
In addition , it allows funders to choose questions to be researched without choosing people or methods .
Buy Health , Not Health Care .
CATO Journal 14(1) :135-141 , 1994 .
To cure health care , give your care - givers a clear incentive to keep you well .
Make sure that when you lose , they lose , and just as much .
Buy lots of life and disability insurance from your care - givers , and have a third party , unable to act against your life or health , pay you to be the beneficiary .
( A simple game - theoretic model illustrates this proposal . )
Humanity seems to have a bright future , i.e. , a non-trivial chance of expanding to fill the universe with lasting life .
But the fact that space near us seems dead now tells us that any given piece of dead matter faces an astronomically low chance of begating such a future .
There thus exists a great filter between death and expanding lasting life , and humanity faces the ominous question : how far along this filter are we ?
Combining standard stories of biologists , astronomers , physicists , and social scientists would lead us to expect a much smaller filter than we observe .
Thus one of these stories must be wrong .
To find out who is wrong , and to inform our choices , we should study and reconsider all these areas .
In particular we should seek evidence of extraterrestrials , such as via radio signals , Mars fossils , or dark matter astronomy .
But contrary to common expectations , evidence of extraterrestrials is likely bad ( though valuable ) news .
The easier it was for life to evolve to our stage , the bleaker our future chances probably are .
Must Early Life Be Easy ?
The Rythm of Major Evolutionary Transitions .
first version Sept. 1996 .
If we are not to conclude that most planets like Earth have evolved life as intelligent as we are , we must presume Earth is not random .
This selection effect , however , also implies that the origin of life need not be as easy as the early appearance of life on Earth suggests .
If a series of major evolutionary transitions were required to produce intelligent life , selection implies that a subset of these were ``critical steps , " with durations that are similarly distributed .
The time remaining from now until simple life is no longer possible on Earth must also be similarly distributed .
These results are used to constrain models of major evolutionary transitions .
If you might be living in a simulation then all else equal you should care less about others , live more for today , make your world look more likely to become rich , expect to and try more to particpate in pivotal events , be more entertaining and praiseworthy , and keep the famous people around you happier and more interested in you .
Ordinary privacy is leaving ; can online privacy replace it ?
A clever and thought - provoking argument suggests we should expect the extinction of intelligent life on Earth soon .
In the end , however , the argument is unpersuasive .
Genie nanotech , space colonies , Turing - test A.I. , and a local singularity are all dreams of a future where some parts of the world economy have an unusually low degree of dependence on the rest of the world .
But it is the world - wide division of labor that has made us humans rich , and I suspect we wo n't let it go for a long time to come .
US officials did not deny the " rendition " policy , the report says
The report follows months of investigation by a special committee of MEPs led by an Italian , Claudio Fava .
" Many governments co-operated passively or actively ( with the CIA ) , " said Mr Fava , quoted by AFP news agency .
He accused top EU officials including foreign policy chief Javier Solana of failing to give full details to MEPs .
The report echoed allegations made in June by the Council of Europe - Europe 's leading human rights watchdog - that European states were complicit in illegal CIA operations as part of the US - led " war on terror " .
US President George W Bush admitted in September that the CIA had used prisons abroad for the secret detention of terror suspects , but he did not specify where the prisons were .
He insisted the suspects had not been tortured .
EU ' informed '
The draft report says several EU governments were aware of the CIA 's secret detention and transfer of terror suspects .
It further accuses governments and top EU officials of failing to co-operate fully with the European parliament 's investigation .
Mr Solana 's evidence to the inquiry contained " omissions and denials " , the draft report says .
And EU anti-terror co-ordinator Gijs de Vries was also criticised over evidence he had given .
Mr Fava 's report singled out the governments of Poland and Romania of failing to co-operate with the investigation .
Both countries have strongly denied media reports that they tolerated secret CIA detention centres on their territory .
The report says the US government had first informed EU member states in 2005 that it was using their territory to transfer terror suspects .
Over the course of three meetings with EU officials , " the Americans spoke in an explicit manner about the transfer system as a method in the fight against terrorism " , Mr Fava told AFP .
Investigations urged
Mr Masri says he was abducted and held illegally in US detention
They included the cases of a German , Khaled el - Masri - allegedly abducted in Macedonia and then detained in Afghanistan - and Egyptian former imam Abu Omar , allegedly kidnapped by CIA agents in Milan .
On Tuesday , a US court began to hear an appeal from Mr Masri after he lost an earlier lawsuit demanding damages and an apology from the US government .
Mr Fava cited at least 1,245 overflights or stopovers by CIA planes in Europe - some of which he said were probably prisoner transfers .
His investigation was launched after press reports last year claiming the US operated secret prisons in some EU states and had used others as staging posts to transfer terror suspects .
The draft report urges the countries named within it to launch their own investigations into whether they violated EU human rights law , the Associated Press news agency says .
“ Cheap labor is not high on the list , ” Dr. Lazowska said .
“ It is access to talent . ”
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , demand for computer scientists in the United States will only increase in coming years , Dr. Cuny said .
“ If you look at the demographics of the country , if we are not going to get our new professionals from women and minorities and persons with disabilities , we are not going to have enough . ”
The big problems , these and other experts say , are prevailing images of what computer science is and who can do it .
“ The nerd factor is huge , ” Dr. Cuny said .
According to a 2005 report by the National Center for Women and Information Technology , an academic - industry collaborative formed to address the issue , when high school girls think of computer scientists they think of geeks , pocket protectors , isolated cubicles and a lifetime of staring into a screen writing computer code .
This image discourages members of both sexes , but the problem seems to be more prevalent among women .
“ They think of it as programming , ” Dr. Cuny said .
“ They do n’t think of it as revolutionizing the way we are going to do medicine or create synthetic molecules or study our impact on the climate of the earth . ”
Like others in the field , Dr. Cuny speaks almost lyrically about the intellectual challenge of applying the study of cognition and the tools of computation to medicine , ecology , law , chemistry — virtually any kind of human endeavor .
“ The use of computers in modern life is totally ubiquitous , ” said Barbara G. Ryder , a professor of computer science at Rutgers University .
“ So there are niches all over for people who understand what the technology can do and also for people who want to advance the technology .
“ But students do n’t see that , ” Dr. Ryder said .
“ And it seems to be happening more with the women than with the men . ”
House Democrats introduce bill to restore habeas corpus Mike Sheehan
Published : Thursday March 8 , 2007 Print This Email This Powerful House Democrats have introduced legislation intended to restore the right of habeas corpus .
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , who chairs the Homeland Security Subcommitee on Intelligence , and Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , announced today the presentation of bills that would reverse " problematic parts of the Military Commissions Act , " according to a statement released by Harman 's office .
" Both the ' Restoring the Constitution Act ' and the ' Habeas Corpus Restoration Act ' will bring credibility to the process of detaining terrorist suspects by placing it within a legal framework , " the statement begins .
" This includes : restoring habeas corpus , narrowing the definition of ' unlawful enemy combatant ' as defined in the Military Commissions Act , prohibiting evidence obtained under coercion , and affirming the Geneva Conventions . "
Harman herself says in the release , " The Administration has never completely found its way out of the ' fog of law ' that set in after September 11 . "
She continues , " No one questions that September 11 and the threat of future attacks required a swift , decisive , and forceful response .
Many Members -- me included -- offered to help the Administration create a legal framework to guide this response , setting the ground rules for detaining , interrogating , and eventually trying terrorism suspects .
" We had an opportunity to show the world that the United States could fight those who would do us harm and protect our core values .
That we could be both strong and just , " Harman says .
" We missed this opportunity . "
She rips the Bush administration because it " chose to act unilaterally , claiming for itself the right to ignore long - standing US and international law regarding the treatment of detainees . "
In the process , " the United States has paid a steep price in eroded moral authority , " she argues .
Yet she insists , " There is no reason why we can't fight the War on Terror and live up to our obligations under US law and the Geneva Conventions . "
The bills are companions to Senate legislation introduced by Sens. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who is running for president , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , and Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) .
An effort in September 2006 to restore habeas corpus was rejected by the then - Republican controlled Senate .
Excerpts from the Harman statement , available in full at her official site , follow ... #
The United States has never been as unpopular in the world as it is now .
We have flouted the very legal protections that we have sought to export to the rest of the world .
We have undermined international human rights standards that we helped create , and which we have used to press other nations to protect the rights of their citizens .
... I 've been briefed on our surveillance , counter - terrorism , and interrogation programs .
I 've been to Guantanamo Bay three times .
And I can tell you that a clear legal framework would empower - not limit - those who fight the War on Terror .
We would ensure those who act on our behalf that they are doing so legally .
Congress had the opportunity to get this right last year , when we considered the Military Commissions Act .
Some of our Members - Senators McCain and Graham among them - made valiant efforts to produce a bill that was consistent with our core values .
But the White House prevailed , and the resulting legislation did little more than codify the rules already in place .
The two bills that Congressman Nadler and I introduced today would roll back certain provisions of the Military Commissions Act .
The " Habeas Corpus Restoration Act " would reaffirm the right of habeas corpus , which allows all those detained by the government to challenge their detention before an independent court .
The right - which dates back to the Magna Carta - is as central to the American conception of liberty as any other in the Constitution .
The " Restoring the Constitution Act " goes further , restoring a host of rights and procedural protections stripped away by the Military Commissions Act .
The bill narrows the vague and potentially limitless applicability of the Military Commissions Act .
It affirms the importance and applicability of the Geneva Conventions .
It prohibits the use of coerced testimony , and gives the trial judge more discretion to ensure a fair trial .
We all want the United States to use all tools at its disposal to fight terrorism and protect our interests .
But we must do so under the rule of law , and in a manner consistent with our values .
These bills are an important course correction . #
Often , there are calls for debate and discussion regarding belief and the concepts which underpin it .
Mostly ( online anyway ) these seem to come from those who already hold to a belief and want to debate with those poor heathens who do not agree .
Now I think it is more than possible that some of the people making these calls are doing so for honest reasons , and actually want to have a debate .
Sadly , I also think that most do not actually want a debate but , instead , seek to convert others .
Shame on them .
In this , I am not talking about the fallacy of scientific debate , I mean things like the “ blogwar ” between Sam Harris and Andrew Sullivan ( which was mentioned yesterday ) .
This happens on television and radio as well ( especially on Radio 2 in the UK , during the lunchtime phone in show ) .
It creates the impression in the observer that both parties are open to new ideas and are open minded enough that they are willing to listen to others and possibly become swayed by a new point of view .
In science , and in rational people , this is common .
For a long period of time Newtonian gravity was believed to be the best model , but then along comes general relativity .
For a long period of time people believed the Earth was the centre of the solar system ( and indeed , the stars were part of “ our ” solar system ) but then along came telescopes , mathematics , Copernicus , Tycho Brahe et al .
Rational people accepted the new information and changed their world out look as a result of it .
There are always nutcases who ignore the new evidence and , normally , they are marginalised and laughed at .
Flat Earthers , people who think the moon landing was a hoax etc. , are not even given the respect of normal kooks ( alternative medicine practitioners for example ) .
Oddly , this does n’t happen if the irrationality is based on a Religious Belief .
The assumption that a “ religious belief ” is due more respect than any other belief weighs hard with people and I think this alone will ensure any debate is meaningless .
As soon as any points are made , the defence “ it is my belief ” becomes unsurmountable – even if the religious belief is based on as much evidence as Flat Earthers have ( i.e. none ) .
Even religious moderates , and people who profess to have minimal religious belief argue from a position on unshakeable conviction .
Take this excerpt from Andrew Sullivan , where he is replying to a question in which Sam Harris asks what evidence it would take to make him give up his beliefs : ( emphasis mine )
I have never doubted the existence of God. Never .
My acceptance of God ’s existence – of a force beyond everything and the source of everything – goes so far back in my consciousness and memory that I can neither recall “ finding ” this faith nor being taught it .
So when I am asked to justify this belief , as you reasonably do , I am at a loss .
At this layer of faith , the first critical layer , the layer that includes all religious people and many who call themselves spiritual rather than religious , I can offer no justification as such .
I have just never experienced the ordeal of consciousness without it .
It is the air I have always breathed .
I meet atheists and am as baffled at their lack of faith – at this level – as you are at my attachment to it .
When people ask me how I came to choose this faith , I can only say it chose me .
I have no ability to stop believing .
Crises in my life – death of loved ones , diagnosis with a fatal illness , emotional loss – have never shaken this faith .
In fact , they have all strengthened it .
I know of no “ proof ” that could dissuade me of this , since no “ proof ” ever persuaded me of it .
Now , in all fairness to Andrew Sullivan , this is the cornerstone of “ belief ” but it does make a mockery of any debate .
In science a theory is “ believed ” to be true until some evidence is discovered to show that it is not .
In belief , there is no need for evidence one way or another because people are indoctrinated from childhood to accept it as true .
The idea that “ faith chose [ me ] ” is laughable .
This is an otherwise intelligent , educated person creating a “ supernatural ” force to explain the fact that growing up in a Christian family , learning about Catholicism ( in this case ) pretty much from birth and the attendant “ brainwashing ” ( for want of a better word ) has created an unshakable faith in him .
I am 100 % sure that if he had grown up in a Pentecostal , Jewish , Islamic , Hindu , Jain ( and so on ) family he would be equally saying the “ faith chose him ” but it would be a different faith .
Now , even though I am an Atheist there are numerous ways in which any Deity could convince me of his or her existance .
That does not mean I have “ less ” faith than a “ believer , ” it simply means I am rational .
I have not been brainwashed .
I am not insane .
If Andrew Sullivan was talking about a teacup floating in orbit around the Sun , people would laugh at him .
Because he is talking about the other invisible fantasy , people respect him
Is that not madness ?
I have been steadfastly against trying to impeach George W. Bush , even though he is clearly the worst president in the modern history of America .
These were my main reasons for feeling that way :
1 ) Politically , I saw impeachment as absolutely impossible to bring off .
2 ) As bad as Bush is , I do n't want to see America turn into some kind of parody banana republic , in which the opposition party tries to impeach every president .
3 ) America knew what the Shrub was selling , and re-elected him , so we got what we deserve .
Plus , I felt that any effort to impeach the rascal would divert attention from the very real agenda of trying to stop his criminal war .
And finally , what if you did manage to remove him ?
You'd get the puppet master himself , the sneering Darth Cheney , widely regarded to be the brains of the current Reich .
Not only that , he would be eligible to run for re-election , and given the Democrats ' penchant for political suicide , that 's a risk I do n't think anyone wants .
Yet I am beginning to think I was wrong .
Quite possibly , I may have been thinking too much like a political insider , or a wimp , or both .
The fact is that the simpering George W. and his sidekick Dick clearly deserve impeaching , if anyone ever did .
Not only that , there seems to be more sentiment to throw the bums out than official Washington knows .
Karl Gregory , the distinguished civil rights activist and retired economics professor at Oakland University , has helped move me on this issue by arguing that while congressional Democrats have said " impeachment is off the table , " lots of people in the real world may not be willing to accept that .
" Do not underestimate the pressure for impeachment .
The Congress is against it now , but pressure is building up and the Congress will respond to sufficient pressure if that is mobilized , " he wrote to me .
John Nichols completed my conversion with an article in last week 's The Nation magazine .
State legislatures have the authority to propose impeachment , he points out , and legislators in a number of states are trying to do just that .
Three dozen towns in Vermont have passed resolutions calling on Congress to impeach and remove both the puppet and the puppet master .
And then last month , Dennis Kucinich , the Ohio Democratic congressman from the Cleveland area , cleverly introduced articles of impeachment ... not against the Shrub , but against his vice president , curled - lip Dick Cheney .
Why is he doing this ?
He told Congress , " because I believe the vice president 's conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation . "
Well , no shit .
Of course he has , from the moment he put his claw on the Bible on Jan. 20 , 2001 .
But is that an impeachable offense ?
Maybe not in itself .
But Kucinich says : " Richard Cheney had purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and the Congress of the United States by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify the use of the armed forces against the nation of Iraq . "
Those are , in fact , the exact words of Kucinich 's first article of impeachment .
He also alleges that Cheney did exactly the same to deceive us " about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al - Qaida . "
His third article of impeachment has a note of urgency .
As the congressman told Congressional Quarterly , " It became obvious to me that this vice president , who was a driving force for taking the United States into a war against Iraq under false pretenses , is once again rattling the sabers against Iran with the same intent to drive America into another war . "
That last may be hard to prove .
And proving that " rattling the sabers " against any nation is an impeachable offense may be even harder , especially when that country is Iran .
But the first two charges certainly need airing .
Would having hearings to see if , in fact , there was anything impeachable about Cheney 's conduct harm Congress ' ability to get anything else done ?
Nichols argues that it would n't .
" The Watergate Congress was highly efficient , and Democrats had one of their best years ever at the polls after pressuring Richard Nixon out of office . "
Increasingly , it 's hard to see what we would be losing by plunging ahead with a massive investigation of the process that took us into this senseless and insane war , a war that has ruined Iraq and done our country untold harm .
If nothing else , shining light onto the war we were deceived into might help us escape another one .
After all , it 's not as if the Democrats are close to stopping this war .
They have been trying clumsily to get a timetable for ending it , though it 's clear that Bush will veto any bill that sets a date for doing so .
What may well be a threat is that the Democrats , especially in the Senate , may end up being co-opted into some kind of support for continuing the atrocity that is our military presence in Iraq .
Too many of them are still terrified of being thought of as " not supporting the troops . "
Well , the best way to support the surviving troops is not to feed them into the meat grinder that has eaten 3,400 American soldiers , far more people than were killed on Sept. 11 , an attack with which Saddam Hussein had nothing to do .
George Bush has needlessly killed more Americans than Osama bin Laden , who remains at large .
He has totally destabilized Iraq , probably for many , many years , and killed tens , or more likely , hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
He also intends to kill more , of them and of us .
And for what ?
Well , Bush did get Saddam and his sons , and showed up or avenged Daddy Bush , who did n't invade Baghdad .
Why now does the Shrub want to continue this war , which has already lasted longer than World War II ?
For nothing , except maybe in the hope that the Iraqis who are blowing up our too - lightly armored vehicles will suddenly all become freedom sensations , ready to establish little replicas of the Texas Legislature and willing to sell their oil cheap to Halliburton .
Richard Nixon looks like a candidate for ACLU man of the year in comparison .
Sorta makes bugging a bunch of loser politicians at the Watergate Hotel look pretty damn tame , does n't it ?
Should Bush and Cheney both be impeached , removed from office , and sent off to Abu Ghraib ?
Damn straight they should .
Can that be done ?
Well , I still strongly doubt it .
But I no longer doubt that citizens should try to call them to account .

Sustainable energy and technology can curb climate change and meet projected growth in demand for energy but only if key decisions are made within the next five years , according to a new WWF report .
Climate Solutions : WWF ’s vision for 2050 concludes that sustainable technologies can meet global projected energy demand while avoiding the most dangerous impacts of climate change .
But it warns that the governmental policies needed to propel this transition are not now in place , or even in prospect in most cases .
“ This report says that we can breathe a sigh of relief : it ’s not too late to save ourselves and our children from the worst ravages of climate change while still meeting the demand for energy , ” said Richard Mott , Vice President for International Policy at World Wildlife Fund .
“ But the report also warns that this opportunity is fleeting .
Any delay and our choices become both more difficult and much more expensive . ”
The study showed with a high degree of probability ( greater than 90 percent ) that known energy sources and proven technologies could be harnessed between now and 2050 to meet a projected doubling in global demand for energy while at the same time achieving the necessary significant drop ( about 60 - 80 percent ) in carbon dioxide emissions needed to prevent dangerous climate change .
The report identifies six key solutions :
Improving energy efficiency
Stopping forest loss
Accelerating the development of low - emissions technologies
Developing flexible fuels
Replacing high - carbon coal with low - carbon gas
Equipping fossil - fuel plants with carbon capture and storage technology
“ The WWF study provides a much needed integration of climate change mitigation within a comprehensive framework of environmental stewardship , ” said Princeton University Professor Robert Socolow .
He and Professor Stephen Pacala developed the climate stabilization “ wedges ” adapted by the WWF study .
While the study shows that a solution to the current climate crisis is within reach , the governmental actions and economic policies needed to drive the switch to sustainable technologies may well be years away based on current progress .
In five years , it may be too late to avert a breach of the 2 degree C threshold for avoiding dangerous climate change .
Socially disruptive options may be forced upon us or we will face interventions with significant impacts on the global economy .
“ Those in power today have a unique opportunity , a duty , to avert a catastrophe , ” continued Mott .
“ Generations to come will face dire consequences if our leaders fail to act within the next five years . ”
UPDATE : I have been informed by some of my readers that bukkake may in fact have a second meaning in addition to being a style of topping for noodles .
I am currently researching Google to try to confirm this matter ; I may be some time .
Last month MyVoice published the results of a survey they conducted amongst their internet monitor group to find out their views on udon .
12,182 people successfully completed an internet - based questionnaire conducted over five days at the start of October . 54 % of the sample was female , 2 % in their teens , 20 % in their twenties , 41 % in their thirties , 24 % in their forties , and 13 % in their fifties .
Udon , thick wheat - based noodles , is one of the two main home - grown noodles in Japan , with soba , a thin noodle made from buckwheat , being the second .
Personally , I dislike udon , and even more dislike eating out as my Western manners - sensitive ears find the loud slurping noises from fellow diners extremely off - putting and irritating .
I ’ve also heard of none of the regional dishes mentioned in Q1 .

Rediscovering Alexander Moritz Frey Eye - Witness Account of Hitler 's WWI Years Found
Hitler 's years in the German army during World War I have long been a mystery due to the lack of eyewitness accounts .
Now a memoir written by a forgotten German author of fantastic literature has been rediscovered -- and sheds new light on the Führer .
Von David Gordon Smith
Giuliani , from Reason , talking about the gun manufacturers :
They ’ve acted negligently by overproducing guns , way beyond the number that ’s necessary for hunting and for law enforcement , maybe by factors of 3 and 4 to 1 .
In doing that , they have knowingly made a calculation that they ’re selling to an illegal market , and that ’s negligence … .
In fact , it would be more in their business interest to produce less guns , because the price of guns would go up if there were less guns , just like we were talking about with OPEC , you know , Economics 101 .
Instead of producing less guns , they produce 6 , 7 times more guns than the legal market actually would demand .
Therefore they have to know that they ’re supplying an illegal market .
So we ’ve got two issues here :
1. Rudy seems to think he knows how many guns the market “ should ” demand .
It seems that he would prefer that guns become even more expensive , so that only the rich could protect themselves * .
2 . I think his view of an “ illegal ” market , considering his record on gun ownership , is a lot different than mine .
Really , given his stance on the issues , some people call him a libertarian Republican .
Would n’t it make more sense to call him a pro-market Democrat ?
* Actually , he probably thinks that we should n’t be able to protect ourselves , we should leave that to the police .

Flexibility can save you money
As above - inflation rail fare increases come into effect , travellers will be looking for ways to keep the price of their journeys down .
BBC transport correspondent Peter Plisner shares his top 10 tips for buying cheaper tickets .
1 . Book ahead Most train companies release quotas of cheaper tickets around six weeks in advance .
On some journeys there are a limited number of tickets on each train .
The earlier you book the better your chances of getting one of them .
Remember with many book - ahead tickets you 'll have to travel on a specific train .
If you miss it , your ticket wo n't be valid for any other services .
2 . Ticket combinations
On some routes you can save money by buying two separate tickets .
For instance , on a journey from Birmingham to Bristol at peak time you 'd pay £ 56 for a standard return .
However , if you buy a return from Birmingham to Cheltenham and then another one from Cheltenham to Bristol you would save £ 26 .
3 . Internet research Several companies now offer passengers the chance to buy tickets on the internet .
You can see all available ticket types for the journey you want to make .
The tickets can either be posted or collected at the station .
4 . Travel off - peak
Most train companies offer the best deals to those who are prepared to travel after 0900 or 0930 .
5 . Different routes
For some journeys you might find that there are different routes available .
Between Birmingham and London there are two routes , one via Watford and another via High Wycombe .
6 . Single tickets
Some train companies are now selling cheap single tickets which are cheaper than buying a return .
It has the added benefit that you can travel out on one route and back on another getting the cheapest deal from each company .
7 . Ticket offers
Like the low - cost airlines , rail companies are now offering cheap deals from time to time .
The best place to check is the rail company websites .
8 . Add-ons Many destinations have add - ons including unlimited bus travel and cheap entry into popular attractions .
When travelling to London you can buy travelcards and use the same ticket on the underground barriers .
9 . Group save Most companies offer group saver tickets .
With some you can buy a ticket to cover four people and save pounds .
10 . Rail cards
There are a variety of rail cards available .
On a long - distance trip you can often get your money back on the first trip .

What are these ?
While in Cambridge , England recently for the
MSR Cambridge 10 year anniversary and
MSR Cambridge PhD Summer School ( stay tuned for coverage on this on Channel 8 ... )
I caught up with
Simon Peyton - Jones ,
Erik Meijer and , very briefly ( too briefly ) ,
Butler Lampson to talk about what 's going on inside Simon 's head right now with respect to general purpose programming language evolution .
Trust me , it 's most interesting and programmers should be excited about the thoughts in Simon 's head these days .
Join us for a really brief conversation ( I think this is my shortest interview in the 3 + years I 've been taking part in conversations here on Channel
9 ) with some of programming language design 's best and brightest .
Here , Simon clues us in to the nirvana of programming languages : Safe and Useful ( effectful ) .
Better just to listen in to Simon 's excellent and succinct explanation of the holy grail
of general purpose programming languages .
Enjoy !
PS I will be interviewing Butler Lampson sometime in the future ( when he 's in Redmond ) .
He 's a rather prominent computer scientist with a rich history in making
systems that many of us rely on for a number of things ...

During my switch to KDE for a week I saw a few comments about others leaving gnome based on the seeming trend toward mono development .
I have seen this in other places as well and I thought I would try to offer some information on what the mono framework really is about .
I share some of the same reservations that many of you have about Microsoft , its tools and so - called “ Intellectual Property “ .
I was interested enough that I thought I should do some research .
Well here is what I found out about mono .
What Is Mono ?
Mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and server applications on Linux , Solaris , Mac OS X , Windows , and Unix .
Sponsored by Novell ( http://www.novell.com), the Mono open source project has an active and enthusiastic contributing community and is positioned to become the leading choice for development of Linux applications .
- Mono Project Website
Did I really just say .
NET ?
Back the truck up there pal !
I do n’t want to develop for Microsoft !
Well you ’re not .
. NET is a public development framework that was initially contributed to by Microsoft but does fall under their control , licensing , etc .
From the Mono website :
The Mono Project is an open development initiative sponsored by Novell to develop an open source , UNIX version of the Microsoft .NET development platform .
Its objective is to enable UNIX developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET Applications .
The project implements various technologies developed by Microsoft that have now been submitted to the ECMA for standardization .
The " . NET Initiative " is a somewhat nebulous company - wide effort by Microsoft , one part of which is a cross- platform development framework .
Mono is an implementation of the development framework , but not an implementation of anything else related to the .NET Initiative , such as Passport or software - as - a - service .
Ok .
I ’ll translate .
This did n’t really clear a lot up for me at first either .
It gets better , I promise .
From what I understand Microsoft put together a development framework that allowed coders to write programs in the language of their choice .
In other words , you and I could work side by side on a program while I use python and you used C#. .NET , in its original implementation , allowed for this and was then submitted to the ECMA for standardization .
So , Microsoft is n’t even really in charge of this system anymore although they ’ve expanded it to their Passport and software - as - a - service models .
These two things , and Microsofts usage of this development framework are really disconnected from Mono .
The only thing .
NET , Microsofts original framework , and Mono have in common are the idea .
A central cross-platform development framework .. and one is based on the other , although not dependent on the other .
Now , from what I ’ve read and understand , there really are quite a few benefits of writing in Mono that should really appeal to us as a software community .
Not only in developing better software but also in being able to spread our software to those not yet ready to use Linux or Ubuntu .
As mentioned above Mono allows you to write an application in a list of languages so you can use the language of your choice .
You do n’t need to learn something new in order to use it .
Some of the languages currently supported in Mono are :
C #
Java
Boo
Nemerle
Visual Basic.NET
Python
Javascript
Oberon
PHP
Object Pascal
Cross Platform Compatibility is the second , and I think more important reason why Mono development can benefit us .
Considering that Mono is supported on Linux , UNIX , OSX , Solaris , BSD and Windows you can write an application within one and almost instantly port it to the next .
Assuming the other platform has the mono common libraries ( which are included in Ubuntu and Windows for starters ) and your application does n’t depend on any platform dependent libraries .
If this is the case you just wrote an application that can be used on Linux , OSX and Windows without any additional work .
Think of the benefits to those outside our community if we could more easily share our Open Source applications with them .. and if we can sell them on Open Source applications we ’ll have an easier chance of helping them understand the benefits of free software and the ideals we all embrace .
There are already some very popular applications that have been developed using Mono .
You might have already used a few of them .
Banshee .
Tomboy .
F - Spot. Beagle .
Even Second Life is developed using Mono .
You might want to take a second look at what Mono is all about .
I think it has some real value .
Not only for us as developers but also as a community .

IDAHO NIXES AMERICAN UNION 
Thirteen states join Idaho lawmakers to stop globalist plan for the Americas By Mark Anderson THE STATES WHICH , ONCE UPON A TIME , created the federal government under the Constitution are trying to give their arrogant offspring  some direction .
But over the long haul , the very - wealthy and well - connected , through their media empire , think tanks , foundations , banking schemes , lobbying outfits and other means , have led that offspring astray , severely corrupting it while sharply eclipsing the average persons influence on the federal government .
Stepping up to the plate , Idaho has now become the first state to pass a legislative resolution , House Joint Memorial No. 5 , in an effort to direct the U.S. Congress to drop out of the North American Union , or NAU a proposed economic - political merger of the United States , Mexico and Canada .
The resolution also calls on Congress to withdraw from any further participation in the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) of North America , an initiative designed to lay the groundwork for the NAU .
The NAU is approximately modeled after the European Union , or EU , which is comprised of formerly independent nations and is largely ruled by a centralized bureaucracy in Brussels .
The 13 states besides Idaho urging Congress to nix the NAU / SPP are : Georgia , Arizona , Missouri , Illinois , Oregon , Montana , South Carolina , Oklahoma , Utah , South Dakota , Tennessee , Washington and Virginia .
Some of the state resolutions oppose the creation of North American Free Trade Agreement superhighways  like the Trans - Texas Corridor , or TTC , a super - wide highway , railway and utility system slated to be built parallel to Interstate 35 from Laredo , Texas , north to the border with Oklahoma , with concrete tributaries and other tollways rippling through Texas as part of a continental cargo transport system .
According to a care2.com , passage of Idahos detailed resolution was credited to grassroots activists .
The resolution itself makes several points , such as , according to the U.S. Commerce Department , U.S. trade deficits with Canada and Mexico have significantly increased since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement . . . and the volume of imports from Mexico has soared since NAFTA , straining security checks at the U.S. border and  the NAFTA superhighway system
from the West Coast of Mexico through the United States and into Canada has been suggested as part of a North American Union to facilitate trade among the SPP countries . 
Furthermore , echoing recent reports in AFP and other sources , the resolution acknowledges that huge ship cargos will be unloaded at Mexican Pacific - side ports so the cargo can be trucked and sent by rail through Mexico and into the United States via the TTC .
However , it also adds that plans of Asian trading powers to divert cargo from U.S. ports such as Los Angeles to ports in Mexico will only put pressure on border inspectors , interfering with their already overwhelming job of intercepting the flow of drugs and illegals flowing into this country . 
The overall TTC plan calls for numerous other new tollways and conversion of regular highways to tollways that , if built , would ripple through many parts of Texas .
The statements and diagrams of Kansas City SmartPort and other organizations amenable to NAU / SPP show that the envisioned network of NAFTA superhighways , including the TTC , is ideal for physically integrating the United States , Canada and Mexico and would greatly facilitate the open migration of goods , people and capital across the three nations  formerly sovereign borders , if this overall scheme is not defeated .
The recipient of this and the other state resolutions the U.S. House of Representativesitself has House Concurrent Resolution 40 in its docket .
Introduced by Rep. Virgil Goode ( R - Va. ) , H.C.R. 40 has 12 co-sponsors .
On Jan. 22 , 2007 , it was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure , and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
HCR 40 would put Congress on record against the NAFTA superhighway and the NAU .
It reads like a pared down version of Idahos resolution .
Not everyone is convinced that these state resolutions deserve a rousing applause .
Some comments posted at ImmigrationWatchdog.com see the resolutions as theatrics or as well - meaning but somewhat toothless gestures .
Some suggested impeachment proceedings against President Bush and others for supporting the NAU .
Such support is seen as treasonous and , therefore , impeachable .
Other posted comments , however , say the resolutions are tangible , welcome progress .
ANOTHER APPROACH
Coming at this issue from another perspective , the We the People Foundation reports filing a petition for redress regarding the North American Union . 
A strategy outlined on the foundations web site notes ,  We must take the first step .
We , the People , must Petition the United States Government for Redress of Grievances regarding the North American Union . 
It was reportedly served on every member of Congress and the president on March 15 .
A transmittal letter was to be served with each petition .
On March 30 , citizens involved in this movement assembled at Lafayette Park opposite the White House that early afternoon , to await the presidents response and that of the Congress .
The letter informs the president and Congress that should they fail in their constitutional obligation to promptly respond to the petition , then ,  the people will not be filing tax returns for 2006 and will retain their money until their grievances are redressed . 
This approach follows a long - established principle , foundation members say .

Energy demand has been rising in Europe as winter nears
An overload in Germany 's power network triggered outages leaving millions without electricity on Saturday night .
Romano Prodi said there was a " contradiction " in having a unified power network but no central authority .
Power failed first in Cologne , Germany , before shutting down across parts of France , Italy , Spain and Austria .
Belgium , the Netherlands and Croatia were also affected .
" My first impression is that there is a contradiction between having European networks but not having a central European authority .
It is somewhat absurd , " Mr Prodi said .
Transmission failure
German utility provider E.ON said early investigations suggested the supply failures were caused by overloads in the power network in northwest of the country , according to Reuters .
The power outages were quickly restored in most cases but in some of the worst cases :
In Paris , firefighters responded to nearly 40 calls from people stuck in lifts as the city lost power
Scores of trains were delayed in Germany 's industrial Ruhr region for up to two hours
The Italian regions of Piedmont , Liguria and Puglia lost energy overnight between 2100 and 2200 GMT
In Spain , power was lost in the cities of Madrid , Barcelona , Zaragoza and parts of the Andalucia region .
European blackout risk
E.ON said the power failures may have been linked to a line across a river being switched off to allow a ship to pass through safely , Reuters reported .
France was one of the worst affected , with five million losing power mainly in the east of the country and the capital , Paris , and its suburbs .
" We were n't very far from a European blackout , " a senior director with French power company RTE said .
Most electricity supplies were restored within two hours of the outage , and so far no injuries or accidents have been reported .
The worst recent power blackout struck Italy in 2003 , plunging the country into darkness for 18 hours between 28 and 29 September .

I love my Sony Vaio laptop .
But I loathe Sony 's new ( and definitely unimproved ) technical support service .
The new system has fallen for Cole 's first law of system design : if something works well , wreck it .
We 've all heard horror stories about automated telephone support lines that force you to navigate through endless menus or which leave you hanging on for ages while an electronic version of Greensleeves assaults your ears .
But frustrating as these systems are , at least in the end you do get to speak to a real human being .
Not so with Sony's , because it uses a computer to filter any contact with its support staff .
It was n't always like this .
At the end of 2004 , my two - year old Vaio was overheating and then shutting down .
" No problem , " I thought , " I 've got an extended warranty . "
So I called the technical support number , pressed " 9 " on my phone keypad and spoke to a Sony support agent .
My Vaio was collected for repair and returned within a week .
Here was a system that worked smoothly , efficiently and effectively .
And then someone at Sony decided to screw it all up .
A few months ago , my Vaio's LCD screen died .
I called Sony 's technical support , but this time encountered a new system .
" If you want to open a new case , " said an automated voice , " press one .
If you already have a case and want to talk to your dedicated Sony agent , press two . "
I pressed one .
" Enter your Vaio 's 15 - digit serial number , which is at the bottom of your computer , " said the voice .
So I did but then the voice said : " Sorry , your Vaio is out of warranty .
Please call this [ premium rate ] number for technical support . "
Then it cut me off .
" But I 've got an extended warranty !
Let me speak to someone ! " I shouted .
I tried the system again but got the same result .
The computer 's decision was final .
I was stuffed .
To cut a long story short , I had to play the journalist 's card and a kind soul from Sony PR got the Vaio support team to call me and arrange repairs .
But what if I had n't been a journalist ?
And what if I was visually disabled and could n't read the serial number or found it difficult to tap 15 digits into a handset ?
Or what if I had a physical condition like RSI and could n't lift my Vaio to access the serial number ?
And which idiot designed a telephone support system that does n't give you the option of speaking to someone ?
I put all these points to a nice lady from Vaio support in a follow - up call months ago .
I 've just tried Sony 's support line and the dreaded system is still in place .
Get rid of it , Sony - your customers deserve better than this .

MOST people find it difficult to keep up with Danny Hillis 's imaginative leaps .
In the 1980s he dreamt of building intelligent computers and co-founded Thinking Machines , a firm with a mission to make machines “ that will be proud of us ” , as he used to put it — with tongue only half in cheek .
That did not quite happen , but Mr Hillis did , in the process , pioneer the field of massively parallel supercomputing .
After a stint at Disney , where he proposed building a theme - park full of free - roaming robot dinosaurs , he turned his attention to building a mechanical clock that will run for 10,000 years , a task that arguably requires genius in its justification as well as its execution .
Now this maverick of the technology industry has a new idea that could have a big impact rather sooner than that .
It concerns the web , a creation that , though impressive , is pedestrian compared with what Mr Hillis has in mind .
Today 's web allows easy and universal sharing of documents .
Before the web , internet users could share documents only by making bilateral arrangements — requesting a document from someone else by e-mail , for example — which incurred transactional “ friction ” , so that relatively few people did so .
The web eliminated that friction .
Today it is obvious that this was world - changing , but Mr Hillis still remembers “ how hard it was to explain ” before it happened .
Déjà vu .
The next step , he says , is to let the web do for data what it has already done for documents .
Just as there used to be lots of people with interesting but unshared documents , today there are innumerable people and organisations with useful but locked - up databases .
These range from topics of life - and - death importance — the World Health Organisation 's data on bird - flu outbreaks , say — to things that are deceptively banal but potentially useful — a foodie 's private spreadsheet listing the best wines at his local restaurants , say .
For data to change the world as documents have changed it , the web must again eliminate all friction involved in sharing .
Metaweb Technologies , a firm set up by Mr Hillis and his co-founders , Robert Cook and John Giannandrea , aims to do exactly that with Freebase , a website that sits on top of a new kind of database .
The name is not a pun on cocaine but a contraction of “ free ” and “ database ” , since the database shares the spirit of Wikipedia , the free and collaborative encyclopedia .
( Mr Hillis is on the advisory board of Wikipedia 's parent organisation . )
Just as Wikipedia lets people contribute information to its articles , Freebase , which is in a test phase , will let anybody contribute , correct or recombine data .
The difference is that information on Wikipedia tends to be “ unstructured ” — ie , buried in text — whereas on Freebase it will be structured , so that each item can be re-used in any context .
It is an open question whether enough people will contribute their data to generate the momentum of Wikipedia , but Mr Hillis is optimistic .
“ Most people with data want others to have and use it , ” he reckons .
A boffin who collects data on butterflies , say , might want to upload it so that others with the same fascination can add their own information .
Another researcher might then add data on lizards , and yet others might then combine the data on butterflies and lizards with existing geographical data to create maps or analyse patterns .
The fact that users will not know in advance how their data might be used is precisely the point .
This requires a new level of flexibility in the database .
When building most databases today , programmers decide in advance what sort of questions users might wish to ask of the data , by defining what are known as the “ schema ” — the types of records in the database and the relationships between them .
Metaweb 's 35 programmers , by contrast , have built a new sort of database , based on a more flexible structure known to programmers as a “ graph ” , which allows users to contribute and use not just data , but schemas as well .
They can , in short , ask any sort of question of the database .
Metaweb is thus very different from commercial database software , such as that made by Oracle , and from Google Base , which might superficially appear similar because it too allows anybody to upload data .
Google Base , says Mr Cook , consists of many independent data sets that are stored in a coherent way .
This means that many records are duplicates — if several people upload the details of the same digital camera , say — and may even contradict one another .
Metaweb , by contrast , reconciles conflicting data and ensures that each object exists only once in the database .
But each object can be tied to every other object , so that the resulting web of associations looks rather like the neural networks in a brain .
There is one similarity to Google , however .
The search giant 's founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , initially concentrated on perfecting a technology ( search ) that could change the world , without worrying about a business model , which came much later ( in the form of advertising ) .
Mr Hillis plans to do the same .
For now , he is much too excited about the technology to worry about the money .
“ Everything else I 've worked on , if it succeeds , only helps one thing , ” he says .
“ This has the potential to make everything better . ”
The banknotes proved too much of a temptation for the thieves
The work by artist Jan Christensen , entitled Relative Value , was made up of notes worth 100,000 kroner ( $ 16,300 , 12,400 euros ) .
The robbers got into the gallery by breaking a window .
They then cut each note off the canvas individually and left the 6.5 - by - 13 ft ( two - by - four - metre ) frame behind .
The work had already been sold to a Norwegian buyer at face value .
" The piece was sold for nothing basically .
It was just an exchange , " Mr Christensen told the BBC News website .
" I wanted to make a blunt work with the intention of creating a discussion about the value of art , and about capitalism , and how the art world works , " he said .
Mr Christensen said he did not know whether he would make a replacement .
The artist wanted to create a discussion about the value of art
" We were afraid something like this might happen , " he said .
" I did n't want to compromise the artwork but I realised it might cause some problems . "
The thieves managed to make off with the money despite security measures being in place when they broke in late on Sunday .
Mr Christensen believes that the presence in Oslo of many high - profile guests for the King of Norway 's birthday celebrations had diverted many of the city 's police from their usual duties .
Despite the double blow of losing an artwork made up of his own money , Mr Christensen says he finds the theft " interesting " .
" It proves my theory that I have made an artwork that has a value outside the gallery space . "
" It means a lot to me that the myth can continue , " he said , referring to the fact that the notes could end up in general circulation .
He said he found it puzzling that someone might wish to risk jail for relatively small amount of money , and is unsure as to what type of person would have stolen his art .
" It could be a drug user , but at least it 's one who 's interested in art , " he said .
Some pundits say former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Clinton operate like a unified political animal .
But a study of their TV and radio interviews reveals that gender separates the speech of the power couple , such that he " talks like a man " and she is " ladylike . "
Well - known interviewers also treated each of the Clintons differently , possibly due to gender stereotypes and expectations .
Camelia Suleiman of Florida International University and Daniel C. O'Connell of Georgetown University recently examined three TV interviews and two radio interviews with the former president in June 2004 and three TV interviews and two radio interviews with Hillary Clinton in June 2003 .
All were conducted by the same journalists : Larry King of CNN , Katie Couric of NBC , David Letterman of CBS , Juan Williams of NPR and Terry Gross of NPR .
Sen .
Clinton was nearly three times more likely to use " you know " than her husband , a " hedge " phrase that downgrades or diminishes the power of a statement .
Previous research shows that women use hedges more than men .
She also used the word " so " more frequently than her husband , a word that is often used to underline or intensify what is said .
This finding also goes along with previous work that shows women use intensifying words more than men and that this marks women and their language as powerless .
" Even though Hillary Clinton is a politician herself , she still follows , to some extent , the historic designation of women 's language as the language of the non-powerful , " the researchers wrote .
The researchers say their findings should be taken with a grain of salt : " We are comparing only two individuals … but Bill and Hillary 's language does reflect the historic power relations between men and women . "
Sen. Clinton has announced her presidential candidacy in the intervening years since the data were collected , but Suleiman said she would find the same gendered talk in data collected more recently .
" I believe it does hold true four years later , " she told LiveScience .
" This is Hillary Clinton ’s personal style as compared to Bill Clinton ’s . "
The results are detailed in the latest issue of the Journal of Psycholinguistic Research .
Call me Bill Gender sometimes entered the mix via the speech of the interviewer , moreso than via the speech of the politician being interviewed , Suleiman and O'Connell said .
For instance , calling someone by their first name rather than their last name can be seen as casual and even disrespectful in some professional and political situations , and in fact , no interviewer addressed the former president with his first name .
However , Sen. Clinton was addressed by her first name when the interviewer was a man , but never when the interviewer was a woman .
Meanwhile , Bill Clinton never addressed his interviewers by their first name , while Hillary Clinton did , males and females alike .
She might have been attempting to establish camaraderie , the researchers wrote , especially when she was regularly being asked in these interviews about her husband 's infidelity , her personal appearance , her daughter , her relationship with her husband , her childhood and doing what is right , along with her potential presidential candidacy , her comments about Republicans and health care .
Interviewers asked President Clinton about his presidency , his wife 's possible presidential candidacy , his personal affairs , scandals , politics in the Middle East and Rwanda , his impeachment and John Kerry 's candidacy , the analysis showed .
Conceding the floor Gender differences in the interviews could also have to do with the power status of a former U.S. president compared to the status of a senator , the researchers said .
Overall , President Clinton dominated interviews more than his wife , as measured in syllables spoken .
He spoke 82 percent of all syllables in the combined interviews , while she spoke 77 percent of the syllables in the sum of all those in her interviews , Suleiman and O'Connell wrote .
" Interviewers are obviously deferring to Bill Clinton more than to Hillary Clinton , " the authors wrote .
In general , the meaning of speaking strategies can change depending on the cultural and social context as well as immediate contexts , Suleiman said .
" Therefore , women in politics , while bringing women 's [ linguistic ] style to politics , can bring in a transformation of the meaning of these linguistic strategies and hence associate them with powerful language as well , " she said .
" In other words , we ( as users of language ) define social relations through language , just like social relations , simultaneously define the way we speak . "

The Personal Face Of Evolution
By Rusty Rockets
Whether we get along with someone on a social , business , or sexual level often depends very much upon our personalities .
And as researchers increasingly discover that animals - from primates to mollusks - have personalities , questions quickly turn to the evolutionary significance of personalities , and the advantages ( or disadvantages ) that different types of personalities confer .
To date , it has proven to be problematic for researchers to link an evolutionary purpose with animal personalities .
But a recent piece of research shows that , logically speaking , personality is a result of natural selection , which leads to some tough questions regarding human nature .
What do we mean when we use the word " personality " ?
In reality , it 's an amorphous word .
A shorthand way of referring to the vast biological hotchpotch of emotions and behaviors that organisms exhibit .
We might think of Sigmund Freud , or Carl Jung and his personality tests that seem to have a ubiquitous presence on the Internet and in glossy magazines .
But whatever we associate with personality , few would argue against the idea that having a distinct personality is what makes us unique as individuals .
But can the same be said for animals ?
Not just chimps , dogs and cats ; but birds , fish , spiders , and even shellfish .
It sounds like a bit of a stretch to suggest that an insect may have a personality , but this is exactly what researchers from a variety of biological and psychological disciplines claim .
" Darwin himself argued that emotions exist in non-human animals , and his evolutionary theory suggests that behavioral traits , including personality , can evolve in just the same way as fins , wings and arms , " notes University of Texas at Austin psychologist , Dr. Samuel D. Gosling .
But the whole question of personality gets considerably harder when we ask just where these personalities come from .
Are we born with all of the individual behaviors and emotions that comprise our personalities ( nature ) , do we develop them over time ( nurture ) , or is it a mixture of both ?
Or , as some evolutionary psychologists would argue , is the nature - nurture dilemma just a false dichotomy ?
These are difficult questions in regard to understanding complex human behavior , as many conflicting factors may be at play .
It is for this reason that discovering that simple animals also have personality traits is so significant .
There is no dedicated field for the study of animal personalities but - at the risk of being simplistic - they can be broken down into those who are concerned with learned animal behaviors , such as animal behaviorists , and those who study innate behaviors , such as ethologists .
An animal behaviorist would suggest that a species of bird might learn a particular warning squawk while developing in the egg and listening to its mother .
Conversely , the ethologist would argue that the bird is born with this ability .
In fact , recent research suggests , barring other secondary environmental factors , that animal personalities are determined by genetics , and that personalities can and do evolve through natural selection .
Some researchers believe that the existence of maladaptive personalities makes behavioral traits via natural selection quite a precarious balancing act for many species .
It was Stephen J. Gould who caused a bit of a hubbub when he suggested that a maladaptive trait could be offset by a positive one .
He used the example of guppies that had to reproduce early so as to avoid being eaten by predators , but then showed that carrying the eggs early made the guppies heavy and sluggish , and easy prey .
There are numerous other instances , such as Elizabeth Pennisi 's example of the female North American Fishing Spider reported in Science magazine , which ate its male suitor because of its aggressive instinct to catch prey .
A practice that , as Pennisi observes , is not a favorable strategy for keeping the species alive .
Such examples suggest that the behaviors that comprise animal personalities are inherited , set in stone , and inflexible .
Attempting to prove a hypothesis in favor of evolved personalities is a team of multidisciplinary researchers working at the Santa Fe Institute , who recently published a paper , entitled " Life - history trade - offs favor the evolution of animal personalities , " in the May 31 edition of Nature .
The paper investigates the evolutionary origins of animal personality - where animal personality is defined as " consistent behavior over time and in different situations " - which involved clearing up plenty of misconceptions about the subject .
The team began by posing a number of straightforward , but pertinent questions , such as ; " Why do different personality types exist within a single population given that , at first sight , one would expect one type to be more successful than another ? " and ;
" Why are individuals not more flexible considering that personality rigidity sometimes leads to seemingly inefficient behavior ? "
The implication here is that if a certain behavior were impinging upon an animal 's chances for survival , then you 'd expect it to change that behavior - especially if these less efficient animals were exposed to animals exhibiting more efficient behavior .
The reason that they do n't , argue the authors , is that their personalities are linked to " risk - proneness or risk - aversion " in regard to their reproductive future .
That , they say , is the " common denominator underlying personalities . "
Translated , this simply means that the greater the stake an individual has in its reproductive future , the more cautiously it will behave in any situation , or at any time - and vice versa .
To this end , the researchers have outlined a model of personality that at the very least identifies risk - prone and risk - averse personalities , in spite of any given situation .
" Individuals often differ substantially from each other in their behavior , and these differences are stable over lifetime and correlated across different contexts , " explains researcher Max Wolf , from the University of Groningen .
" Some tits , for example , are consistently more aggressive than others , and aggressive birds differ from non-aggressive birds in many other respects like foraging behavior or the exploration of novel environments , " he added .
There is yet to be a dedicated discipline dealing specifically with the evolutionary significance of personality - perhaps because it is often associated with the " soft " science of psychology - let alone scientists using animal observations to successfully explain human personality and behavior .
However , it would be interesting to consider the fallout that would follow a theory of evolution that differentiated risk - takers and risk - avoiders within human society .

I had a email conversation with Jeff Waugh a long time ago about design and taste in open - source software , which Jeff encouraged me to blog about .
However , every time I tried to put the email into a blog article , it lost the original feel of what I was trying to say .
Kathy Sierra ’s superb keynote at Linux.conf.au 2007 on Creating Passionate Users inspired me to publish it more - or - less verbatim here so it would n’t be delayed for any longer .
( Perfection being the enemy of Good and all that . )
As such , here ‘ tis :
… something else that I ’ve been musing about in the past week is that there ’s a really interesting culture difference between the Mac OS X community and the Linux community .
The Mac community thrives on shareware applications : things that cost anywhere between $ 5 - $ 50 .
RapidWeaver , a $ 40 Web application creation program , is apparently used for over 3000 Web pages …
There are plenty of Mac shareware developers who make enough money from their software that they can do it for a living , professionally .
Wil Shipley , the author of Delicious Library … claimed he had $ 50,000 in sales of his first day of Delicious Library .
The interesting culture difference is that the Linux community tends to put out small , useful little programs , but with little polish .
This is not a criticism : there ’s a lot more programs in the Linux world to do what you want to do , and even though they ’re not polished , they do work , and they ’re open source whereas Mac software generally is n’t .
However , it ’s a completely different class of programs to Mac shareware : now that I ’ve done a lot of work on a program where the UI is the really important thing , I truly admire the amount of polish and sheer effort that goes into the majority of Mac shareware programs .
The icons are beautiful , every part of the workflow is accounted for , and the integration with the rest of the system is superb .
That ’s what you pay your $ 5 to $ 50 for , and the authors charge this because they ’ve put a hell of a lot of time and effort into all these things .
The attitude difference is quite a contrast : probably the best way to sum it up is that the Linux community tends to produce cheap ’n’cheery tools that they ’re very happy to give away and share , whereas the Mac community has a much slower rate of production , but their production values are superb : they are completely unwilling to release stuff that is n’t up to the developer ’s highest standards .
Jose Couso 's family pressed for charges through the Spanish courts
Jose Couso , 37 , died in April 2003 after a US tank fired on a hotel used by foreign journalists in Baghdad .
The US has admitted its tank crew fired at the Palestine Hotel but has cleared Sgt Thomas Gibson , Cpt Philip Wolford and Lt - Col Philip De Camp of blame .
The soldiers say they thought they were being shot at when they opened fire .
Caught on film
The Palestine Hotel was the base for almost all the foreign media crews in Baghdad during the US - led invasion of Iraq .
Mr Couso was working for Spain 's Telecinco television station at the time .
Reuters cameraman Taras Portsyuk , a Ukrainian , was also killed in the blast and three other Reuters staff injured .
Footage of the incident on the day before the fall of the regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein - which did not record any fire from the hotel - was witnessed around the world .
A US review of the incident ruled that the use of force by the tank was justified , but the family of Mr Couso decided to press criminal charges through the Spanish courts .
Freeze on assets
In December 2006 , Spain 's supreme court overturned a previous high court decision and ruled that the Spanish legal system was competent to judge the three US soldiers . '
As he issued the international search - and - capture order for the three tank crew members , Judge Santiago Pedraz demanded that prosecutors also investigate whether it was possible to freeze the soldiers ' US assets in case of future compensation claims .
The BBC's Danny Wood in Madrid says Spain 's justice system is accustomed to taking on controversial international cases .
In 1998 , Spain attempted to extradite Chile 's former leader , Augusto Pinochet , while he was in London .
The British government turned down that request , and the US authorities are very unlikely to co-operate with this latest international arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge , our correspondent says .
But four years after the death of Mr Couso , his family have achieved a symbolic victory , he says .
There is something interesting going on , culturally , with YouTube .
To see what I am talking about , watch this video .
Also , be sure read the text description of the incident given on the right ( click the " more " link ) :
After watching the video , read some of the 1,000 + comments that people have left to share their opinions .
Then watch this :
And this :
We have three different views of the same incident , all filmed at the scene and posted within a few hours of it happening .
Now think back to the " Rodney King incident " of 1991 .
No one would have believed what happened to Rodney King had there not been video tape of the event .
And the tape had a powerful effect on how people interpretted the event .
That was one of the first cases of " inverse surveillance " -- citizens watching the police with cameras .
With YouTube , the same thing happens , but now there are many people taking video and all of the video is available world - wide an hour later .
The same thing happened when 50 cent was arrested this year in NYC ( look at how many people have cameras ) :
Then there are day - to - day incidents like this : Because of places like YouTube , combined with ubiquitous camera phones , we eventually arrive at the point where everything you do in public is filmed .
If you do anything that has even a whiff of being " interesting " or " controversial " or " confrontational " , it gets filmed by someone .
Police , to some extent , are used to this .
In some places all traffic stops get filmed by cameras in police cars .
Celebrities are also familiar with it because of the paparazzi .
But I do n't think the rest of us are used to it .
It changes the entire meaning of " going out in public . "
ANYTHING you do has the potential to be filmed and broadcast worldwide , often to your detriment .
That 's a pretty big ( potential ) price to pay for going out in public .
Something I also wonder -- why on YouTube do we see less video of people doing good things ?
For example , paramedics saving a person 's life on the street ?
When Britney went to her mother 's birthday party , she wore a lace dress with a pink bra .
Now it 's her sister 's birthday , and Brit 's wearing a see - through top and no bra .
Classy !
Brit put on her best Cleopatra makeup , popped on an apple cap with what appears to be a built - in Dynel wig , velveteen hot pants , her always - there cowgirl boots and what looks like a plastic , salmon colored purse ... the perfect ensemble to celebrate lil ' sis Jamie 's 16th birthday at Ruth 's Chris Steakhouse in Beverly Hills .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , accused of letting a political appointee meddle in the science of endangered species , said on Friday it could reverse eight decisions if it finds they were inappropriately influenced by political concerns .
The decisions under review affected species as varied as the Hawaiian picture - wing fly and the white - tailed prairie dog .
All involved input from Julie MacDonald , a former deputy assistant secretary who resigned in May after government scientists complained of political interference .
Dale Hall , head of the Fish and Wildlife Service , said hundreds of endangered species decisions from MacDonald ’s five - year tenure were reviewed after her resignation , and eight were singled out for further evaluation and possible reversal .
“ These are important because it ’s a blemish , I believe , on the scientific integrity of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior , so we ’re going to place a pretty high priority on trying to get these done , ” Hall said in a telephone briefing .
Without being definitive , Hall indicated reversals were likely : “ We would n’t be doing them ( the re-evaluations ) if we did n’t at least suspect that the decision will be different . ”
The selection of which decisions to review was made by the agency ’s regional directors , whose original judgments were changed by MacDonald , Hall said .
Hall gave no timetable for the re-evaluations , but said three had already begun in response to court challenges against them .
The other five will not begin until the start of the federal fiscal year in October .
INTERFERING WITH SCIENCE
The Union of Concerned Scientists , which has reported extensively on political interference with science in the United States , gave the announcement a qualified endorsement .
“ While we welcome the revisiting of decisions where political interference has been documented , the list of species under consideration is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive , ” the group ’s Francesca Grifo said in a statement .
“ If the agency truly wants to get to the bottom of this , then asking the regional directors to identify the problems is not enough .
Any agency scientist should have been able to provide input . ”
A report earlier this year by the Interior Department ’s inspector general gave numerous examples of political appointees in the Bush administration interfering with science at the Fish and Wildlife Service , but focused on MacDonald .
The report said she was heavily involved in editing scientists ’ reports to favor business interests and had showed internal documents to lobbyists .
It noted she was trained as a civil engineer with no formal education in the natural sciences , such as biology .
The decisions under new review involve the following species : the white - tailed prairie dog , Preble ’s meadow jumping mouse ( two decisions ) , the Hawaiian picture - wing fly , the Arroyo toad , the Southwestern willow flycatcher , the California red-legged frog and the Canada lynx .

People who need such a vehicle do n't need it 100 % of the time , maybe not even most of the time .
I 've wondered , why do n't states make it more affordable to own multiple vehicles by making it possible to have one set of plates ( and a special , lower - cost insurance policy ) , so that an owner or lessee of multiple vehicles can have only one vehicle on the road at a time , mounting the plates on each vehicle as needed or desired .
That could be enough incentive for some people to buy or lease a second , more fuel efficient car to use just for commuting .
If you check the credits for the new environmentally - themed feature , The Green Chain , it looks like the cast should be arriving at the premiere in starships and protesting logging on New Caprica .
The new movie about the battles between loggers and environmentalists stars two Battlestar Galactica stars — Tricia Helfer ( Number Six ) and Tahmoh Penikett ( Karl “ Helo ” Agathon
Helfer , who recently guest - starred on “ Supernatural , ” plays Leila Cole , an eco-friendly superstar who comes to logging country to speak out against clearcuts .
Penikett , who recently guest - starred on “ Smallville ” plays a logger coping with layoffs by moonlighting as a firefighter .
The Green Chain ’s executive producer , Donna Wong - Juliani , has her own Battlestar connection .
Her son , Alessandro Juliani , plays Felix Gaeta .
The Green Chain ’s writer - director , Mark Leiren - Young , is also a genre vet .
He was a story editor and writer on the first season of Lifetime ’s hit TV series , “ Blood Ties ” .
The lifelong comic fan is currently writing for a new hour - long drama series in development with No Equal Entertainment based on the Marvel comic , “ Moon Knight . ”
“ The Collector ” , a syndicated series about the Devil ’s deals , guest - starred Tricia Helfer as a VJ with multiple personalities and earned her a Leo Award nomination for “ Best Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series . ”
Scott McNeil , who stars as a logger in the movie , is one of the busiest and best known animation and anime actors in the world .
His roles include Wolverine in “ The X - Men , ” Duo Maxwell in “ Gundam Wing , ” Piccolo in “ Dragon Ball Z ” and Rattrap , Dinobot and Waspinator in “ Beast War . ”
The Green Chain ’s world rights ( excluding the US ) were recently picked up by Christal Films Distribution and the film is set to premiere on the festival circuit later this year .

Collateral damage is nothing more than a euphemism for state - sponsored mass murder .
It is the term given to people killed in military actions who were " not intentionally targeted . "
In reality , this is pure propaganda .
It has always been morally just to protect innocent people against aggressors .
But , on the other hand , it has never been moral , nor has it ever been necessary , to bomb cities filled with innocent people .
We rarely see the faces or know the identities of those reduced to the status of collateral damage .
It is a gray area where the victim becomes less than a person .
Interestingly enough , during the Vietnam War , both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara used the term " integers " to describe those civilian deaths that they preferred not to have publicized as human beings .
Such is the amazing power of doublespeak .
Civilians killed incidental to what the dominant power refers to as " progress " are called collateral damage , while those killed intentionally are victims of " terrorism . "
But all too often , unfortunately , it 's quite difficult to tell the difference between the two .
Governments regularly do one and call it the other , but the end result is still the same ; dead civilians .
So , no matter name you give it ( War on Terrorism , Spreading Democracy , Regime Change , Defending our Freedoms ) , when war is taken to a civilian population , is n't it nothing more than terrorism and murder , even if you later call the victims collateral damage ?
Come to think of it , there is probably no term that is more repugnant and immoral than the one that discards the importance of other people 's lives are mere collateral damage ; especially when their deaths become incidental to the conquest of some military or political objective .
As collateral damage , these people suffer the same outcome as fat discarded by a butcher .
It is important to note , however , that those who use the term " collateral damage " strategically always seem to apply it to foreigners ; such as Iraqis and Afghanis .
Even when a two - ton , laser - guided bomb is dropped on a small village , it 's claimed that the mass deaths were " inadvertent " and " tragic , " and that they could have been prevented if the " terrorists " would just stop fighting back , or as some of us call it , resisting .
So , rather than treating these people as human beings victimized by evil actions , they are simply written off as collateral damage , i.e. , rubble .
No moral person would ever dream of referring to a policeman killed while trying to save people from the World Trade Center as collateral damage , even though that policeman was also an " inadvertent " victim , and not the direct target of the attack .
We can all acknowledge the fact that the policeman was a real person , and not just an unfortunate statistic .
That person was the victim of a heinous act of violence which caused his death .
Likewise , the innocent victims of our government 's actions in the " war on terror " are more than a statistic .
They are also victims of heinous acts of violence .
Apologists for American soldiers killing people in Iraq would like us to believe that their killings are justifiable because they 're done in " self - defense . "
The awful truth is that most killing in the course of this or any war is simply murder disguised as self defense .
Otherwise , we'd have to accept as morally valid , a thought process similar to this :
Those Iraqis were trying to kill ME so I just had to kill THEM .
Like my leaders said , they were supposed to welcome me as a liberator , and let me secure their country for them .
I 'm here to help these poor people , and all they do is shoot at me !

Let 's try to simplify this self - defense argument .
U.S. soldiers participate in the invasion of Iraq , which is a country thousands of miles away from home .
The soldiers have their weapons loaded , with fingers on the trigger .
Meanwhile , there are Iraqi citizens who object to their country being invaded by a foreign army .
They proceed to load their own weapons , and point them at invading U.S. soldiers .
American soldiers then shoot and kill the " foreigners " in their home country .
According to American politicians and military leaders , such killings are not murder ; they 're self - defense .
These " insurgents " should have just given up and surrendered peacefully .
With this type of thinking , I suppose that if a person were to stand on your driveway and aim a loaded weapon at you , they would be justified in killing you if you were to point a gun at them . , under this code of collateral damage , would be the ones using self - defense !
Oh , you might say that the robber was trespassing , right ?
U.S. troops are doing the same , are they not ?
We 've heard it called regime change , spreading democracy , fighting terrorism and more .
But , what else can it be called other than trespassing ?
It is nothing more than an invasion , which is trespassing at the barrel of a gun .
When a State drops bombs on another country and brings about the inevitable deaths of innocents , just because it did n't want to kill them .
It can never be innocent itself , whatever the justification .
It can never be anything but fully responsible for each and every death it causes .
Reducing men , women and children to statistics will never eliminate the overall culpability of the aggressor State .
The obvious assumption that the murderers make is that our goals and our lives have more importance than that of any foreigners , and therefore , in order to achieve these goals , we have the right to murder them without repercussion .
Because there is never a penalty for the " winners , " it must be a right ... right ?
But what kind of right could this be ?
Is it an inherent right , a legal right , a moral right ?
In fact , it 's none of these ; .
This is the same kind of right that has been exercised by tyrants throughout history ; giving them justification to murder millions to achieve a " greater good .
" So , these unfortunate people , the collateral damage of war , have been forced to become martyrs for the unchecked power that caused their deaths .
They have been discarded for the sake of the higher cause ; not based on their own beliefs , but ours .
It should be quite self - evident by this point in history , that anyone who claims to believe in freedom and equality could never use the phrase " collateral damage " without being an utter hypocrite .
Such hubris must not continue forever .
The murder of innocent people is murder , period .
Yes , it is true that innocents die when war is waged .
Yes , innocent people will always die when their cities are bombed and their homes are invaded .
This is all the reason that should be needed to vehementlythat our government engages in !
In the end it does n't matter what you call it .
A half - million Iraqi children who died as a result of " sanctions " do n't care what you call it .
They , and their brethren who are dying today , do n't care about the doublespeak used by so - called scholars , party loyalists , military apologists , or any other supporters of our brutal wars - they 're dead .

Representative Don Young is a man of few words .
He offered an obscene gesture the other day in response to a reporter curious about his travels as king of the Congressional pork dispensers .
Far from his home district in Alaska , Mr. Young , the ranking Republican for transportation spending , was feted by Florida land developers who chipped in $ 40,000 for his re-election drive last year .
Fast as quo follows quid , Mr. Young tailored a choice piece of Florida pork  $ 10 million in taxpayer money for a cross-wetlands connection to the federal interstate .
The connector would boost the value of thousands of acres that Mr. Young ’s contributors want to develop over the objections of environmentalists .
Last year ’s transportation bill was stuffed with 6,300 budget - busting earmarks  far too many of them chunks of blatant pork like the road connector .
What made this one special was that the local congressman said he never sought the money .
Local officials voted twice against the connector .
Mr. Young ran into flak last year for customizing a costly pork project for the Alaska outback that was dubbed the Bridge to Nowhere .
At least that was his turf .
In Florida , he eliminated the middleman , the elected congressman .
The Democrats took the House majority on promises to end abusive earmarking , but the Republicans say the new majority is up to the old tricks .
We hold the new appropriations chairman , David Obey of Wisconsin , to his promise for reform as he wades through 30,000 earmark requests .
“ I do n’t give a damn if people criticize me or not , ” Mr. Obey snapped .
He vowed that staff workers would investigate and publicly highlight each earmark to assure “ some idiot ” in the House is n’t profiteering .
Now there ’s a higher road for Congress .

For the past number of years , whenever I ’ve needed to write a parser for a language , I ’ve turned to Terence Parr ’s ANTLR .
It ’s a wonderful piece of software , far more capable than the old standbys lex and yacc .
Just as appealing is the fact that it generates recursive - descent parsers that are easy to read and debug .
Compare an ANTLR - generated parser with the pages of pushdown automaton state transition muck that yacc and its descendants generate and you ’ll quickly appreciate the clean nature of ANTLR ’s code .
In the Haskell world , a close approximation to ANTLR is available in the form of Parsec , a library for building parsers using combinators .
Where ANTR has its own special syntax , and you run a tool that generates code in some target language , you construct a Parsec parser entirely in Haskell .
The Parsec documentation is excellent , with a great tutorial that makes it clear how easy it is to use Parsec to build a parser .
In my case , I wanted to parse a simple language that has some structure , but no formal grammar , and a few nasty corners .
This language makes heavy use of key / value pairs , in which the keys and values are usually just contiguous non-whitespace strings .
In other words , a typical pair might be “ “ , or “ “ .
Sequences of pairs are separated by white space , so three pairs might look like “ “ .
It ’s easy to recognise one of these pairs .
One of the lurking nasty bits of this language lies in how it represents string literals .
A key in this case will be the word " " , and the value will be the text of the string .
Unfortunately , the text of the string is n't escaped in any way , so a literal might look like " " .
Oh , no !
Where did my nice regular language go ?
Fortunately , a string literal is always followed immediately by a pair that tells me how long it was , with a key of " length " , and a value that 's an integer .
To further complicate matters , there can be an arbitrary amount of white space between the end of the string literal and the start of the length pair ; some of this white space can belong to the string , while the remainder is padding .
So in order to recognise a string properly , I have to identify the start of the string , scan for the length pair , parse the number for the length , then use that to chop out the actual string to return as the value of this production .
( Aside :
The astute reader will notice that we 're sunk if a string literal contains a piece of text that looks like a valid length pair .
This would allow an attacker to inject key / value pairs that could lead us off into the weeds , depending on what we are trying to do with all of this data .
Consider the example below , where the " real " string is in italics , but it contains an embedded string that we can't distinguish .
Kids , remember what mom said !
When a stranger comes up to you and suggests that you cruft together a simple file format , just say " no " to dumping unquoted literal strings out !
You never know who 'll be watching ! )
If I want to be able to recognise a normal pair or one of these bizarre string creatures , it 's easy enough .
If ( yet to be defined ) does n't match , will " unconsume " the characters it ate trying , and thenwill try to useto match .
The key tois that it usesto recognise the " length=n " string .
That function returns both the accumulated string that it scanned and the value of the length pair :
This definition ofis very similar to Parsec 's standardcombinator .
Finally , let 's provide a definition ofthat avoids " do " notation , just because I could : What I like about Parsec is the ability to do things in a freewheeling manner when necessary , like parse these nasty string literals ; this simple task is rather more painful with a traditional parser / lexer generator .
Oh , and I have n't mentioned the error messages that Parsec generates .
If a parse fails , it does a nice job of telling you where the problem occurred , and what it was expecting to match at the time .
Compared to trying to produce meaningful errors from yacc , it 's rather a lot nicer .
There are a few downsides to using Parsec , compared to more traditional tools .
The biggest is that a normal parser generator will tell you if your production rules will lead to nontermination ( e.g. via a production whose RHS matches its LHS , like foo -> foo ) .
Since Parsec is n't a parser generator , it does n't have the ability to inspect productions ; you 'll get an infinite loop at runtime .
However , the Parsec documentation does a good job of explaining its pitfalls , and how you can work around them .
It 's a lovely piece of software .
Television screens are getting bigger ... and so are electricity bills
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News Magazine
They 're big and bright and flying off the shelves in the seasonal spending spree .
Flat - screen televisions are accounting for eight out of 10 TVs bought this Christmas - casting their bulky old predecessors into the shade .
But while the cash tills might be ringing , there have been warnings about the environmental impact of this big - screen switch - over .
According to the government - funded Energy Saving Trust , plasma televisions which are 50 % bigger than their cathode - ray tube equivalents " consume about four times more energy " .
Gas guzzlers
In terms of carbon emissions , the EST says old - style TVs produce 100kg of climate - warming CO2 per year - while larger , plasma screens ( there are no small plasma TVs ) will pump out 400kg .
Flat - screen televisions are a big seller this Christmas
Supporting these claims , the EST points to research from the government - funded Market Transformation Programme , which advises the government on sustainability policy .
This says that , on average , the power consumption of a cathode - ray screen is 3.4 watts per screen inch , while plasma uses 9.4 watts per screen inch - based on figures from 2005 .
So does that make these sleek new TVs the gas - guzzling 4x4s of home entertainment ?
Not exactly .
Flat - screen
TVs broadly come in two varieties - plasma ( which go from about 42ins to an almost cinematic 100ins - plus , and LCD , which are smaller , but , crucially , getting bigger all the time ) .
Power hungry
Peter Raynes , professor of opto-electronic engineering at the University of Oxford , says modern LCD screens use a similar amount of power to bulky old cathode ray tube ( CRT ) televisions .
Old - style televisions are on the way out
Plasma televisions are currently less efficient and will use more power , he says .
But Professor Raynes cautions about the difficulty in objectively comparing like with like - because there are unlikely to be any CRT televisions on the High Street which are the same size as plasma .
Manufacturer Philips , which makes CRT , LCD and plasma televisions , even rejects the broad assumption that plasma screens are inherently more power hungry - a spokesperson saying there was no clear , standardised , consensus on energy use .
And with rapid advances in technology , power consumption for all screens is set to become more efficient - rendering any current forecasts redundant .
Consumer power
But is this really about technology or about consumers hankering after bigger and bigger TVs ?
The stand - by button can undermine any attempt at energy efficiency
The specifications from Philips ' range shows how much it 's the upscaling in size that matters - and also how difficult it is to generalise about power consumption .
Philips has won a European green television of the year award with its 42ins LCD television - which has a power consumption of 210 watts .
In comparison , a 42ins plasma screen uses 230 watts .
Not much different ?
Well , there 's another plasma screen , the same size , same manufacturer , which uses 365 watts .
Then look at Philips ' old - style televisions , where a medium - size 28ins widescreen only uses 87 watts and a portable 39 watts .
And an LCD portable uses 42 watts .
And the 50ins plasma screen ?
A bumper - size 400 watts .
So you can be eco-conscious , buy the " green telly of the year " , and still end up using twice as much energy as the old box you 've thrown out .
Confusing ?
John Twidell , adviser on energy to the Institute of Physics , says consumers need to be given much more straightforward information about power consumption .
' Eco-mode '
Another key issue for energy consumption , says Dr Twidell , is turning off machines at the mains - and avoiding leaving televisions on stand - by .
There 's no point worrying about economising , if a television on stand - by is chewing up the power all day and night , every day .
There are other issues surrounding television energy consumption - such as the brightness of screens .
The Market Transformation Programme warns that televisions are often set for display in shops , rather than the much lower levels of light needed for home use .
It suggests that creating an " eco-mode " for screen brightness could cut power consumption by 15 % .
And disposing of the unwanted CRT televisions is going to be a challenge in itself - with an anticipated 70 million old - style sets to be dumped by the end of the decade .
Once you 've sorted out the power , there 's still an even bigger question .
Where do you put a 50ins flat - screen television in your living room ?
I was in an electrical retail shop last week - not to buy a mega - silly TV .
But I reckon plasma TVs can save CO2 emissions and energy because if I had one I would never need my central heating on .
They get so hot I felt like I was in the tropics in the TV section .
Stu , Braintree
Our notion of progress seems to be getting rather warped these days .
We are expected to dump old TVs ( no recycling available ) then buy new ones that use too much power , take up too much space , presumably boom out the ' high - quality ' sound even louder so that it annoys neighbours through the thin walls of the poorly - built modern flat / house you 've paid too much for .
Terry , London
Sometimes I 'm hopeful that we will be able to turn away from the environmental crisis we are heading for , but then I read stories like this and reality hits me in the face again .
Surely there must be a balance between enjoying yourself and being environmentally responsible as well ?
I just hope that the manufacturers of these televisions are working hard to reduce their energy consumption .
Let 's all take some responsiblity for the future of our planet .
Lucy Turner , Eastbourne
Who cares about how much power they consume ?
I know I do n't .
It does n't matter what you do , there 's always somebody sticking their oar in , whinging about eco this and eco that .
If they 're that concerned about it , why do n't they develop a TV that does n't use as much power .
I have a 42 " Plasma , it 's switched off at the mains at night watched for 25 mins while I get ready for work and about 4 hours on an evening after my evening meal .
The majority of people are not like these un-employed people who buy TV's like this from credit companies and sit on their rears all day watching Trisha and eating pot noodles , pumping out children all year so they do n't have to work .
I paid for my TV outright , I can buy what I want to buy when I want to buy it and use it how I see fit ( within reason of course ! )
Steven , Newcastle - Upon- Tyne
I 've just been trying to compare the running costs of LCD and CRT computer monitors .
The accessible monitors in my workplace do n't display power ratings , nor is it at all easy to find the price of a kilowatt - hour online , despite the numerous so - called ' energy comparison ' websites .
If this dearth of information is typical , how are we to make environmentally - friendly buying choices ?
As usual , there is an urgent need for stringent , simple and standardised labelling of goods and services .
Jason Mills , Accrington
I 've got a 4 year old 42 " plasma screen which I was amazed to find out pulls 4.3 Amps which is 1032 Watts !
I 've just purchased a new LCD TV which only uses 185 Watts of power which will save me almost £ 1000 in electricity over 5 years and reduce my contribution to CO2 emissions .
Richard , Middlesbrough
I am a service engineer , a standard 42 " Plasma screen at normal settings for home use , should consume around 300 watts of power .
Most of this is lost as heat .
Improvements in design can hugely reduce this but add to the cost .
If demand is apparent manufacturers will respond .
So ask for a low energy set .
Robin Metcalfe , Sheffield
A lot of plasmas have an energy save option which subtly turns down the brightness .
Beyond that it heats the room so meaning less use of central heating , so it 's not all bad .
John , Southampton
Our previous colour TV , a modest 26 inch CRT , used 850 watts .
Our current 28 inch CRT uses 220 watts .
Time always brings efficiency in the consumer electronics market , so be patient .
However , plasma will never be as energy efficient as LCD due to its screen heat losses generated by the individual plasma bulbs .
Alan Jones , Lee on the Solent
A standby feature is included in appliances because turning off all current in the circuitry compromises the longevity of certain components .
No standby means more failure , more replacements and larger CO2 footprints .
Trent , London
My flatmate often turns our TV to standby then walks up to it and puts the remote control on top of it !
It is so frustrating .
Manufacturers can help by taking away the standby feature , but in the meantime people need to change their lazy habits - and it saves money !
Mark , London
I do n't understand this fixation with huge screens .
I have a 28 " CRT and it dominates the room already - and the picture still outperforms any LCD / Plasma I 've seen .
Oli , Edinburgh
Why can't you turn off
TVs using the remote rather than only being able to put it on stand - by ?
I often put it on stand - by meaning to then turn it off , but then forget .
Julie Sadler , Leeds
Please , please , please , can somebody shut these people up ?
Why , in this age of modern technology can we not enjoy the ' fruits of our labours ' ?
I am now the owner of a 42 " plasma screen , and wonder how I managed before .
The picture is better in all ways , and my electricity bill has hardly changed - so where does the extra energy come from ?
Graham , Gorleston
With a mature , modern and science - based policy on nuclear power , we could all have televisions as large as we wanted with no need for the guilt .
Environmental lobbyists need to realise that , since the ' energy footprint ' of each UK citizen is going to rise over time regardless of how many energy saving lightbulbs we all buy or how many acres of countryside we will have covered with wind turbines in 50 years time , they need to embrace the solutions we have right now , and issue loud demands for their implementation .
Nuclear energy will save this planet ; whinging about televisions and pining after vague ' alternatives ' will condemn us all .

An 80 - year - old man survived a collision between two gliders by jumping out with a parachute and spending the night on a snow - covered mountain .
Police in the Swiss canton of Graubünden said rescue services found the co-pilot of the two - seater glider from Germany sheltering in the downed plane 's cockpit on Sunday at a height of 2,700 metres ( 8,850 ft ) on the Piz Nuna mountain , about 90 miles southeast of Zurich .
The pilot , a 64 - year - old German , died in the crash on Saturday , as did a 70 - year - old Swiss national flying the other aircraft .
The cause was being investigated , police said .
Palestinian minister tries to quit over Gaza security
The new Palestinian government hit its first crisis yesterday when the interior minister tried to resign because of the failure to tackle the growing lawlessness in the Gaza strip .
The Hamas prime minister , Ismail Haniyeh , rejected the resignation of Hani al - Qawasmi , who then agreed to stay on .
The coalition government , made up largely of politicians from the rival factions Hamas and Fatah , was welcomed by Palestinians when it was formed nearly three months ago .
Mr Qawasmi had attempted to rein in lawlessness in Gaza but was reportedly frustrated by a lack of cooperation .

New president continues with grand designs
Turkmenistan's new president has ordered construction of a luxurious district in the capital Ashgabat that will include a 220 metre ( 722ft ) skyscraper , an artificial lake and golf courses , the president 's office said yesterday .
The grand project is the first to be approved by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov , who took over after the death last December of President Saparmurat Niyazov .
Niyazov was fond of prestige projects and built a ski resort in the Central Asian desert nation .
The new district will be built by 2011 , by a Turkish company , the president 's office said .
It did not give the cost .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
In the cutthroat business of real estate , U.S. - based firm Baytree Capital Associates has been chosen to market Dracula ’s Castle .
Archduke Dominic Habsburg , who lives in New York State , and his family retained the private investment firm to market Bran Castle and the surrounding property in the Transylvanian region of Romania .
“ They ’re looking to flat out sell the entire project , but they are particular about who they sell it to , ” said Michael Gardner , Baytree chairman .
“ While they are amenable to someone building a resort that continues the castle and such , they ’re not amenable to blood dripping on swords .
This is not going to be Vampire Land . ”
While he would not say how much the property would go for , he suspects it would be in the nine - figure euro range .
He expects to start marketing the property in about 60 days .
The castle and ancillary buildings are located on 22 acres and additional acres also may be attached to the sale .
The property is about 20 minutes away from an international airport that is currently under construction and near the Brasov ski area .
The association of Bran , Castle as Dracula ’s Castle can be traced back to Irish author Bram Stoker , who used the castle as his inspiration for the settings of his 1897 novel , Dracula .
The Romanian government has about two years left to operate the castle as a museum , which hosts about 450,000 visitors a year , Gardner said .
The castle originally was built as a fortress in 1377 and was given to the Romanian royal family in 1920 .
The castle became a possession of the state in 1947 and was transformed into a museum in 1957 .
The Romanian government returned the property to the Habsburg family in 2006 .
Gardner said the property will probably be marketed to private equity firms and hotel real estate investment trusts , but the buyer will probably be European .
Carlo Petrini saw Prince Charles last week and has the ear of top politicians .
Jasper Gerard meets the man with a mission to change the way we eat
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday June 24 2007
The article below used a quotation which linked Monsanto to seeds which ' include a terminator gene so they can't be replanted ' .
This is not true ; to date , there are no such seeds in existence , and Monsanto is committed not to use or commercialise such technology .
Not since Jesus rustled up a feast from some fishes and a few loaves of bread - beat that , Nigella - have we invested food with such spiritual qualities ; and if food has become the faith of a decadent West , its high priest is Carlo Petrini .
When the founder of the Slow Food Movement met the Prince of Wales last week it was hard to say who was having the audience .
Ditto when the Italian campaigner and writer met the Conservative leader David Cameron , and David Miliband , the Environment Secretary .
When in America Petrini might pop in on Barack Obama or Al Gore .
Time has included him in a series of ' European heroes ' , who created the ' ethical consumer ' .
Petrini came to prominence two decades ago when he stopped McDonald 's opening by Rome 's Spanish Steps .
His non-lethal weapon of choice at the time ?
Plates of penne .
But does he have a bigger point , or is he merely a kind of modish Dalai Lama figure for those who think nothing of paying a small fortune for purple broccoli , dusted with powdered linseed or potatoes sold ' with added earth ' from Kensington 's new and uber - fashionable emporium , Whole Foods Market ?
Prince Charles certainly seems to find more in him .
Petrini has become the Prince 's new guru .
As Charles led him around Highgrove , the interpreter grew embarrassed , so matey did the two seem , with the normally formal heir to the throne greeting the campaigner as ' My dear Carlo ' .
Several peers were kept waiting as Petrini 's audience over - ran .
The two are now in constant correspondence and are planning another meeting later this summer .
During this , his only interview while in Britain , Petrini reveals he has moved on from agitating against McDonald 's and instead urges us to rise up against Monsanto for patenting seeds which he condemns as ' violence ' against the developing world .
He declares French food to be in a worse state than ours , which will cause consternation across the Channel .
He also has harsh words for the celebrity chef culture , obsessed with ' recipes , recipes , recipes ' .
Indeed , for one so idolised by the privileged , his views are radical .
He is more likely to tell you about the ingredients of a just agrarian society than the perfect artichoke risotto .
The Slow Food Movement , opening its first branch in Britain , boasts more than 80,000 members worldwide .
He has organised countless small - scale agricultural projects to bolster regional gastronomic traditions , and is leading the growing debate about the ethics of food , spreading his message that it should be delicious , environmentally friendly and socially fair .
Which is a big task for a quarter pounder .
For one who believes in slowness , he is always on the go .
He has founded a school of gastronomy in Italy and is bringing to Britain his increasingly successful American campaign to ensure every school has a garden - all of which is pretty impressive for an erstwhile radio journalist .
He must make an unlikely friend of Charles .
' I consider him the patron of the Slow Food Movement , our spiritual guide , ' Petrini replies passionately .
' He has been a visionary , with his passion for organic production and a harmonious relationship with nature .
' People thought he was just romantic , a poet , and that his approach would n't have any economic impact ; but his way is the only salvation for the planet .
Those who said he was not a practical soul should now apologise . '
Amid the charm there are sharp points .
So while he enthuses about Miliband as a future Prime Minister , he criticises plans to ease restrictions on supermarket building on the edge of towns .
' You can not separate food production from the environment , ' he says .
' We need to re-localise food and avoid food miles . '
He does not look like anyone 's caricature of a gastronome : thin , serious and faintly abstemious , eschewing breakfast at his boutique London hotel in favour of filter coffee .
' I am a gastronome , ' he smiles .
' Not a glutton .
Being a gastronome can actually mean eating less , but better . '
The only hint of his passion lies in his gold lapel badge of a snail , reflecting his belief in the languid rhythms of Mediterranean life .
Still , as he grows more expansive , you can easily picture him on a terrace scented with bougainvillea , sipping Barolo .
He says you must , every day , eat dinner with the one you love .
He contrasts his ideal , in classic Italian style , with the reality : ' A woman cooks some food , and no one smiles at her or says " thank you " .
Neither is there any fascination with food .
In Mediterranean Europe , there is still that conviviality , that ritual .
The most important thing about eating is to enjoy the moment of affection .
A civilisation that loses this becomes very poor .'
This is a hard sell to a nation fed from the Tesco ready - meals aisle .
Yet Petrini does not merely argue about supermarkets ; he works to save traditional foods by setting up local networks , be it for Cornish pilchards , Malaysian rice or Greek cheese .
Nor does he re-hash the usual condemnations of globalisation , instead arguing that learning about and helping other cultures fosters ' a virtuous globalisation ' .
He does not always paint the little guy as victim - keepers of small shops must shape up .
' They must become cultured people , ' he says ' who can talk knowledgeably about food and how it is produced . '
It is certainly optimistic to envisage Arkwright from Open All Hours ruminating on the production values of polenta .
' I like to imagine the hands of the people who grew the food , transported it , processed it and cooked it before it was served to me , ' he says .
How has Italy largely avoided Tesco-fication ?
' We have supermarkets too , ' he says .
' But we have the ancient tradition in every small town of a market .
The further north you go in Europe , the weaker that is . '
Does he detect much progress in Britain ?
' Choice has improved , but I 'm sceptical of the real quality .
' Still , France has suffered even more than England with the growth of these huge supermarkets like Carrefour .
I know English people have this romantic idea about Provence , but in many places in France the agrarian ideal has become a memory . '
If that is true even in the land of the slow lunch , as captured by Manet , is n't his movement a nostalgic distraction for wealthy , leisured foodies rather than a manifesto for our grittier , busier age ?
' We need to educate people .
Food is not too expensive , it is too cheap . '
Hmm .
Statistics out on the day of our interview said the recent rise in inflation was caused almost entirely by food prices : for the single mother in a tower block it probably does n't seem that cheap .
' In Italy people spend 12 per cent of their budget on food , and 10 per cent on cell phones .
It used to be accepted that food would be our biggest expense .
So in the scale of our values we have to restore food . '
It does not help prices , he says , that gaining organic registration is expensive and cumbersome for farmers , so ' absurdly ' the system favours farmers who make least effort .
Prices are also pushed up by an insistence on buying produce flown to shops out of season .
If European Union farm policies are ' disastrous ' , America , he believes , has made ' even more dramatic choices , with less than 2 per cent of its population left tilling the soil ' .
As for President Bush pushing bio-fuel , Petrini dismisses the notion that ' land can become the new oil field ' .
But he says there are encouraging signs in America , with a small band of converts setting up slow food agricultural enterprises .
With starvation in the southern hemisphere and poor diets in the northern , he has scant interest in the twitter of celebrity chefs , whom he dismisses as ' reductive ' .
' Slow food tries to show people that gastronomy is about economics , anthropology , biological and genetic science . '
Rather than making another lamentable reality TV show - ' pornographic bombardment ' - Gordon Ramsay et al should ' go and cook in some care homes ' .
He is pleased McDonald 's has not had a major breakthrough in Italy , but his attention has shifted : ' I 'm much more concerned about firms patenting seeds that have been passed down from generation to generation .
For me , to rob the people is a criminal act .
That 's a lot worse than McDonald's . '
He plans to set up a giant database of seeds to undermine patenting , which started when America 's patent office gave permission for the practice , endorsed by the World Trade Organisation .
' So in Mexico , birthplace of corn seeds , farmers have to pay patents to multi-nationals for new hybrids . '
Monsanto et al would , no doubt , say they have to invest large sums developing such seeds .
' These seeds include a terminator gene so they can't be replanted .
It is violence .
You can decide whether to go to McDonald 's but you can't decide whether to use seeds .
It is bio-piracy .
And now natural herbicides are being patented and sold for fortunes in supermarkets without giving any royalties to people in third world countries who discovered and developed them . '
How much of this will David Cameron swallow ?
And does Petrini back the new , cuddly Tory leader ?
' We tend to give credit to anyone who shares our ideas , though I naturally feel more affinity for the Labour party , ' Petrini says .
' We shall suspend judgment until and if Cameron gains power . '
But it is Miliband who excites him : ' I am following him with great interest .
I think he has enormous promise . '
So in half a century will the world have slowed to the melodious , civilised saunter of the Slow Food Movement , or will it have sped up into a fast food , disposable hell ?
He laughs : ' I think it will be a huge achievement if in 50 years humanity even exists .
The environmental destruction of our ecosystems is that dramatic .
But man has a choice and I hope he will make the right one I hope he will choose virtue . '
Take it easy
The Slow Food movement was founded by Petrini in Italy in 1989 .
It began as a response to the proposed opening of a McDonald 's in Piazza di Spagna , Rome .
It has more than 80,000 members in 100 countries .
Slow Food UK has more than 2,000 members .
The movement supports products under threat such as Canada 's Red Fife wheat , Morocco 's Argan oil and the Netherlands ' Eastern Scheldt lobster .
In the UK it backs Three Counties perry in the West Midlands and Cornish salted pilchards .
Slow Food movement tenets
' We believe in the diversity and locality in food and drink and that everyone has a fundamental right to pleasure and consequently the responsibility to protect the heritage of food . '
' We believe that food should taste good , be produced in a clean way that does not harm the environment , animal welfare or our health . '
' We believe food producers should receive fair pay for their work . '

Parsing , CFGs , and Type Hacking
This is what I have been playing with for the last day or so .
Haskell has a very nice monadic parser library for predictive parsing ( parsec ) , and a decent lex / yacc - style parser and lexer generator suite ( happy and alex ) .
That said , though , it ’s more fun and educational to write code than to worry about what ’s already been written , I set out to do something similar .
In particular , my goals are :
Write an LR parser , like that generated by parser generators .
Write readable grammars directly in Haskell source files , with no external parser generator utilities .
Let the type checker do its job by checking and inferring types for semantic rules .
I have n’t written the parsing code yet , but I did squeeze out something that I ’m nearly happy with for the first two goals .
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
All the language extensions I ’ll be using .
This is the bare - bones list ; the original list was eight or nine lines ..
So , if you were wonder whether this is a good post for new Haskellers just learning the language , there ’s your answer !
I need some way to represent variables ( in the CFG sense ) .
In order to ensure that everything is well - typed , I need some way to keep track of the type of the semantic value associated with each variable .
Here ’s what I did .
data Var a = Var String
And a right - hand side of each rule will have a sequence of variables and terminals .
Again , to keep the type information around , I ’ll need a sort of cons operator at the type level .
Here is that .
I defined a type , and also an operator that makes the type easier to use .
data RHS a b = RHS a b ( & ) = RHS -- a convenient operator infixr 5 &
And next , things get hard .
I ’m using a multiparameter type class , in the fine tradition of Haskell type hacking , to represent a relation between types .
My relation is defined in the following comment :
{- ( Action a b c ) means the following : A production with a right hand side of type : a may be associated with a semantic rule of type : b to produce a rule with semantic result type : c -} class Action a b c | a b -> c , a c -> b
In other words , the Action class will be used to ensure that the result type of a grammar production , the right - hand side of the production , and the type of the associated semantic rule are all consistent with each other .
The functional dependencies simply assert that if you know the types of the right - hand side and the semantic rule , this is enough to determine what the result will be after applying the semantic rule ; and that if you know the right - hand side and the result type , this is enough to determine what the type of the semantic rule needs to be .
There are a three base cases for this relation :
instance Action ( Var x ) ( x -> y ) y
This says that if a production has the form A -> B , where A has semantic values of type y , and B has semantic values of type x , then the semantic rule must have type ( x -> y ) .
If you think about it , this should make sense .
instance Action Char y y
This rule says that if the right - hand side of a production is a signle character ( a terminal , not a variable ) , the semantic rules should be a constant that matches the semantic type for the left - hand variable .
instance Action ( ) y y
This describes the situation for empty productions ( sometimes called epsilon or lambda productions ) .
Since leaving out any terms on the right - hand side of a rule is n’t an option , I use ( ) , called “ unit ” to represent an empty right - hand side .
Those are the base cases .
( As a side comment , only the last one is strictly necessary ; the first two are basically just syntactic convenience .
See below . )
Here ’s how rules with more than one symbol on the right - hand side are handled .
instance ( Action a b c ) =>
Action ( RHS ( Var x ) a ) ( x -> b ) c
The RHS operator defined earlier is used to build a list of sorts .
This rule says that adding a variable to the beginning of the right - hand side of a rule requires adding a parameter to the beginning of the semantic action , and that the result type stays the same .
This case handles right - hand sides that begin with a variable .
instance ( Action a b c ) =>
Action ( RHS Char a ) b c
Finally , this case handles right - hand sides that begin with a terminal ( a character ) .
The types of the semantic rule and result do n’t change , since a terminal is known in advance , so there ’s no need for it to carry semantic information .
Some more syntactic convenience makes it easier to write grammars .
Here I abuse monads to take advantage of the special syntax .
{- The RuleSet monad is used to define rules of a grammar in a convenient ' do ' notation .
-} data Rule = forall a b c .
( Action a b c ) =>
Rule ( Var c , a , b ) data RuleSet x = RuleSet ( [ Rule ] , x ) instance Monad RuleSet where a >>= k = let RuleSet ( r1 , v1 ) = a RuleSet ( r2 , v2 ) = k v1 in RuleSet ( r1 ++ r2 , v2 ) return x = RuleSet ( [ ] , x )
So a rule consists of a left - hand side , a right - hand side , and a semantic rule .
They are constrained to match each other by the Action class defined above .
A RuleSet is basically just a writer monad for lists of rules , but I defined it by hand just for the fun of it .
Now time to define an operator for building rules inside the monad :
( ==> ) :: ( Action a b c ) => Var c -> a -> b -> RuleSet () ( == > ) lhs rhs sem = RuleSet ( [ Rule ( lhs , rhs , sem ) ] , ( ) ) infixr 4 == >
It took a while to pick this .
All the good arrow - like operators seems to be taken !
Nevertheless , it does the job we want fairly well .
Notice that even though I ’m using an infix operator , there are three operands .
The normal usage looks like this :
lefthand == > righthand $ semanticrule
You ’ll see examples coming up .
The formal definition of a context - free grammar includes four things : a set of variables , a set of terminals , a set of productions , and a special start variable .
We ’ve got three : variables are values of type Var a .
Terminals are values of type Char .
Productions are values of type Rule .
Next , I need a start symbol .
This is defined once , outside of the monadic environment in which rules are defined .
At the same time , I through away the result value of the monad , which is useless since I was just exploiting the syntax rather than building a real monad .
{- Grammar .
A grammar is a set of rules together with a start symbol .
-} data Grammar a = Grammar ( Var a ) [ Rule ] grammar s ( RuleSet ( rs , x ) ) = Grammar s rs
And that ’s it !
Here ’s a sample grammar so we can see it work .
{- Sample grammar .
The parentheses in the let bindings are required : they force the rules to be monomorphic , which is needed for type checking to work properly .
-} g = let ( expr ) = Var " expression " ( term ) = Var " term " ( termmore ) = Var " term operator " ( fact ) = Var " factor " ( factmore ) = Var " factor operator " ( digit ) = Var " digit " ( digits ) = Var " digits " in grammar expr $ do expr == > term & termmore $ \\ x y -> y x termmore == > () $ \\ x -> x termmore == > '+' & term & termmore $ \\ x y z -> y ( x + z ) termmore == > '-' & term & termmore $ \\ x y z -> y ( x - z ) term == > fact & factmore $ \\ x y -> y x factmore == > () $ \\ x -> x factmore == > '*' & fact & factmore $ \\ x y z -> y ( x * z ) factmore == > '/' & fact & factmore $ \\ x y z -> y ( x / z ) fact == > ' (' & expr & ' ) ' $ \\ x -> x fact == > digit & digits $ \\ x y -> y x digits == > () $ \\ x -> x digits == > digit & digits $ \\ x y z -> y ( 10 * x + z ) digit == > ' 0 ' $ 0 digit ==> ' 1 ' $ 1 digit ==> ' 2 ' $ 2 digit == > ' 3 '
$ 3 digit ==> ' 4 ' $ 4 digit == > ' 5 ' $ 5 digit == > ' 6 ' $ 6 digit == > ' 7 ' $ 7 digit ==> ' 8 ' $ 8 digit == > ' 9 ' $ 9
( This is a modified grammar I had laying around from a set of compiler course notes .
It happens to have left recursion removed , but that ’s immaterial really . )
There are no type declarations in the entire grammar .
Ask GHCi for the type of g , though , and it answers .
g :: ( Fractional a ) => Grammar a
It correctly inferred that the result type of expr must be Fractional .
How ?
Because the third production for factmore uses the / operator .
This means that factmore must be Fractional , and the type ripples upward all the way to the start variable of expr .
The only thing I do n’t like at the moment is the need to use an explicit monomorphic binding ( the parentheses ) to declare non-terminals .
If that ’s not done , then the compiler thinks non-terminals can have different result types when used in different places , and the types it infers tend to be several pages long !
A nice solution to that would be good , but I ’m happy with everything else !
Please comment if there ’s something that can be improved .
I have sent the Apple security department the following email and got a return acknowledgement of receipt :
Gentlemen : I recently sent a macbook in for service .
It would not start .
I took it to Compusa here in XXXXX , and they in turn forwarded it to Apple for repair .
When I got it back the other day , IT HAD SOMEONE ELSE'S HARD DRIVE IN IT .
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION .
The macbook hard drive that I sent in may or may not have sensitive data on it , I am not sure yet , since it has been used mostly by my son at college .
I know that the hard drive that I received had data on it that I 'm sure the owner would not want just anyone to see .
I have figured out who the owner is ( I think ) and have left them a phone message to call me if they want me to do anything to get their hard drive back to them .
I have been in touch with Apple service department .
At first they suggested that we just wipe the drive I received , and reload the operating system .
While we were discussing that , I discovered that the drive I received was a 60 gb drive , whereas the original drive in my macbook was an 80gb .
So , Apple service is sending me a box to ship it back so that they can put an 80 gb drive in it .
During my discussions with Apple service , I asked if there was any way they could find out where my drive is , and they did not seem interested in pursuing that option .
I was surprised .
I even offered to give them the info from the drive in the macbook to see if they wanted to contact that person .
No interest , again .
It is one thing for a drive to be damaged or data lost in the process of service .
It is quite another for a drive to be lost , and sent to someone else !
Please let me know what you propose to do about this situation .
I could feel the air just pass me and then my car just did a 360 degree turn on the tracks
Paula Ceely
Paula Ceely , was driving her Renault Clio from Redditch , Worcestershire , to see her boyfriend at his parents ' home in Carmarthenshire for the first time .
She was trying to cross the line in the dark when she heard a train horn , realised she was on the track , and the train smashed into the car .
Transport police said drivers must take care with satellite navigation .
The car was carried about half a mile ( 800 m ) down the line by the Pembroke Dock to Swansea train , although Ms Ceely escaped injury in the incident near Whitland .
A second - year student at Birmingham University , she had borrowed the sat nav from her boyfriend , Tom Finucane , 21 .
" I put my complete trust in the sat nav and it led me right into the path of a speeding train , " she said .
" The crossing was n't shown on the sat nav , there were no signs at all and it was n't lit up to warn of an oncoming train .
" Obviously I had never done the journey before so I was using the sat nav - completely dependent on it , " she said .
" I came to this crossing at Ffynongain and there was like a metal gate , which looked like just a normal farmers ' gate with a red circle on it
" I thought it was a dead end at first and then there was a little sign saying , if the light is green , open the gates and drive through .
The car was hit up the railway line in the collision
" So I opened the gate , drove forward , closed the gate behind me and then went to go and open the gate in front of me .
" Then I heard this train and I noticed train tracks .
It was only then that I did realise I was on a train crossing .
" I just stood back and I just watched this train come in front of me .
" I could feel the air just pass me and then my car just did a 360 degree turn on the tracks and was knocked to the other side . "
She said her initial thought when she heard the horn had been to get into her car and move it .
" It was so quick that if I had done that , I would have been in the car when it was hit , " she said .
' Really lucky '
Ms Ceely said she had been " really lucky " .
" I can't completely blame the sat nav because up until there , it did get me where I needed to go , " she added .
We would advise people to use sat navs with due caution
Chief Inspector Paul Richards , British Transport Police
" If maybe I had been more aware of the situation , I would n't have had the accident .
" But I would be a bit more wary of the sat nav next time because they try to take you the shortest route , and not always the most accessible route and not always the safest route . "
She has returned to Wales since , but took the train rather than drive .
" I 'll never use a sat nav again .
You rely on them and if it all goes wrong , you 're horribly stuck .
" People should be more careful with them - you never know where they might lead you . "
Chief Inspector Paul Richards of British Transport Police said they were investigating the incident .
" We would advise people to use sat navs with due caution , " he added .
The hardest thingâ € ” but perhaps more sought - after than a Lafiteâ € ” is a list of good , interesting and affordable wines , for parties or for dinner Sunday to Thursday or even all week long .
Hereâ€™s my latest list , arranged not by preference , but by style , from lightest to fullest in white and red .
Why is it only a list of nine wines under $ 10 instead of the usual ten under ten ?
Because I ’m grumpy .
It ’s increasingly difficult to find good wines with character under ten dollars .
Blame part of it on the weak dollar ( though my list here is heavy on eurozone wines ) , blame it on producer greed –they ’re all just excuses !
Good wines , easy on the palate and on the wallet are what consumers want .
Sure , there are lots of great wines for $ 12 - $ 15 and many more from $ 15 – 20 , but these are out of reach for a lot of people to have with dinner on a given Tuesday .
Producers take note of this market opening , ready to be filled !
Meanwhile , we can fill up our wine storage areas with this value vino .
Whites
Muscadet Sur Lie , Hautes Noelles .
$ 9.99 ( find this wine )
This muscadet is great for oysters .
Do n’t you get tired of people saying that ?
I do .
I have oysters once every five years and this wine is too good to wait that long between bottles .
The “ sur lie ” aging gives this muscadet a richer mouthfeel but it still has the characteristic crsip acidity , faint melon note , and gentle briney quality .
Fire it up with grilled seafood on the deck .
( Importer : H2 Vino , Michael Skurnik )
Vina Sila , Naia , Verdejo , Rueda ( Spain ) , 2005 .
$ 10 ( find this wine )
This is a classic summer wine from a grape you may never have heard of : verdejo .
Fresh citrus notes , though not as much acidity as a kiwi sauvignon blanc , notes of honeysuckle and white flowers make this wine a great one as a warm - up ( with light , salty appetizers ) or as a cool down ( poolside ) .
Creta Olympias , Vilana , Crete 2006 , $ 10 .
( find this wine )
Vilana is usually a ho - hum wine that is churned out from the most recent vintage .
However , in a recent tasting of this off - the beaten - path variety , I found a few that were recommendable with this being the most affordable .
With delicate white flower aromas , the wine had a certain lush mouthfeel , with pleasant minerally verve .
This wine +
Greek salad + outside under umbrella on a sunny day = life is good .
RosÃ©
Domaine Houchart , Cotes de Provence rose , 2006 , $ 9 . ( find this wine )
This dark , vibrant , and dry rose has notes of strawberry and watermelon .
The lively acidity makes it a great food pairing .
While I think that rosÃ© should be less than $ 10 a bottle to be lots of fun I might be tempted to pay $ 12 for the Domaine Sorin .
But this blend of Grenache , Syrah , Cinsault , Cabernet Sauvignon , MourvÃ¨dre gets the job done on the deck in the summer .
Reds
Bodegas las Hormigas , Colonia las Liebres , bonarda , Mendoza ( Argentina ) .
2006 .
$ 4.49 ( find this wine )
This ridiculously priced bargain is one to buy with both hands .
This surprisingly light and lively , unfiltered old - vine bonarda from importer Marco de Graziaâ€™s project in Mendoza .
Itâ€™s now our house burrito wine .
Terra Rosa , Malbec Mendoza ( Argentina ) , 2004 .
$ 10 ( find this wine )
This is a fascinating wine of the global era : Patrick Campbell of Sonoma buys the fruit from local growers in Mendoza , makes the wine on location , then ships it back to California for bottling and an admirably reduced carbon footprint .
The cost - savings results in a wine of character , with good fruit and a pleasant and unusual level of acidity , at a very reasonable price .
It calls out for grilled meat .
CastaÃ±o , HÃ©cula , monastrell , Yecla ( Spain ) , 2004 $ 9 . ( find this wine )
I poured this wine recently at a tasting and people thought it was a $ 30 wine .
It has the wonderful mourvedre game quality on the nose , and serious but not aggressive tannins on the finish .
I actually came across a bottle of the 2001 of this wine in the Dr. Vino Cellar recently ( originally purchased for $ 7â € ” inflation ! ) and it was among the most rewarding $ 7 bottles of wine I have ever had .
Iâ€™ll throw some more of this one in the cellar and check back in a few years .
Try it now with game or sausage .
Castillo de Jumilla , monastrell , Yecla ( Spain ) .
2006 .
$ 9 . ( find this wine )
Given what I just wrote about how I feel about young monastrell , I wasnâ€™t planning on being wowed by this freshly squeezed 06 .
But I was .
Itâ€™s a gobs - of - fruit , beef - drippings kind of wine but with a pleasing lushness .
According to the wineâ€™s importer , there are only a few hundred cases of this excellent BBQ companion wine available .
Trentadue , Old Patch Red , Sonoma , 2004 , $ 8 . ( find this wine )
California Zinfandel has sadly seen prices escalate : consider this one greed relief .
Fans of big reds will find this a gulpable bargain with hints of dark fruits and faint spice .
The biggest plus here is thatâ € ” unlike some of the other wines on this listâ € ” the wine has broader availability .

Immediately following the American Civil War , some Confederate southerners were unwilling to live under the rule of the triumphant Union .
Reconstruction had gone badly for many of these former Confederates as their pre-war lifestyle was gone and replaced with economic impoverishment .
Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil seized upon this opportunity by offering an alternative .
He sent recruiters into Alabama , Louisiana , Georgia , South Carolina and Texas in search of experienced cotton farmers for his country .
Many southerners saw this as their only option for happiness ; to build a community with southern values in the jungle of Brazil .
They would become known as the Confederados .
Dom Pedro offered the disgruntled Southerners a package of tax breaks and grants if they would immigrate to Brazil .
General Robert E. Lee asked Southerners not to accept , but about 10,000 Confederates did take the Emperor up on his offer .
Eventually about sixty percent of the Confederados trickled back into the United States , but of those who stayed permanently , most became part of a Confederate - values colony northwest of Sao Paulo that was named Americana .
Americana was as much a southern city as one could have in the jungle .
Exploratory parties looking for good land to settle were met by cheering crowds and bands playing “ Dixie . ” Emperor Dom Pedro came to meet the new arrivals .
The colonists were ecstatic about what they saw and one wrote back to the Mobile Daily Register :
“ I have sugar cane , cotton , pumpkins , squash , five kinds of sweet potatoes , Irish potatoes , cornfield peas , snap beans , butter beans , ochre , tomatoes and fine chance at tobacco .
I have a great variety of fruits on my place .
I have made enough to live well on and am better pleased than other . ”
Confederate Memorial in Americana
Slavery was still legal in Brazil⁠ — which remained the case until 1888 ⁠ — but it turns out that was not a deciding factor for the Confederados settling there .
Primarily they used poorly - paid native workers who were more cost - effective than slaves .
Americana was far enough south that disease - infected mosquitoes were less of a problem than they were in Brazil ’s northern regions , but hostile natives were another matter .
Settlers occasionally disappeared due to kidnapping natives , especially doctors and dentists .
Eugene Harter in “ The Lost Colony of the Confederacy ” reports on one dentist captured by Indians who was fortunate to have his medical bag with him :
“ On demonstrating his curative powers , he soon rose to the position of “ medicine god ” in the tribe and lived in privileged comfort among them for three years before escaping back to civilization .
It cooled his ardor for Brazil .
It was believed he soon returned to his native Georgia . ”
The Confederados , despite the usual problems of colonization , thrived in an environment that had defeated many settlers before them .
Americana became an image of the antebellum period of the American south .
Many of the first Baptist churches in Brazil were started there .
They built public schools and provided education for their female children , something that was rare in Brazil .
They flew the Confederate flag and enjoyed the traditional southern meals of biscuits and gravy , black - eyed peas and , of course , grits .
The settlers had very European names like Stonewall and Butler .
They would bake pecan pies , have debutante balls , and sing southern hymns .
Only recently was the Confederate flag removed from the city ’s crest .
In 1906 , US Secretary of State Elihu Root made a quick stop in Americana , but had little to say to the expatriates .
Root later told his biographer that he left Americana weepy and had told the Confederados they ’d never be welcome in the United States again .
For many years Americana remained an insulated island of Confederate values in the Brazilian jungle⁠ — a cultural time capsule⁠ — but over time the old Southern ways became diluted .
Second - generation Confederados began intermarrying and speaking Portuguese , and the land previously used to raise cotton was gradually switched to the native sugar cane .
Only a few descendants still live on the land owned by their ancestors , with most scattered throughout Brazil .
Today Americana is a city of 120,000 people with Confederados ’ descendants making up only about one tenth of the population .
But the ties to the old South live on .
Fiesta Confederada is a celebration that takes place every year in Americana .
The festival has Confederate flags , Confederate uniforms , food typical of the pre-war South and dances reminiscent of scenes from “ Gone With the Wind . ”
Princess Maxima of the Netherlands , accompanied by her husband , Crown Prince Willem - Alexander , receives tulips upon arrival March 2 at the Istanbul Modern Museum in Turkey .
Photo : AP / Murad Sezer AMSTERDAM , Netherlands –
While on vacation this week , I was relaxing over the English - language bulletin The Hague Amsterdam Times when a curious item caught my eye .
It seems that last week Prince Willem - Alexander and Princess Maxima of the Netherlands filed a lawsuit against a gossip magazine for publishing photographs of the princess relaxing on the beach with her two elder daughters and their nanny .
The prince and princess argue that publishing photographs of famous people in public places , but doing private things , violates European Union privacy law .
The royal family just might win , and the case provides a fascinating contrast to the way courts balance privacy and free press in the United States , where the outcome of such a lawsuit would likely favor the tabloid .
The lawsuit rests on a decision by the European Union Court of Human Rights , in a case brought by Princess Carolyn von Hannover of Monaco against Germany and decided in 2004 .
In that case , Princess Carolyn sued to enjoin the publication of photos of her going about her daily business .
Germany had ruled against her , holding that under that country 's law , the rights of a free press , including publications intended to entertain , outweighed the rights of celebrities like the princess to control photos of themselves in public , non-secluded places .
The EU court reversed the ruling , essentially telling Germany that as part of the federation , its law had to change .
Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , privacy was defined as " the right to live one 's own life with a minimum of interference . "
That meant that even a celebrity par excellence had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his or her private life , including conduct in a public place .
Princess Carolyn therefore could suppress the publication of photos of her tripping over an obstacle at a beach club , shopping or kissing her male companion , as the publication was not part of a public debate , but only to satisfy public curiosity about private matters .
The court also opined that modern communications technologies justified a broader protection for private life , since publishers had an increased capacity to store and reproduce personal data and to disseminate photos to a broad section of the public .
Since the pictures of Princess Maxima and her daughters show the family playing on the beach , there 's a strong parallel to the von Hannover decision .
Under European law , the royal family 's privacy rights could well outweigh the press ' right to cater to ( though never satiate ) public curiosity .
In the United States , however , there is no federal right that protects regular people from being photographed by either the government or private entities .
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government , but this rule does not prohibit law enforcement taking photos of you in public places , or the publication of any photos by a private entity .
In the few states where individuals do have a statutory right to control publication of photographs , it is essentially a property interest in the economic value of your likeness rather than a right to keep personal information private .
This means that the right can be sold , and the buyer can enforce the interest as its own economic right .
In a dispute involving two competing baseball card companies , both of which purchased the " exclusive right " to certain players ' likenesses , the first buyer was able to stop the second company from using the photos , despite the players ' consent .
The right can also be passed on to and enforced by heirs , and is heavily dependent on a finding of commercial exploitation .
As a result , regular people who do n't have a commercial interest in their image are less protected than celebrities who do , even though the public arguably has more of a legitimate interest in what famous people are up to .
In any event , these state rights are limited by the First Amendment .
Political messages , scholarship and works of art are protected .
Thus , unauthorized biographies can use a celebrity 's likeness to sell books .
But confusion sets in when courts try to distinguish between art , commentary and exploitation .
Consider the movie Forrest Gump , which uses the likenesses of famous people ; or a T - shirt depicting the Three Stooges ; or a bobble - head doll of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Is any , all or only some of this art and social commentary protected by the First Amendment ?
Legal scholars agree that Gump is protected .
But in past cases , the T - shirt manufacturer lost and Schwarzenegger settled his lawsuit against the toy manufacturer .
Despite the legal confusion , the tabloid would have a better defense against the prince and princess ' lawsuit here in the United States than it does in the European Union .
Courts generally protect free speech rights in films , their associated advertising , parody , critique and even entertainment - news reporting .
I support a ruling in favor of the paper .
History shows that when it comes to deciding what qualifies as a matter of public interest and what 's merely improper economic exploitation it's hard for the courts to draw a clear line .
And it becomes dangerous for publishers to guess at the boundaries of a fuzzy one .
Still , there 's something valuable for U.S. privacy law in the EU approach .
Here in Europe , privacy is not an all - or - nothing right that stops at the front door , or that protects only commercial value .
Rather , privacy implicates individual autonomy , private social interactions and personal freedom .
Weighing these human interests against the rights of the press to publish and the public to know will be increasingly difficult .
The court considering Princess Maxima 's suit has its work cut out for it .
But at least the EU has a better formulation of what is at stake for individuals .

Disclaimer : I finance wind farms .
While that means in practice that I make sure that the projects I work on have as few vulnerabilities ( technical , economic , legal , or political ) as possible , I am naturally interested in the growth of the industry that underpins my job .
So take this diary with the grain of salt you think it accordingly deserves .
I 've cherry - picked a few tidbits of information that underline what are in my view interesting lessons from last year for the wind power sector .
The Department of Energy 's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ( EERE ) center has published its Annual Report on U.S. Wind Power Installation , Cost , and Performance Trends : 2006 ( pdf - the graphs below come from the accompanying powerpoint presentation - also pdf ) .
2006 was another good year for wind power , with a ( via GWEC ) 32 % growth in capacity installed over the year :
For the second year running , the USA was the first country by MW installed in that year , although not the first by cumulative capacity , with Germany still far ahead , and Spain still ahead of it .
The strong position of China , and even more of India ( home of manufacturer Suzlon , which has just won the battle to buy German manufacturer Repower , and purchased Belgian gearbox subcontractor Hansen last year ) should be noted .
However , in terms of capacity relative to domestic electricity markets , the European pioneers ( Denmark , then Germany and Spain ) are still far ahead :
We 're beginning to see countries where wind penetration is large enough to provide a visible portion of total electricity ( and note - this is the fraction of actual kWh consumed , after taking into account the lower availability of wind power generation capacity ) - and these numbers are set to keep on growing significantly in the coming years , as more capacity comes online .
Even though most of market growth now comes from newcomers , like France or Canada , countries like Spain and Germany are still adding 10 - 15 % new capacity to their existing stock each year .
As I wrote in an earlier diary ( No technical limitation to wind power penetration ) , there 's still a lot to go before integration of wind into the grid becomes an issue .
The EERE has a table which confirms this , with the additional cost of dealing with wind power between 0.2 and 0.5 c/kWh :
( Just for clarity : 1c / kWh is the same thing as $ 10 / MWh )
To get back to the previous graph , using the word " pioneer " to describe today 's wind leaders is not really adequate , as the undisputed pionner in the 80s was the USA , as the graph below shows : essentially ALL the wind power capacity built in the 80s was in the USA .
That lead was abandoned , and in the 90s , Denmark ( with manufacturers Vestas , Neg - Micon ( now part of Vestas ) and Bonus ( now Siemens ) ) created the modern , large - scale version of the industry and never looked back .
In fact , what 's been striking about the US wind industry has been the stop - and - go nature of its development in recent years , with boom years alternating with dead years .
That unhealthy trend , caused exclusively by the instability of the federal regulatory framework , has caused havoc in munfacturing processes ( how do you run a big factory where demand is 100 one year , 0 the next , 150 the next - without knowing at the beginning of the yeat what it will be ?! ) and almost bankrupted several of the leading companies in the sector ( Vestas had losses , Repower had to be bailed out , others were gobbled up by big outsiders like GE and Siemens ) .
It 's difficult enough for smallish companies in a heavy manufacturing sector to deal with rapid growth rates : 20 - 30 % growth per year sound great , until you realize that betting on it being more or less each creates problems ( immobilized capital from overoptimistic investment , or loss of markets from falling behind the competition ) ; but if you have to additionally deal with uncertainty until the last minute on whether 20 % of the market will exist or not ...
That phenomenon was caused by the fact the the main regulatory support for wind in the US , the PTC , expired in 2001 and was only renewed very late , and only for 2 years at a time .
For 2004 and 2005 , the PTC was only renewed in spring 2004 , which means that projects meant to be built that year had been suspended until that renewal , which led to no construction whatsoever for most of 2004 , and a rush after that .
The lesson here is that a regulatory framework has to be stable - or at least to evolve in predictable ways .
The PTC saga was the exact opposite , and has had one simple consequence : the reluctance of turbine manufacturers to set up factories in the US , in the face of uncertainty on the demand side .
This is all the more depressing that the PTC works fine - my bank and others finance lots of projects on its basis , and it is one of the cheapest support mechanisms around : it costs the federal budget 2c / kWh , when European support mechanisms are often in the 3 - 5 c / kWh range ) .
As we are now speaking of prices , one of the most interesting graphs in the EERE report is this one , which shows that wind power is extremely competitive for power purchasers : the actual sale price of wind power has been in the lower half , or even below the range in which wholesale prices for electricity moved for the past 4 years :
In particular , wind power prices went down in 2005 when electricity prices , pushed up by record natural gas prices , were going sharply up : those utilities that had the foresight to enter into purchase agreements with wind producers saved a lot of money then , and still do now .
Note - the prices above for wind power are those for the sale of electricity only ; wind power producers also earn the PTC discussed above , equal to $ 19 / MWh last year .
But that means that wind power is fully competitive without subsidies with power prices in the $ 50 - 60 / MWh range - and that 's , of course , without taking into account the fact that wind causes no pollution and no carbon emissions .
Two trends are driving wind power prices : lower O&M costs and slightly increasing construction costs .
As noted in the EERE report , O&M costs have gone down from $ 30 / MWh for turebines built in the 80s to $ 8 / MWh for turbines built in the last few years .
As the report notes , it is still hard to tell how much of that is simply a reflection that older turbines require more maintenance , and how much is a genuine lowering of costs , but the trend is down ( and I have in house studies which I can not post here which make the same point on Danish turbines ) .
On the initial investment side , costs have been going up somewhat lately .
This reflects two things - one is the scarcity of turbines , as manufacturers , made wary by earlier years , have not anticipated demand growth and need to catch up with production capacities - and sell their available models for more today ; the other is that , like in all industrial sectors , the cost of raw materials that are used have gone up , which impacts prices .
The report by EERE suggests that the economies of scale from building large windfarms are not that big , which should be an encouragement for people to team up , as they have in Denmark and Germany , to invest in one or two windfarms in their community if they have the space to do so - and most rural areas could do that .
Anyway , the conclusions I draw from all if this are as follows :
windpower is booming , and is reaching a stage where it becomes a noticeable source of electricity in a number of countries .
This is not the time to stop supporting it - it 's time to make the essential part of electricity production : any kWh from wind lessens the need for coal - fired plants - or for nuclear .
As such , the US is still really far behind and needs a sustained effort to catch up .
Germany has twice the capacity with one twentieth of the land ;
windpower still depends on having a stable and clear regulatory framework .
It is close to being competitive in absolute terms , but given the powers of incumbency of other power sources ( gas , coal , nuclear ) , and the more or less hidden subsidies that go with it , it still requires a lot of support - including grassroots support .
That matters to get the manufacturing capacity and the local jobs that come with wind power ;
windpower is a good bet for utilities : its cost will not increase with the price of gas and oil , and is already lower than other sources .
It is a perfect business hedge against oil & gas dependence .
And it looks , and is , energy :
You'd think that if you wrote something really great , you 'd get praised .
And if you wrote something really dumb , you 'd get trashed .
But that 's not the way it works .
Instead , if you write something really great then everyone tells you how dumb you are .
And if you write something really bad , you just get ignored .
Ask any blogger and they 'll tell you its true .
But why is this ?
People naturally respond to what they read .
If someone loves what you write , the natural response is to forward it to friends or post it on Digg .
But what if someone hates your blog ?
They can't unforward it , nor can they delete it from the collective memory .
So they trash you .
Because really , it 's all they can do .
There are times when the blogosphere seems terribly uncivilized .
Recent events like the Kathy Sierra death threats make this all the more salient .
But not everyone hates Kathy .
In fact , most of her readers love her .
They express their love by reading her posts in the first place .
But this support is largely invisible , so sometimes all that 's left to see is the hate .

Abstract
We show how patents and most particularly software patents , like all other forms of protectionism , are an absurd kind of government intervention the effects of which are opposite to its alleged rationale .
We show that the net cost of such protectionism exceeds at least the double of the visible benefits it brings to a privileged class of protected industrialists and lawyers .
We show that the alleged incentive to create is not justified in economics any more than in psychology or in technology .
Finally , we explore the social consequences of patents on workers , which we find to be dreadful .
Table of Contents
Foreword
The European Commission was having a consultation about whether to extend patent laws so that patents may cover software algorithms and business methods , as they can in the United States of America .
I am very worried about the possibility of the EU adopting new laws that would strengthen the validity of patent claims over software , and think it is very important that software patents be weakened instead .
I am a computer professional : computer user , software developer , scientific researcher and entrepreneur .
In all aspects of my computer activities , I feel threatened by the possibility of an extension of patent law , and would much prefer reduction of patent applicability .
In the hope that it will help convince whoever may decide that patents are a bad idea that should n't be extended , and particularly not in the software industry , I wrote the below economic analysis of the issues at stake .
I am familiar with both the computer technology businesses and political economics in general , and have held conferences on the subject , including this one ( in French ) at the EURO92 institute of economic studies .
Although I am not a professional economist , my analysis is as far as I know essentially the same as that of many economists who have studied the subject , including some I know personally like Henri Lepage or Bertrand Lemennicier .
However , they did n't formally review this particular article , and neither did any professional economist , so I cannot claim their endorsement of it .
Instead , if this article does n't convince you , or worse , has a negative effect on your opinion , I invite you to read what professional economists wrote on this very same topic , or even to contact them .
To this effect , see the bibliography at the end of this article .
Finally , I do not in any way represent the whole movement of people against software patents .
In this movement are people who approve of patents in general except for software , people who think that patents are useful in some specific cases outside of the software industry but not in general , people without opinion on patents in general but against software patents , and people who oppose patents in general .
As far as I know , most people in the movement against software patents are in the third category " without an opinion in general " , and most of the remaining are in the first two categories .
As far as I know , the reason is that they do n't have a clear understanding of how patents in general work or do not work , so they tend to accept the legitimacy of existing laws a priori , until proven incorrect .
Such was also my opinion ( or lack thereof ) about patents , until I undertook to untangle the economic issues behind patents .
I am now most definitely in the last category , a posteriori , after a lot of hard thought , the conclusion of which I 'm presenting in the current document .
I do not claim to represent anyone but myself , and I expect my arguments to be considered a posteriori , after pondering them , for what they are , good or bad , and not a priori , without pondering them , for the number or quality of people who back them .
This article was written between 2000 - 11 - 24 and 2000 - 12 - 13 , before the end of the above - mentionned consultation .
Thanks to John Tobey and Xavier Dudris Ferran for their feedback .
PS : I know that my writing style is much too emphatic .
That 's just the way I am .
I will tell you what I think , and do it according to the way I feel it .
I would like you to ponder separately these two issues of reason and feelings ; please do not let the common or alien nature of my feelings with respect to yours alter your rational judgement on the issues at hand .
I can but once again beg your pardon for the additional difficulty that my style might induce in your understanding the points ( or hopefully not , the lack thereof ) that I am trying to make with this article .
Macroeconomic Effects of Patents
Patents are a Privilege , not Property
The essence of a Patent is a de jure monopoly : a total control on all activities related to some technique , device , or whatever is subject to the patent : use of a technique , experimentation with it , enhancement to it , technical support about it , etc .
Such monopoly does not reside in a natural unability of other people to produce the same services without causing harm to someone .
On the contrary it consists in a state - enforced prohibition for others to carry out activities in which they could otherwise engage most legitimately , without harming anyone , for the benefit of all concerned .
Such monopolies are not natural property : they are privileges granted by governments to a first claimer under the pretense of promoting creation of new techniques .
Nobody can deny that patents are a privilege , rather than natural property .
The US constitution , Article I , Section 8 , Clause 8 , makes it explicit : " The Congress shall have power [...]
To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ; [... ] " .
The State grants a time - limited privilege in as much as it hopes that this privilege will foster innovation .
Thomas Jefferson , who co-originated this section of the US constitution , clearly explains it in some letters of his correspondance .
Even disregarding the authority of the US founding fathers , it is clear that these monopolies are not legitimate property of patent holders : indeed , even the most extended patent laws acknowledge that freedom must ultimately ( after a number of years ) be returned to the public to freely use the patented technology .
Legitimate property would last forever , whereas patents last for a mostly arbitrary number of years that changes depending on the country , the date , and the whim of the legislator ( and on the growing influence of patent lobbies on governments ) .
Patents are a privilege , the cost of which is borne by the public .
Any economic account of patents that displays their alleged benefits without even considering their cost is a shameful lie ; it is a disgrace that most people ( and most legislators , too ) are so easily fooled by the omnipresent protectionist propaganda of patent lobbies .
Thus we will be analyzing in more detail the benefits and costs of patents , and we will see if they balance each other , or if one exceeds the other .
First Order Effects of Patents : Monopoly Inefficiency
Not only does the usual criticism of monopolies apply as regards the effects of patents , but the negative effects are tremendous in the case of software patents .
Let me summarize the case against monopolies in general , then the case of patents more specifically , and finally the case of software patents in particular .
The fact that the net global effect of de jure monopolies over economy is negative is the first and foremost result in economics , both historically ( see Turgot or Adam Smith in the Eighteenth Century ) and conceptually ( it is the fundamental principle that justifies free trade and the EEC ) .
Monopolies have a beneficial effect on the monopolist , that is clearly seen , because it is focused .
But this effect is achieved only at the cost of a double negative effect on both the consumers and the competitors , that is not seen , because it is scattered over a large population .
Indeed , the increased wealth of the monopoly does not magically appear ; the only way a monopoly may enrich someone is by preventing someone else from proposing a competitive service .
Non-competitive service need no monopoly to be excluded : the market ( i.e. the consumers ) will reject it because of its cost .
Not only cannot this negative effect be denied : it is the very justification of monopoly , to begin with .
The double loss to the society at large is not a vain expression , but an exact figure , that can be accounted for , penny for penny : any gain by the monopolist because of the monopoly is a gain of what would have instead been paid by the consumer to a competitor for an equivalent service ; but the only reason the consumer would go to a competitor is because the competitor offers equivalent service at lesser price , that is , because the competitor is overall more productive .
Let us thus compare the net wealth in Europe with or without monopoly .
With the monopoly , Europe is richer in a service S , at a cost X ; Without the monopoly , Europe is richer in the same service S , at a lesser cost Y , with the difference R=X - Y being the monopoly rent .
The net result of the monopoly is a loss of productivity equal to the monopoly rent .
( Of course , there may be additional transfers of money between the consumer and producer above or below this rent , due to imperfection in the market ; but these transfers do not increase or decrease the overall wealth of Europe ; their net effect on the economy is null ; moreover , similar imperfections exist no less in presence of monopolies ; actually , a ternary effect of monopolies is to make these imperfections bigger by removing the free market price system as a source of information for resource management . )
So much for monopolies in general : their overall global effect is negative , in direct proportion to the enrichment of those who benefit .
Every single Euro won by the monopolist because of the monopoly is one Euro lost by the consumer plus another Euro lost in decreased productivity , totalling a net decrease of wealth of two Euros for the rest of society .
Again , this double negative effect of protectionism , monopolies , and other economic restrictions and prohibitions is perfectly known since at least 1830 , as witnesses Free Trade literature of the Nineteenth Century .
Acknowledgement that Free Trade is good for the economy as well as for peace is the very reason why Free Trade ultimately won , and why the EEC and now the EU are economically justified .
Now , let us consider the case of patents as a particular case of monopoly .
Patents allegedly increase the wealth of a nation by creating an incentive for certain activities that would not be done without it .
Let us examine what conditions need exist for such increase in wealth to arise ; we 'll see that these conditions are clearly not present in the case of software patents , and will even emit reservations as to their being gathered in other cases .
Once again , the incentive induced by patents is not magical .
Patent law is not a magical spell that endowes people with a sudden inspiration to create .
Any incentive it induces is in direct proportion to the economic gains it promises to would be patent holders .
Now , we have seen that any gain earned by a holder because of his monopoly is in direct proportion to a double loss by other people , and thus a net loss to the economy at large equivalent to these gains .
Any measure of the beneficial effects of patents for patent holders is also a measure of the detrimental effects of patents on European economy at large .
A loss is the direct and primary effect of patents .
Second Order Effects of Patents : Disincentive and Misincentive
There remains to determine if there are secondary effects , and if these secondary effects are worth the tremendous cost incurred by the primary effects .
If we are to accept that the global incentive to innovate is proportionnal to the potential market earnings , then to the net decrease in wealth due to patent monopolies corresponds a net decrease in the overall incentive to innovate .
Once again , the focused beneficial effects will be seen , while the distributed detrimental effects will not be seen ; but the detrimental effects will be twice as big as the beneficial effects .
You 'll see a few overpaid researchers in a big monopolist structure , and you wo n't see the plenty of inventors that could not be paid by smaller businesses because of the decreased opportunities .
Any successful incentive to innovate that patents may foster leads to a new monopoly where everyone is disincented to innovate anymore , since competition is lessened .
The incentive of patents is an incentive to find ways of earning money at destroying the global economy ; it makes possible and encourages business models centered around rent - seeking and parasiting the economy at large , to the double detriment of the public , and against the global interest of society .
Innovations will be incented not in direct proportion to their global social utility , but in direct proportion of their ability to generate monopoly rent and prevent subsequent social utility .
It is the worst inventions that are most incented by the patent systems : those the patenting of which detriments the public most .
Unless it can be established that monopoly rent is in any way proportional ( and with a positive rate ) to the utility of secondary side effects of innovation , then the incentive induced as a secondary effect of patent monopolies will have no net positive effect to begin to balance the cost of these monopolies .
But ( as we 'll see in section Technological Consequences of Patents ) , the marginal technological effect of patents at the second order are also dreadful .
The patent system is thus pure destruction of riches and prevention of innovation at both the first and second order .
Third Order Effects of Patents : Disorganization
Thus , we are to look at tertiary effects of patents on the industry , to see if they lead to industrial organization that leads to better innovation .
Since patent monopolies lead to large benefits at one place to the detriment of a doubly larger loss spread everywhere , it could be argued whether or not the induced concentration of money is a benefit or not to society .
One point about rents is that since they are not the result of free market competition , the way they are spent is not subject to the direct feedback that maximizes the productivity with which they are spent , and thus they lead to decreased industrial efficiency , as opposed to the same amount of money being spent by the consumer in other free market activities ; of course , it may happen that the monopolist is also wiser than average at spending his rent earnings , but in absence of economic feedback mechanism , he wo n't be on average ; actually , he 'll be much worse off , having no economic comparison with competition to base his R&D decisions upon .
So the net statistical effect of patents on the organization of research is increased fragility of the economy in the case of failure of such an inflated player , since risks are higher and less spread .
As for the technical advancement of society , the concentration of benefits also concentrates in the monopolist the advantages of any enhancement or creative use of the patented technique .
This means that any incentive to create derivative works will suddenly be decreased or even annulled , in proportion to the strength of the patent law , for everyone but the patent holder .
All the knowledge , risks , and other factors involved in creation of derivative products now largely resides on the shoulders of the monopoly holder , with other people being discouraged in proportion of the license fees the holder may demand .
Thus , patents are a clear disincentive to innovate anything that depends on a patent one does n't hold .
Patents , when they are successful to the holder , are also an incentive to prevent innovation in competitors , by means of pressure , lies , legal threats , and lobbying , so that they do n't find a technique that would make the patent useless .
The monopoly holder , being rich and influencial thanks to his huge monopoly rent , is especially able to exert such strong hand practices , and to buy out the weakened competitor 's technology so as to bury it , should this technology look like a real danger to them .
In the end , since the monopoly holder faces decreased competition concerning the patented technique , it is unclear whether he himself will be incented to continue innovation ; at least the market pressure for him to do so will be limited , and without much useful feedback , since the market wo n't be able to choose among as many marginal innovations .
This point is essential .
It means that patents can have no beneficial tertiary effects at all that begin to compensate for tremendously negative primary and secondary effects , unless innovation is somehow " atomic " , that is , if innovation in the field where patents apply never leads to further innovation , and conversely never depends on previous innovation .
In all other cases , patents will be detrimental to innovation for their whole duration .
It is doubtful at best that innovation is thus " atomic " in any industry ; it is doubtful that " atomic " innovations , when they exist , are of such value to society as to justify a system that has important detrimental effects on all other innovations .
Actually , any " atomic " innovation might arguably be considered so worthless as not to deserve any protection : all interesting research starts as variants on an existing problem , and generates lots of new variants ; the interest of the research only appears after these variants have been freely created and confronted , when the coverage of a lively community of freely exchanging scientists is such that a new point of view has emerged and been confirmed .
Specific Effects of Software Patents : Junk
Finally , let us consider the particular case of software patents .
As a computer professional , I can certify that innovation is never atomic in the computer industry .
On the contrary , computer software constantly and crucially depends on the ability to freely and quickly reuse , combine and evolve previous techniques .
In the age of interconnected computers , software plays an essential and ubiquitous role in the way computers , people , businesses , countries , etc. , communicate with each other .
Industrial property on software thus leads to monopoly lock - ins in the way people communicate .
To computer professionals , software patents are as dreadful as if someone had patents on part of the English language ( or whichever language they use ) .
It prevents not only innovation , but the use of computers at all , and leads to proprietary systems from big monopolies that few can use , and that no one can innovate upon .
Patents induce such a technological stagnation in the computer industry that it is almost visible .
Software engineers constantly curse the way they must conform to proprietary protocols that are not well documented ( if at all ) , misdesigned ( often with gross mistakes that peer review would have immediately eliminated ) , that they cannot improve upon , that exist in a wealth of gratuitously incompatible variants , and with which they must stay compatible for decades and decades .
The field of computer development is thus filled with junk , that accumulates with time , and that no one has the right to clean , least he becomes incompatible with the others .
Every patent on a successful software program or technique is an obstacle to the whole industry , that remains until it expires ; even the holder , when he wants to improve his previous technique , finds himself faced with the inertia of a whole industry that adapted to his own junk , contorting either to interface to it , or to work around it .
Thus , the specific effect of patents in the software industry is to make software development and computer communication slower , more complex , more expensive .
The amount of money , computer hardware , developer time , user time , etc. , that is wasted and could be saved by removing protectionist barriers is so insanely high as to give vertigo to anyone .
Technological Consequences of Patents
Delays in Publication
Patents were allegedly made to foster publication of inventions that would otherwise remain secret .
But actually , patents result in scientific findings being published later , and in disuse of techniques that could not in any way remain secret .
Indeed , due to patent regulations , research centers will hesitate to publish results in ways that would prevent their patenting them .
This particular problem is not intrinsic to the principle of patenting ( that , as we saw , is dreadful enough without it ) , but is due to regulations that prevent patenting of previously published material .
In such case , the patent system will actually delay ( or even suppress ) publication of material that would otherwise be published ; the effects are such that some research centers will have a default policy of not publishing without complex approval processes , that leads to a disincentive for researchers to publish .
A bigger problem with patents , is that they will be used to prevent use of techniques that could easily be reverse - engineered .
Indeed , industries can only take advantage of a technique by exploiting it ; the patent system allegedly encourages such techniques to be published , so that they do not disappear with the inventor ; but it is not possible to exploit a technique on a large scale , generating large revenues , without making it possible for competitors to reverse - engineer it .
Thus , if a patent 's extent in time is longer than the time it takes for a competitor to find a way to copy the technique , then the patent is a net technical loss to society ( in addition to all its economic effects ) , since its effect will be to delay rather than speed up the free use of the technique by the public .
Considering the ever increasing speed at which techniques progress , patent duration should thus be ever decreased , until it is abolished , instead of being ever increased as it is today .
Technical Lock - in and Research Avoidance
Once a patented technique is successfully spread , it creates incentives for a whole range of nasty behavior from the privilege holder , whereas other people are forced into passiveness , or strongly incited into it .
Successful patent monopolists , deriving lots of ( socially destructive ) revenues from their patents ( which is the primary economic effect of protection ) , are incited into finding ways to secure these revenues .
We have already covered part of this phenomenon in our analysis of secondary and tertiary economic effects of patents ; let us now uncover the technical aspect of this rent - seeking behavior : the monopolist will try to accumulate new patents regularly , so that even when his original patent expires , he still has a monopoly on the modern form of the technique .
At first glance , it looks like this will foster innovation , but then , the kind of innovation that is incited is not superior ways to use the technique , for the benefit of the public ; it is ways to secure monopolistic revenues .
This means that a large part of the research will be diverted from making things cheaper , simpler and better , into making them more expensive , more complex to interface to ; the most wicked kind of " innovation " that this leads to is tricks that make customers prone to paying additional money for derived services that would otherwise be free if there were competition .
With industrial protection , technology becomes a way to put consumers into shackles , instead of a way to free them .
Since the monopolist does n't face technical competition within his technical domain , he will neglect domain - specific enhancements , and invest into marketing tricks that might extend his protected domain .
This means that he 'll have apparently more attractive products , that turn out not to be satisfying to people who actually use them ( especially technically aware people ) .
As compared to a free market in the same technical domain , this results in decreased quality , higher costs , and a lot of customers tricked into products that turn out not as good as promised : all in all , useless dissipation of wealth for the society at large .
Companies that hold patents will tend to fund research that depends on their existing patents , and to discard research that circumvents their patents .
For instance , a cheap mechanism for blocking the AIDS virus that does not depend on patented molecules will find no funding from patent holders , because they wo n't be able to grab as enormous a share of profit with it .
In the absence of patents , there would be no such incentive to avoid research ; on the contrary , research laboratories would compete to find the best and cheapest technique , independently from any lock - in requirement .
The net effect of patents on innovation is thus to divert it from useful innovation into harmful innovation .
Redundant Developments
In the presence of information protectionism , every industry will develop its own secret or proprietary recipes .
For every technique , you 'll find tens of mutually incompatible programs that do essentially the same thing , but in subtly different ways , both so as to avoid industrial property disputes , and so as to try to capture a market monopoly .
In as much as patents have " encouraged " any work , this work not only does not create riches , but destroys riches ; it is the costly aspect of work that has been encouraged , whereas its productive aspect has been discouraged .
This exactly matches the 1848 critique of protectionism by Bastiat in " Les deux haches " and " Autre chose " ( in English " The Two Hatchets " and " Something Else " ) .
This is particularly true in the software industry , where the same programs get written over and over and over , because they are covered by patents and copyrights ; everyone ends up reimplementing things in a different way so as to avoid the neighbour 's patent and copyright claims , yet has to go through very difficult routes so as to be compatible with proprietary software from other vendors .
Protectionism generates a huge amount of useless work , with people both building barriers around themselves and digging holes to avoid other people 's barriers in an immensely wasteful con game , instead of spending their forces at doing something productive .
In the case of software patents , this multiplication of redundant yet incompatible effort takes such gigantic proportions as to be the primary problem that overwhelms all the other sources of cost in software development .
Technical Inertia and Dead Techniques
Many superior techniques are abandoned , because the overhead of paying a license and the unsafety of depending on a vendor 's good will far overweigh the benefits of the technique .
In the computer industry , superior data formats or protocols have thus been abandoned , because their own patent protection was too drastic , and / or because the market was locked by other patents into using incompatible techniques .
The same superior techniques would without hesitation have been widespread if neither side of the technical exchange had to care about patents and the double lock - ins that they try to avoid from providers and impose to customers .
The effect of patents in the spread of superior techniques is thus to slow it down considerably .
Often , so considerably as to make them no longer financially viable for too small a monopolist to support , so that they will die , whereas they would have survived in a free market .
Ultimately , because of the above mentioned problems , or just because of the evolution of its own concerns , because of the random mishaps that any company ultimately faces , a vendor will kill a project , abandon a product line , etc .
Patent monopolies then make it very difficult for anyone to take over such deceased product , all the more when it in turn depends on a complex net of third party patents , and the situation gets even worse when the demise of a company or department leads to plans being lost , to " industrial property " assets being disputed between creditors , former partners , etc .
Considering the many years that patents take to expire ( and the decades needed for software copyrights ) , it is such an eternity in the technological world as to mean that the technique will never be used again , being forgotten ( or considered a legend ) long before anyone has the right to use it again , even though the knowledge is still readily available , lively in the heads of original inventors , and just in reach of competing engineers .
As a result , the corresponding patented and copyrighted techniques suddenly fall into disuse .
Even though their users were technically most satisfied with them , they suddenly have to migrate to different techniques , at a high cost , because they will not be able to find support and service anymore .
Competitors , former employees , and even the original inventors , are prohibited from providing a valuable service that the privilege holder can't or wo n't provide anymore , but that could nevertheless create value and riches to both customers and inventors .
All in all , patent protection makes technical progress much less lively than it would be without it : superior techniques will have a lot more trouble spreading , and they can disappear for good without any chance of reappearing before an eternity .
Negative Research
Even worse than the above , companies that hold a monopoly on a given domain thanks to a portfolio of patents will be incited to secure their monopoly by patenting useful techniques that could be used by competitors , not so as to exploit them , but so as to prevent them from ever being deployed .
For instance , oil companies would hold patents on other sources of energy than oil ( like alcohol made from crops ) , so as to prevent anyone from ever developing oil - less vehicles that would stop their milking billions of car - owners .
Research done not so as to deploy a technique , but so as to prevent its deployment , can be considered as negative research .
Patenting , by definition , consists in preventing deployment of techniques ( by non-holders ) , so it is always something negative done with research ; but it is never as frankly so as when the holder conspicuously refuses ( or proves unable , being himself prevented by other patents ) to deploy the technique , making the patented research a pure loss to mankind .
Of course , sometimes , and especially with government funding , research done with negative intent may lead to actually deployed techniques ; but these techniques and research will have been considerably slowed down in the mean time , being prohibited to most , and reserved to a sole privilege holder who is n't enthusiastic about risking himself in a technique that threatens his main business .
And even then , you 'll still face a patent monopoly , with all its costs .
What the patents amount to , in such cases , is clearly negative research : research done , at a cost , so as to prevent the public from benefitting from it , and to lock it into using inferior techniques .
Contradiction between Patents and Public Research
This gets even worse when all that negative research is funded with public tax money .
Public research , contrarily to patents , is not an economic absurdity .
Its first order effect is neutral , as a normal economic activity : some researchers get paid in exchange for finding new techniques and technical variants .
It may be discussed in what circumstances its second order effects are positive or negative , which is a particular case of the question of where government intervention is or is n't useful in economic matters .
Moreover , even without specific government funding of research , on a reserved budget , it may be argued that , in as much as public institutions exist , they have their own technological needs , and research is thus a legitimate way among other things to spend their resources so as to optimize their efficacy , within their own normal budget .
Thus , from a political point of view , public research may or may not be positive , but let us repeat that from a strictly economic point of view , it is not an absurdity at all , and is even a very good idea , under some circumstances .
Now , things begin to get really bad when the result of public research is patented , as universities have recently been encouraged to do throughout Europe .
I would go so far as to assert that patenting of public research is the greatest economic absurdity there can be .
Patents were meant as an indirect way to foster innovation ; so far , we have found them to fail on this account .
But even should they , by some magic , succeed in certain cases , it would be absurd to patent the results of public research : indeed , in the case of public research , the public has already paid for the research , through taxes , so it need n't pay for it a second time ; the only result of the patent is the monopoly , that restricts the use of the technique that was paid for , and deprives the public from both the technique and from the monopoly rent .
And of course , it would be absurd to assert that monopoly is necessary to ensure that the technique would be deployed , since more competitors , as prohibited by the monopoly , could only mean more deployment of the technique ( and if no third party wants to deploy it , there 's no need to grant a monopoly to the first - come industrialist so that he may remain the sole exploiter of it ) .
The patent is absolutely no incremental encouragement to innovate for public research , since the encouragement was already completely given as public funds ; but the patent will still have its detrimental effects on the public , and its limiting effects on the use of the discovered technique .
Patents issued from public research is proactively negative research ; it is citizens paying to be oppressed rather than to be freed .
Social Consequences of Patents
The consequences of intellectual property monopolies are dreadful .
Every single europenny earned by the privileged industrialists is paid twice by the public which is deprived from its rights to benefit from competition .
Difficulties for Inventors
Patents were allegedly instituted to protect inventors .
But their actual effect is to make it more difficult for inventors to find investors , and to put them in a lesser situation when they found them .
Let us examine the case of free - lance inventors .
Once again , the one directly protected by a patent is the patent - holding industrialist or monopolist .
So as to directly benefit from a patent , the inventor will have to turn himself into an industrialist , which might be difficult for him , since entrepreneurship and invention are quite different ( although not incompatible ) avocations .
This difficulty in itself is already a source of economic inefficiency that is caused by the patent system .
Assuming he is able to have this double proficiency , or to ally himself with people who do , the inventor will have to spend weeks , months , years , and several tens of thousands of Euros in registering a patent .
This non-negligeable amount of time and money could very well have been used to begin production instead , providing the inventor with an appreciable edge with respect to competition ; but instead , it will be wasted in non-productive activities .
In the end , the inventor will have a paper that does not protect him much , since the acceptance by the patent office , despite its huge cost , is no guarantee , and he will have to spend millions in legal battles , should he want to actually defend it .
All in all , small inventors , who are tricked by patent lawyers into registering patents , pay a lot for little .
It is unclear whether the inventor actually gains anything , but it is very clear that the net economic effect of it all is a huge waste .
Now , should the inventor be afraid of going free - lance , he will have to find investors or industrialists or monopolists , who will develop his technique and / or fund its further developments .
And then , after some company acquires his original patent , he shares the same fate as other researching employees .
Indenture of Employees
Consider the consequences on employees , including inventors among them : Employees who develop proficiencies the application of which depend on patents find themselves suddenly undervalued in the labour market .
Indeed , patents reduce the number of potential employers , since only license holders may take advantage of these proficiencies .
Thus the market for these proficiencies is artificially reduced , and the employee is thus forced to accept lower wages and work under worse conditions .
They find themselves indentured to patent holders .
Again , patent monopolies do not protect inventors , but industrialists ( and not even the real industrialist , but actually the monopoly holder ) ; so that if the inventor , researcher , or software developer , gets any professional , intellectual , sentimental , or other attach to his creation , if he has any ideas about it he wants to express , then he has to stay with his current employer .
Should he leave , he 'd leave years of personal investment behind .
Should his employer go bankrupt , should his project be cancelled by his management , or otherwise join the ranks of dead techniques ( see thus - named section above ) , then his years of proficiencies are suddenly worth nothing ; even though he knows how he could leverage them , he does n't have the right to do it .
Employee inventors do not directly benefit from patents ( the famous transistor patent earned its inventors one symbolic dollar from the company they worked for ) ; but they are directly oppressed by them .
This indenture of employees to privilege holders means reduced mobility for employees in general , and thus a more expensive and less efficient job market .
In the end , the companies themselves will have to pay higher wages for less adapted employees .
Everyone loses with patents .
Loss of Liberty to Customers
The consequences to customers are just as dreadful .
Since they will face reduced competition , they will have to pay more , will be provided services of lower quality .
This economic aspect has been discussed at length above , so let us just be reminded that the customer , in the end , is the one who pays for all the economic inefficiencies created by patents .
But this is not all there is to it , and we can detail the social aspect .
Because of monopolies , customers wo n't be able to influence the direction in which services evolve by differential purchase .
In a free market , they will purchase the products that suit them best , and industrialists will have to compete in innovation so as to keep ahead one of another .
Presented with a large choice of providers in every domain , customers will be able to buy from whichever source fulfills their needs best , being thus able to influence the evolution of techniques , by signalling their tastes to producers .
In the end , a free market allows for services finely tuned to the tastes of customers .
But this does not happen at all in presence of patent monopolies .
With industrial protectionism , innovation is no longer consumer - driven , but producer - driven .
The evolution of any product line resides on the shoulders of a one monopolistic provider .
A consumer cannot compare between providers and choose one that suits him better .
Even assuming this provider is devoted to the public , and does n't try any trick as he might be incited to do , as described in the above section about technical lock - ins , assuming there is never a conflict of interest between him and the public in which he could and would use his monopoly to resolve the issue to the detriment of be public , the monopolistic producer will still have less information available to know the public 's taste than would a free market producer .
Thus , the risks for the customers are high that , even in good faith , the monopolistic producer will lead the whole industry into quite suboptimal ( or sometimes catastrophic ) choices .
The overall result , for customers , is thus not only bad quality of services and high prices , but less liberty in choice of technological solutions , and thus solutions that are less adapted to their needs .
Disappearing Services
In a free market , when a consumer has precise tastes that no producer fulfills or specific needs or problems that require incremental technical development , he may spend the proper amount of money to have a taylor - made solution at competitive price by some service provider within the free market .
This concerns casual users who will have a " bug " fixed , as well as large industries that will develop custom solutions .
Now , in presence of industrial protectionism , should the consumer have precise tastes , he has only one service provider to contact .
If the monopolist refuses to make the specific modification , asks insane amounts of money for it , or is unable to come up with a satisfying solution within an acceptable delay , the consumer has absolutely no recourse .
Well , actually , if the customer is rich enough , he may purchase the whole monopolist provider , but then again the price of the provider is inflated by the monopoly power .
In the software industry , there is a particularly great demand for fixing bugs and customizing software , and the limitations and price increases due to industrial protection are greatly harmful to corporate customers , whereas they prevent the very appearance of a servicing industry for private customers .
The effect of protectionism is to prevent these services from being exchanged .
Customers wo n't find satisfaction .
Riches that could be created will not be .
Service industries that could have prospered will fail to exist .
This is a great damage to the economy at large , but this damage is not visible , because it consists precisely in things that do not happen .
Monopolists will boast about the things that happen , but no one can mourn the things that did not happen because of them , even though this invisible damage largely exceeds the visible benefits .
Monopolists will thus use the riches they show to have governments extend their monopolies over and over again , while customers mumble , curse , and get used to their insatisfaction , and potential service providers have to accept indenture to the monopolist , or to seek a job in a different industry so as to survive .
The Absurdity of " Defensive " Patents
Even industrialists who do n't want to play the foul game of patent monopolies , find themselves incited to file " defensive " patents , so as to prevent their being sued by monopolist competitors .
The principle of defensive patents is that in case an industrialist is attacked by some patent holder , he 'll himself have some patents so he can trade licenses with the attacker , and no one has to pay anything .
Industrialists thus enter cross-license agreements about patented techniques .
What this all amounts to is a tremendous dissipation of forces by industrialists into unproductive legal matters , risks of legal procedures , ways around them , and management hassles caused by them or the fear of them .
Some companies are known to have paid quite a high price for this : they have gone bankrupt on patent litigation , and even , in some cases , on litigation for patents that have later been found to be invalid .
But this waste does n't stop here .
Such networks of cross-licenses between industrialists already present in a sector serve as a way to exclude competition from newcomers .
This makes it much more risky to invest in the industry , and makes things more difficult for beginning inventors , entrepreneurs , etc .
Even without monopolies , this creates oligopolies that share some rent to the detriment of the public : all the negative effects described above still exist , albeit in a reduced way .
The patent system thus induces a lot of lose - lose situations for everyone , even for those who otherwise want to play fair .
The purpose of law in general is to reduce conflicts within society .
Here , we have laws that create artificial conflicts that would n't otherwise exist ; companies resort to private contracts so as to eliminate these conflicts , but even then , the mere potentiality of these conflicts is detrimental to all .
Fostering a Class of Parasites
If the patent system is thus detrimental to everyone , why does it survive ?
What are the forces that keep it in place ?
It is the greed of a whole class of parasites who have learnt to extract a rent out of this dreadful institution .
We have already lengthily discussed the case of big monopolist firms , specialized in patent rent , that accumulate thousands of patents to secure some industrial monopolies or oligopolies , and then milk the public .
Such companies can use their huge earnings to lobby governements , by explaining how their impressive corporations would suffer from lack of patent protection , without showing how the public and the competition have paid doubly all these gigantic earnings , with an equivalent amount of riches being completely wasted , together with a loss of liberty to the public .
This is a typical case of " what is seen and what is not seen " , with the protection lobbyists showing the positive side of protectionism while diverting the attention from the flip side , the negative effects of which are huger , but spread over the whole population .
These monopolists have accomplices , who are the lawyers and officers specialized in selling patents , this government - sanctionned protectionist snake oil .
These lawyers and officers are the infrastructure that makes the whole system stand .
As with any law , apart from the economic effects ( that we showed were dreadful ) , there are administrative costs : the cost of the patent administration , the cost of cost law enforcement institutions , the cost of judicial procedures , the cost of advisors who avoid judicial procedures .
Such costs are implied by any law , and exist in addition of any positive or negative effects of the law as such ; even a law that looks " economically neutral " on face value will actually be a economically detrimental law , once the enforcement costs are considered .
This is why no law should be passed unless it is certain that this law is necessary , or at least immensely beneficial ;
This is also why the burden of the proof should always be on the proponents of more public institutions and more governmental privileges .
Things are even worse since patent officers and industrial property lawyers themselves benefit from " protection " in their activities , which again means that the public will have to pay more for less .
Patent officers have a government monopoly on filing patents ; all they do mostly is put a seal on a document and be done with it , but it costs a dreadful lot .
They are meant to do some prior art verification , but it is mostly limited to the patent database , and has little value in a court litigation , since most prior works were not patented , but published in technical journals , conferences , or even just commercialized without formal publication ; for these reasons , the patent office issues patents " without guarantee of the government " .
One may wonder what good the patent office serves .
The registration monopoly is completely unnecessary , even considering patent laws .
Even assuming patent laws , there could be competing registration offices .
If industrial property were anything like a natural right , inventors should be able to file their patents by publishing their invention in just any large enough journal , such that anyone may see it , with the invention declaration itself being freely copyable , and written in technical language understandable by any technician instead of legalese .
This would encourage people to publish sooner instead of later and completely remove publication delays due to the current patent system ( since many laboratories will currently delay publication because of some actual or potential patent filing procedure ) .
It would dispel the false belief in the worthless official seal of a patent , that iniquitously biases court decisions towards registered patents , even though their claim may be ridiculous .
It would thus move the burden of proving patent validity where it is due : to the litigator , making for a saner and safer judicial system .
Finally , it would encourage value - added registration authorities that would actually provide ( limited ) financial or legal guarantees at competitive rates according to meaningful prior art research .
IP lawyers have also captured a share of the patent racket by being necessary intermediates in registering and defending a patent : they will translate technical claims into obscure legalese that will confuse the patent reviewers and jurors alike , and induce fear into people who are demanded license fees ; they will instill a climate of fear in the industry , encouraging companies to play the game of monopoly , threatening innocent entrepreneurs into paying licenses , using the strong bias of juries toward officially sanctionned patents , sueing over patent claims of dubious technical value , inciting even honest industrialists into registering " defensive " patents .
But they provide no more of a guarantee , and are paid flat rate .
It can be argued that if some class of people most certainly benefits from patent laws , it is industrial property lawyers .
Industrials have to fight each other with their patents , a few among them becoming monopolies , most perishing , some trying to play fair , all paying IP lawyers .
In any particular case , lawyers may play opposite roles to each other , but they all play the same play , and win both ways .
The industrialists play patent roulette , some win , most lose .
The IP lawyers are the croupiers who collect the stakes ; in the average , IP lawyers win while industrialists lose ( unless they actually become firms specialized in monopoly rent , with a big legal department ) ; and in the meantime , all this energy is wasted .
The members of these parasite institutions are destroyers of riches .
Even though they claim they do a profitable job ( to themselves at least ) , even though they increase ( meaningless ) statistics of patent registrations that provide a false measure of " innovation " , even though they participate in huge economic transactions ( levy of patent protection racket ) , even though they work at preventing and resolving legal conflicts ( that they created to begin with ) , their role is to run a machine that harms the economy and slows down innovation .
Yet , as part of the public administration and the legal system , as coeducated with the legal staff who redact laws , as rich people who can afford socializing in the high spheres of power , as allies of the few immensely powerful companies that feed on monopoly rent , patent officers and lawyers are near the ear of the politicians who vote laws .
At the same time , the victims are disorganized , scattered , made poorer by the monopoly , each with but a small individual interest in the large common cause .
It is thus no surprise that parasites can easily influence political decisions towards their interest , to the detriment of the public .
This is not the least danger of patent laws .
Like all protectionist laws , patent laws are a great danger to the public : for even if a little bit of protection ever were beneficial , the mere existence of such powerful lobbies as created by this protection will incite politicians into voting more and more protection , until it gets out of proportion , and becomes a huge system of legal plunder .
Conclusion
The EC now EU was created to promote free markets within Europe , to remove the barriers to free entreprise , so that Europe would become a peaceful place where industry can grow and prosper and people can be free .
Patents are the very essence of what the EU and the EC were created to fight : protectionism .
Historically , economically , philosophically , morally , technically , psychologically , socially , patents are but privileges that have no justification .
They are harmful to the public at large , as customers , workers and investors alike .
Like all political frauds , patents are based on showing large benefits that are seen for a few , visible because of the focus , without showing the immense costs for everyone , that largely surpass the benefits , but are not seen because they are spread over so many people .
The EU should not extend protectionist patent laws so as to cover software .
On the contrary , it should free the industry from the protectionist barriers of patents , and from the parasitism of industrial property lawyers .
Post Scriptum
One of the official justifications for patents is that patents would encourage inventors to publish their techniques instead of keeping them secret , so the inventions wo n't disappear with them .
After any kind of rational examination , this justification appears as completely bogus .
If secrecy were a working method to ensure an indefinite monopoly on a technique , and the monopoly were the prime motivator of inventors , then inventors would certainly not publish in exchange of a patent that gave them a monopoly for only a few years , when they could have an indefinite monopoly by not publishing !
More generally , the patent system is only meaningful when reverse - engineering would otherwise allow the invention to be universally deployed despite attempts to preserve secrecy .
Thus , the technical effect of the patent system is always to slow down the way inventions are spread , never to speed it up !
There remains the problem of secrecy and its enforcement .
That 's precisely what non-disclosure agreements and exclusivity contracts are about , and it is very important that companies and individuals be able to sign such contracts and be bound by them .
The essential difference between contract - based secrecy and " intellectual property " is that a contract only binds contractants .
Hence the enforcement costs are born by the set of contracting parties who share the secrets ( and it is sure that the benefits are properly shared among them -- otherwise , they would n't sign up ) , not by the public that is excluded from this secret .
Not only is this " owner pays property enforcement " principle an elementary principle of justice , it is also an essential principle of economically sound law , to prevent negative externalities in enforcement costs .
Indeed , with intellectual property , the privileged parties are the one who receive the benefits of monopoly enforcement , whereas everyone else bears the costs : potential customers and competitors as well as taxpayers .
Thus , the predictable and observable effect of intellectual property is that we see a strong lobby of privilege holders and rent - seekers that will use the strength of its current and expected future privilege money to push toward extending ever more the privileges and their enforcement costs , way beyond any possible positive effects of the monopoly ( if they exist at all ) since they get to receive all the relatively small but concentrated benefits , while others get to pay the huge but very decentralized bill .

A petition is circulating that begs California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to pardon Paris Hilton .
TMZ placed several calls this morning to the Guv 's office .
The first person we spoke with said there were " rumblings " about the petition in the office , but he would n't be more specific .
We then spoke with someone else who said she 'd get back to us .
We then asked if that meant the Governor had Paris plans .
She giggled and said , " maybe . "
We love Kalieforneeya !!!
BUT WAIT !
Just as we were about to publish the article ( finger literally on the button ) , TMZ got a callback from the Guv's Press Secretary , Aaron McLear , who said that Arnold 's office is prepared to give Hilton a fair shake !
McLear told TMZ the office is prepared to treat Hilton 's request " no differently than any other request filed to the Governor 's office . "
McLear added the Governor only acts in " extraordinary circumstances . "
We asked if Paris qualified -- all we got was a laugh .
So far , they have n't received the petition , asking people to " sihn " ( sic ) in support of Paris .

Wall Street awards itself billions in Christmas bonuses
By David Walsh
19 December 2006
Wall Street is awarding itself tens of billions in bonuses this winter .
The fantastic amounts of money being handed out to investment bankers , securities traders and the like is symptomatic of the vast social divide that blights every aspect of American life .
Investment bank Goldman Sachs is leading the pack .
The firm reported an increase in quarterly earnings of 93 percent and will distribute some $ 16.5 billion in bonuses to dozens of its bankers and traders .
The top “ rainmakers , ” as they are called , will each take home as much as $ 20 to $ 25 million just in bonuses , “ while traders who booked big profits will take home a chunk of those profits , up to $ 50 million apiece , ” according to a December 13 article in the New York Times .
The report cited the comment of one New York - based investment firm , “ Anyone at the bonus line at Goldman Sachs died and went to bonus heaven .
It does n’t get any better than this . ”
Another piece on the December 3 financial page of the Times suggested that bonuses are “ expected to be a cash pile of more than $ 100 billion across the Street this year . ”
That estimate presumably includes companies of all sizes .
Last year major investment banks and trading firms handed out $ 21.5 billion in year - end bonuses .
Options Group , a New York executive search firm , predicted 2006 bonuses would rise 15 to 20 percent .
The staggering figure of $ 100 billion in total bonuses is more than twice the annual budget of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and nearly twice the US Department of Education budget .
Washington spends $ 20 billion annually on foreign aid to the entire world .
The yearly budget of the City of New York , which employs 250,000 people , amounts to $ 50 billion .
The $ 16.5 billion in bonuses at Goldman Sachs alone is more than New York City pays to educate 1.1 million children in its schools , the largest local school budget in the US .
Goldman Sachs is giving out more in year - end financial rewards than the federal government spends on the nation ’s largest low - income housing program , the Housing Choice Voucher Program ( $ 15.9 billion ) , which covers some 2 million households .
Goldman Sachs ’ top employees are not alone .
Investment bank Morgan Stanley awarded its chief executive , John Mack , $ 40 million in stock and options for 2006 , according to a regulatory filing on December 14 .
When Mack rejoined Morgan Stanley in June 2005 ( he was ousted as president of the bank in 2001 ) , he received a new - hire award of 500,000 restricted stock units , valued at $ 26.2 million .
In February 2006 , Morgan Stanley announced that it had awarded Mack $ 13 million in cash , stock and other compensation for his first five months on the job .
Aside from his salary , therefore , Mack has received compensation worth nearly $ 80 million in 18 months at Morgan Stanley .
Mack ’s $ 40 million bonus , however , is expected to be eclipsed by the amount eventually handed out to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein .
His 2006 bonus will probably top $ 50 million , according to analysts .
Other executives in the $ 40 - $ 50 million category include James Cayne of Bear Stearns , Stan O’Neal of Merrill Lynch and Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers , notes the Wall Street Journal .
Much of the bonus money is paid out for those involved in massive mergers and acquisitions .
The New York Times revealed what it termed the “ dirty little secret ” of corporate mergers :
There is “ a torrent of multibillion [ dollar ] takeovers and mergers at the end of every year ” to influence bonuses “ for all involved in the deal , especially the bankers . ”
The newspaper added , “ Corporate America ’s biggest cheerleaders and boosters need to get paid . ”
Bankers at Goldman Sachs and the other firms receive bonus money for a deal announced this year , and receive another reward when the deal closes next year .
Even if the merger eventually fails to come about , the bankers keep their bonus money .
The nature of Goldman Sachs ’ activities underscores the parasitic character of modern - day American capitalism .
According to the Times , the investment bank has “ transformed its business to capitalize on sea changes in the capital markets , particularly new opportunities in far - flung markets and a shift from issuing and trading plain - vanilla stocks and bonds to building and trading complex derivative products . ”
Two episodes demonstrate how Goldman Sachs makes some of its billions .
In the second quarter of 2006 , it spent $ 2.6 billion for a 5 percent stake in the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China , the largest state - owned bank in that country .
When the latter went public in October , Goldman Sachs reaped a windfall .
For the fourth quarter , it made nearly $ 1 billion on the investment .
Goldman Sachs earned a further half a billion dollars on the sale of Accordia Golf , a portfolio of Japanese golf courses it began to acquire in 2001 .
This is a far cry from the manufacturing operations of a Henry Ford or an Andrew Carnegie .
Goldman Sachs is a particularly well - connected financial institution .
The present US treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , is a former chairman and CEO .
His three immediate predecessors were Jon Corzine , former US senator ( and present governor of New Jersey ) , Stephen Friedman , who became chairman of the National Economic Council ( and later chairman of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , in which capacity he still works ) and Robert Rubin , who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration .
The billions in bonuses will have a material impact , in the first place , on New York City , further widening the social gap .
Financial industry employees collect more than 50 percent of the wages paid in Manhattan , although their 280,000 jobs represent less than a sixth of the total ( 1.8 million ) , and that first figure itself is skewed , considering the relatively small percentage of employees at Wall Street firms who make fabulous amounts .
Meanwhile , incomes for restaurant , hotel , retail and health care workers stagnate , in many cases at near - poverty levels .
Real estate brokers , luxury automobile and jewelry dealers salivated at news of the Wall Street bonuses .
According to the Times , “ There are few things that can gladden the hearts of New York real estate brokers as much as the thought of billions of dollars in bonuses paid on Wall Street , moving from hedge funds and buyout fees to brick and stone , or in some cases , glass and steel , as this uncertain year of wavering condominium and co-op price draws to a close . ”
The newspaper continued : “ Not all buyers , of course , wait for bonus season .
Among recent transactions was the $ 19 million sale of a co-op at 66 East 79th Street to J. Christopher Flowers , a former Goldman Sachs partner who formed his own investment fund , and who is listed by Forbes on its list of 400 richest Americans with a net worth of $ 1.2 billion .
Then , Kenneth D. Brody , another former Goldman Sachs partner , who went on the head the United States Export - Import Bank during the Clinton administration , bought a fifth - floor apartment at 25 Sutton Place for $ 6.25 million . ”
The vast amount paid out for real estate in Manhattan and affluent corners of the other boroughs is helping drive up housing costs .
For working New Yorkers , affordable rents are disappearing .
And social conditions for millions in the city continue to deteriorate .
In 2004 , in the “ richest city in the world , ” an estimated 1.2 million people , including 400,000 children , lived in hunger or in households where having sufficient food was always in question .
In 2005 , the top fifth of Manhattan ’s earners reported making $ 330,244 -- about 41 times more than the $ 8,019 reported by the bottom fifth .
The Bronx remains the poorest urban county in the country ; more than half of its households headed by a woman and including young children live below the poverty level .
As is the case with every other social phenomenon , there are two holiday seasons in the US , one for the wealthy elite and another for the overwhelming majority of the population .
The gap is registered by every significant social barometer .
In late November , Tiffany & Co. reported a 23 percent jump in earnings on increased sale of $ 20,000 rings and necklaces .
The luxury retailer hiked its profit forecast for the year as a result of the holiday demand .
The Bloomberg wire service noted , “ The US luxury market has grown as the number of Americans with financial assets of at least $ 1 million increased 6.5 percent last year , according to the World Wealth Report published by Capgemini Group and Merrill Lynch & Co. Tiffany and other US luxury retailers are poised to have a strong holiday season , analysts said . ”
The Chicago Tribune commented , “ So far , it ’s a tale of two Christmases for retailers .
Those stores catering to luxury shoppers are faring better than discount stores . ”
The International Council of Shopping Centers noted that sales at chain stores rose only 2.1 percent in November , reflecting , in particular , the poor showing of Wal - Mart , where millions of lower - income people shop , which experienced its worst performance in a decade .
A report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out that the disparities in consumer expenditure among households at different income levels were greater in 2005 than in any year on record .
The top fifth of households made 39 percent of all consumer expenditures in 2005 , the highest share on record .
The bottom 20 percent of the population made only eight percent of the expenditures , tied with 2004 for the lowest share ever .
The media and political establishment attempt to ignore this vast social chasm — or treat it as something of a joke .
At one point in American history , and not so terribly long ago , the Goldman Sachs bonuses would have caused a furor .
The amounts handed out , while tens of millions lived in poverty , would have been called a national disgrace .
Congressmen would have demanded public hearings .
Now , there is a shrug of the shoulder in the media , or an amused reference , or hints of envy and jealousy .
The politicians , many of them multi-millionaires like Corzine , prefer to say nothing .
If anything , the vast pay - outs are seen as a positive sign .
As a New York Times reporter , speaking for many , asserted , “ Investment banking earnings are often proxies for the health of the American and global economy . ”
On the contrary , the misappropriation of wealth to a handful of speculators and glorified bottom - feeders is a sign of a diseased social organism .
The funneling of tens of billions into the hands of the elite , who will spend it on themselves , on their homes , yachts and private airplanes , means that useful and productive projects go by the wayside and grave social needs go unmet .
The Goldman Sachs figures made a few people in the media nervous .
John Gibson , one of Fox News ’s right - wing anchormen , wrote , “ Yes , I ’m for capitalism , but please .
You ’ve got guys like [ Democratic Party politician ]
John Edwards saying there ’s two Americas — the rich and the poor — playing the class game . . .
My point is :
Why do the fat cats have to work so hard at proving him right when by and large we know he ’s wrong ? ”
The Washington Post business page opined , “ Still , news of Wall Street ’s Very , Very Good Year is likely to stir some resentment on Main Street — not because the economy is so bad as much as it is yet another reminder of the ever - widening gap between the super - rich and everyone else . ”

A couple days ago , I posted YouTube film critic Rob Ager 's in - depth analysis of Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining ... which oscillated wildly between extremely insightful commentary on the symbolism and psychology that made The Shining so effective and Ager 's own wishful - thinking political wankery ( for example , his assertion that Shelley Duvall is dressed as a Native American woman throughout the film , which illustrates the subjugation of Indian wives by early American colonial husbands ) .
It was an odd , fascinating mix .
This is Rob Ager 's similar treatment of Clockwork Orange : the first part focuses mostly upon Clockwork Orange 's themes of society in violent , sexual decay and the integral quality of violence to define humanity .
The second part , though , focuses on the Illuminati and the New World Order .
Ager couches his language with plausibly - deniable " mays " , but if becomes clear during this part that Ager believes in the Illuminati and actually thinks Kubrick was hired to film the hoaxed moon landings and assassinated for exposing the Illuminati in Eyes Wide Shut .
Yeah , it 's nutty , but despite Ager 's weirdo conspiracy theories , he does make a convincing case that Kubrick may at least have shared his theories .
He points out several moments ( one , in the prison yard , extremely interesting ) from Clockwork Orange where the Stonemason pyramid is clearly visible .

lolcatのファンたちがインターネット上でプログラミング言語を作成している。 lolcatの人気 がプログラミングにまで波及し、 lolcat の独特な文法に基づいたプログラミング言語LOLCODEが誕生したのだ。そこであなたも大流行の「バケツ」を手に取り、早速LOLCODEを習得してみよう。
当然ながらlolcatと同様にLOLCODEにも、実用的な価値や教育的な価値はまったくない。しかしだからといって「楽しくない」わけでは決してない。それに、プログラミング言語開発の黎明期に参加できるチャンスはそうそう転がっているわけではないのだ。
構文
LOLCODE 言語は現在のところはまだ開発/策定段階だが、LOLCODEの習得を始めることはすでに可能であり、開発/策定の手助けを行なうことさえできるようになっている。あなたがlolcatのファンであれば、文法は簡単に覚えることができるだろう。そうではなくあなたがlolcatのファンでないというのなら、おそらくこの記事をここまで読んでいるということもないだろう。
さて言語の入門ということであれば、お約束の「 Hello World!」の例を抜きにすることはできない。LOLCODEには「 Hello World !」の代わり に「 HAI WORLD !」という例がある。
LOLCODE アプリケーションはすべて HAI 文から始まる 。「 HAI WORLD !」では、その次にLOLCODEのプリント文である
VISIBLE があり、最後は KTHXBYE 文で閉じる 。
HAI VISIBLE " HAI WORLD ! " KTHXBYE
上の例からも分かる通り、LOLCODEでは当然のこととして、すべて大文字が使用される。
ループ
LOLCODEで変数を宣言するためには、以下のようにI HAS A文を使用する。
I HAS A CHEEZBURGER
ここでは CHEEZBURGER を変数として宣言している。それでは次に、CHEEZBURGERの値を1ずつ増加してその値を表示する短いスクリプトを見てみよう。
HAI I HAS A CHEEZBURGER ITZ 1 IM IN YR LOOP VISIBLE " I has dis many : " N CHEEZBURGER IZ CHEEZBURGER BIGGER THAN 11 O RLY ?
YA RLY GTFO NO WAI UP CHEEZBURGER !!1 KTHX KTHX KTHXBYE
上記の I HAS A 文では、変数 CHEEZBURGER を宣言し、その 値 を1 に設定している。次の IM IN YR LOOP 文は、ループを開始する 。
次に VISIBLE 関数を使用して、現在の値を表示する。なお CHEEZBURGER の値を表示するためには、単に CHEEZBURGER とするのではなく N CHEEZBURGER とする必要がある。その後、値の比較を行ない、
CHEEZBURGER の値がループを終了するための定数を越えていないかどうかを判定する。
UP CHEEZBURGER!!1 は、 CHEEZBURGER の値に1を足す。
値の比較により、値が一致した場合には（ YA RLY ）、LOLCODE は GTFO 文を実行してループを終了する。一方、値が一致しない場合には（ NO WAI ）、 CHEEZBURGER 変数を再 び1 増加する。なおループが KTHXBYE ではなく KTHX で閉じられていることに注意しよう。 KTHXBYE はプログラム全体のブロックを閉じるときにのみ使用することが推奨されている。そしてこのプログラムでも、最後の
KTHXBYE 文でプログラムのブロックを閉じている。
LOLCODE の実行
以上で基本的な文法を把握したので、実際にLOLCODEプログラムを実行してみよう。LOLCODEにはPerl、Python、.Net、Javaなどで書かれた様々な実装がある。私はParrotチームがそのうちParrot Virtual MachineでLOLCODEもサポートしてくれることを期待しているのだが、それが実現するまではLOLPythonインタプリタで試すことにした。
しかし残念ながら、LOLPythonはLOLCODEの最新版を扱うことができなかった。一方、Perlで書かれたBSDライセンスのLOLCode
Interpreterでは、LOLCODEの最新版もちゃんと動かすことができた。LOLCode Interpreterを使うには、PerlモジュールParse::RecDescentがインストールされたシステムならば、lol.plファイルを取得するだけで良い。なおUbuntuでlibparse-recdescent-perlをインストールするには、「 sudo apt - get install libparse - recdescent - perl 」と実行するだけだ 。
プログラムを実行するためには、プログラムを .lolファイルとして保存する。例えば私の場合、上記のHAI WORLDプログラムをhai.lolとして保存した。プログラムを実行するには、lol.plを実行可能にして（ chmod 755 lol.pl ）、以下のようにしてスクリプトを実行すればよい。
lol.pl hai.lol
LOLCode Interpreterのウェブページでは、LOLCode
InterpreterがサポートしているLOLCODE文法のリストを見ることができる。
I Can Has Cheezburger ?サイトの写真をすでに全部見てしまったのなら、しばらくはLOLCODEをハックして暇を潰すのも良いだろう。KTHXBYE！

It 's been about a week since we have heard anything about Nick Lachey and a new love interest .
Life & Style is reporting that he has a new girlfriend named Kim Kardashian .
The couple was seen leaving an afternoon showing of The Da Vinci Code in Westwood .
Life and Style reports :
â€ œThey were holding hands throughout most of the movie , and shared popcorn and a drink , â€ ? an eyewitness tells Life & Style .
â€ œShe was resting her head on his shoulder during the movie .
It was definitely a date.â€ ?
Afterwards , Nick dropped Kim off at her Beverly Hills house and went inside , staying for about half an hour .
As Life & Style first exclusively reported , Kim â€ ” daughter of late O.J. Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian â€ ” started seeing Nick in April .
Insiders close to the couple confirm that the two have been quietly going out for almost two months .
â€ ?
Itâ€™s real , itâ€™s more than a one time thing , â€ ? one insider tells Life & Style .
â€ œTheyâ€™ve been keeping it very low profile , just going to friends houses and small restaurants.â€ ?

「 Code Reading―オープンソースから学ぶソフトウェア開発技法」（毎日コミュニケーションズ発行，写真1）という本があります。私はこの本の監訳者ですから，やや自画自賛になってしまいますが，ソースコードの読み方を主題にした本はほかにはあまりありません。技法からツール，データ構造，アーキテクチャ，さらには実際にコードを読んで利用する実例まで紹介している網羅的で良い本だと思います。
写 真1 ● 「 Code Reading―オープンソースから学ぶソフトウェア開発技法」（毎日コミュニケーションズ発行）
この本の 「 はじめに 」 で「達人プログラマー」として知られるDave Thomas氏は以下のように書いています。
他人の作品を読まなかった偉大な作家，他人の筆づかいを研究しなかった偉大な画家，同僚の肩越しに技を盗まなかった腕のよい外科医，副操縦席で実地の経験を積まなかった767機長――果たして，そんな人たちが本当にいるのでしょうか？
たしかにその通りです。ソフトウエア以外の領域では修行することとはすなわち，他の人の仕事をながめ，まずマネをして，そして十分力を付けてから自分の独自性を出すことです。空手ではこれを「守・破・離」と呼ぶと聞いたことがあります。
この当然のことが，IT業界では必ずしも守られていない側面がありました。商用ソフトの世界ではソースコードは「飯のタネ」であり，広く見せることは想定外でした。商用ソフトでは，隠し持ったソースコードがすなわち財産なので，なかなかよそのソースコードを読むことはできません。ソフトウエア開発技術の多くは，それぞれのソフトウエア会社の中で口伝のように先輩から後輩へと伝えられてきました。
オープンソースの登場で，コードから学ぶ機会が増えた
しかし，近年になって状況は大きく変化しています。ソースコードが公開されている「自由なソフトウエア」は，1980年代から「フリーソフトウエア」として知られていましたが，90年代末から「オープンソース」という新しい名前を得て，広く知られるようになりました。また，インターネットの普及により，以前よりもはるかに簡単にこれらの自由なソフトウエアを入手することができるようになりました。少し検索すれば，世の中に数多くのオープンソース・ソフトウエアを見つけることができます。オペレーティング・システム（OS），エディタ，オフィス・ソフト，ペイント・ソフト，開発ツール，ユーティリティなど，今やほとんどあらゆる種類のソフトウエアがオープンソースで手に入ります。
これらのソフトウエアは，実行ファイルだけでなくソースコードも入手できます。ソースコードを読んで，そのソフトウエアがどのように実装されているかを，実際に使われている「生の」コードを通じて学ぶことができます。
例えば，OSを考えてみましょう。OSの重要な使命はハードウエアの抽象化と資源の管理です。ハードウエアを直接操作するのは大変なので，OSがそれらに対する使いやすいインタフェースを提供してくれます。また，メモリー，ディスク，時計などの「資源」を複数のソフトウエアが競合せずに使えるように管理してくれます。これらの処理の本質はさほど難しいものではありません。例えば，OSの教科書としては古典の，Andrew Tannenbaum教授による「 Operating Systems : Design and Implementation （ 「 オペレーティングシステム 第 2 版 設計と理論およ びMINIXによる実装」，プレンティスホール出版発行）」は，実例としてわずか1万2000行で実装されたUNIX系OS，MINIXを紹介しています。また，初期のUNIX実装を紹介した「
Lion's Commentary on UNIX 」 （アスキー発行）という書籍は ，UNIX V6 のソースコードを解説していますが，それもわずか1万行というコンパクトなコードです。
しかし，世の中で実際に使われているOSは肥大化の一方です。オープンソースOSとして有名なLinuxのソースコードの行数は600万行にも上ります。Windows XPのソースコードは公開されていませんが，一説には，Linuxよりさらに多く数千万行に上るということです。OSの基本的な部分はわずかな行数で実現できても，それを実用的なレベルに引き上げるには，その数倍，数十倍のコードが必要になるのです。ソースコードが公開されていないソフトウエアでは，こうした実践的な部分を外からうかがい知ることはできません。一方，オープンソース・ソフトウエアであれば，このような部分も含めて実際のソースコードから学べます。これを生かさない手はありません。
万有引力の法則で有名なアイザック・ニュートンは，自分の実績について「私がさらに遠くを見ることができたとしたら，それは単に私が巨人の肩に乗っていたからだ」と語ったといいます。過去の資産があればこそ，その上に偉大な成果を積み重ねることができる，という意味です。私たちも，オープンソース・ソフトウエアが積み上げてくれたソースコードという知識を利用することで「巨人の肩に乗る」ことが可能になるのです。
「 読む目的」をはっきりさせ る
オープンソース・ソフトウエアのおかげで，実践的なソースコードを隅から隅までながめ，学習できるようになりました。だからといって，目的もなしにただソースを読みさえすれば，誰でも優秀なプログラマになれるわけではありません。残念ながら，ソースコードは，小説，音楽，映画などのように，直接人間の感性に働きかけるものではありません。ソースコードは，人間とコンピュータの両方が理解できるように，プログラミング言語というやや特殊な形式で記述されています。ですから，普通の小説のようには読み下せません。数万行もあるソースコードを目的もなく最初から読み下してその中身をすんなり理解できる人はほとんどいないでしょう。ただ，ソースコードには小説のような物語があるわけではないので，必ずしも全体を通して読む必要はありません＊1。むしろ，積極的に面白そうなところ，必要なところだけをつまみ食いして，先人の知恵を学べばそれで十分です。
さて，ソースコードを読みこなすにはいろいろと必要なものがあります。最も必要なものはおそらく「目的」でしょう。何かを学ぼうと思ってソースコードを読むことで，効果的に読解し，知識を得ることができます。例えば「再帰下降構文解析の実装法を学ぶ」とか「この処理系がどのようにガーベジ・コレクションを実装しているか」とか「なぜこの処理系はこんなに高速に動作するのか」といったことです。何かを身に付けようという目的は，膨大なソースコードの中でどこを読むかということを決める指針になります。
ソースコードを読む目的は，学習のためばかりとは限りません。例えば，ソフトウエアの保守やデバッグのためにソースコードを読まなければならないこともあります。仕事上の理由で他の人が書いたソフトウエアを保守しなければならない事態になることは珍しくありません。ソフトウエアを改善したり，機能を追加したり，バグを直したりするためには，目的のソフトウエアのソースコードを読みこなす必要があります。たとえ自分が書いたソフトウエアでも，しばらく時間が経てばその内容や背景などをすっかり忘れてしまうことも珍しくありません。ソフトウエア業界には「半年前の自分は他人」という「ことわざ」があるくらいです。ですから，自分の書いたソフトウエアでも，結局はコードを読む必要があります。
「 読み方の戦略」を持 つ
たとえきちんとした目的を持っていても，やみくもにソースコードをさまよっていては目的を達成できません。コードの読み方の戦略にはいくつかありますが，私がよく使うものを紹介しておきましょう（図1）。
図1●ソースコードを読むための三つの戦略
●落下傘方 式
目的を持ってソースコードを読むときに，プログラム全体を読む必要があることはまれです。実際には，何か知りたい知識が隠されている部分とか，バグを抱えている部分とか，全体からみるとほんの一部に過ぎないところを見つけ出し，その部分だけを読めば十分である場合のほうが多いのです。「落下傘方式」とは，そのような重要な場所を見つけ出して，その部分のソースコードだけを読解する戦略です。落下傘部隊が戦略上の重要ポイントにいきなり降下するイメージですね。落下傘方式の本質は，どの部分が重要であるかを見つけ出すことです。実例はあとで紹介しますが，検索が鍵になります。
●深さ優先探索方 式
ごくまれに，プログラム全体の流れを把握したいケースがあります。例えばLinuxの起動時の制御の流れを把握したい場合などです。このような場合には，プログラム起動時に一番最初に実行されるmain関数から始めて，呼び出される関数を次々にたどっていく「深さ優先探索」が有効です。これ以上他の関数を呼び出さない末端の関数まで来たら，今度は今までの経路を逆にたどって読解をはじめます。このようにボトムアップで読解することで「知らない関数が存在しない」状態で読解を行うことができ，効率的にソースコードを読むことができます。この方式は開発者の名前を取って「ひらメソッド」と呼ばれ，実際にLinuxソースコードの読解に用いられています＊2。
●デバッガ方 式
プログラムの状態は実行に伴ってどんどん変化します。ですから，プログラムを読解するといっても，プログラムの字面だけをたどっても理解できるとはかぎりません。ときには読解者は自分がコンピュータになったつもりで変数やオブジェクトの状態を想像しながら読解する必要があります。
しかし，考えてみれば，我々が想像しなくても，どうせコンピュータはプログラムを実行するのですから，その実行の様子をのぞいてみることができれば，正確に実行時の状態を知ることができます。そのことを可能にしてくれるのがデバッガです。デバッガを使えば，プログラムを任意の場所で一時停止させ，そのときの変数の状態などを調べられます。デバッガはバグを発見するために作られたソフトウエアですが，ソフトウエアの動的な状態（実行時の状態）を知ることができるため，コード・リーディングにも有効です。
SCENE 1
Suburbia - 6:15 am GUESTS : Neighbors 1 , 2 , 3 & 4 AB : Good morning .
Where are you guys all headed off to ?
NEIGHBOR # 1 : [ holds up his coffee cup ]
AB : Ahh , going for that first cup of morning Joe , huh ?
You know I know it 's none of my business , but is n't that the sort of thing you ought be getting at home ?
N #1 : Home coffee bad .
AB : Bad ?
Oh yeah ?
Well try this on for size .
You know , there used to be a time that folks were proud of their home brew .
I mean , heck , back before there were pre-ground packets and freeze - dried crystals , shoot , people not only ground they roasted their own coffee .
Try that .
N #1 : Hey , this is good .
AB : Darn tootin ' it is .
NEIGHBOR # 2 : The stuff I make never tastes like this .
AB : Well , see , unfortunately most of us have handed the brewing over to those big , gadget , laden , counter sculptures that are really more about looks and convenience than flavor .
Now you 've got to think of it this way : brewing is cooking .
I mean , would your hand your steak over to some machine to cook for you ?
NEIGHBOR # 3 : [ shrugs ]
AB : Heck , no .
I 'm telling you friends and neighbors , it 's time we took coffee back into our own hands .
NEIGHBOR # 4 : But how ?
AB : I 'll tell you how .
First we 've got to really understand our ingredients , we 've got to master some basic techniques , and we 've got to get hold of some reliable tools .
N #1 : Do you really think we could do it , stranger ?
AB : Friend , humanity demands it .
Besides , I do n't know about those little bunnies there , hose little lambsies you 've got on , but these little piggies we 're not made for beating the mean streets .
So , are you with me ?
N #1 - 4 : You betcha .
AB : That 's what I wanted to hear .
All right , we 've got a lot of grounds to cover not a whole lot of time .
So , strap in tight .
Pay attention .
And believe me , the next cup you brew will be seriously ...
N #1 - 4 : Good Eats ?
AB : Could n't have said it better myself , pilgrim .
[ drives off ]
NEIGHBOR # 3 : Who was that guy ?
N #1 : And where did he get those slippers ?
SCENE 2
Atlanta Botanical Gardens : Atlanta , GA - 7:30 am
The coffee bean is actually the pit of a cherry like fruit that grows , botanically speaking , on one of two varieties of coffee tree .
Now Robusto trees are hardy and high - yielding but their beans render a brew that 's all power , meaning caffeine , and no flavor .
There kind of the malt liquors of the hot beverage world .
On the other hand , Arabica trees , like this one are shy , finicky , delicate mountain dwellers that produce a measly two pounds of beans a year .
But , oh the beans .
Not only do Arabica beans deliver a sublime , gestalt of flavor , acidity , body and aroma , they actually have the ability to capture the essence of where they were grown .
Like great wine grapes , Arabica beans deliver terroir .
Which means that not only are beans from the three major world growing areas different from each other but within each of these areas there are hundreds of different subtle variations .
Now as much as I do n't care for gross generalizations , I do have a little analogy that I 've been working on to kind of sum up this whole world coffee thing .
So here I go .
Hawaii and Central America : Bright , snappy .
Pop music .
Okay , you with me ?
Hawaii
Central America Pop Music East Africa and Yemen : Brooding , but still catchy .
Beethoven , on a good day .
East Africa
Yemen Beethoven
Then you 've got Sumatra and Indonesia :
And the coffees down there are just plain funk .
No way around it .
Sumatra
Indonesia Funk
Aw , geez .
I 've got to go .
SCENE 3
St. Ives Coffee Roasters : Gainesville , GA - 10:01 am GUEST : Dr. Don Wilson , Master Roaster
Now at this point , the beans are referred to as ' green ' .
They do n't look a whole lot like coffee and to tell you the truth , if you were to brew up a cup it would n't taste a much like coffee .
It would taste much more like ... well ... yard clipping soup probably .
Now it requires the talents of master roasters at this point to fulfill the flavor potential of the bean through the application , judicious application , of heat which is the next step .
Because once they are sucked up through this hopper these beans will head into this giant , oversized ... well ... gas - powered clothes dryer , I 'd guess you 'd say , which is being operated by a master roaster , in this case Doctor Don Wilson .
DON WILSON : Hi , Alton .
How are you doing ?
AB : How you 're doing , Doc ?
DW : Good thanks .
Good .
AB : Thanks for having me in .
DW : You 're welcome .
AB : I got a question for you .
DW : Yeah .
AB : What exactly is it that roasting does ?
DW : Well , what we 're going to do is bring the beans up through temperature and we 're looking for color , consistency , and most importantly we 're going to look for chemical change in the beans to bring out the aromas , the flavors .
It 's a process called pyrolysis .
Pyrolysis : Chemical change resulting from exposure to heat .
DW : The First Crack is where the water comes to boiling temperature and it pops and starts to turn to steam .
AB : Kind of like popcorn ?
DW : Yeah .
And it cracks the bean and pops the chaff out .
AB : We actually hear that ?
You hear the pop ?
DW : You 'll hear it .
AB : What do you think is the kind of optimum balance between the flavor of the bean and the flavor of the roast ?
DW : It 's a question of personal preference .
As people learn more about coffee , they 'll learn that different levels of roast suit particular coffees better .
[ they begin to hear cracking ]
That 's the first crack .
You 're hearing it now .
different roasts for different beans AB : Yeah .
DW : We 're going to take frequent samples to determine when it 's absolutely at it 's best .
Don 's looking for the " sweet spot " where acidity , flavor and body balance .
DW : We 're going to see a little bit of oil appearing ...
AB : Uh , huh .
DW : ... just in the center of the surface of the bean .
AB : That 's starting to look like a seriously cooked coffee bean .
DW : I got seconds there to get this right .
So , I 'm going on a combination of eye , nose and ear .
Okay , we 're ready to drop .
Since Don was after a bright acidity and a regional character he stopped these beans at a Light City Roast .
A few minutes down the line would have been a Full City usually considered a perfect balance of flavor and body .
A little further than that a French or Vienna Roast trades flavor for body .
Then later an Italian Roast which at this point is , well , it 's practically charcoal and no real flavor of the bean remains .
Just roast .
Light City
Full City
Vienna / French
Italian DW :
The further you roast coffee the lower in caffeine it becomes .
So an Espresso Roast has actually got less caffeine per ounce than the Light City .
The darker the roast , the lower the caffeine AB : Well Don , thank you very much for the tour .
DW : You 're welcome .
AB : I appreciate your work .
Beautiful job .
Well now that they 've reached their peak of flavor each one of these tiny beans is also a ticking time bomb .
That 's because unless they 're stored in air tight containers immediately , they start going stale .
The problem is that these beans , at least for the next couple of days , will be giving off prodigious amounts of carbon dioxide .
So much so , in fact , that they 'll basically blow their way , appropriately , out of any container you seal them in .
But there is a way to diffuse the situation .
SCENE 4
St. Ives Coffee Roasters : Gainesville , GA - 11:19 am A coffee house that roasts on premises can avoid explosive situations by moving beans straight from the roaster to jars which when opened on a regular basis allow for venting .
Now , as long as the coffee house enjoys speedy turnover , staleness will never have a chance to happen .
Now a good coffee house , by the way , is like a good fish market : the busier it is the fresher the product is .
Now as far as grocery stores go , well , that 's a whole ' nother can of beans .
SCENE 5
Grocery Store
It used to be by the time a coffee gassed out and was shipped to a retailer it was well on its way to staledom .
But , in the 1960s an Italian engineer came up with away to keep freshness in while giving CO 2 a way out : an air - tight bag with a one - way value laminated right into the side .
Just feel around your bag .
You 'll know if its there .
Thus contained , beans can remain fresh for two , maybe three months .
By the way , whole beans are not always fresh beans .
Given a little air , a little time , a little light even the most noble beans will be rendered flavorless .
So , beware open bean bins .
One Way Valve
Oh , geez .
I 've got to get moving .
SCENE 6
The Kitchen
These two bags may look alike , but they 're not .
See , this bag is actually sealed .
While this bag is merely closed .
See , your friendly , neighborhood roaster never meant for you to keep beans in this bag .
He just did n't want you to have to carry them home in your pockets .
This sealed bag on the other hand is an acceptable storage device .
But remember , once it 's breached the time bomb clock starts ticking again .
You can diffuse the situation by getting all of these back into an air tight environment .
Do not be fooled by these little twist ties .
These are not acceptable containers anymore .
But a canister is fine as long as you know that the seal is air tight .
Air Tight Container
Now as for temperatures , freezing or refrigerating may be popular with coffee fans but not with coffee beans .
See , each time you fetch them from the chill , moisture condenses on the surface of the bean which only makes them degrade faster .
Now as long as you do n't stash this near the oven , room temperature will do just fine .
Now that we have procured and secured quality beans we only have 97 percent of the coffee ingredients to go .
Oh geez .
I 've got a boat to catch .
SCENE 7
Municipal Water Works - 12:43 pm
Coffee is mostly water .
Not only does H 2 O work as a solvent liberating flavor compounds from the bean , but it blends its own flavor to the equation .
Now most of us receive our tap water from municipal supplies pumped from rivers and lakes into huge basins where various suspended solids are removed via sedintation and coagulation .
Now various disinfectants , neutralized various pathogenic organisms and various filtration mediums clarify matters further .
Now besides chlorine and fluoride , you 're average tap water contains at least trace amounts of other chemicals which insure its wholesomeness .
Which is not say it makes it taste good .
Luckily a simple carbon - based water filter can wrestle away most of the offending flavors .
carbon ( charcoal ) water filter
In areas that have either excessively hard , soft or sulphury water you should probably go with bottled water .
But avoid distilled water .
It 's so flat and empty that it really just can't chemically get a grip on the grounds .
too hard
too soft
sulphury go bottled NOT distilled Oh , geez .
Time to talk mythology .
SCENE 8
Blackjack Table
You know , brewing coffee is a lot like black jack .
It 's a gamble .
But just like the good gambler knows how to play the odds , the good brewer knows how to play the odds .
For instance , a good brewer knows that 30 percent of the beans total weight is extractable by water .
He would also know that of that two thirds tastes really great .
Would also know that that last third would tastes really rotten .
So , the question is how far are you willing to go .
Cause if you extract just enough you 'll have a great tasting cup .
But if you go too far , oooo , busted .
Oh well .
Hopefully making coffee wo n't ever be as painful as this .
30 % of bean is extractable
And it wo n't be as long as you can control four specific functions .
You 've got to be able to control the temperature of the water , the size of the grind , the proportion of coffee to water and finally the brew time .
H 2 0 Temperature
Grind Size
Coffee : H 2 0
Brew Time
If you 've got those down , every single cup is going to be a winner .
Well , better luck next time , sir .
Appreciate that .
Oh , geez .
I 've got to go .
Lloyd's of London started as a coffee house in 1668 .
SCENE 9
The Kitchen GUESTS : Chuck , Sleepy Neighbor {??? } ... appreciate the fact that most human beings brew their coffee while in a quasi- somnambulistic state .
That 's why we 've designed a brewing system of such cunning design as to render the highest amount of flavor for the smallest amount of both financial and mental investment .
Now just to prove how easy it is to make truly , truly great coffee we 've invited over my sleepy - headed , late - night working butcher neighbor , CHUCK , to give it a test spin .
CHUCK : Mister Brown is that you ?
AB : Right over here Chuck .
Over here .
Nice of you to join us , buddy .
C : I was having the nicest dream .
AB : Yeah ?
About a nice , steaming mug of mocha java ?
C : That 's right , molten lava .
AB : Poor kid .
Helps on the way .
Look what you 're going to be testing for us .
A manual drip brewer featuring a thermal carafe .
C : Gerbil giraffe .
AB : And that 's not all .
We 've got an electric coffee grinder here and an electric kettle .
And now I know .
You want to ask me why all the separate components .
C : Desperate doughnuts .
AB : These components will give you control .
And flavor is all about control .
Now , Chuck , in your opinion what would you say are the top coffee making mistakes ?
C : Poppy raking with snakes .
AB : Most of us do n't put near enough coffee in our coffee .
Look , the ratio is two tablespoons of freshly ground beans to six ounces of water .
Okay ?
Now we 're going to make four perfect cups of coffee .
And that means we 're going to need 24 ounces of water , right ?
Which I 've already loaded up into this kettle .
So if you 'll just plug that in for us we 'll get going , okay ?
6 oz .
H 2 0 + 2 Tbl Coffee 4 servings = 24 oz H 2 0 A lot of people do n't think they like strong coffee when in reality what they do n't like is bitter coffee .
Now logically to take care of this they decide to brew with fewer grounds .
The problem is is that makes the bitterness even worse .
And here 's why .
If this filter was full up with grounds then as the water were to moving through it , it would just kind of extract the right amount of solids as it went through .
But if its only got , maybe , coffee up to here then you 've got a lot more water crossing a smaller amount of grounds .
That means it 's going to extract a lot more flavor and a lot of that flavor is bad .
Bitter .
We do n't want that .
fewer grounds = over extraction = bitter coffee AB : Hi .
Um , what do you think is the biggest favor you can do your beans ?
C : For fiends .
AB : Right .
Grind your own .
I mean you want to open these guys up and get their power out as close to brew time as possible .
I mean after all you would n't buy a bottle of champagne and then ask the cashier to uncork it for you , would you ?
C : [ shakes his head ]
AB : No .
You would never do that .
Same thing here .
Now there are a lot of different machines out there to grind coffee .
Some that are programmable .
They do it for all different kinds of drips .
But , I 've got to tell you this little 20 dollar blade grinder does a fine job by me .
So do me a favor .
Plug this up and push down that button for 15 seconds , okay ?
Good .
$ 20 blade grinder Now grind time and of course grind size is completely dependent on the brewing method .
Now a fast brewing coffee like espresso can use a very , very fine powdery grind where a longer brewing method like , say , French press needs a pretty , big chunky grind .
Now I 've found that for drip machines either manual or automatic work fine with about a 15 second grind .
15 - 20 sec. grind for all drip makers AB : Chuck .
You 're there .
You 're there .
Come on back .
Good job .
Okay .
That 's perfect .
Now this is a two tablespoon measure .
We 're going to use one of these for every cup of coffee , okay .
So take this and let 's have four spoonfulls right there .
2
Tbls per 6 oz H 2 0 Now if you do n't have a coffee scoop just make sure ...
AB : That 's not cereal , Chuck .
Coffee , not cereal .
There you go .
... make sure you that you use two tablespoons for each cup .
You 've got that .
Now a lot of folks like to use paper filters and they 're fine .
Although I find that these gold filters besides being a little easier on the local land fill allow more of the body producing compounds to pass through from the coffee and I like that .
These little guys will pay for themselves in one year .
AB : You know , I think the water is ready .
C : I do n't want to go steady .
AB : The kettle ?
Oh , wait , wait , wait .
Now this is important .
The ideal extraction temperature is between 190 and 205 degrees which is just off the boil .
So hold that for about 10 seconds , okay ?
Now here 's another little tip .
Since coffee grounds have a tendency to float when you pour in the water give the top a little bit of a spritz .
By pre-saturating those grounds you 're going to have cleaner extraction .
Which is a good thing .
Now you may pour .
190° - 205°
Now , odds are good he 's going to have to fill that cone about three times .
And it 's probably going to take a total of four minutes .
And that is perfect because the last great secret to coffee brewing is that you want a four to five minute extraction .
That is the window where the flavors we are after will come out .
4 - 5 minutes brew time
Want to know how many six - ounce servings your electric maker can crank out ?
Just fill it full of water , measure how much it holds and divide by six .
To re-calibrate your electric brewer 's capacity ,
measure how many ounces it holds , then divide by six .
Four minutes to brew , three minutes to heat the water .
If you ask me , seven minutes is not too much of an investment for a perfect pot of coffee .
Of course , the very best thing about this carafe is that when he wakes up in a few hours this will still be hot .
Oh geez .
I 've got to go .
SCENE 10
The Kitchen GUEST : Judy Crim , Dietitian
Well , it looks like our friend , Chuck , is now friskier than a heard of Ethiopian goats .
AB : Uh , hey , Chuck .
I can't help but notice you 're mopping my floor .
C : Ah , it 's the least I can do , Mr. Brown .
AB : Okay .
What I want to know is what 's got him feeling so darned good .
Luckily I 've got a registered Dietitian hanging around the place who can answer these kinds of questions .
AB : So , why is he feeling so darned good ?
JUDY CRIM : It 's the caffeine .
He 's wired from the caffeine .
AB : Yeah , I think he drank like the whole pot of this thing .
How does that stuff work ?
JC : Well , it works because in the brain the caffeine prevents adenosine from being released in the brain .
And adenosine is a compound in our brain that helps to keep us calm .
And when that 's not released you just stay high all the time .
You stay very energized .
AB : Now I noticed he 's working very quickly .
Would you say he 's working better or just faster ?
JC : He 's working faster but not better .
Because what happens when we 're so high and up all the time , we have the illusion of working better but the quality of work is very poor .
AB : So in other words it makes you faster but it does n't make you better .
JC : Right .
So you better check your floor because it's not , probably not very clean .
AB : So most people think of caffeine as just kind of , you know , this mild little thing .
That does n't look very mild .
JC : No .
For some people it can be very , very strong and have this kind of effect and while other people can drink a cup of coffee with caffeine in it before they go to bed and it never affects them .
And you just need to be aware of how it affects you .
And if it affects you in a hyper way you probably should n't drink it .
AB : Unless you like that kind of thing .
JC : Unless you like that kind of thing .
AB : Okay , got to go , doc .
Thanks a lot .
Um , hey , Chuck .
Go home .
Legend has it that coffee was discovered around 800 B.C. by
an Ethiopian who noticed that his goats became excited after
eating berries from a mysterious shrub .
SCENE 11
St. Ives Coffee Roasters : Gainesville , GA - 5:36 pm
Now all this caffeine talk begs the question .
Is there such a thing as a great cup of decaf ?
Well , it 's not really a simple question .
It 's got a lot to do with economics .
Now lets say that this cup of decaf and this cup of regular both cost 100 dollars .
But we 're okay with that because we know that quality beans cost , right ?
Okay , now even at it's best , decaffeination is like doing surgery with a hand grenade .
I mean , you may get most of the caffeine , but a lot of the good stuff is going to go down the proverbial drain with it .
To make up for that , decaffeinaters have to use the best quality beans called double A .
They 're not really gold but you get the idea .
They of course cost more money .
There .
Oh , did I mention that decaffeination is a complicated process requiring expensive factories .
There you go .
And you do n't have to be a fat cat industrialist to know that means more of these .
So , now you 've got your decaf .
And it 's pretty darn good but it costs a heck of a lot more than my regular which we consumers just wo n't tolerate .
Now coffee processors respect that .
So , there go the double A beans .
Pity .
That does n't even things up .
Well , we can't do without the factories so we 'll have to go with substandard beans .
There , now they cost the same .
Of course now this cup taste a lot like a wet " ruff , ruff , ruff . "
So , either settle for drinking less of this hard stuff here or seek out expensive decafs .
Until someone genetically engineers a coffee tree with a no - caffeine gene , this is the best we can do .
Now we hope we 've inspired you to wake up and smell ... yeah , well , you know .
Just remember that beans and water are ingredients .
Brewing is cooking .
And if you take the time , pay attention to details , this is good eats .

There 's a curious and bizarre fact about the universe that is introduced in physics courses without anyone stopping to point out just how curious and bizarre it is .
I think it deserves to be more widely known to non-physicists .
It 's a little esoteric , but not so esoteric it can't be grounded in ordinary everyday concepts .
And it is n't something hypothetical but something that is fundamental to modern physics and testable in the lab .
It is also the reason why I chose to useinstead ofin my quantum computing code
This post will be in two parts .
This part will mainly be about geometry and topology , and in the second part I 'll talk about the physics .
In order to explain the idea I want to introduce the concept of a universal cover .
If you look at the definition of this notion anywhere it can seem pretty daunting to non-mathematicians , but in actual fact the key idea is so simple that even a child could understand it .
I can say that without fear of exaggeration because universal covers used to play a role in a childhood fantasy of mine .
( OK , I was a weird kid , but not that weird . )
My crazy idea as a kid was this : if there were two ways to get from A to B , maybe the B you reached by taking either of the two routes were actually slightly different , even though they looked the same .
I was actually more concerned with journeys from A to A .
Suppose the kitchen has a door at each end and that you start in the bedroom , go down to the kitchen at one end , come out the other end , and return by a different path to the bedroom .
How do you know this is the same bedroom ?
( I also admit I read a lot of science fiction as a kid . )
Suppose instead you took a simpler path : you left the bedroom and went to another room and then returned by the path you went .
If you had taken a piece of string and tied one end to the bedroom and walked this path playing out the string behind you as you went then when you returned to your bedroom you would have both ends of the string visible .
You could then reel in the string from your journey , without letting go of the ends , and see that indeed , both ends were in fact the ends of the same string and so you had retuned to the start of your journey .
But if you 'd taken the round trip through the double - doored kitchen you would n't be able to pull the string tight and so you could no longer be sure .
In what follows we consider two paths from A to B equivalent in this way : mark the two paths with strings going from A to B .
If you can pull one string to line up exactly with the other ( you 're allowed to stretch ) without breaking the string or moving the endpoints then they are considered equivalent .
( The correct technical term is homotopic . )
So if a path that appears to go from A to A is homotopic to the trivial zero length path , then you know that the path really is from A back to A .
But if you can't shrink the path down to zero length you 're faced with the possibility that the string is extended from A to a similar looking place , A ' . ( Of course this implies a considerable conspiracy with someone tying a distinct identical string to an identical bedroom , but if you can't see both ends , alien beings from a higher dimension could do anything ... )
The best case scenario is that all of the bedrooms are the same - a conventional house .
Call this house X . But what 's the worst case scenario ?
How many different copies of the bedroom might there be ?
Well let 's call the starting bedroom 0 .
If we walk anti-clockwise round the house , going through the kitchen , we end up back at a bedroom .
In the worst case scenario this will be another bedroom .
Let 's call it 1 .
Walk round again and we get to another copy of the bedroom , call it 2 and so on .
So we have an infinite sequence of bedrooms , ( 0,1,2 , … ) .
But we could have walked clockwise .
In that case we'd get a sequence ( - 1 , - 2 , … ) .
So now think about the set of all points in this infinite house .
Each point can be described as a pair ( x , n ) where x is a point in the house X and n labels which of the infinite number of paths you could have taken to get there .
( Remember , if the two paths are homotopic we consider them to be the same path . )
If using a house as an example seems too far - fetched think of a mult - storey car park .
It 's easy to walk what you think is a closed loop but find that you 've in fact walked to almost identical looking , but different , floor .
( Incidentally , this kind of infinite house is the kind of thing that can be created in a Portal engine such as in the game Portal . )
Let 's think about this more generally .
Given a topological space X we can form another space X ' from it by ( 1 ) picking a point p in it and ( 2 ) forming the set of all pairs ( x , n ) where x is a point in X and n is a path ( up to homotopy ) from p to x .
X ' is known as the universal cover of X.
Enough with houses , let 's try a more purely geometric example .
Consider the space of rotations in 2D , otherwise known as SO ( 2 ) .
A rotation can simply be described by an angle with the proviso that a rotation through an angle θ is the same as a rotation through θ +2n π where n is an integer .
The space of rotations is essentially the same thing as the circle ( by circle I mean the 1 - dimensional boundary of a 2 - dimensional disk ) .
Looping once round the circle brings you back to where you started .
So how can we visualise the universal cover of SO ( 2 ) ?
There 's a nice trick for this .
Imagine a disk that 's free to rotate around one axis .
SO ( 2 ) describes the rotations of this disk .
But now imagine a belt , fixed at one end , connected at the other end to the centre of this disk like this :
The rule is that we 're allowed to twist the belt as much as we like as long as the centre line of the belt is along the axis .
Notice how if we rotate the disk through an angle of 2n π the disk returns to its starting point , but the belt ' remembers ' how many twists we took to get there .
Notice another thing : if we travel along the belt from one end to the other , the orientation of the belt at each point gives a 2D rotation .
In other words , the belt itself represents a path in SO ( 2 ) with one one representing a fixed point in SO ( 2 ) and the other end matching the current orientation of the disk .
So if the orientations of the disk represent elements of SO ( 2 ) , the possible twistings of the belt represent elements in the universal cover of SO ( 2 ) .
And what the twists do is allow us to differentiate between rotations through θ and rotations through θ +2nπ .
In other words , the universal cover is just the real line , but not folded down so that θ is the same as θ +2n π .
The universal cover is the worst case scenario where all non-homotopic paths are considered to represent distinct points .
But it 's also possible to construct an in - between scenario where some paths that are n't homotopic to each other are still considered to lead to the same place .
For example , take the real line again .
If we identify 0 and 2 π we get SO ( 2 ) .
If we consider 0 and 2nπ to be distinct for n≠0 we get the universal cover .
But we pick an N≠1 and consider 2N π to be the same as 0 , but that 2nπ is distinct from 0 for 0 2 .
For N=2 you should easily be able to come up with a mechanism based on what 's below . )
With the examples so far , the universal cover of a space has always had an infinite number of copies of the original space .
That is n't always the case and now we 'll meet an example where the universal cover is a double cover : the real projective plane , RP .
The easiest way to visualise this is to imagine the game of Asteroids played on a circular TV screen .
In the usual Asteroids , when you go off one side of the screen you reappear on the opposite side .
In this version it 's much the same , points on the edge that are diametrically opposite are considered to be the same points .
Such a universe is a real projective plane .
Let P be the point at the centre of the screen .
Suppose we attach one end of our string to P and fly off towards the edge , reappearing on the other side .
Eventually we get back to P again .
Can we shrink this path down to a point ?
Unfortunately , any path that crosses the edge of our screen will always cross the edge no matter how much we try to deform it .
If we move the point at which it crosses one edge of the screen , the point at the other side always remains diametrically opposite .
This means you can never bring these points together in order to collapse down a loop .
On the other hand , suppose we loop twice round the edge .
The following diagram shows how this path can be shrunk down to a loop :
So given two distinct points in RPthere are two inequivalent paths between them , and so the universal cover of RPis made from two copies of the space and is in fact a double cover .
Now we 'll try a 3D space - the space of 3D rotations , otherwise known as SO ( 3 ) .
This space is 3 - dimensional because it takes 3 numbers to define a rotation , for example we can specify a rotation using a vector whose direction is the axis of rotation and whose length is the angle of rotation .
Now all possible rotations are rotations through an angle 0 ≤θ≤π for some exis .
So every rotation can be represented as a point in the ball of radius π.
But a rotation around the axis a through an angle of π is also the same as a rotation around the axis - a through π .
In other words , SO ( 3 ) is the closed 3 - dimensional ball with diametrically opposite points identified .
This is very similar to the situation with RP .
In fact , almost exactly the same argument shows that the universal cover of SO ( 3 ) is the double cover .
( For an alternative wording , see this posting . )
There is also another way of seeing this that is analogous to the disk with belt example above .
This time we have a sphere instead of a disk .
The belt is fixed at one end and the other end is attached to the sphere .
We are free to rotate the sphere however we want , and we 're no longer confined to having the belt along one axis .
It is an amazing but easily demonstrable fact that if you rotate the sphere through 2π , you cannot untwist the belt , but if you rotate it through 4 π you can !
This is known as the Dirac Belt Trick , and if you do n't believe it , watch the Java applet written by science fiction author Greg Egan .
If you 've done much computer graphics you 'll have already met the double cover of SO ( 3 ) .
Computer graphics people sometimes like to represent rotations using unit quaternions .
The unit quaternions form a 3 - dimensional sphere but there are two such quaternions for each rotation .
So the unit quaternions actually represent this double cover , and SO ( 3 ) is a 3 - dimensional sphere with antipodean points identified .
And that 's the geometry dealt with .
In the next installment I 'll say what this has to do with electrons and my quantum computing code .
Balls and Spheres .
The closed n- dimensional ball is the set of points ( x , ... , x ) such that x+...+ x≤ 1 . The ( n - 1 ) - dimensional sphere is the set of points ( x , ... , x ) such that x+...+x=1 .

Nevada Dems Nix Fox Debate
The Nevada State Democratic Party is pulling out of a controversial presidential debate scheduled for Aug. 14 in Reno and co-hosted by Fox News , according to a letter released late Friday from state party chairman Tom Collins and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev ) .
The letter said Nevada Democrats had entered into the agreement with Fox , despite strong opposition from Democratic activist groups such as MoveOn.org , as a way of finding " new ways to talk to new people . "

But Collins and Reid wrote that comments on Thursday by FOX News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes , when he jokingly compared Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , the junior senator from Illinois , to Osama bin Laden , " went too far , " and prompted Nevada Democrats to end the partnership .
" We cannot , as good Democrats , put our party in a position to defend such comments , " the letter said .
" In light of his comments , we have concluded that it is not possible to hold a presidential debate that will focus on our candidates and are therefore cancelling our August debate .
We take no pleasure in this , but it is the only course of action . "
The debate was to be hosted by Fox News Channel and Fox News Radio , the Nevada State Democratic Party and the Western Majority Project .
A statement released Friday night from Fox Vice President David Rhodes said : " News organizations will want to think twice before getting involved in the Nevada Democratic Caucus , which appears to be controlled by radical fringe , out - of - state in interest groups , not the Nevada Democratic Party .
In the past , MoveOn.org has said they ' own ' the Democratic party .
While most Democrats do n't agree with that , it 's clearly the case in Nevada . "

Fox officials also argued that Ailes ' remark about Obama , made at the Radio and TV News Directors Foundation Awards , was meant to poke fun at President Bush , not the Illinois senator .
Ailes said : " And it is true that Barack Obama is on the move .
I do n't know if it 's true that President Bush called ( Pakistani President Pervez ) Musharraf and said , ' Why ca n't we catch this guy ? ' "
Controversy has been brewing for weeks about the debate .
Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said Wednesday he would not participate , citing Fox 's conservative ties as a factor .
His deputy campaign manager , Jonathan Prince , sent an e-mail to the liberal website DailyKos , which was posted on the site .
“ We ’re definitely going to debate in Nevada , but we do n’t see why this needs to be one of them , ” it read .
The state party has been under pressure from progressive activists across the country , led by MoveOn , to cut its ties with the debate .
According to MoveOn , more than 265,000 people signed a petition sent to the Nevada State Democratic Party .
In announcing the event , a statement posted by the state Democratic Party has Reid offering high praise of the debate partnership with Fox .
“ This is more great news for Nevada , ” he said in the statement .
“ I 'm happy FOX News will be a partner for the August presidential debate .
Western issues will be a major focus of this debate in particular .
With FOX
News as our partner , candidates will have an opportunity to not only speak to Nevada voters , but voters across the West who will be instrumental to electing a Democratic president in 2008 . ”
Ailes lauded the idea , too : “ FOX News is proud to be a leader in coverage of the 2008 campaign season and a co-host of this important presidential debate .
We look forward to working with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Western Majority Project . ”
State Democratic party chairman Collins , in a letter posted on the party web site Wednesday , said Reid now shared activist concern about the event .
Collins wrote the Reid " has asked us to take another look . "
A spokeswoman for the state party did not immediately return a call .
The Rose Law Firm , which formerly employed Hillary Rodham Clinton , was the focus of investigations related to the Clinton family 's business dealings , including the Whitewater development .
Is the bloom off the Rose Law Firm ?
LITTLE ROCK , Ark. – When Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) addresses some 4,000 Democrats at the Alltel Arena here Saturday night , she ’ll be less than a mile away from her old office at the Rose Law Firm .
But judging by the fact that she does n’t mention the blue - chip firm at all on her websites , she is putting a lot more distance between herself and Rose .
The chill seems to be mutual : Clinton -- arguably the firm ’s most famous ex-employee as its first female partner , first lady of the United States and current Democratic contender for president -- does not merit a mention on Rose ’s website .

The Rose Law Firm became emblematic of the scandals that dogged Clinton and her husband , Bill , while he was president : Whitewater ; the death of Vince Foster , a Rose partner who became deputy White House counsel ; and the missing billing records from Rose that were discovered in Hillary Clinton ’s book room at the White House .
The aftermath of the spotlight cast by those scandals has been tough to overcome for the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi .
These days , sources say , Rose is a paranoid shell of its former self .
According to a legal directory , Rose employed 32 lawyers this year , down from the 53 that were listed in 1991 , when then - Gov. Bill Clinton launched his presidential bid .
Some of the Rose ’s most powerful lawyers left over the past eight years to either start their own firms or join corporations .
Within the office , every document is shredded , sources say , to prevent dumpster - diving journalists from finding any material .
Even case law books are shredded , instead of going to a local university , because partners feared the books would end up on eBay , said one source with Rose connections who spoke on condition of anonymity .
And with Hillary Clinton now in the presidential race , the firm is primed for more scrutiny , as her past will inevitably return for careful reflection .
When she announced her exploratory committee earlier this year , partners sent out an e-mail warning attorneys not to speak to the media about her .
Steve Joiner , the firm ’s CEO since last May , declined an interview for this story .
According to FEC reports , he ’s the only law partner thus far to contribute to Clinton ’s exploratory committee ; he gave $ 250 in March .
Few people wanted to talk about Rose in the present for fear of reliving the turbulent past .
Even Kenneth Starr , the independent counsel who led the investigations of the Clintons , declined to be interviewed for this story .
One source swept up in the Whitewater scandal said the only way anyone would talk about the firm was with a subpoena .
The Clinton connection was n’t always so problematic , however .
In January 1993 , two days before Bill Clinton ’s inauguration , Rose held a star - studded reception in honor of Hillary Clinton in the grand ballroom of Washington ’s Mayflower Hotel .
Then , in 1993 , Rose opened an office in Washington – which it closed after a year .
Like many other law firms , Rose did some lobbying , as well .
In 1991 , the firm made news when three of its lawyers registered with the state to become lobbyists for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority .
The lawyers worked on legislation that would permit the state to issue sewer bonds for cities .
One lawyer who requested anonymity said that the firm no longer has the bond business monopoly that it once had .
The firm still lobbies , but one source said it does n’t “ wheel and deal ” like in the old days .
Over the past five years , Rose lawyers have lobbied the state legislature on behalf of New York ’s First Union Real Estate Equity & Mortgage Investments , Pittsburgh ’s Reynolds Metal Co. and Arkansas Gas Consumers .
In terms of legal clients , Rose represents Stephens Inc. , one of the largest investment banking firms off Wall Street , and Tyson Foods Inc .
And it has maintained one powerful connection to the Clintons :
It represents the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation , an international nonprofit .
“ Two points can be made , ” said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch .
“ It provides a financial link between the Rose Law Firm and the Clintons at an important time .
If the firm were going to the other side , they have financial disincentive to do so because they will lose money .
It is financial insurance so the firm stays on their side through the campaign and the presidency . ”
Fitton also said the connection protects both the firm and the Clintons .
“ The firm has a reason to keep quiet because of attorney - client privilege , which could prevent any more investigations and inquires on the legal side . ”

America now has staggering 7 million jailed citizens
As many people around the World continue in their amazement over the total moral and economic collapse of the American Nation , a possible new clue as to why this so was revealed this past week with the United States Department of Justice announcing the staggering rate in which their government has been jailing their own citizens , and which now stands at 7 million Americans .
' Land Of The Free , Home Of The Brave . '
America now has staggering 7 million jailed citizens
According to these reports , ' A record 7 million people - or one in every 32 American adults - were behind bars , on probation or on parole by the end of last year ' , and when these figures are added to the estimated 1 million prisoners of war held by the Untied States , all around the World , the once great American Nation has now become the greatest jailer of human beings the World has ever known .
More importantly about these numbers , however , is the debilitating effect they are having upon the American society as a whole due to the fact that these horrific numbers are a direct reflection of the Totalitarian Fascist Nation they have truly become .
So draconian has life in the United States become , in fact , that their Nation 's internal security police , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , this past week received permission to monitor all American citizens by eavesdropping on their cell phones , and which according to these reports they are able to do even if the cell phones are turned off .
Just as devastating to the American people as the total loss of their freedoms is the economic nightmare they are now entering , and as we can read as reported by Britain 's The Guardian News Service in their article titled " Plunging dollar will set world markets reeling " , and which says :
" The slowdown in the US economy , which has sent the dollar into freefall over the past fortnight , will have devastating knock - on effects in markets around the world , analysts warn .
As the US slows , and consumers in the world 's biggest economy feel the buying power of the dollar in their pocket declining , global growth will be hit hard , economists say .
The greenback took yet another turn for the worse on Friday , after a survey of the US manufacturing sector showed output declining for the first time in more than three years . "
It has been well said by others , that when the American War Leader Bush announced after the September 11 , 2001 that the American Nation was in danger of losing its freedoms , he was more right than many of these helpless people knew , but not to any terrorist have the American people lost their freedoms , but from the actions of their own government has this been done .
Most sadly , though , about the American people of today is the effect their Totalitarian Fascist Nation is having on their most precious possessions , their children , and who have indeed turned into exactly those types of children warned about by the great British writer George Orwell , and who in his book ' 1984 ' sent these words of warnings to his American friends :
" Nearly all children nowadays were horrible .
What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages , and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party .
On the contrary , they adored the Party and everything connected with it .
All their ferocity was turned outwards , against the enemies of the State , against foreigners , traitors , saboteurs , thought - criminals .
It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children . "

Pity the poor astronomers living in our galaxy 100 billion years from now , for they will detect neither hide nor hair of the big bang that kicked off the known universe .
Researchers say that the runaway expansion of the cosmos by then will have blown away all evidence of the big bang like dandelion fluff into the wind .
With it will go cosmology , the study of the origin and evolution of the universe .
But before getting too smug , be aware that we also may not be privy to long lost evidence of other mysteries .
Cosmologists have put themselves in the shoes of their future counterparts by pondering the consequences of dark energy , an enigmatic force discovered in 1998 that seems to be pulling galaxies apart at a steadily increasing clip .
Eventually , this accelerating expansion of space will yank galaxies away from each other faster than light can travel between them , leaving our galaxy and its immediate neighbors isolated in a vast darkness .
In the process , all current evidence for the big bang would either vanish or become so diluted as to be imperceptible , says cosmologist Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University , who has studied the idea with Vanderbilt University physicist Robert Scherrer .
" It will lead them to the wrong conclusion about what the universe is doing .
The universe will look static , and that 's vastly wrong , because the universe is expanding so fast they can't see it . "
Take the expansion itself , first identified by Edwin Hubble in 1929 from the red tinge of distant supernovae .
As space puffs up like a balloon , it stretches the wavelength of light from the bluer side of the spectrum toward the red .
Krauss says that in 100 billion years or so the light from receding galaxies will have been stretched like taffy to a wavelength longer than our galaxy ( 100,000 light - years ) and , therefore , be impossible for telescopes to detect .
The cosmic microwave background radiation , a residue of matter 's first flash of light following the big bang , will suffer a similar fate .
As its wavelength expands , Krauss says , the radiation will start to be soaked up by interstellar dust , potentially becoming indistinguishable from other light sources .
Kiss good - bye , too , any knowledge of the relative abundance of the hydrogen isotope deuterium among all matter in the cosmos , which cosmologists believe was first set by the big bang when the universe was only about a second old .
Researchers calculate the amount of deuterium in the heavens by measuring the light from distant quasars shining through interstellar gas , Krauss says .
But dark energy will scatter both the quasars and gas beyond our observational horizon .
For their work , Krauss and Scherrer recently won a prize in an annual essay contest sponsored by the Gravity Research Foundation .
The paper is slated to appear in the October issue of General Relativity and Gravitation .
So what will would - be cosmologists of the far future be able to tell ?
Krauss says the motions of stars or planets will probably lead them to general relativity , the modern theory of gravity , and nuclear physics will tell them that those stars have existed for billions of years .
They will not realize , however , that their visible universe is only one galaxy cluster in a vast but dilute sea of galaxies .
Although we may know a lot more than they will , there is no guarantee we have a complete picture either , Krauss says .
We only discovered dark energy , he says , because we live in a " special " time during which the mysterious influence is neither too weak nor too strong to observe .
" This is about the only time in the history of the universe when you could detect it , and that 's really weird , " he says .
" Maybe there are important things we can't observe that will have dramatic consequences for the future of the universe . "
Much was made of last week ’s announcement by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that he was leaving the GOP , and much of the buzz was because of speculation that this announcement might lead to an independent run for the White House .
As this press release from the Club For Growth demonstrates , if he runs , no matter how he portrays himself , Americans should remember that he ’s just another apostle of the Nanny State :
Washington –
It wasnâ€™t enough for New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg to make the mere presence of an empty ashtray in an office building illegal .
Nor was he satisfied with banning trans fats in all New York City restaurants .
Now Mike Bloomberg wants to tell New York City residents what to drink , and he wants to spend taxpayer dollars to do it .
According to the New York Daily News , Mayor Bloomberg is launching a $ 700,000 ad campaign to promote tap water .
Taxpayer dollars will fund a total of 1,400 advertisements on New York City subways , bus kiosks , and check - cashing stations .
Ironically , this campaign comes one month after the city raised water rates .
This latest waste of taxpayer dollars reflects Mayor Bloombergâ€™s long record of raising taxes and city spending through the roof .
In his first term , Bloomberg raised sales , income , and property taxes while increasing spending by an average of 10 % per yearâ€ ” far outpacing the growth of inflation and population .
â€ œMany journalists have labeled Mike Bloomberg a â€˜fiscal conservative , â€ ™ but there is nothing conservative about spending $ 700,000 of taxpayersâ€™ money to tell them what to drink , â€ said Club for Growth President Pat Toomey .
â€ œBloombergâ€™s latest crusade demonstrates his little respect for New York Cityâ€™s hardworking taxpayers and the right of individuals to make their own choices.â€ 
What ?
You mean the government should n’t be spending tax dollars on a campaign to remind us we need to drink water ?
Who else can I depend on to tell me what to do when I ’m thirsty ?
Ordinarily the end of December is a low point for blog reading .
Somehow people seem to have other things to do which are more important to them .
So I was pleasantly surprised to see Fractals of Change readership as measured by SiteMeter spiking upwards and had to drill down and find out why .
What clearly happened , according to MyBlogLog is that a post I wrote last May has been Stumbled Upon .
Some member of www.stumbleupon.com liked what I wrote about Why a Great Programmer is Worth 50 Good Ones and recommended it .
Other members of the social network agreed with this opinion and the site began recommending the post to both members who stumbled similar sites and members who say they like things which are stumbled by the members who stumbled this post .
One of the differences between stumbleupon and other social networking sites is that stumbleupon does NOT keep an overall list of the 100 most popular posts or even give average ratings for sites .
In their FAQs , they explain why : “ Because these statistics foster a competitive atmosphere that would promote spamming among owners of the sites in question .
StumbleUpon is based on showing people sites personalized to their particular interests , not on absolutes like average rating and top 100 lists . ”
The key part of this answer , I think , is the second sentence .
How relevant or worthwhile a site is depends on your interest .
A rating is only relevant in terms of what stumbleupon can infer about your likes and dislikes from the stumbling you ’ve done and the people in stumbleupon you ’ve chosen to associate with .
Judging from very limited experience , the differences in technique between reddit which uses overall ranking and stumbleupon which looks for individual relevance results in a difference in reader behavior .
Below is a graph of a spike in FOC readership which came when it was heavily recommended on reddit .
Interestingly , it was the same post that was recommended both times .
Here are some differences :
The reddit spike came almost immediately after publication ; the stumbleupon one came seven months after .
I ’ve noticed that something which does n’t make it to the top of digg or reddit almost immediately , never does .
The reddit spike was much briefer ; the one from stumbleupon spread out and relatively long lasting .
The stumbleupon members typically read multiple posts ; the reddit members ( like most casual visitors to the site ) just the one they were pointed to .
( look at page views vs. visits in the stats above ) .
someone stumbled another post yesterday - Managing Programming for CEOs Part 1 – Decompiling Programmer - Speak - and significant traffic is now going there as well .
You ca n’t see it in the charts butsomeone stumbled another post yesterday -
Too soon to know whether the new stumbleupon readers become regular readers ( not many from reddit did ) and / or email or rss subscribers .
But I ’m impressed by this use of dynamic peer clusters for finding apparently interested readers so you will notice that , at the bottom of each post , it is now very easy to stumble that post .
Will also keep writing from my programmer ( nerd ) POV .
You Ca n’t Get There From

This story appeared early today on the Daily Mail website .
It has since been pulled without explanation .
If correct , this story could bring down the entire British government which is probably why it was immediately subject to a D notice - a British government order to censor a story .

Hookers , spies , cases full of dollars ... how BP spent £ 45 m to win ' Wild East ' oil rights
GLEN OWEN
UK Daily Mail
Sunday May 13 , 2007
BP executives working for Lord Browne spent millions of pounds on champagne - fuelled sex parties to help secure lucrative international oil contracts .
The company also worked with MI6 to help bring about changes in foreign governments , according to an astonishing account of life inside the oil giant .
Les Abrahams , who led BP 's successful bid for a multi-million - pound deal with one of the former Soviet republics , today claims that Browne - who was forced to resign as chief executive last month after the collapse of legal proceedings against The Mail on Sunday - presided over an " anything goes " regime of sexual licence , spying and financial sweeteners .
High life : Mr Abrahams , left , and another BP executive not linked to any impropriety with local girls in Azerbaijan .
He also claims that Home Secretary John Reid was arrested at gunpoint on a BP - funded foreign trip for being out on the streets after a military curfew had been imposed .
Mr Abrahams tells how he spent £ 45 million in expenses over just four months of negotiations with Azerbaijan 's state oil company .
Armed with a no - limit company credit card , he ordered supplies of champagne and caviar to be flown on company jets into the boomtown capital , Baku , to be consumed at the " sex parties " .
Ex -BP boss Lord Browne
The hospitality continued in London , where prostitutes were hired on the BP credit card to entertain visiting Azerbaijanis .
Mr Abrahams , an engineer by training , joined BP in 1991 , just as the disintegration of the Soviet Union had triggered a " new gold rush " by oil multi-nationals seeking a share of the 200 billion barrels of oil reserves beneath the Caspian Sea .
While employed by BP , Mr Abrahams says he was persuaded to work for MI6 by John Scarlett , now head of the service but then its head of station in Moscow .
He says he was passing information to Scarlett in faxes and at one - to - one meetings in the Russian capital .
He also claims that BP was working closely with MI6 at the highest levels to help it to win business in the region and influence the political complexion of governments .
Mr Abrahams worked for BP 's XFI unit - Exploring Frontiers International - which specialises in opening new markets in often unstable parts of the world .
He said Lord Browne , then BP 's head of exploration , allocated a budget of £ 45 million to cover the first year 's costs of the Baku operation .
" The order came from Browne 's aides to ' get them anything they want ' .
" By ' them ' , they meant local officials in Azerbaijan , " Mr Abrahams said .
" There were 20 or 30 people working on it at BP head office , and we soon had a steady stream of executives coming over as negotiators .
We got through the money in just four months - after which it was simply increased without question . "
He described a Wild West world in which oil executives with briefcases full of dollars rubbed shoulders with mafia members , prostitutes and fixers and cut their deals in smoke - filled back rooms .
" The BP officials would come out to Baku in groups of five or six , every week , " he said .
" Sometimes I would charter an entire Boeing 757 to carry as few as seven staff .
Their main base was the hard currency bar of the old Intourist hotel - so named because it accepted only dollars and was only open to foreigners .
" It was full of prostitutes and many of us , including me , used them on a regular basis , although we quickly established they all worked for the KGB .
" If we went back to the rooms , not only were they bugged , but the girls would quiz us closely about what we were doing and where we were going , and reported straight back to their handlers .
" Everywhere was bugged , and all the phones were tapped .
One of our executives was recorded saying unflattering things about the president , and his comments were played back to us in a meeting with local state oil company officials .
" We were then told clearly that he was no longer welcome in the country . "
Mr Abrahams helped to forge links with the local officials by throwing lavish parties .
He said the Azerbaijani girls who worked in the BP office , which occupied a floor of the Sovietskaya hotel , would attend the parties and routinely provide " sexual favours " .
They were also presumed to work for the local intelligence services .
" There was one girl , called Natasha , assigned to teach us Russian , but it usually ended up as more that that .
She would use the intimate opportunity to ask us questions about what we were up to .
" Caviar and champagne were consumed at the parties , which would start in the bars but inevitably end with the girls in the rooms .
" We had a company American Express card with no name on it which we could use to draw out $ 10,000 a time to pay for entertaining without ever having to account for it .
" Our local fixer was called ' Zulfie ' , who would help find girls , drink and occasionally hashish .
We always suspected he worked for the KGB , because he was so well connected .
" A lot of the BP men 's marriages went wrong .
Either they ended up with the local girls , or the wives would find out - often because the girls would ring their home numbers " by accident " .
" I do n't believe that Browne did n't know everything that was going on .
He came out to Baku on five or six occasions . "
Mr Abrahams , who left BP in 1994 , said his first marriage buckled because of his work in Baku .
He has since remarried and lives in West London with his new wife Lana and six - year - old daughter Anastasia .
He now works as an adviser to the EU .
He said BP applied the same laissez - faire attitude to hospitality when Azerbaijani officials came to the UK during the negotiations .
" I was given a hotline number which connected to a desk in the Foreign Office .
It meant visas could be granted instantly for the Azerbaijanis and collected on arrival at the airport , rather than taking the usual several weeks .
" We had bundles of cash to spend on them when they got here , and could again use the corporate card without restraint .
" We would typically have a dinner at which Lord Browne would be present , then he would go home and we would head off to somewhere like the Gaslight Club in Piccadilly - where girls would dance topless and you would get charged £ 250 for your drink .
" Our guests would usually want girls to go back with afterwards .
Sometimes we could persuade the girls in the clubs , but more often we would just phone up an escort agency .
" We could charge them straight to the BP Amex card .
But it sometimes became problematic .
One group of Khazak Oil officials stripped their hotel rooms in Aberdeen bare , including the sheets and pillowcases , and they would usually clear out the minibars wherever they were staying . "
All the entertaining paid off in September 1992 when BP signed a £ 300 million deal to exploit the Shah Deniz oilfields .
Mr Abrahams says that a key factor in securing the deal was an £ 8 million payment BP made that year to SOCAR , the state - owned oil company in Azerbaijan , for the right to use a construction yard on the edge of the Caspian Sea .
" It was effectively a sweetener to help to secure the deal - and it worked , " he said .
Among the guests at a dinner and ceremony at Baku 's Gulistan Palace to celebrate the Shah Deniz deal were Lord Browne and Baroness Thatcher .
Mr Abrahams says he was told to ensure that everything ran smoothly for the event , including meeting Browne 's fastidious requirements .
" I had his favourite brand of water , Hildon , and his preferred foods flown out in advance , and I made sure money was paid for police escorts and to circumvent immigration procedures at the airport for Browne and his entourage .
" That evening , he personally handed me a briefcase containing a cheque for $ 30 million ( £ 15 million ) , to close the deal .
" He was so keen to wear a particular shirt , which he had left at the airport , that I persuaded the chief of police to close off the roads so his cavalcade could go via the airport to collect it . "
In 1993 , Mr Abrahams played host to a group of MPs who visited Baku as guests of BP , including Harold Elletson - then a Tory MP but now an adviser to the Liberal Democrats - and Home Secretary John Reid , a Shadow Defence Minister at the time .
" John flew out in the BP Gulfstream jet , " he recalls .
" After dinner , we went drinking in the hard currency bar .
He was drinking a lot - this was a year before he gave up for good - and I grew worried as it got closer to the time of the curfew imposed because of the tense political situation at the time .
" I said , ' Come on John , we have to get back to the hotel . '
But as we left , he was swaying around and being very noisy .
" I urged him not to draw attention to us because we were n't meant to be still on the streets .
But then a van load of police armed with Kalashnikovs pulled up and asked us what we were doing .
" He said , ' I am a British politician ...'
I urged him to be quiet , but then he said to one of the policemen , ' If you do n't take that f*** ing Kalashnikov out of my face I 'm going to stick it up your f*** ing a***.'
" With that , we were arrested and shoved at gunpoint into the back of the van .
" It was only after I persuaded the driver to go to the hotel to speak to the intelligence officer there that they released us .
John had only about two hours ' sleep , then was up at 5.30 am to fly to the nearby war zone of Nagorno Karabakh .
He was completely hung over . "
Some of Mr Abrahams ' most intriguing claims surround the alleged co-operation between BP and the British intelligence services to secure a more pro-Western , pro-business regime in the country .
He says the operation , masterminded by Scarlett in Moscow , contributed to the coup in May 1992 which saw President Ayaz Mutalibov toppled by Abulfaz Elchibey , and then to a second change a year later which saw Haydar Aliyev take power .
Just months after Aliyev was installed , BP signed the so - called ' contract of the century ' , a £ 5 billion deal which placed BP at the head of an oil exporting consortium .
John Scarlett , says Mr Abrahams , " approached me very subtly and asked me to help to gather information for him .
" Because my daily route to the construction yard passed the supply routes for Nagorno Karabakh , he asked me to report on troop and weapons movements .
And BP 's deputy representative in Russia seemed very close to the embassy , too .
" BP supported both coups , both through discreet moves and open political support .
Our progress on the oil contracts improved considerably after the coups . "
Subsequently released Turkish secret service documents claimed BP had discussed an ' arms for oil ' deal with the assistance of MI6 , under which the company would use intermediaries to supply weapons to Aliyev 's supporters in return for the contract .
When the documents emerged in 2000 , BP denied supplying arms - although sources admitted its representatives had " discussed the possibility " .
A BP spokesman said last night of Mr Abrahams ' claims : " There are some facts in his account that are accurate , but we do n't recognise most of it .
We regard it as fantasy . "
A spokeswoman for John Reid said she had no comment and the Foreign Office said of Mr Abrahams ' claims : " We neither confirm nor deny anyone 's allegations in relation to intelligence matters . "
That subhuman pile of garbage has no heart to shit in .

It 's not half bad for a first attempt , either :)
No , the laptop industry has n't bypassed the idea of quad - core laptops in favour of octo-core machines , since NextComputing 's 8 - core flextops are machines you would n't want anywhere near your lap .
Based as they are around the Intel Xeon 5300 processor , the NextDimension Pro and Evo can take advantage of the relatively low power requirements of 100W for two quad - core CPUs ( down from 160 Watts for its power hungrier desktop equivalent ) .
For a sense of just how expandable the NextDimension machines are , consider that they can hold up to twelve 160 GB 2.5 - inch 7200 RPM hard disk drives .
They also manage to pack in four PCI / PCI -e slots in the Evo model , and Firewire , Gigabit Ethernet , and support for 24GB of memory through four DMA channels on both models .
These 20 - pound desktop machines with a handle will be shown off at Interop Las Vegas later this month , but beyond that we 're not sure when or for how much you 'll be able to lug one away .
I ’ve talked a lot lately about different VCSs .
I got some interesting comments in reply to my most recent post .
One person took issue with my complaint that nobody really understood how to specify a revision to git format - patch , and proceeded to issue an incorrect suggestion .
And a couple of people complained about my comments about bzr , which generally came down to the released version of bzr did n’t have anything compelling and also did n’t support tags .
So I went into #bzr , asked them what bzr has that git , Mercurial , and darcs do n’t .
And gave bzr the benefit of the doubt that 0.15 will be out soon and will be stable .
What I got back were these general items :
Renaming of directories ( not in hg , git ) 2 - way sync with Subversion ( not in hg , darcs ) Checkouts ( not in any others by default )
No server - side push requirement
Let ’s look at these in more detail .
1. Renaming of directories
All of them can rename files and ( excepting git ) completely accurately track back the file ’s history .
But consider this : if person A commits a change to branch A that adds a file , and person B then renames the directory that the file is in on his branch , will a merge cause person A ’s file to appear in the new directory name ?
In darcs and bzr , yes .
In Mercurial and git , no .
So yes , this is a nice thing .
But I have never actually had this situation crop up in practice , and even if it did , could be trivially remedied .
I would say that for me , I do n’t really care .
[ Update : Current stable releases of Mercurial can do this too .
I ’m not quite sure how , but it does work .
So git is the only one that ca n’t do that . ]
2. 2 - way sync with Subversion
This is a really nice feature and is present in both git and bzr .
I have n’t tested it either place , but if it works as advertised — and properly supports tracking multiple related svn branches and merges — would be slick .
That was enough to make me consider using git , but in retrospect , I so rarely interact with people using svn that it is not that big a deal to me .
Still , for those that have to work with svn users , this feature in bzr and git could be a big one .
Better yet would be to get all those svn holdouts over to DVCS .
3. Checkouts
A bzr checkout is basically a way to make local commits be pushed to the remote repo immediately , as with svn .
This is of no utility to me , though I can see some may have a use for it .
But it can be done with hg hooks and probably approximated with scripting in others .
4 . No server - side process necessary for pushing repos
bzr has built - in support to push to a server that has sftp only , and does n’t require a copy of itself on the server .
While I believe that none of the other three have that , it is possible to rsync ( and probably ftp ) darcs and Mercurial repos to a server in a safe fashion by moving repo files in a defined order .
Probably also possible with git .
All four can pull repos using nothing but regular HTTP .
What bzr still does n’t have
Integrated patch emailing .
The big thing is that it has no built - in emailing of patches support .
darcs is extremely strong in this area , followed by hg , and git is probably third .
“ darcs send ” is all it takes to have darcs look at the remote repo , figure out what you have that they do n’t , and e-mail a bundle of changesets to them .
I posted an extension and later a patchset that does all this for Mercurial except for automatically figuring out what default email address to do ( that ’ll come in a few days , I think ) .
One feature Mercurial has had for awhile that Darcs has n’t is sending multiple textual diffs as a thread , with one message per changeset .
bzr does n’t have any support for emailing patches yet , which is disappointing .
Because of the strong support for this in darcs and Mercurial , people running those systems feel less of a need to publish their repos .
[ Update : There is a plugin for bzr that seems to address some of this .
I have n’t tested it , and it ’s not in bzr core ( so does n’t quite meet my very friendly for a newbie requirement ) , but this does exist , though apparently not as advanced as Mercurial ]
Performance .
Supposedly 0.15 is supposed to be better on this , but even if bzr achieves the claimed doubling of performance , most benchmarks I have seen would rate it as still being significantly behind git and Mercurial , though it may overtake darcs in some tests .
Extensive documentation .
I would say that bzr ’s docs are better in some ways than git ’s ( its tutorials especially ) , but lack depth .
If you want to know some detail about how the repository works on - disk , it ’s not really documented .
Darcs still has David ’s excellent manual , and Mercurial has the hg book which is still great as well .
Merging not as advanced .
darcs is pretty obviously way on top here , but of the others , Mercurial does a pretty good job with its automatic handling of renames and automatic resolving of different branches that commit the same change ( even if that same change is a rename , or an add of the same content ) .
bzr ca n’t resolve as much automatically .
Summary
Well , I ’ll say that bzr still does n’t look compelling enough for my use cases to use , and the lack of an easy - for - a - newbie - to - use automated email submission feature is a pretty big disappointment .
Though I did appreciate the time those on #bzr spent with me , and if I needed to sync with svn users frequently , I ’d probably choose bzr over git .
For now , I ’m happy with sticking with darcs for my code and hg for my Debian work .
But all four communities are aggressively working on their weaknesses , and this landscape may look very different in a year .

The monthly mood swings experienced by many women may serve an evolutionary purpose , researchers say , by helping to get them pregnant .
Levels of sex hormones such as oestrogen and progesterone fluctuate throughout a woman ’s monthly menstrual cycle .
During the follicular phase at the start of the cycle , the egg is maturing and the body releases oestrogen , while during the luteal phase , when a fertilised egg might implant , progesterone is secreted .
To see how these influence the brain , Jean - Claude Dreher and colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland , US , used functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) imaging to examine the changes in brain activity over the course of the month .
The team scanned the brains of 15 women at different stages of menstruation as they played a game with hypothetical prizes of money at the end .
During the follicular phase , both the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala showed higher activity both when the women were anticipating a reward and when the reward was delivered .
The orbitofrontal cortex is associated with decision making , reward and emotion processing , and the amygdala mediates emotional reactions .
Advertisement
This means the women were probably experiencing greater feelings of reward during the first half of their menstrual cycles than during the second half , although they were not specifically asked to report this .
“ Our work specifies the brain networks that are modulated by the menstrual cycle , ” says Dreher .
Pleasure booster
It is unwise to speculate whether women also get more pleasure from activities such as sex , shopping or eating chocolate during the first half of their menstrual cycle .
So says Emily Stern at Cornell University ’s Weill Medical College , New York , US , whose own work has shown how women use different parts of the brain at different stages of their menstrual cycle .
“ However , certain behaviours that are known to involve reward systems , such as drug addiction , might be enhanced during the follicular phase , ” she says .
Indeed , previous experiments have shown that women report getting more pleasure from cocaine and amphetamine use during the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase , says Dreher .
He believes his findings may therefore help treat women with drug abuse problems , or those with mood disorders .
Dreher also speculates that increased feelings of reward during the follicular phase – when a woman is ovulating and therefore most likely to get pregnant – may have an evolutionary benefit .
“ It is interesting to note that , from an evolutionary perspective , the increased availability , receptivity and desire that may occur during the ovulatory period has been thought to facilitate procreation , ” he says .

Hannah can now do normal activities thanks to Milo
Hannah Baker , 20 , from Dedham in Essex , has severe epilepsy , brought on by a non-malignant tumour diagnosed when she was six years old .
Poodle Milo has been trained by the charity , Support Dogs , to spot changes to her pupils or skin tone before she has a seizure .
He then stares at her until she knows something is wrong .
Before she had Milo , Hannah used to have up to 80 seizures a day - now she has about 10 seizures each day , and most of those are small .
" Milo is like a security blanket for me , " said Hannah .
Facts about epilepsy Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurrent seizures 456,000 or one in every 131 people in the UK has epilepsy
There are around 40 different types of seizure and a person may have more than one type Many people who develop epilepsy below the age of 20 will ' grow out of it ' in adult life
" He 's made a huge difference to my life and to my family 's life . "
Milo alerts
Hannah about eight to 10 minutes before she has a seizure and she then sits down on the floor or with her back against the wall to make sure she is out of any danger .
Milo stays with her until she regains consciousness .
Hannah 's mother Nicola Baker said : " I 've gone from worrying about her every minute of the day to worrying about her half a dozen times a day , which is a significant difference . "
Hannah says she is now more confident in doing ordinary activities such as going for a walk or making a trip to the cinema because of Milo .
" The thing inside me has met its match , " she said .

EXCERPTS FROM THE INFORMANT : A True Story by Kurt Eichenwald
The FBI tapes afforded an opportunity to hear how senior officers of a Fortune 500 company characterize their attitudes towards women in the workplace  indelible evidence of the challenges still facing women today .
All names of women mentioned have been changed to protect their privacy .
A warning : the material in these sections is extremely offensive .
Do not read this if that bothers you .
Whitacre and Andreas were alone , letting their hair down in Micks office .
The only sound was the air pump in Andreass aquarium .
It was 4:40 the same day , and Mick had just called Whitacre again , seeking more information about the Japanese .
Clearly ,
Mick understood that they were at a make - or - break point .
The options were either price war or profits .
Mick went back and forth on how he wanted to handle the situation .
Lying was a good option if the competitors refused to deal .
But if they would talk , well , that was different .
In a way , Andreas relished his position .
The Asians had all been together , fixing prices before ADM even came on the scene .
Then , ADM started banging on the door , demanding to be part of the club .
When no one answered , ADM drove down prices .
The companys executives had made it clear that they could not be ignored .
Andreas leaned back in his chair .
Now was the time to be quiet in the marketplace , he said .
If demand fell , ADM would cut production .
" Tell em we re gonna go down with the market , " Andreas said .
" But we re not gonna stand for any poaching or anything . "
ADM wasnt about to cut back if competitors started stealing customers .
If they did , Andreas said , the competitors should just be told that any business ADM lost would be taken back when prices went higher .
" I dont think theyll try to screw with us , do you ? "
Andreas asked .
" No , I dont think so , " Whitacre said .
" I mean , that takes balls . "
" There s definitely a trust factor here , though , " Whitacre said .
Andreas coughed .
" I know . "
" I mean , Terry scared em shitless . "
" That s just like Ikeda , " Andreas said , smiling .
" Terry s our Ikeda . "
Whitacre laughed .
" Terry did what we needed done at the time . "
" Yeah , " Andreas said , leaning forward on his chair , " and Ikeda probably went back and said ,  I told those sons of bitches they re cutting back to half where they are or else . 
And Yamadas saying to himself ,  Or else what , you dumb motherfucker ?  "
Yamada had to know , Andreas reasoned , that a confrontational approach wouldnt work .
ADM had crashed lysine prices before , and if the company didnt get its way , they could be crashed again .
" Let s face it , " he said , " our track record is good . "
" We drove it to sixty cents three times . "
" Yeah , that s right .
Third time is a charm . "
Andreas moved to the edge of his chair .
" I would enjoy havin that meeting with Yamada . "
Whitacre snapped to attention .
" You would ? " he asked .
" I think its gonna be a necessity in the long run . "
" Id like to do it myself . "
Whitacre shrugged and agreed .
" Just him and me alone in a room , " Andreas said .
" Just sit down and say ,  Ive got stockholders .  "
" Did you want me to suggest that ? "
Whitacre asked .
" Ikeda acts like hes gonna be there . "
" We can do that at the last second . "
Maybe , Whitacre suggested , it would be better to meet together for a while , and then Andreas could be alone with Yamada .
That way , everyone would be happy .
Andreas nodded .
" Probably better to sit and listen to their bullshit first , " he said .
" Yeah . "
" And then sit alone and say ,  Well , here we are .
These guys are fighting , having a lot of fun cutting each others throats , and you and I are losin all the money .
So maybe we oughta come to an agreement .  "
Whitacre laughed .
" Yeah . "
" Put me with him alone , " Andreas said again .
" I can talk a lot more freely . "
" Yeah . "
Andreas managed a tight smile .
" Ikedas probably wearing a wire on us , " he said .
" Under his jacket . "
Whitacre blinked and laughed .
The tape recorder running under his jacket suddenly felt very big .
" Hes probably tapin it that way so he can translate and then report it to the Japanese , " Whitacre said , still laughing .
He was making little sense ; he wanted to change the subject .
" Okay , well , I appreciate everything you done , " Whitacre continued , his grammar getting worse as his tension increased .
" I definitely , definitely enjoyin the hell out of it and were gonna get there .
We really are .
It s not where citric is today , Ill be perfectly honest with you . "
" No , no , I know . "
Talking about citric reminded Andreas of something .
He wanted to promote Barrie Cox to president of the citric group .
That would open up the possibility for other promotions in the division .
" I want him to find out whether that means we could make that girl in there a vice president , and maybe the one in Canada that s supposed to be so good - lookin , " he said .
" Yeah . "
" I may do that before the board meeting . "
Whitacre leaned in ; there was a woman in his division named Kathy who should be promoted as well .
She was dedicated , a real career woman .
" I told Dad what I felt we should do is get an all - female sales force , " Andreas said .
" Well put like Debbie out there in charge of the West Coast .
You know , thered be more partyin once a year . "
Whitacre laughed .
" He says ,  Yeah , yeah , that s great .
Ill come to the party ,  " Andreas said , clearing his throat .
" He wouldnt care if he gets sued .
Shit , hes seventy - five years old . "
Whitacre again pushed Kathy ; she was just as good as Anna , the woman in citric .
Andreas said he wasnt trying to help Anna .
In fact , he said , Anna scared him .
She had once pressed him with questions at a meeting , Andreas explained , asking him what he considered ADMs obligation to the community to be .
" And I said ,  Well , our obligation is to provide good - paying jobs to hardworking people .  "
Whitacre fiddled with his tie .
" She said ,  Well , that doesnt seem like enough , "  Andreas continued .
" Shes talking about day care centers , and I thought ,  Fuck this .  "
" Yeah , shes a womens libber , " Whitacre said .
" Ones gotta be careful . "
Maybe , Andreas suggested , he should promote a couple of women to vice president and make another woman president of the western department .
" What the fuck do I care ? " he shrugged .
" Yeah , just a title , just a title , " Whitacre said .
" Dont mean anything .
At least to the outside , it does mean something . "
" Yeah , " Andreas said , nodding .
***
At 2:00 the next day , Whitacre picked up the Ikeda fax and scanned it quickly .
Yamada was willing to meet with Andreas and Whitacre in Los Angeles on either October 25 or 26 .
A site for the meeting could be chosen when the date was set .
Whitacre walked down to Mick Andreass office .
He flicked on the recorder in his pocket .
" Mick ? " he said at the office doorway .
" You got a quick minute ? "
Andreas looked up from his desk .
" Yep . "
Whitacre walked in , holding out the fax .
" Ikedas working quick for us , " he said .
" Yamada wants to meet in L.A. the week after next . "
" No kidding ? "
" Told me on the phone that hes coming with him . "
" Ikedas coming just for that ? "
As Whitacre described the details , Andreas checked his schedule and saw he was free on the twenty - fifth .
Whitacre said he would go make a copy of the Ikeda letter for Mick .
The original , he was thinking , needed to go to the FBI .
When Whitacre returned , Andreas discussed the meeting arrangements .
Who did they know in L.A. who might have ideas ?
Whitacre mentioned a former ADM employee named Tina , who had moved to southern California .
" Shes gettin married , " Whitacre said .
" Well , what a waste , " Andreas said .
Andreas checked with the ADM pilots ; the flight to Los Angeles would take just over four hours .
He suggested flying out at seven oclock in the morning , Decatur time , for a nine oclock Los Angeles meeting .
They could be home by seven oclock that same night .
Whitacre said he would make the arrangements .
Since he had Andreass attention , Whitacre decided to check on the promotion for Kathy , the woman in his division .
He asked what had happened with Anna .
Andreas said that her boss opposed promoting her .
" He says she wants so much , " Andreas explained .
" Shell say ,  Well , do I get a raise ?
Do I get a car ?
Do I get this ?
Do I get that ? " 
Whitacre saw an opening .
" Kathy s not that way , " he said .
" Kathy wouldnt ask for any of that . "
" Well , see ... "
" Kathy would appreciate what shes got , " Whitacre said .
" Anna is a little bit different . "
" Yeah , shes a lot more aggressive . "
Whitacre coughed .
" Oughta be a fantastic fuck , " Andreas said , smiling .
" But I think shed be trouble with a capital dont you ? "
" Yeah , " Whitacre said .
Kathy wouldnt be a problem , he added .
Shed take what ADM gave her without complaint .
They spoke for another moment about promoting women .
Andreas leaned back in his chair , smiling .
" So , my Tina is getting married , " he said , referring to the woman who had moved to southern California .
" Yeah , " Whitacre said .
" Two or three weekends from now . "
" That wont last for very long , do you think ? "
" No . "
Shes kind of a dodo - head , you know ? "
Andreas said .
" Shell be back .
I just hope she doesnt get pregnant .
Fuck up her body . "
" Yeah . "
" Nice body , " Andreas said .
" Itd ruin her tits .
Shes got the greatest tits in the world . "
Andreas smiled broadly .
" In the world . "

At the airport , the three climbed into Whitacres car for the drive to the office .
From the backseat , Wilson stared at Whitacres head .
It looked funny .
" Whitacre , what are you doing ? " Wilson asked .
Whitacres hair looked like it was two - toned , he said .
Was he dying it ?
" Kinda bleaches a little bit , " Whitacre said .
" Especially in the summertime . "
" Has Sue told you it looks better that way ? "
Wilson asked , referring to a woman at the office .
" Or whats the deal ? "
" Sue likes that , " Whitacre said .
Andreas smiled , half raising a hand .
" Im gonna ask you a few questions about that , " he said .
" Sue is getting married , right ? "
Yes , Whitacre said .
Sue was getting married and moving to Canada .
" What else is new around the office ? " Andreas asked .
" Amys divorced , " Wilson said .
Whitacre asked if they were talking about the same Amy who used to spend time with another senior ADM executive .
" He used to fuck her , but he doesnt anymore , " Andreas said .
" She loves to give head and fuck . "
Whitacre looked in the rearview mirror .
" Is she really getting a divorce , Terry ? "
" Yeah , " Wilson said .
" Ive been tryin to tell her how to  "
" How to give blow jobs ? " Andreas interrupted .
" No , " Wilson answered , smiling .
" How to take care of the kids so she doesnt have any problems . "
Andreas looked into the backseat .
" How about that little fat one over there by you ? " he said .
" Anna ? " Wilson asked .
" No , no .
Yeah , Anna , too .
Whos fuckin Anna now ? "
Wilson shook his head .
" I dont know whos fucking Anna . "
" You think shes pretty much of a rounder ? "
Andreas asked .
Whitacre smiled .
" Shes very , very , very friendly .
I think shes very bored with her life here .
I dont mean ADM , either ; I m talkin after - ADM life . "
" So , " Andreas said , " she likes to just go out and fuck ? "
A minute later , the men brought up another woman at the company .
Andreas shot Whitacre a look .
" I know you fucked her a few times , " he said .
" No , no , " Whitacre replied .
Andreas smiled .
" You look at her up close , she is not that attractive . "
" No , " Wilson said .
" But she is built . "
" I dont like her , though , " Andreas said .
" Shes so masculine or something . "
Wilson sat up .
" Shes got lips , look like a black .
Sensual .
You know theyd fit right around . "
Whitacre coughed .
He was painfully aware that this conversation was being taped .
" Her makeup disguises what she really looks like , " Andreas said .
" Shes got kind of a flat face and oval eyes . "
Wilson coughed .
" I thought she might be somewhat Hispanic . "
" Could be Hispanic , " Andreas said .
" Latin , " said Whitacre .
" Shes got big lips , " Wilson repeated .
" Like a black . "
Andreas smiled .
" Shed give great head . "
He turned to Whitacre , asking to hear about some of the new women at work .
Whitacre mentioned a woman who had recently joined ADM .
" You were trying to get in her pants , and she wouldnt talk to you , " said Andreas .
" Shes just a quiet gal , " Whitacre said .
" Sort of a little meek - lookin gal , " Andreas added .
" Yeah , " Whitacre said .
" But she looks like shes an  "
" Looks like a whore , " Andreas interrupted .
" Looks like a fuckin whore . "
Whitacre pulled into ADM , circling the car around to the parking garage .
In an instant , the three executives the vice - chairman and two division presidents of a Fortune 500 company walked back into the corporate headquarters , smiling and politely bidding hello to some of the female employees they had just been tearing apart so venomously .

for people looking for greater musical diversity when they tune in .
Now that diversity is threatened by a draconian rate increase for every copyrighted tune that these stations play .
In a ruling that was made public just after this article was initially published , the Copyright Royalty Board has extended the deadline for implementing the new rate structure to July 15th .
According to the AP : " Webcasters can file a notice to appeal the decision in federal court , something they have said they plan to do .
" Tim Westergren is one of the leading spokespeople for SaveNetRadio.org , the organization that is fighting back against the new regulations .
Westergren is also founder of the Musical Genome Project and Pandora Internet Radio .
Coincidentally , Pandora has just hit a snarl with international licensing .
On Wednesday , Pandora sent an email to its 6.5 million subscribers with bad news — they would now be forced to curtail access to subscribers in most non-U.S. countries . ( " [ W ]e are deeply , deeply sorry to say ...
It is difficult to convey just how disappointing this is ... " ) I recently interviewed Westergren on NeoFiles .
Jeff Diehl joined me .
Let 's start with the basics .
What has the Copyright Royalty Board done ?
It 's pretty simple .
We pay a licensing fee for every song that we stream , which was determined by the Copyright Royalty Board .
And the royalty board just voted to almost triple those fees within the next couple of years .
So overnight , they 've made webcast radio pretty much impossible .
It 's impossible , at these new rates , to really operate a radio station online .
So who is the Copyright Royalty Board and how did they become so empowered ?
They 're members of the copyright office in D.C.
They were empowered by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Its purpose was , sort of , to govern webcasting ; to provide a structure , both in terms of the constraints and the licensing structure .
There were three judges assigned to this case .
So there are no existing checks and balances at this point other than to try to go back to Congress ?
It looks like our only recourse is to get some legislative help .
So in the last couple of weeks , under the " Save Net Radio " coalition , we 've tried to organize as many webcasters and musicians and other folks to put pressure on Congress .
There was such an uproar in the first week following this ruling that a bill was just introduced on Thursday of last week to roll it back , and to further alter the basic structural problem that really discriminates against internet radio .
Who 's sponsoring the bill ?
Representatives Jay Inslee , a Democrat from Washington , and Don Manzullo , a Republican from Illinois , are the lead sponsors .
Many co-sponsors are signing up as we speak .
Tell us a bit about the bill .
It 's called the Internet Radio Equality Act .
As the title indicates , it 's trying to establish parity between internet radio and satellite radio .
Right now , internet radio is treated differently and worse than satellite and much worse than terrestrial radio for the same function .
We 're asking to be treated equally — which means paying a percent of revenue .
The bill would void this Royalty Board ruling and establish parity with the percent revenue that 's used for satellite radio .
Do people who oppose this equal treatment argue that internet radio is harder to keep track of ?
Maybe more stations can slip through the cracks because the internet is virtually infinite .
I do n't think I 've ever heard that argument .
Originally , there was some argument that it was easier to copy off the internet because it 's digital .
But of course , HD radio is digital .
Satellite radio is digital sometimes .
So that argument is no longer used .
Going way back , we could always slip a cassette in and record directly off the radio .
It 's probably pretty difficult to get anything like this through Congress .
My impression , for instance , is that the entertainment industry owns many Congresspeople , particularly in the Democratic Party , where a lot of your support would seem likely to come from .
In general , I think that 's historically true .
When it comes to things like licensing and issues as it relates to media and music , Congress has been the domain of the industry .
But I think in the last three or four years , we 've started to see a reversal of that leverage .
The internet has empowered this huge class of musicians and " participative listeners " now .
I think that power is just starting to show and I do n't think they 're going to take this sitting down .
In the end , I hope and believe that Congress is going to react to their constituents .
There were hundreds of thousands of FAXes and letters sent to Congressmen within a couple of days of the coalition starting .
Now , there seem to be two dates on this .
I understand it 's retroactive back to January of 2006 — but then there 's another date approaching .
Is that correct ?
Well , that 's D - Day !
July 15 is the day .
That 's the latest date we 've heard when these rates are going to become law .
And when they do become effective , the payments are retroactive back to the beginning of ' 06 .
On that day , every webcaster will be suddenly faced with a fee that they can't afford .
Did they inform people of this in January of 2006 ?
A plan for this rate to be readjusted was announced at the end of ' 05 .
It took a long time for them to set the rate , but I think what they came up with was a shock to everybody .
But technically , you 're playing songs in January of 2006 for one price , and then they 're coming along and charging you more money .
That does n't sound legal to me .
Well , I do n't know about the legality of it , that 's not my expertise .
But I can tell you that on that day , the bills will be due from everyone from college radio to non-profits to small webcasters .
For folks like us at Pandora , the costs are going to be astronomical .
I think that this ruling has virtually no constituents .
Well , there 's the RIAAI would argue , though , that if they really thought this through , they would recognize that this is a bad decision .
It 's crushing a promotional channel .
Did they give a rationale for such a huge hike in the rates ?
Well , Sound Exchange is the organization that pushed for it .
And their rationale is that it 's fair , and that if you can't run a business on it , you should n't be in business .
That 's not much of an argument .
But why that amount of a hike ?
An incremental increase would be one thing , but this is exponential .
They do n't give any reason for that ?
All I can do is take at face value what I hear , in terms of press releases and commentary .
And it 's all been , " It 's fair , and if you can't run a business on it , then you should n't be in business .
" Who does Sound Exchange work for ?
They 're supposedly representing musicians , right ?
That 's an interesting question .
Sound Exchange is meant to represent all musicians .
And their board is comprised of artists , and representatives of the small labels and the large labels .
And I 'm a musician myself .
I used to play in bands .
I spent ten years living in a van and doing that whole thing .
I think you'd be hard - pressed to find a dozen musicians who — if they got fully educated on the subject — would actually support this ruling that is ostensibly supposed to help them .
It 's sort of mysterious how this could emerge from an artist 's organization rather than from the music corporations .
I mean , obviously radio had promoted music for several generations .
It 's baffling .
There were two sides in the discussion – the webcasters and some artists were on one side ; and then Sound Exchange , the RIAA , and these various constituents were on the other .
They argued in front of the Royalty Board for different solutions .
And the Royalty Board , in a very flawed ruling , went all the way in one direction .
So my guess is that the ruling surprised even Sound Exchange , although they 've defended it since .
I 'm still trying to figure out whose interests are being served ... Well , if this goes through , it basically ruins internet radio .
But maybe a small handful will continue to stream – folks who can somehow continue .
And in order to continue , they 'll be forced to sign direct licensing agreements with labels .
When they do that , there 's a big difference in the way the royalties are divided up .
In the current DMCA statute , all the royalties get split half with the artist , half with the label .
In the world where you 're dealing directly with a label , it virtually all goes to the label .
So that could be one incentive .
Okay , I 'm beginning to see some interests who would like to monopolize Internet radio and who could be behind this .
On the Save Net Radio web site , there 's talk about a 300 % - 1200 % percent increase .
That 's a big difference .
How is all that mapped out ?
That 's a good question .
The reason for the difference is that in the previous rate structure , there was two ways stations could pay .
Smaller and non- commercial webcasters could pay a percent of their revenue .
And if you got beyond a certain size , you had to pay per tuning hour rate .
The new ruling creates one rule for everybody , and it's all just " per song . "
So if you take someone who 's paying a percent of revenue , and then translate that to what they would be paying in this new rate , in some cases it 's over a 1,000 % increase .
Stations that have very little revenue had a way of functioning before and now they wo n't .
And I think that 's important .
Pandora is all for paying musicians .
We completely believe in that and we 've done that since the very beginning .
But the rate that they 're paid needs to make sense in this business as it exists right now .
And it 's all about promotion .
Online radio is the only hope that your average indie musician has for getting any kind of exposure .
It 's become common knowledge that most people hate terrestrial radio .
They hate the radio stations and what the corporations have done to them .
And people are looking all over the place for alternatives .
The growth in internet radio is certainly partly because folks are looking for alternatives .
And it's an alternative for musicians too .
Of course , it took a while to work out an agreement where internet radio stations were legally allowed to play music that 's owned .
I think it was really after the DMCA in 1998 that some agreements were worked out .
Do you know anything about that history ?
I 'm not a perfect historian on this , but basically in 2002 , that whole legislation that you 're talking about was re-considered .
And that 's when new language was inserted into the bill that changed the standard for rate setting for internet radio .
It 's called the " willing buyer , willing seller " standard .
It 's a standard that 's only applied to internet radio — it 's not applied to satellite and it's not applied to terrestrial radio .
It opened up a doorway for this kind of crazy rate - setting to come along .
Many people have observed that the smallest webcasters are the ones that are really going to get screwed by this .
Most college stations stream on the web , and they will be among the first to go .
Where is Pandora in this ?
Pandora 's a large webcaster …Are you guys going to survive ?
Not at these rates .
Pandora can't make it work at these rates .
That 's very honest of you .
Your investors must be ... Yeah … they read a quote in the news from me one morning saying , " We 're dead if this stays . "
It was n't hyperbole .
Larger webcasters like Pandora … we 're actually a viable alternative for independent musicians .
We have 6.5 million listeners right now , and that figure is growing fast .
That 's the kind of critical mass that 's really going to allow you to build a new independent artists ' foundation .
And I 'm a huge fan of indie , but even indie musicians need scale .
They need to support the growth of large internet companies that do this , as well as the small ones .
What role do the record labels really play for the artists anymore — marketing , getting musicians on the radio ?
Is n't it possible that an outfit like yours could connect directly with artists and say , " We 'll support you " ?
Is there a chance to get rid of that middleman ?
Well , I think that the industry is starting to bifurcate .
There is still the sort of " hit " industry that is the traditional business .
And the stations that play that are largely marketing vehicles , like you said .
But with some good software editing tools and good recording chops , you can make a CD now without borrowing half a million dollars , which was the whole premise for the record deal in the beginning .
So technology has now allowed musicians to make professional - sounding CDs , and make them available globally , virtually for free .
The record labels wo n't go away .
They 're going to change and consolidate more and more , which they 've already been doing .
There are some startups that are trying to do that — to eliminate the middleman .
Oh yeah .
There 's a whole industry growing up around the " new label " — which is more like a quasi- management / distribution / promotions company .
I think that 's going to play a bigger and bigger role .
And then some rock stars who have enough of a reputation can also ...… do it on their own .
Prince has done some of that .
Pandora is not going to go into the label business .
We really need to separate the radio from having any kind of agenda related the music we play .
I think that 's really important .
Does it bug the music industry that people can make their own radio stations with companies like yours ?
It was always a dream of mine that I could just run down a list of all my favorite artists , and just have some station regurgitate their entire catalogues in some randomized fashion .
I think that one of the debates around internet radio , is : is it promotional or is it substitutional ?
When it gets really interactive and you can choose at any time to listen to " Dark Side of the Moon " from front to back — chances are you 're not going to buy the album .
And when that happens , whoever is doing that is providing something that 's kind of in lieu of buying a CD or buying a single .
They would need to charge something different for that .
It seems like you guys are pretty close to that boundary compared to , say , a station where DJs spin tunes that they choose .
To me , the real bright line is that we 're not offering songs on demand .
On Pandora , you wo n't know when a song 's coming , just like on terrestrial radio .
I think that makes it fundamentally different .
And Pandora 's a wildly promotional service .
The big broadcast stations also have streaming on the internet .
Are you getting any support from any of them ?
Yeah .
The National Association of Broadcasters is with us too .
Every radio company wants to be part of the online world .
So what 's in it for us podcasters ?
When do we get a voice in Washington ?
Well , I think this is a great bill for anybody who wants to include music in their programming because it 's acknowledging the internet format as radio .
So I think it 's a step in the right direction for podcasters too .
Good !
Do you think we could grandfather ourselves in under this ?
We could just say , " Hey , this applies to us ! " and maybe make a test case out of it .
Well , I think the one difference between podcast and radio is that you create and post copies of your shows .
So you create a copy of a piece of music that you can replay , rewind , and so on .
So it 's in a different category .
And I think that if you 're making a copy of a piece of music that can be used and re-used , it 's legitimate to worry that people wo n't buy the music .
So it 's different .
Before I let you go , tell us a little something about your own work .
How was the Musical Genome Project conceived and how does it work ?
It 's something that we started about seven and a half years ago in a one - bedroom apartment in San Francisco .
It 's an enormous collections of songs that we have been analyzing , musicologically , one song at a time to try to capture their musical DNA .
A team of musicians literally listens to songs — one at a time — and analyzes them for their attributes .
We have 50 musicians working for us now .
We 've been at it for seven and a half years , so it 's really been a long path to create enough music in one collection to power the radio service .
It takes between 15 and 30 minutes to analyze each song .
I was trying to think about whether music can really be broken down into its component parts .
So I tried your station .
I combined Brian Eno , Leonard Cohen , The Beatles and Sonic Youth and it worked pretty well .
But then I was thinking , if I added my absolute favorite band , which would be The Rolling Stones circa 1966 – 1972 , I 'd wind up getting lots of stuff that sucks like Aerosmith and Guns ' N ' Roses .
Musically , there 's always going to be some stuff that 's great that you can't quite put your finger on .
I think that 's part of what makes music so great .
But yeah … it works most of the time , but there are going to be some situations where you 're not going to be happy with what you hear .
Give folks a final pitch for how they can get active to save net radio .
Go to SaveNetRadio.org where we 're keeping all the news and recommendations on what to do and we ’ve got the latest news on the bill .
But the basic call to action is for folks to call their Congressperson to urge them to support this bill , which is called the Internet Radio Equality Act , and it 's House Resolution 2060 .
Call your Congressperson for your district .
You can look it up on the web just by typing in your zip code .
All that information 's at SaveNet Radio.org .
Make a call and say " Support the bill ! "

Sorry , my sister has mucked up her life , and if her only kidney fails I 'm not going to donate one of mine to save her .
When I was ten years old and my sister Philippa was eight , we became " blood sisters " .
Sharing the same genetic parents was n't enough , we decided ; we needed to cut our wrists and mingle our blood if we wanted to be real sisters .
Using a rusty penknife of the kind that would have health and safety officers in hysterics these days , we opened our veins , rubbed our wrists together , and swore everlasting love and loyalty until the end of time .
I protected her against all comers in the neighbourhood and at school ; in return , she covered for me and took the blame when I transgressed at home .
We shared a room until I was 16 , and were so close we joked about living together with our husbands when we grew up .
I pinched her make - up ; she broke my favourite doll .
We fought and bickered like any sisters , but the moment anyone threatened either of us , we closed ranks and backed each other to the hilt .
We grew up in a loving , middle - class Roman Catholic family in West Sussex , together with our younger brother , Charles .
Our father , Michael , worked as a contracts manager for an engineering firm ; our mother , Jane , was an editor for Jane 's Defence books until she died five years ago .
We had a normal , happy childhood ; there was never a great deal of money , but there was always plenty of love .
As a child , my sister was always sickly .
She had pneumonia 13 times in two years ; her lungs collapsed , and one of them never recovered .
Her kidneys also gave her problems , and when she became pregnant with the first of her three sons at the age of 22 , one of them finally gave up altogether .
She 's now 36 , and for the past 14 years , she 's limped along with a single fitfully functioning kidney , spending frequent spells in hospital .
We both know that she could lose the use of her remaining kidney at any time , condemning her to a lifetime of dialysis unless she finds a donor .
As her sister , I 'd be her best bet for a genetic match .
And yet a few weeks ago , I came to the difficult decision that if she asked me for a kidney , I 'd say no .
I know many people 's instinctive reaction will be to condemn me as heartless , even cruel .
But the truth is my sister is both feckless and reckless with her health .
She drinks , she 's used drugs , and she has three children by three men - all of whom have now been taken into care .
So I 'm sorry , but I 'm simply not prepared to risk my own health and the future of my own family to bail her out .
Recently , the case of a woman in Cheshire who refused to donate bone marrow to her dying brother became the subject of great debate , with critics from all sides branding her wicked and even somehow unnatural .
Who knows what family secrets lurk behind her seemingly selfish decision ?
Without knowing the full facts , we should n't rush to judgment .
But asking someone to donate a kidney or bone marrow is n't like wanting to borrow their car for the weekend .
It can be a life - changing decision for the donor too , and needs to be made calmly and clearly , rather than on a wave of sentimental emotion .
Admittedly , that goes against the grain when it comes to family .
We all think with our hearts rather than our heads when someone we love is in danger .
But we owe it to all those who depend on us , not just the person in need , to make the right choice - which is n't always the easiest one .
The reason I cannot in all conscience now offer a lifeline to my sister is that since we left home our lives have followed such different paths that - in brutal terms - I am not now willing to risk my life to save hers .
I did better at school than my sister , in part due to her constant illnesses , and at 18 , won a place at Oxford .
Philippa left school the same year , with a good clutch of O - levels , to take a secretarial job .
At first , her career went well ; she was promoted to the company director 's PA by the time she was 19 .
She was earning good money , while I was struggling to get by on a student grant ; generous to a fault , she bought me expensive presents and always paid for dinner when we met up .
But then it all started to go wrong for her .
She started a doomed affair with a married man who took advantage of her youth and naivety .
He treated her very badly and broke her heart , and I think many of the things that went wrong for her later in life can be traced to this man .
Not long after he ended their relationship , she suddenly announced her engagement to a young man she 'd known only a few weeks .
It was clearly a rebound relationship , but within months , they were married .
We all knew it was going to be a disaster , so no one was very much surprised when they split up less than two years later .
Perhaps she could have put it down to experience and moved on with her life - but then she found out she was pregnant .
Her ex-husband demanded a paternity test , which duly proved the baby was n't his , and when she was just three months pregnant , she moved in with a new boyfriend .
He was initially very supportive , but when the baby was born , he started to resent him .
Thinking he would come round to the idea of fatherhood if he had his own child , she deliberately got pregnant again without telling him .
As soon as he found out , he left her .
At 23 , she was alone with a 12 - monthold son and a newborn baby .
She could n't cope , and social services were called in .
She decided to put the children into care for six months while she got her life back together .
Naturally , the family was dismayed , but she started therapy and a course of anti-depressants , and we all rallied round to support her .
The doctors had diagnosed her with a personality disorder .
Her psychiatrist told her not to get involved in another relationship until she was more stable , but once again , she met a new boyfriend , moved in with him , and got pregnant .
The new baby was born just 25 months after her first child - she'd had three boys in just over two years by three different fathers .
This time , the boyfriend did at least stick around , but we all wished he had n't .
He did n't have a job , and spent much of his time taking drugs and drinking .
But my sister seemed head - over - heels in love .
Her two older sons were returned to her , and she got married again and tried to make a home for her young family .
Now it was my turn to help her out financially .
At that point , having worked as a producer at ITN , I was married to a CNN correspondent and forging a career as a writer .
Philippa would call saying she had no food for the children , so I 'd drive over and take her to the supermarket to stock up , or pay her rent when she was about to be evicted .
Her husband got her on to drugs , and the children were soon running wild .
Within a couple of years , her second marriage broke down amid accusations of affairs and abuse .
She overdosed several times , but always called for help before it was too late .
We were worried sick , but even when we managed to get her into rehab , she checked herself out after a week or two .
She could n't cope with the children , and put all three boys - now aged six , five and four - into care .
This time , social services would n't let her have them back .
They wanted to put them up for adoption , but our mother fought them at every turn , hiring lawyers and even offering to bring them up herself .
My sister did n't seem bothered either way .
By now a mother myself , I found her attitude very hard to understand .
It was difficult not to be judgmental .
I told myself she had an illness , and could n't help herself .
But it was hard not to get angry with her lack of concern , or the worry she caused our mother .
She admitted to still using drugs from time to time , but generally seemed to have her life on a much more even keel .
After her children had been in care for three years , she finally got them back , married for the third time to a man who seemed much more stable , and seemed to be turning her life around .
Then , once again , she went off the rails .
Her husband left her , having caught her in bed with another man , although she claimed they were just " cuddling " .
She attempted suicide , after which the boys were split up and put into permanent foster care , where they 've been for the past four years .
I do n't blame her for much of what 's happened .
Shortly after she gave the children up for the last time , she was rediagnosed with bipolar disorder ( in most respects it is what people mean by manic depression ) ; although her new medication has helped to some extent , she 'll always be more volatile and fragile than most .
But she does n't make much effort to help herself either .
She only has one lung and was told smoking would kill her - yet she 's smoked a pack a day since her late teens .
She knows that she should avoid alcohol because of her kidneys , but frequently binges , sometimes putting herself in hospital .
I do n't know if she 's still taking drugs - I hope not - but it's not something I like to ask .
Yet despite all this , I love her desperately .
I 'd do anything in my power to make her better .
But if I were to give her a new kidney , I 'd only be treating a symptom , not the cause .
Like George Best , who was given a new shot at life with a donated liver and wrecked that too with drink , my sister can't - or wo n't - change her behaviour .
I 'm now a novelist and have three young children of my own to consider .
I 'm the main breadwinner at home , and if I take risks with my health - and let 's not forget that kidney donation is major surgery - I 'm taking a chance with their future as well as mine .
Who knows what might happen on the operating table , or later down the line ?
I 'm not a coward .
If one of my children needed my kidney , I would n't hesitate .
But my sister has made her own choices , and followed her own path .
She 's an adult .
My children have everything ahead of them .
I 'm not prepared to play roulette with my life and perhaps ruin theirs .
Perhaps , if things were different , it'd be a chance worth taking .
I 'm not saying she does n't deserve my help because I do n't agree with her lifestyle - that 's not the point .
But with three young lives depending on me , I have to put them first .
The irony is , I know she'd be the first in line to give me a kidney if I ever needed it .
She 's impulsive and generous to a fault .
I just wish I could turn back the clock to the days when we thought a couple of scratches on our wrists was all it took to bind us together for ever .
She 's my sister , and I love her dearly .
But she 's made her choices in life , and she has to live with the consequences .
I just hope I never have to live with the consequences of my decision .
Tess 's sister , Philippa Stimson , 36 , is a mother of three who lives on benefits in a council house in Burgess Hill , West Sussex .
She says :
When Tess told me recently that she would n't give me one of her kidneys if I needed it , I was n't surprised .
She thinks deeply about everything before she makes a decision , which is the complete opposite to me .
I 've gone through life leading with my heart , not my head .
I suppose her way has worked out better , I mean she has a big house , lots of money , a loving husband and three beautiful kids .
I , on the other hand , am living off state benefits and at the end of each week I hardly have enough money left to buy a loaf of bread .
I admit I have made a lot of decisions that I deeply regret , mainly choosing the wrong men and not looking after myself properly .
However I , too , have three amazing children and while they are not living with me , I would n't change them for the world .
When I look back at our lives I am jealous of Tess 's success .
I 'm not bitter but I do wonder how things went so right for her and so wrong for me .
I think my health has been an overriding factor .
I have struggled with numerous infections and so I only have one lung and one kidney .
Also in the past few years I 've been diagnosed with manic depression - one of the main reasons my boys were put into foster care .
I know that Tess does n't agree with the way I lead my life .
I smoke 20 cigarettes a day and despite the drugs I take for my depression , I have a drink every now and again .
I should n't do either with my body in its weak state , but I do n't think about anything in the long term anymore .
I make every decision on the spur of the moment and take every day as it comes .
I know this attitude means I may need a donor sooner than I once thought , but I really do n't blame Tess for making the choice not to donate her kidney .
If I 'm honest , I think I 've always known she 'd feel this way when it came to the crunch .
About 15 years ago , Tess was living in Cyprus and I went to visit her .
I was pregnant with my second child at the time , and Tess was struggling to conceive .
We had a long chat about her options , one of which was surrogacy .
I immediately offered to be her surrogate mother if it came to it .
She was very grateful but said she had to admit if I needed her to do something like that for me , she could n't .
I just saw it as an example of how different we were , it did n't mean I loved her any less .
And the same is true now .
Tess knows if the boot was on the other foot and that I would n't hesitate to give her a kidney .
She is allowed her opinion as I am allowed mine .
If and when I do need a donor , I will just have to hope I find one through the general donor list .
Every day I wear a necklace that Tess bought me for Christmas .
It has three stones on it , one says " sisters " , one says " friends " and the last says " for ever " .
It is a symbol of our loving relationship and , one kidney or none , that is not going to change - at least I 'm not going to change it .
What Tess does is up to her .

Marine and freshwater organisms could be facing damage due to increasing levels of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation , according to a United Nations ( UN ) commissioned review .
Aquatic ecosystems produce over half the biomass of the Earth and are an integral part of the planet ’s biosphere .
The international team behind the review is worried that the depleted ozone layer has exposed these ecosystems to harmful levels of UV radiation , particularly in polar regions where the ozone layer is the thinnest .
There could also be wider implications for climate change , since if UV damage cuts marine ecosystem productivity , the oceans ’ capacity to mop up the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide would fall .
This extra atmospheric CO2 could then add to global warming .
Additionally , the annual phytoplankton boom , which supports the entire Antarctic aquatic food chain , is currently protected from UV damage by a layer of sea-ice .
Warmer climates would mean sea-ice melts earlier , increasing UV exposure .
These plankton are particularly vulnerable to UV damage as the low temperatures slow their repair mechanisms .

A team of scientists from Germany , India and America compiled the review .
It comprised hundreds of separate studies into to the effects of UV radiation , covering organisms from plankton to frogs and fish .
The findings highlight that while the effects of UV radiation on entire ecosystems are difficult to measure and model , the impact on individual species can be dramatic .
Numbers of frogs , toads and other amphibians have fallen across the world over the last 10 years .
And while the exact cause is a complex combination of factors , the review highlights more than 50 research papers implicating UV radiation .
The study is part of a wider United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) report on interactions between ozone depletion and climate change .
Every few years , UNEP produces a report for parties to the Montreal Protocol – the 1987 international agreement to phase out production of most ozone depleting compounds , such as CFCs , by 2000 .
The report is subsequently published in Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences , to make it available to the entire scientific community .
Janet Bornman , co-chair of the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel of the UNEP and co-ordinator of the report , said : “ It is hoped that the publication will stimulate the scientific community to continue working on the gaps in knowledge that still exist .
“ We hope that it will help keep scientists aware of their involvement in the protection of the environment for all forms of life on Earth ” .
The news is reported in the latest edition of the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences .
FlavaDave Says :
Let ’s say you are eating a hamburger .
It ’s grilled to perfection , slathered in mustard with just enough Worcester sauce .
It seems perfect , but something is ……… missing .
Or let ’s say you got a turkey and swiss sandwich on sourdough .
You savor every last bite , licking the plate for crumbs while you polish off the chips .
But you finish the meal and are left vaguely unsatisfied .
Why oh why ca n’t you enjoy food ?
What is going on ?
What is missing ?
DAMN DIRTY APES !!!!!
Leave the apes alone , Heston .
Your problem is simple :
You live in a world without pickles .
Pickles top our sandwiches , garnish our plates and pucker our l ips .
They are bitter , but they leave you feeling oh so sweet .
Now I am obviously a fan of the green wonder , but even non-fanatics can agree : Pickles are a legitimate food .
Right ?
Flinchbot Says : Sure , pickles are a legitimate food .
You eat them , your body handles it , you shoot it out a while later just like all other foods .
However , there is one caveat to this particular food .
Pickles are infallible proof that Satan exists because pickles are the work of the devil .
Yes , Old Scratch , in his constantly scheming and nefarious ways , has forced the pickle into the popular conscience .
He passes it off as a food but in all actuality he is using the pickle to steal your soul .
Oh you might think I ’m crazy .
You would be wrong .
I have shocking , infallible proof that the pickle is evil .
After reading my thoroughly documented and well written argument , your entire pickle weltanschauung will change .
You will quit eating pickles , you will be happier , and slowly but surely you will recover parts of your soul .
This will lead to brighter teeth , healthier skin , and a better sense of smell .
Fact 1 . )
The color of a pickle is proof of supernatural meddling .
Look at the color of a pickle .
Where else in nature does this color show up ?
Is there any other vegetable , fruit , meat , dairy , or grain product that has this color ?
No , there is n’t .
This glow - in - the dark radioactive green hue is not something found anywhere else in the world except in the pickle .
Why is that ?
Because Satan chose the color .
He specifically chose a color that stands out from all other foods to clearly mark that this food is his .
Fact 2 . )
The smell of a pickle is proof of supernatural meddling .
Have you ever smelled one of these things ?
Oh sure , people will say it ’s due to the vinegar .
No it ’s not .
It ’s due to Satan ’s powers of evil that cause that stench .
That stench is n’t due to vinegar .
No pickle smells like vinegar and oil salad dressing .
No pickle smells like Malt vinegar .
Heck , no pickle has the raunchy smell of straight up vinegar .
Nay , the pickle has some other smell based on the raunchy vinegar we are accustomed to but with an undeniable hint of pure evil .
Fact 3 . ) The taste of a pickle is proof of supernatural meddling .
Now , I have to admit that I am generally unqualified to make a strong statement about the taste of the pickle as I have rarely had the disgust of having one of these Satanic “ treats ” in my mouth .
All I know is that when some dumbass at Chic - Fil - A forgets to grab the “ No pickle ” sandwich and hands me the pickle sandwich on accident and on even bigger accident I bite into it and I get a full on flavor - blast of evil - incarnate …
So at Chic - Fil - A I know to look for the sticker on the wrapper that says “ no pickle ” .
Whenever I bite into a burger , I tear it apart looking for pickles .
I always , always , always order my meal sans pickle .
However , due to the meticulous workings of Satan and his minions , he has used his whily trickeration on the food services industry and made the pickle an almost de facto and de rigeur addition to a served plate of food .
So it is at this time , fellow Satan - haters , that we must stand on high and denounce this work of the pure evil .
Realize that you have been brainwashed into thinking that the pickle is “ good ” and “ OK to eat ” .
It is purely the Dark Lord at work .
You now know how easy it is to be manipulated by dark forces beyond your understanding .
You can think me for exposing this for you .
If you have been an ardent pickle - eater , I recommend you go home and pray for salvation of your soul lest you end up looking like this guy , a lifelong pickle eater whose soul is almost entirely Satan ’s at this point :
Let me leave you with the sage wisdom found at this website :
http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:QwsnDmNRp0IJ:www.huumor.com/joke_3036+pickle+joke&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=us
Every pickle you eat brings you nearer to death .
Amazingly , the “ thinking man ” has failed to grasp the terrifying significance of the term , “ in a pickle . ”
Although leading horticulturists have long known that Cucmis sativus possesses an indehiscent pepo , the pickle industry continues to expand .
Pickles are associated with all the major diseases of the body .
For example , nearly all sick people have eaten pickles .
The effects are obviously cumulative :
99.9 % of all people who die from cancer have eaten pickles .
100 % of all soldiers have eaten pickles .
96.9 % of all Communist sympathizers have eaten pickles .
99.7 % of the people involved in air and auto accidents ate pickles within 6 months preceding the accident .
93.1 % of juvenile delinquents came from homes where pickles were served frequently .
Evidence points to the long - term effects of pickle eating :
Of all the people born in 1839 who later dined on pickles , there has been a 100 % mortality rate .
In spite of all the evidence , pickle growers and packers continue to spread their evil .
More than 120,000 acres of fertile U S soil are devoted to growing pickles .
Americans ’ per capita annual consumption is nearly four pounds .
Alternative : Eat orchid petal soup .
Practically no one has as many problems from eating orchid petal soup as one does with eating pickles .
FlavaDave Says : Chris Columbus ( the explorer , not the director ) was very thankful for pickles .
He brought crates full of pickles with him on his voyage to discover America ( or India or whatever he was actually going for ) .
Know why ?
Because pickled vegetables were the only sustenance sailors could eat without any risk of catching scurvy .
In fact , all sea- fairing explorers used pickles to feed their crew .
I know what you are thinking .
Wait , Columbus did n’t discover America , Amerigo Vespucci did !
I see you payed attention in fifth grade US History .
But you might not have listened close enough , because if you did , you would know that Amerigo was by trade a pickle merchant .
So you see , to hate pickles is to hate America .
Do you hate America , Flinch ?
Do you ?
FlavaEDIT : Whoa , hold up a second .
Soon after I posted my half - assed defense of pickles , I decided to check our young blog ’s stats .
And what I found out will shock , stun , and convince any remaining pickle worshipers to repent .
As soon as I blasphemed against God by professing my love of pickles , we recorded our 666th hit .
Hold me , Flinch .
Flinchbot Says :
No need to hold you .
Just pray for your soul , pickle eater !
Also , Amerigo Vespucci did not discover America .
Leif Erickson did .
Well , he discovered Canada , which is North America , which is close enough .
( The Congress of the United States of America , by joint resolution ( Public Law 88 - 566 ) approved on September 2 , 1964 , authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 9 of each year as “ Leif Erikson Day ” . )
Leif Erickson is not a known pickle - eater .
He was also a Christian .
He was a mighty fine man , that Erickson .
Also , this pickle - bashing would not be complete with linking to this video .
Why do they try to force her to eat pickles ?
This woman is alright in my book .
She ’s a hero and should be honored , not cast on stage for the amusement of the ignorant pickle eaters .

As a man , I am sometimes given to thinking purely in the interests of my genitals .
It is an inherent affliction that is sometimes friend and sometimes foe .
However , when such interests are impeded , I may go to great lengths to see them prevail .
I am , to say the least , not a devout Christian , nor am I any variety of Christian .
But that fact does not extend prejudices upon my fancies .
I am often times intrigued by the gentile vixen .
However , any advances I might choose to take could conceivably be thwarted by the widely held Christian dogma that claims that premarital relations are sinful .
I have often found that when Christianity and logic are at odds , there can be some reconciliation through interpretation .
Because I found abstention to be illogical , I sought out the passages of the bible that are cited when justifying the Christian position on premaritals hoping to find room for interpretation .
To my , and my lesser compadre ’s , delight I found much room for interpretation .
I mainly discovered passages that describe what will happen if one is “ Sexually Immoral ” - burning in a fiery lake of sulfur and all of that tralala .
“ Sexual Immorality ” is without a doubt not acceptable biblically speaking ; however , the bible never really defines what “ Sexual Immorality ” is .
In fact the only time “ sexual immorality ” is even mentioned in relation to marriage is in Hebrews , chapter 13 , verse 4 when it says “ Marriage should be honored by all , and the marriage bed kept pure , for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral . ”
But again , what does sexually immoral mean ?
Does it mean the rape of a spouse ?
Does it mean bringing a third party into bed ?
Does it mean giving ones spouse a Dirty Sanchez ?
I do n’t know and neither do you , because the bible does n’t specify and neither of us are god .
In the book of Corinthians there are some possibly more legitimate passages pertaining to the immorality of pre-marital sex .
The first is in chapter 7 , verse 8 , where the apostle Paul says , “ Now to the unmarried and the widows I say :
It is good for them to stay unmarried , as I am .
But if they cannot control themselves , they should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn with passion . ”
This passage only says that if a woman cannot remain celibate , then it is better for her to marry .
It does n’t say that she must marry .
There is no talk of fiery lakes of sulfur following this passage .
Also , this is Paul the Apostle talking , not god .
So I think this is one of those times the bible is offering guidance rather than putting laws into stone .
It was after all written in the days before Trojans ( of the prophylactic variety ) and Birth Control Pills .
Maybe the bible is just saying it sucks to get preggers .
And I agree .
It sucks to get preggers .
The other often cited passage in Corinthians is in book 7 , chapter 1 , and goes “ It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband . ”
This passage is similarly spoken by Paul , and similarly a guideline .
So while that advice may have been sensable at a time before birth control evolved beyond uteral punching and clothes hangers , it is a bit outdated now .
Passages that are not often referenced when defending abstention can be found in Exodus and Deuteronomy .
The reason that they are not often cited is because they ’re fucking ridiculous .
In Exodus chapter 22 , verse 16 , it states that “ If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged , and lies with her , he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife .
If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him , he shall pay money equal to the dowry for virgins . ”
Deuteronomy has almost the exact same passage .
So , according to Exodus and Deuteronomy , a man can seduce a girl , with or without her will , as long as he pays her father a dowry and offers to be her husband ; should the father refuses , the man has to pay market value on her virginity .
Now , how much is virginity going for these days ?
15 goats ?
I probably have to adjust for inflation from the 1300’s .
So , that ’s 1,050 goats give or take .
Sweet .
The Old Testament is riddled with all sorts of surprisingly odd little foibles .
Leviticus in , chapter 19 , verse 19 , instructs us not to wear clothes made of two different fabrics , and , in chapter 14 verse 43 it describes how to remedy Buildings that catch leprosy .
So , perhaps this is not the direct word of god .
Perhaps this is just a reflection of the standards of society at the time the Bible was written .
Remember that in the bible , young women were betrothed to men based on a financial deal and fathers could fetch a better price for their daughters if they were virgins .
Also because paternaty tests werent available when the bible was writen , women who were sexually promiscuous would frequently birth babies whose father ’s could not be determined .
So , perhaps virginity was such a protected status because it was beneficial economically and perhaps “ Sexual Morality ” refers to loving monogamous relationships rather than ones irrevocably bound by marriage or ones where the woman was “ common ” .
Now ,
It should be known that I do n’t say these things to challenge people ’s faiths .
I do n’t say these things simply to be heretical .
I do not even say these things purely in the interest of sex .
I just feel that when 2+2=5 , you need to check your math .
Faith is a fine thing - even a great thing - but it is sometimes friend and sometimes foe .

Ever since I published my article : 10 Reasons It Does n’t Pay To Be “ The Computer Guy ” , I ’ve had occasional encounters with unauthorized republications of the article content .
That is , my original article has been copied and pasted into other forums and blogs without proper credit to me as the author ( plagiarized ) .
At first , I was outraged .
The idea that people were blatantly discrediting my article in an attempt to pass it off as their own writing was infuriating .
I would try to contact the offending party , asking them to provide a link to the source or remove the article .
Their response was surprising .
Finding sites quoting my original article is n’t hard .
A Google Search of 10 reasons it does n’t pay to be the computer guy displays my original article followed by similarly titled blog posts or forum threads in a list that spans several pages .
The hard part is sifting through these results and determining which republications are n’t giving credit to the article source .
Whenever I located a site that was plagiarizing my content , I would contact the blog author or forum administrator indicating that my article has been republished on their site without permission .
Surprisingly , the typical response I received was an apology .
Furthermore , all apologies were coupled with a promise to correctly link back to my article as the original source .
Most people reacted this way because they did n’t read the article here on LifeReboot.com — they read a plagiarized republication on another site .
Therefore , when they republished the article on their own site , they were unaware they were doing anything wrong .
In other words , most of them were simply uninformed about the true source of the original article .
Considering the vastness of the World Wide Web , it ’s an easily forgivable mistake .
Once these site owners were made aware of what needed to be done to reverse it , they did it without argument .
To everyone who has acknowledged that they made an honest mistake and worked to correct it :
Thank you .
Of course , there were also some individuals that preferred to play hardball .
They ignored — and possibly deleted — my email messages , blog comments , or forum replies requesting proper acknowledgment of the article source .
To everyone that falls into this category : Whatever .
I ’ve been trying to stay on top of the unauthorized republications for over a month now , and I ’ve decided it ’s not worth it .
My reasoning is that if I ca n’t convince someone to give me proper credit to my original work after the first attempt , then that someone does n’t deserve any more of my time .
Some of you are probably thinking “ What !?
Shaun is giving up ! ? ”
In this single pursuit , yes — though I prefer saying I ’m choosing to let go .
What ’s the difference ?
Well , you give up things that are yours to give up .
You can give up piano lessons , or ballet , or a childhood dream of growing up to be a fighter pilot .
You let go of the things that were never yours to begin with .
In this instance , I was trying to control how other people use the Internet .
This objective view of my actions seems quite silly , does n’t it ?
It ’s impossible .
Why have I even wasted my time trying to control things I simply can’t ?
For the same reason it ’s hard to let go .
I wrote the article .
It ’s something of mine , and I do n’t like other people stealing it .
I felt like I could still protect it somehow .
All of these feelings made it difficult to accept the fact that it is beyond my control now .
It ’s been a hard lesson to learn , but it ’s factual :
There are some things you can control , and some things you can’t .
When you learn to let go of the things you can’t control , you can focus your efforts on improving the things you can .
Invest time into things that are worthwhile .
Do n’t let people rent space in your head .
In other words : Do n’t sweat the small stuff .

NASA ’s Opportunity rover has been tentatively checking out the rim of Victoria Crater , gathering as much science as it can before going down inside .
Mission controllers announced today that they ’ve got all the data they need , and they ’re ready to push the rover over the edge , and send it on a potentially one - way journey down into the crater .
A meteor impact created Victoria Crater millions of years ago , blasting though layers of rock , and gouging out a hole on Mars 800 metres across ( .5 miles ) .
As Opportunity crawls down the steep slope , it ’ll be traveling back in time , observing older and older layers of rock on the exposed walls of the crater .
As before , it ’s looking for evidence of ancient , wet environments .
They ’re not planning on a one - way journey .
Even though the rover has lasted 12 times longer than mission planners were expecting ( 90 days ) , and its capabilities are reduced , it should be able to crawl back out .
The slope should n’t get any steeper than 15 - 20 degrees , and it ’s on exposed bedrock for good traction .
Here ’s a quote from the principal investigator , Steve Squyres :
“ We do n’t want this to be a one - way trip .
We still have some excellent science targets out on the plains that we would like to visit after Victoria .
But if Opportunity becomes trapped there , it will be worth the knowledge gained . ”
Good luck Opportunity , and hang on tight .
It ’s going to be a wild ride .

If there ’s one thing I ’ve learned in my 10 + years working in IT , it ’s this : Project Management is utter bollocks .
It ’s rubbish .
I ’m not saying that planning is a bad idea .
I thinking planning is absolutely necessary if you want to avoid disaster .
But anyone who thinks they can predict exactly what will happen over the life of a project , exactly how much it will cost and how long it will take is some bizarre hybrid of a lunatic and a liar .
The most polite description I can think of for the bullshit that surrounds project management is that it ’s a consensual hallucination .
I first came across that term in the cyberpunk ’s bible , William Gibson ’s SF novel “ Neuromancer ” .
He used the term to describe cyberspace .
I do n’t know if he invented either term ( consensual hallucination or cyberspace ) but he was certainly pivotal in popularising them .
Cyberspace does n’t exist in any physical sense in the world of Neuromancer .
It ’s a massive computer network that can be “ navigated ” in a way that people can conceptualise .
Which allows for some cool descriptions of pseudo - physical interactions with data .
For ease of understanding , everyone treats this abstract concept as a concrete reality .
They have consented to believe in the hallucination because it ’s easier to understand that way .
Life is full of consensual hallucinations .
A polite way of saying we ’re surrounded by bullshit .
If you live in a democracy , you tend to believe you have a say in what happens in your life .
There ’s a tendency to ignore the reality of politicians being soulless whores who are bought and paid for by vested interests .
The consensual hallucination of participatory democracy is more comforting .
Voting is little more than a sideshow but life ’s a little easier to bear if we pretend voting can actually change anything .
In fact , pretty much any political or religious belief system is a consensual hallucination .
Which is not to say that they are by definition untrue .
Believe in your magic friend in the sky all you like .
Who needs empirical evidence when banding together with other believers makes the consensual hallucination feel true ?
And do n’t get me started on science .
I ’m a big believer in science , but that ’s the point .
I ’m a believer , by and large , not a knower .
At least 98 % of people who believe in science can’t prove or even deeply understand much of the science they support .
But we put our faith in the idea that someone smarter than us got it right .
Which gets me back to project management , specifically , how it applies in the world of IT .
The consensual hallucination that permeates nearly all of IT is that the magic pixie dust of project management can reveal The Truth .
People who like to think they are rational individuals tend to believe that it ’s possible to predict ahead of time how long a project would take , how much it will cost and everything that will happen along the way .
In the broadest possible sense , this is true .
If you have enough experience you can probably do better than a wild - arsed guess .
We ’ve done something similar that took about this long so we can aim to do that again .
That ’s logical .
IT people like logical .
But when someone gets the project management religion , they think they can be precise .
Business people like precise .
But some people are completely fucking insane when it comes to this topic .
Some people believe Project Management should tell you these things down to the day and the dollar .
A project plan should tell you every task that needs to be completed .
A project plan should be flawless and leave nothing to chance .
And a project plan should be completed before ANY work is done on the project .
OK , take a fucking pill , man .
That is straight up insanity .
Despite the fact this is clearly fucked - up thinking , it ’s a terrifyingly common mindset in management ranks .
Planning , or at least goal setting , at some level is obviously important .
How the hell do you know what you ’re doing if you do n’t have any targets ?
But we ’ve descended into the seventh circle of hell when we move from “ let ’s have a clearly defined set of project goals and a strategy for how we ’ll get there ” to “ this is 100 % accurate , it ’s carved in stone and will never change , if you ca n’t deliver according to this project plan it ’s because you ’re doing something wrong . ”
Here ’s what I think are the main drivers for elevating the myth of project management to the level of holy scripture :
There ’s a whole industry of consultants scamming a living out of it .
They base their entire existence on the lie that they can provide the definitive solution to project management .
They are n’t about to ruin a good thing by telling the truth about their fallibility .
There are several rainforests worth of books published on the topic .
They all apparently have the definitive answer as well .
How could they possibly be wrong ?
You know , unless publishing all those books was a money making scam .
Nobody likes to look stupid .
If you ’re a professional and someone puts you on the spot to answer “ how long will this take ? ” it ’s only human to want to provide an answer .
Whether you call it professional pride or ego , it ’s a powerful driver .
Programming tasks are measurable in retrospect .
It ’s easy to make the mistake of thinking this makes them easy to predict in advance .
Being able to say “ for a previous project we wrote this many lines of code and it took this many hours ” does not mean you can accurately say “ for this completely new project we will write this many lines of code and it will take this long . ”
Very few businesses are keen to hand over an open chequebook .
Because a manager demands a deadline someone provides one .
Just because this stupidity keeps happening over and over does n’t make it less stupid .
So how do we escape the consensual hallucination that there is a way to do project management that is absolutely foolproof and provides definitive answers ?
Well , I propose we kill all the consultants .
Just throw the fuckers up against the wall and shoot them .
OK , maybe I wo n’t get away with that .
How about we tone it down a bit .
Maybe we ’ll just take it out on the consultants who act like they have some mystical powers that enable them to succeed where all others have failed .
We could staple their tongues to their chins .
Maybe even that ’s going a little too far .
Surely there ’s a solution that does n’t involve jail time ?
There is no silver bullet that will solve this issue ( although there ’s quite a good essay entitled “ No Silver Bullet “ ) .
But there are things that can be done to improve the situation .
How about we all sit down to a big three - course serving of reality ?
This can save many packed lunches of pain and misery .
If you ’re on the IT side , have the courage to say “ I do n’t know ” when that ’s an accurate answer .
And if you ’re on the business side , FOR GOD ’S SAKE , LISTEN !
Good IT workers really do n’t like saying “ I do n’t know . ”
If they say it , they probably mean it .
So stop pushing for a definitive answer when one does n’t exist .
I ’ve spent years dealing with obnoxious managers who want an answer , any answer .
They make it clear that they think the lack of an answer comes from laziness or evasiveness .
Worse still , managers often insist on being given an answer even when they know the answer is wrong .
That is n’t being hard - nosed , it ’s being fucking stupid .
It ’s perfectly reasonable to want some sort of plan up front .
I ’m actually one of those funny types who believe up front planning is a necessity .
So long as everyone understands an estimate is just that : an estimate .
You learn as you go along and discover more detail .
So you revise the estimate accordingly .
For this to work , everyone involved has to listen , everyone has to be open , everyone has to be responsive .
Or we could keep flailing away with the fucked up attitude that “ it has to be this way ” because the sacred project plan says it ’s this way .
Because that really is a lot of fun , is n’t it ?
At the end of the day , it ’s how people respond to the unexpected that drives whether a project will succeed or fail .
So what are you going to be ?
A jerk who worships at the altar of whatever project management methodology is flavour of the month ?
Or a realist who can accept that things change and all projects can be unpredictable ?
Your decision makes a big difference .
Woman Drinks 12 Diet Cokes a Day Many can't get by without coffee , but diet soda fans say there 's no substitute .
May 19 , 2007  --
Although many Americans can't start their day without a cup of coffee or tea , die - hard fans of diet sodas claim there 's no substitute .
Elton John , Victoria Beckham and even former president Bill Clinton admit to being hooked on Diet Coke , and they 're not alone .
For many , diet sodas fulfill a craving for sweets while giving drinkers a jolt of caffeine with few or zero calories .
Amanda Sanchez , a 29 - year - old working mother of two , is a self - professed Diet Coke junkie .
" It 's my water .
It keeps me going .
It 's the fluid that keeps me alive , " Sanchez said .
" I really think I am addicted .
I really think it would be very hard for me to stop . "
She drinks more than a case of Diet Coke a day , or 12 cans , almost one for every hour she is awake .
" It 's her main staple .
I consider it a food group in our house , " said her husband , Henry Sanchez .
She drinks it at home and at work .
" You hear the popping the top , " her co-worker Elizabeth Perkins said .
" You know when Amanda shows up to work .
You can hear it in the Coke . "
Sanchez says that Diet Coke helps her make it through her day .
" I really like the fizzy of the diet soda .
I really like the coldness and the taste and the sweetness , " she said .
" If anything goes wrong , I will just grab a diet soda and it 's all better .
Diet Coke and other diet sodas are hugely popular in the United States , with consumers spending $ 21 billion a year on the low - calorie drinks .
While the drinks may be low in calories , they have plenty of caffeine , which can be addictive .
" People do indeed become addicted to caffeine very rapidly , and they also withdraw from caffeine very rapidly , " said Dr. Harris Stratyner , an addiction specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center .
" It can make their sleep patterns disturbed .
It can make them restless , wired , anxious . "
There is no major study that says drinking diet sodas is bad for you , but some health experts say it may have health consequences down the road .
" There is some evidence that the acid load of soda , regular or diet , has an adverse affect on bone health , " said Dr. David Katz , nutrition expert at the Yale School of Medicine .
" I would be very worried that if you are drinking 12 cans a day , diet or regular , it 's potentially going to do damage to your skeleton , and eventually that can be a very serious problem .
The Coca -Cola Company said it sees nothing wrong with drinking lots of Diet Coke .
" Great taste .
No calories .
Wholesome ingredients .
How could you drink too much ? " said Diana Garza , the communications director of Coca - Cola North America .
Sanchez feels perfectly healthy , but admitted that it may be time to stop .
" I 'm going to cut back .
I am going to stair step it .
Start [ at ] 12 , cut back to eight , then cut back to four and then try to cut back completely and replace that with water , " she said .
" I 've never done that before .
[ It 's ] going to be a huge thing for me . "
Imagine being able to walk for miles through the heart of New York city – without ever touching the ground !
Until a few years ago , these elevated railroad tracks running right through Manhattan were slated for demolation .
Today , they have the support of politicians and celebreties ( as shown in the video ) including Hilary Clinton , Edward Norton and Kevin Bacon .
Of course , none of these are professional designers with ideas for how to convert this amazing property into an elevated park .
Still , their support has helped fuel a series of design competitions with amazing results .
All four of the design team finalized , including heavy hitters like Zaha Hadid and Diller +
Scofidio produced compelling urban design strategies .
Construction is currently underway and is projected to open next summer – be sure to catch it on your next trip to New York !
Web site : U.S. troops traded Iraq photos for porn access
No evidence of felony , Army says From Barbara Starr
CNN Washington Bureau
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT
Interactive :
Who 's who in Iraq Interactive : Sectarian divide Timeline : Bloodiest days for civilians Coalition Casualties Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Iraq Afghanistan Cable News Network ( CNN ) Military Bases or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Army is investigating reports that troops took photographs of dead Iraqis and traded them to a pornographic
Web site in return for access to that site , Army sources said Wednesday .
Army spokesman Paul Boyce told CNN that a preliminary investigation had found " no evidence of a felony crime , " but both he and Col.
Joseph Curtin said the Web postings , if verified , could constitute a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions on good conduct .
" There is no criminal investigation into the matter of photos of deceased bodies in Iraq being posted on the worldwide Web anonymously , " Boyce said .
" Army criminal investigators examined this recently as a preliminary inquiry but found there is no specific evidence of a felony crime . "
Curtin acknowledged an ongoing investigation , however , saying it was focusing on " allegations that soldiers may have exchanged personally taken photographs of dead Iraqis in exchange for pornographic access . "
Chris Wilson , owner of the site , told CNN that he had given members of the military serving in Iraq and Afghanistan access to the site for free -- if they provided him with a photograph proving they were serving there .
CNN could not verify the authenticity of the photographs and videos posted on the site and will not include its name because it is considered offensive by many people .
Wilson , of Lakeland , Florida , said the military has n't contacted him about the postings or the anonymous posters and he does n't " suspect they 'd have reason to . "
" It would be a matter of free speech , " he said .
" Since I 'm not a member of the military , I 'm not bound by the laws of the military . "
The Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , however , said the grisly practice may violate international laws of war .
The Geneva Conventions require respect for " the remains of persons who have died for reasons related to occupation or in detention resulting from occupation or hostilities and those of persons not nationals of the country in which they have died as a result of hostilities . "
Wilson's
Web site , which began as a place for men to post photographs and videos of their sexual partners , is hosted on servers located in Amsterdam , he said , and is bound by the laws of the Netherlands .
The site allows the anonymous postings of photographs and videos purportedly taken by members of the military with their own digital cameras .
In particularly gruesome images , visitors to the site try to guess what body part is displayed .
U.S. military personnel also appear in some of the images .
Curtin said the investigation would try to verify the authenticity of the images and the identity of any U.S. personnel before it can determine if any prosecutable offense or violation of military policy exists .
" The photos show close ups of military uniforms and closeups of human body parts found allegedly in the streets of Iraq , " Boyce said .
" The military will work the matter within the chain of command in Iraq to ensure that personnel are aware of appropriate conduct and continue their sensitivity to the remains of local citizens and members of our Armed Forces -- since in some of the photos it is even difficult to discern the identity of the deceased . "
The Web site also includes images purported to be from Afghanistan .
Wilson , 27 , said gruesome photographs began to be posted because paid access to the site was blocked for those attempting access from so - called " high risk " areas like Iraq and Afghanistan .
And members of the military , he said , wanted to be able to see the site .
" So I made a deal with them that if they sent me a picture proving they were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan , I would give them access to the site for free , " he said .
Now , he said , some 30,000 of his 220,000 registered users or military members serving in the war zones .
The gruesome photos , he said , are " probably third or fourth " most popular areas on his 18 - month - old Web site .
The most popular , he said , are " the adult areas , for sure . "

President Bush is notorious for issuing statements taking exception to hundreds of bills as he signs them .
This week , we learned that in a shocking number of cases , the Bush administration has refused to enact those laws .
Congress should use its powers to insist that its laws are obeyed .
The Government Accountability Office , a nonpartisan arm of Congress , investigated 19 provisions to which Mr. Bush objected .
It found that six of them , or nearly a third , have not been implemented as the law requires .
The G.A.O. did not investigate some of the most infamous signing statements , like the challenge to a ban on torture .
But the ones it looked into are disturbing enough .
In one case , Congress directed the Pentagon in its 2007 budget request to account separately for the cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was a perfectly appropriate request , but Mr. Bush issued a signing statement critical of the rule , and the Pentagon withheld the information .
In two other cases , federal agencies ignored laws requiring them to get permission from Congressional committees before taking particular actions .
The Bush administration ’s disregard for these laws is part of its extraordinary theory of the “ unitary executive . ”
The administration asserts that the president has the sole authority to supervise and direct executive officers , and that Congress and the courts cannot interfere .
This theory , which has no support in American history or the Constitution , is a formula for autocracy .
The college head thinks 95 % of us are going to burn in hell .
His new deputy believes it 's wrong for women to teach men .
Insiders are complaining about an " openly homophobic " atmosphere .
A third of the academic staff have resigned .
Others are unwilling to speak openly to the press because they fear disciplinary action .
Is this perhaps the notorious Bob Jones University in South Carolina , where rock music and mobile phones are banned , where men must have short hair and where women can't wear trousers to class ?
No. Welcome to the University of Oxford .
Strictly speaking Wycliffe Hall is a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford , rather than a full college .
But the difference is pretty academic .
Wycliffe has control over its admissions policy and those who graduate do so with a full Oxford University degree .
Which is why the thought that Wycliffe has been taken over by Christian fundamentalists is ruffling senior common room feathers all over the university .
For having a cell of religious extremists succeed in claiming one of its precious institutions does little to enhance Oxford 's reputation .
But can disgruntled dons do much about it ?
After all , Oxford was founded as a Christian institution and , for good or ill , Christianity is built into its DNA .
Dominus Illuminatio Mea - the Lord is my light - is the university motto .
It has a university church and university sermons ; the colleges have chapels and chaplains .
It 's hardly a secular institution .
Even forgetting this heritage for a moment , there 's a freedom of academic speech aspect to all of this .
Surely Richard Turnbull , the principal , and his chums must be allowed to say what they like , however foolish or unpleasant .
What sticks in the throat , however , is that this new wave of reactionary evangelicalism is using the name of the university despite the fact that it has no love in its heart for the values of learning .
Wycliffe is fast becoming a school for church planting that does little more than peddle the techniques of Christian salesmanship .
As such , it is drawing upon a longstanding tradition of evangelical anti-intellectualism that originates in the great American revival of the 18th century - specifically , in the American churches ' desire to define themselves against what they regarded as the bookish sophistication of snobbish and decadent Europeans .
The theologian Mark A Noll , in his book The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind , argues that the low esteem in which many evangelicals hold academic inquiry is a function of fear , a lack of confidence that faith can survive rational scrutiny .
And so they build walls around their minds and colleges , desperate to keep at bay the dangerous lessons of the Enlightenment .
In such a context , theology and doctrine are replaced by training : leadership skills and strategies for church marketing .
Places such as Wycliffe once had internationally renowned scholars - now they cling on to the university for its kudos .
It 's all about image .
Which is why it 's all very timely that Oxford is conducting a high - level review of the status of its permanent private halls , chaired by the former vice chancellor Colin Lucas .
As a minimum requirement , it must ensure that places like Wycliffe are made fully compliant with the equal opportunities policy of Oxford University .
Would Wycliffe
Hall really be a safe place for a gay person to study ?
I suspect not .
It is why Oxford University must be careful with its imprimatur .
For while it is one thing to hold morally abhorrent views about the subordinate role of women , it is quite another for such views to influence admissions policy .
Of course , what should really happen is that the bishops of the Church of England stop using colleges like this to train its priests .
Places such as Wycliffe are turning Anglicanism into a cult .
But it 's a symptom of how bad things are in the C of E , and how frightened its bishops have become of the financial muscle of conservative evangelicals , that they wo n't find the gumption to cut Wycliffe adrift .
But clearly they should .
For Anglicanism is fast becoming the nasty party at prayer , with traditionally inclusive theology being submerged by a bargain - basement prejudice that damns to hell all those who disagree .
This is n't faith , it 's fanaticism .

June 5 , 2007  --
In Kirkuk , a city in northern Iraq that wavers between war and unsteady peace , a woman named Khadeja runs a beauty shop in the poorest section of town .
She needs $ 1,200 to keep her business going -- a business that supports her parents and disabled brother .
In Los Gatos , Calif. , a real estate broker named Debby Bright is giving her a loan .
Separated by roughly 7,000 miles , Bright and Khadeja connected through Kiva , an online lending network which recently added Iraqis to its list of entrepreneurs in poor countries who are looking to build up a business .
On Kiva.org Bright and others like her log on , browse the pictures and profiles of small business owners and make micro loans -- usually $ 25 to $ 50 each -- with the click of a mouse .
Once the full value of the loan is collected , it 's wired to a Kiva field partner in that country , who then delivers cash to the entrepreneur .
Khadeja gets her loan , and Bright gets to feel she made a difference .
" She 's an entrepreneur and I 'm an entrepreneur , and I know how important it is to have one 's own business , " Bright told ABC News .
" I feel we as a nation owe something to these people . "
Rebuilding Iraq -- One Loan at a Time
The first Iraq entrepreneurs to join this lending service went up on the Kiva Web site just two weeks ago .
Photographs of their faces were blurred to protect their identities , and the requests were accompanied by this disclaimer : " This entrepreneur is from a volatile region where the security situation remains unsettled .
Lenders to this business should be aware that this loan may represent a higher risk and accept this additional risk in making their loan . "
Nevertheless , the Iraq postings sparked what seemed like a feeding frenzy online .
Within a few hours all the loans were fully funded -- from the hair salon to a request for a new sewing machine and a request to rebuild a computer shop that had been burned to the ground in a terrorist attack .
" A lot of people had the same reaction I did , which was , ' This is my chance ! ' " said Christian Conti of Washington , D.C. , who loaned $ 25 to a mobile phone shop owner in Kirkuk .
" As someone who watches the news play out day to day … and all you hear is the negative news … you say , ' Man , I wish I could do something . ' "
" Traditionally a business on Kiva gets funded in about a day and a half , " CEO and co-founder Matt Flannery told ABC News .
He noted that women business owners in Africa usually go the quickest , while Eastern European men take the longest time to get funded .
" Right now the Iraqis are going to quickest .
I think they all got funded in half a day , which is the fastest sector on our site right now , " Flannery added .
Some of the Americans who responded told ABC news the loans were their way of helping with Iraq 's reconstruction , lifting an economy left in tatters by the U.S. invasion .
" I 'm not able to save Iraq … but I am able to give $ 25 to support a woman and her tailoring business , " said Glenda Denniston of Madison , Wis. , who loaned money to both the computer store owner and the seamstress in Kirkuk .
The ' Two Martini Loan '
Many of the Kiva lenders say they are " addicted " to the Web site , checking it daily if not hourly to see what new countries and entrepreneurs have been posted .
Conti has loaned $ 25 to three dozen different entrepreneurs from Togo to Tanzania , Afghanistan to Iraq .
He calls it his " two - martini loan . "
" That 's what it costs in D.C. for two martinis and instead someone in Tajikistan has two cows , is able to feed their family … that 's an easy decision for me , " said Conti .
And the small sums add up .
In 20 months the San Francisco - based nonprofit has helped put more than $ 6 million into the hands of small business owners in 30 countries .
Kiva , which means " agreement " in Swahili , operates based on what 's called social lending or person - to - person financing .
The power of that method , according to Kiva CEO and co-founder Matt Flannery , lies in the personal connectivity felt on both sides of the transaction .
" I think the secret of Kiva 's success is that it's a people - focused experience .
People in America get to see where their dollars are going , " said Flannery .
Sending a Message
In every country , Kiva has a field partner that deals directly with the entrepreneurs -- reviewing loan applications and delivering the cash .
In Iraq , that partner is the Al - Aman Finance Center in Kirkuk , which is funded by a grant from USAID .
Al - Aman chairman Waria Salhi says that the Kiva loans send a clear and powerful message to borrowers in Iraq .
" The message is ' Americans are not only the soldiers whom you see on Iraqi streets chasing bad guys .
They are also good and hardworking people thousands of miles away and voluntarily willing to help you with their hard earned money , ' " Salhi told ABC News in an e-mail .
" Lenders are not lending because they think of how the person is going to pay me back … they 're lending because they think this person is the most in need , " said Flannery .
The Payback
So far , Kiva has an excellent track record for the repayment of loans .
Only one out of 9,000 borrowers has defaulted on a Kiva loan ; all others have paid back or started to pay back their lenders .
While the individual lenders on Kiva do n't collect interest on their loan , the borrowers do pay interest to Kiva 's field partners at a rate of roughly 13 percent to help cover their operating expenses .
That 's usually far less than the interest charged by banks or other institutions that are available to make loans .
Aside from the default rate , experts find there can be other risks with this operating model for loans .
In particular , there is a risk that loan recipients are not honest or realistic about their plans for the money they receive .
" It 's very hard to vet projects on the ground … and make sure they 're capable of doing what they say they 'll do with the money , " said Ethan Zuckerman , a research fellow at Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society .
" Kiva 's done quite well with this so far , leveraging contacts on the ground .
But it gets harder to do the larger you get , " he said .
The Next Step
As Kiva looks to raise more money for an expanding group of small businesses around the world , there will likely be changes to its operating model .
To date Kiva 's overhead expenses have been covered by donations and grants , but sometime this year the nonprofit will introduce a fee of 2 percent to local partners to sustain and scale up its work .
There are also plans to build out the Web infrastructure on Kiva.org to add rich content including more photos and soon , video of Kiva loan applicants in remote reaches of the world .
But for now , entrepreneurs like Khadeja in Kirkuk , are just happy that they received a loan .
She is looking forward to hiring some extra workers and getting new equipment for her beauty shop with her thousand dollars from Kiva .
" I tell my donor thank you , " Khadeja told ABC News through a translator .
" It will change my life . "

The new link will cut Zurich - Milan journey times dramatically
Sending Italian wine to the Netherlands , or German washing machines to Greece , means a long , slow journey along narrow alpine valleys , through tunnels and over passes .
The amount of freight crossing the Alps in heavy goods vehicles has risen sharply over the last two decades .
In 1990 an estimated 40 m tonnes went by road , in 2001 that had risen to 90 m tonnes , with further big increases expected by 2010 .
But concerns for the Alpine environment and fears over safety have led to big pressure to move freight off the roads and onto the railways .
Both Switzerland 's Gotthard road tunnel and France 's Mont Blanc road tunnel have suffered major fires in the last 10 years in which many died .
Faster than flying
As long ago as 1994 , the Swiss voted in a nationwide referendum to put all freight crossing their country onto the railways .
Naturally , such an ambitious plan was not going to happen overnight , but now the project dubbed the engineering feat of the 21st Century is slowly taking shape .
A key feature of the project , which is new to alpine transport , is the fact that the entire railway line will stay at the same altitude of 500 metres ( 1,650 ft ) above sea level .
This will allow trains using the line to reach speeds of 240 km /h ( 149 m ph ) , reducing the travel time between Zurich and Milan from today 's four hours to just two - and - a - half .
That would make the journey faster than flying .
To see the work in progress , it is necessary to travel two kilometres underground , to the construction site between the southern Swiss towns of Faido and Biasca .
The scale of the work going on is enormous : 2,000 people are working on the tunnel , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
Besides the two main railway tubes , the construction workers have to dig access tunnels for people and equipment .
Huge fans ensure a fresh supply of air and cool things down .
Yet the temperature is above 30C .
" We 've got two - and - a - half kilometres of Alps above us , " explains engineer Albert Schmid .
" That means millions and millions of cubic metres of earth pressing down on us , that increases the pressure and the temperature . "
Difficult work
It also means that every time the workers dig out another few metres of the tunnel , mother nature tries to close it up again .
Along the tunnel 's length , reinforced steel rings have to be inserted , to prevent it collapsing in on itself .
At another section the world 's biggest tunnel - boring machine is in operation ; it is ten metres in diameter and covered in dozens of rock - cutting blades , which as the machine turns , hack away at the rock face .
" With this machine , in good conditions , we can excavate 40 metres in a day , " says Mr Schmid .
" That 's an absolute record . "
But conditions are not always good .
The tunnel workers have run into serious geological problems ; in some areas the rock is as soft as butter , making digging it out more complicated .
" In poor rock conditions , where the rock is very soft , we can only excavate around half a metre a day , " says Mr Schmid .
" So in these situations , the work is delayed , and the costs rise . "
Soaring costs
In fact the price tag for the entire rail link has soared from about $ 8 bn ( £ 4bn ) to almost $ 15bn and final completion is unlikely to be before 2018 .
But that has not stopped the alpine communities from supporting the project , and from trying to ensure that the rail link brings some social benefits too .
The tiny village of Sedrun , population 1,500 , lies along the tunnel 's route , and while residents are pleased to be relieved of the heavy lorries , they are concerned that the tunnel may marginalise their community .
" The thing about this tunnel is that it makes the Alps disappear , " explains local architect Arthur Loretz .
" At the moment , when you drive from Zurich to Milan , you get a beautiful panoramic view .
But this tunnel turns the Alps into a big black hole . "
Alpine gateway
The original plans for the tunnel involved trains rushing beneath the Alps without stopping .
But in Sedrun a 1,000 - metre elevator and underground railway station have been built just to get the workers to the construction site .
Tourists will be able to arrive by train in the Alps in record time , and then be whisked up to fresh mountain air by way of the world 's longest elevator .
" I think it will have great benefits , " says Mr Loretz .
" Not just for tourists , but for us .
Look , over that mountain people speak Italian , and over that one there they speak German . "
" And here we speak Reto Romansch - a language only spoken by around 50,000 people .
Traditionally the mountains have divided us , but with this rail link , and with Porta Alpina , we can bring people together . "
With continued interest in the subject of 9/11 mounting after his film " Fahrenheit 9/11 " , public opinion now cast much doubt on the official story of 9/11 where polls show that only 16 % of the U.S. believe the Bush Administration is telling us the full truth about 9/11 .
From the interview :
" I 've had a number of firefighters tell me over the years and since Fahrenheit 9/11 that they heard these explosions -- that they believe there 's MUCH more to the story than we 've been told .
I do n't think the official investigations have told us the complete truth -- they have n't even told us half the truth . "
He then questions the suppression of video footage from the Pentagon :
" I 've filmed there before down at the Pentagon -- before 9/11 -- there 's got to be at least 100 cameras , ringing that building , in the trees , everywhere .
They 've got that plane coming in with 100 angles .
How come with have n't seen the straight -- I 'm not talking about stop-action photos , I 'm talking about the video .
I want to see the video ; I want to see 100 videos that exist of this , "
He went on to imply the implausibility of a pilot executing the flight pattern of the flight that allegedly hit the Pentagon .
" Why do n't they want us to see that plane coming into the building ?
Because , if you know anything about flying a plane , when you 're going 500 miles per hour , if you 're off by that much , you 're in the river .
So , they hit a building that 's only 5 stories high ...[ unclear ] that expertly .
I believe that there will be answers in that video tape and we should demand that that tape is released . "
With Michael stating that he intends to get his own answers , could we be seeing a follow - up to " Fahrenheit 9/11 " in the near future ?
Also Michael thanked the 9/11 Truth group WeAreChange.org for their work in investigating 9/11 .

Psychologists say that filling the role of the responsible firstborn , while important to academic achievement , still does not account for eldest children ’s higher average scores on intelligence tests .
Robert Zajonc , a psychologist at Stanford University , has argued that in fact having a younger sibling or two diminishes the overall intellectual environment for eldest children  who otherwise would be benefiting from the rich vocabulary and undivided attention of parents .
This helps explain why , under the age of 12 , younger siblings actually outshine older ones on I.Q. tests .
Something else is at work , Dr. Zajonc said , and he has found evidence that tutoring  a natural role for older siblings  benefits the teacher more than it does the student .
“ Explaining something to a younger sibling solidifies your knowledge and allows you to grow more extensively , ” he said .
“ The younger one is asking questions , and challenging meanings and explanations , and that will contribute to the intellectual maturity of the older one . ”
( Only children receive the benefit of more parental attention but miss the opportunity to tutor a younger brother or sister . )
Ms. Monaco , who has two sons in their 20s , said her oldest was expected to help his brother from an early age .
“ He was a teacher to his brother , and he has grown up to be a more intense thinker ; he ’s studying business management , ” she said .
“ His brother is more easygoing , independent ; he ’s studying leisure and recreation and has an internship at a golf course . ”
The two are very close friends , she said .
Parents who recognize the different niches that their children fill can enhance the family ’s intellectual environment by exploiting each child ’s expertise , researchers say .
“ Given the evidence we have on this , I would as a parent encourage late - born siblings to take on teaching roles , with other siblings or other children , ” said Paul Trapnell , a psychologist at the University of Winnipeg .
Dr. Trapnell compared this process to the so - called jigsaw approach used in classrooms , in which complex projects are divided up and each child becomes an expert in a particular task and instructs the others .
Younger siblings often have something more to pass on than the tricks of their favorite hobby , or the philosophy behind their social charm .
Evidence suggests that younger siblings are more likely than older ones to take risks based on their knowledge and instincts .
Seems renewable energy is popping up everywhere lately .
The newest converts ?
The Amish .
Yea that ’s right the Amish .
Seems they care more about independence and having reliable power than they do shunning technology .
Hundreds of Amish are taken with getting energy from the sun .
They see it as a safe alternative to natural gas and kerosene as a source of light .
Livestock farmer Owen Nisley of nearby Charm said getting power through solar panels is “ no different from my cows eating the grass that has captured the sun ’s energy .
…
We love the solar , even in the winter when there are a lot of dark days . ”
The equipment has become so prevalent that the environmental group Green Energy Ohio is organizing an Amish Country tour during the American Solar Energy Society ’s 36th annual convention , July 7 - 12 , in Cleveland .
About 1,800 people from across the nation are expected to attend the conference and trade show .
Squaring solar panels with the Amish tradition of forgoing the fancy is easy for Jake Raber , co-owner of The Lighthouse of Ohio Distribution in Fredericksburg .
“ I am a Christian and I am Amish .
But being Amish is not a religion .
It ’s a way of life , ” Raber said .
“ Being Amish means being independent . ”
Raber and his wife , Betty , ordered $ 50,000 worth of solar panels last year from suppliers in Michigan and Japan and sold them all .
Many of his customers are Amish families who do n’t require the amounts of electricity their non-Amish neighbors use . ( via )
Global warming does n’t only hurt human beings .
Ocean wind patterns are shifting due to changes in global climate .
A few months ago , the clear blue Pacific Ocean waters off the coast of Oregon suddenly turned a thick greenish brown .
A swell of nutrients produced a bizarre blooming of plankton that reached levels never seen before by scientists .
Then the plankton died and sank , causing oxygen levels in the water to plummet to zero .
The living ocean was transformed into a dead zone .
Scientists conducted a submarine survey and found only the bodies of crabs and marine worms scattered across the ocean floor .
There were no signs of any fish .
Nothing had survived the cataclysm .( via )
It seems that the warming oceans are causing a shift in the wind patterns .
This warming is caused by human beings and our co2 heavy lifestyle .
Seasonal winds affect ocean currents by pushing away surface water , which is then replaced by colder water from below .
But warmer land temperatures result in higher pressures and stronger winds , which in turn have an impact on currents .
The patterns of these shifts are starting to wildly fluctuate as predicted in global warming climate models .
This is the result of over 5 decades of data .
Looking down at the James Webb Space Telescope , the sunshield , which is stretched out underneath the mirrors ( yellow ) looks like a spider web .
Click image to enlarge .
NASA is adding a docking ring to the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) just in case a visit by astronauts aboard a future Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle is needed to complete deployment of the multibillion - dollar orbiting observatory .
The U.S. space agency made the announcement May 10 during the unveiling of a full - scale model of the JWST on the National Mall here .
Billed as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope , the JWST is slated to launch in mid-2013 .
By the time it is fully expanded as it is deployed at a gravitationally stable spot some 1.5 million kilometers from Earth , the spacecraft will be about the length of a tennis court .
Building , launching and operating the infrared telescope for 10 years is expected to cost $ 4.5 billion , making it the most expensive science mission NASA has in development .
" We cannot make the James Webb Space Telescope fully serviceable like the Hubble because that would cost so much money that I do n't think this country could afford it , " said Edward Weiler , director of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , the Greenbelt , Md. , facility in charge of the Webb telescope .
" However , what if you have a bad day when you put this thing a million miles out and everything folds out except for an antenna ... it gets stuck ?
Or a solar panel does n't fold out completely , and you say , ' gee , I wish we could send an astronaut just to give it a kick ' ? "
Weiler said NASA Administrator Mike Griffin asked the James Webb team two years ago to examine whether it was worthwhile to design the telescope to accommodate a visit from Orion .
According to Weiler , it is .
" We are going to design for the James Webb Space Telescope a little ring that the Crew Exploration Vehicle could dock with so if we had a bad day the astronauts could go out to James Webb and do minimal , gross things , " he said .
" They could n't replace instruments , they could n't change out things , but they could fix things that were obviously wrong . "
Weiler said it is his hope and expectation that an astronaut service call never proves necessary .
That point was seconded by Martin Mohan , the JWST program manager at Redondo Beach , Calif . - based Northrop Grumman Space Technology .
" We are spending a great deal of time in testing to make sure that JWST deploys reliably on orbit , " Mohan said .
" That is one of the core competencies of Northrop Grumman Space Technology .
That was , we believe , one of the factors in our selection .
That does n't mean we take it lightly in any stretch of the imagination . "
The decision to add a docking ring to the Webb telescope was news to Griffin .
Asked about it May 16 , he said : " A year or two ago I asked people if it would n't be smart to at least have some capability to dock Orion with James Webb such that if people wanted to service it , they could do so .
It only seems to me to make sense to not preclude that .
I did n't tell them to do it .
So if they are doing it , they must have studied it and come to the conclusion that it is a worthwhile thing to do . "
Meanwhile , a NASA review board recently determined that all 10 new technologies key to the success of the JWST are mature enough to move into the detailed engineering phase of the program .
Among those new technologies are near - infrared detectors , sunshield materials and lightweight cryogenic mirrors .
" The invention is done more than six years ahead of launch , " Mohan said .
" That 's an unprecedented achievement . "
Weiler agreed , saying that Hubble 's launch was delayed several years because its enabling technologies were not ready , adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of the project .
Mohan said that thanks to the new technologies , Webb 's 6.5 - meter mirror will weigh only half of what Hubble 's mirror weighs yet will provide nine times as much light - collecting power .
The Ball Aerospace - designed mirror , which is already in fabrication , consists of 18 separate segments that will be unfolded during deployment and held in place by composite structures developed by Minneapolis - based Alliant Techsystems .
Weiler said the JWST has met every budget and technical milestone in the 20 months since NASA restructured the project , delaying its launch two years and adding $ 1 billion to the life - cycle cost estimate .
The project 's next major review is slated for March 2008 .
As expensive as JWST might seem , Weiler said , when all is said and done it will cost roughly half of what NASA has spent on Hubble — about $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion adjusted for inflation and measured according to the same accounting methods that govern Webb .
The West Wing of the White House tends to have a funereal stillness , even in the best of times , which these are not .
The President ’s aides walk the narrow corridors with pensive expressions and vigilantly modulated voices .
By contrast , Karl Rove ’s office has an almost party atmosphere .
Rove , the President ’s chief political adviser — the “ architect , ” Bush has called him , of his 2004 victory over John Kerry — has been a man of constant troubles : Valerie Plame troubles , U.S. Attorney - firing troubles , and , most of all , collapse - of - the - Republican Party troubles .
Yet his voice is suffused with bonhomie , his jokes are bad and frequent , his enthusiasm is communicable ; he resembles an oversized leprechaun , although one with unconcealed resentments and a receding hairline .
Tom DeLay , Newt Gingrich , Karl Rove — who ’s most to blame for the Republican Party ’s disarray ?
FINN GRAFF
“ Hey , what ’s Snow doing here ? ” Rove said one recent afternoon .
“ Must be important , if he ’s visiting us . ” Tony Snow , the White House press secretary , stood in Rove ’s outer office , bent over in conversation with one of several assistants .
“ Uh - oh , here ’s the big gun , ” Rove said as Peter Wehner , the White House director of strategic initiatives , came into the office .
Wehner , an evangelical Christian , is known in Washington for a relentless stream of e-mails that praise George W. Bush ’s allies ( “ The Remarkable Anthony Charles Lynton Blair , ” “ The Remarkable Joseph Lieberman ” ) ; that glean from the Internet any cheerful news from Iraq ; and that provide links to articles by writers like the Middle East scholar Fouad Ajami and the untiring neoconservative Norman Podhoretz .
As we talked , Rove would bounce up from his chair , twice making a show of going to the dictionary to look up words .
( One was “ sanguinity , ” as in “ I ’m very sanguine ” about the Republican Party ’s future . )
He is a bookish man who plays the part of the anti-intellectual , which fits an Administration whose culture discourages displays of esoteric knowledge and , its critics say , of useful knowledge as well .
When Rove came to Washington , after the 2000 election , he envisioned creating an enduring Republican majority — the permanent mobilization of the Party ’s broad , socially conservative base .
Part of his strategy was to cast as threats , in alarming terms , same - sex marriage , abortion rights , and other bogeymen of the right .
It is Rove ’s cleverness , combined with his joie de combat , that made him insufferable to Democrats .
Now , though , the Democrats are gloating — and happy to point out that little more than thirty per cent of the public approves of Bush ’s job performance .
Andrew Sullivan , a disaffected conservative , has joked on his blog that Rove seems to be getting his permanent majority — except that it ’s a Democratic one .
The Republican reversal has certainly come with great speed — as fortunes in Washington have tended to do since the Vietnam era .
In the midterm election , Republicans lost control of Congress , and the House G.O.P. caucus is beleaguered by scandals and by accusations that its members have benefitted from crude pork - barrel politics .
The tenets of neoconservatism that have animated Bush ’s foreign policy — that America has a responsibility to spread the ideals of democracy , and that force can justifiably be used to aid this secular missionary work — are held in low esteem .
The call to change the world which infused Bush ’s second Inaugural speech has faded .
Disillusionment with the Administration has become widespread among the conservatives who once were Bush ’s strongest supporters .
Mickey Edwards , a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma , said recently , “ The Republican Administration has shown itself to be completely incompetent to the point that , of Republicans in Iowa , fifty - two per cent thought we should be out of Iraq in six months . ”
Edwards , who left Congress in 1993 and now teaches at Princeton , is helping to lead an effort among some conservatives to curtail the President ’s power in such areas as warrantless wiretapping .
“ This Administration is beyond the pale in terms of arrogance and incompetence , ” he said .
“ This guy thinks he ’s a monarch , and that ’s scary as hell . ”
The grievances against the Administration seem limitless .
Many congressional Republicans , for instance , were upset that Bush waited to fire Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld until after the midterm elections .
Even if events in Iraq do eventually turn in the direction that the Administration hopes , history is weighted against the Republicans .
Only once since the death of Franklin Roosevelt has a party kept the Presidency for three consecutive terms — when George H. W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis , in 1988 .
Bush the Elder , though , had the advantage of being Ronald Reagan ’s Vice - President , and Reagan , despite being damaged by the Iran - Contra scandal , was greatly esteemed by his party .
Few of the men running now for the Republican nomination are likely to embrace George W. Bush ’s record .
“ If the Democrats ca n’t win the Presidency in 2008 , they ’ll never win the Presidency , ” David Keene , the chairman of the American Conservative Union , said not long ago .
And now Karl Rove , the man Bush has called his “ boy genius , ” is among those being blamed by conservatives for the Party ’s problems — blame that he shares with others who have attempted to transform the party .
One is Newt Gingrich , the strategist behind the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress , who could not hold together his coalition , and resigned .
( Gingrich also faced ethics problems — he was accused of using tax - deductible donations for political purposes . )
Another is Tom DeLay , who served as House whip under Gingrich and became Majority Leader under Gingrich ’s successor , Dennis Hastert , and who left facing charges relating to campaign fi-nance .
Perhaps most of all , conservatives blame Rove ’s boss , George W. Bush .
When I asked Rove if the persistence of bad news , along with criticism from conservatives , has made the White House a moody place , he let loose an apparently authentic laugh .
“ This is a great place to work , ” he said .
“ It ’s inspiring to work here .
It ’s neat , particularly when you ’ve got a boss whose attitude is ‘ What can we do today to advance our goals ?
What are the big things we could be doing ? ’ ” Such statements fail to acknowledge that the President has been spending much of his time fighting congressional attempts to limit his mobility in Iraq and to force the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
For Rove , the future is still Republican .
“ I do n’t think by any means it ’s a sure thing , but I do think there are these big societal changes driving us , and I think that the conservative movement and the Party through which it operates are going to benefit , ” he said .
“ That ’s not to say that it ’s going to be an ever - upward line .
And it also does n’t mean that smart Democrats ca n’t do something about it . ”
Rove thinks that more voters now are being influenced by technology and religion .
“ There are two or three societal trends that are driving us in an increasingly deep center - right posture , ” he said .
“ One of them is the power of the computer chip .
Do you know how many people ’s principal source of income is eBay ?
Seven hundred thousand . ”
He went on , “ So the power of the computer has made it possible for people to gain greater control over their lives .
It ’s given people a greater chance to run their own business , become a sole proprietor or an entrepreneur .
As a result , it has made us more market - oriented , and that equals making you more center - right in your politics . ”
As for spirituality , Rove said , “ As baby boomers age and as they ’re succeeded by the post - baby - boom generation , within both of those generations there ’s something going on spiritually — people saying it ’s not all about materialism , it ’s not all about the pursuit of material things .
If you look at the traditional mainstream denominations , they ’re flat , but what ’s growing inside those denominations , and what ’s growing outside those denominations , is churches that are filling this spiritual need , that are replacing sterility with something vibrant , something that speaks to the heart of the individual , that gives a sense of purpose . ”
Rove believes what he has always believed : that the Christian right and , to a lesser extent , tax - and regulation - averse businessmen will continue to assure Republican victories .
Early G.O.P. Presidential polls , though , do n’t seem to confirm this analysis .
Rudolph Giuliani stands more firmly than any of his rivals for abortion rights and civil unions for gays , and at this point appears to be in the lead .
Bush , polls suggest , has also lost the support of some self - described conservatives .
( Thirty - three per cent of voters in 2004 identified themselves that way . )
But Rove cautioned against reading too much into polls , or the results of the 2006 midterm elections .
“ It ’s important to keep in perspective how close the election actually was , ” he said .
“ Three thousand five hundred and sixty - two votes and we would have had a Republican Senate .
That ’s the gap in the Montana Senate race .
And eighty - five thousand votes are the difference in the fifteen closest House races .
There ’s no doubt we ’ve taken a short - term hit in the face of a very contentious war , but to have the Republicans suffer an average defeat for the midterm says something about the underlying strength of conservative attitudes in the country . ”
Rove ’s arithmetic was correct , but he sounded like John Kerry , who , shortly after his defeat in the 2004 election , told me , “ I received the second - highest number of votes in American history . ”
Rove places the blame for the election results on the recent scandals in Congress — congressmen who placed themselves in the orbit of Jack Abramoff , the lobbyist at the center of the Republican ethics meltdown ; and the former congressman Mark Foley ’s relationships with congressional pages — rather than the Administration ’s management of the Iraq war .
“ If you look at the exit polling , the No. 1 issue , particularly among swing voters , was corruption and behavior , ” he said .
“ After Foley , people said , ‘ It ’s just too much . ’
After that , spending was the No. 2 issue . ”
Rove suggested , as Bush repeatedly has , that history will ratify the decision to invade Iraq .
“ You know , the Bush doctrine — ‘ Feed a terrorist , arm a terrorist , train a terrorist , fund a terrorist , you ’re just as bad as a terrorist , ’ ” he said .
“ It ’s going to remain our national doctrine , and it ’s going to be very difficult , I think , if not impossible , to dismiss this , just as it will be to dismiss the doctrine of preëmption .
In the future , the country is not going to let the dangers fully materialize , and we ’re not going to allow ourselves to be attacked before we do anything about it .
The question was , did we have the right intelligence about Saddam Hussein ?
No .
Was it the right thing to do ?
Yes . ”
Leaving the White House , I passed through the West Wing reception area , where a single visitor — an Army officer , perched on a couch — was waiting for an appointment .
It was Lieutenant General Douglas E. Lute , who that evening was to be named “ war czar , ” a job that few others seemed eager to take .
The appointment of a war czar four years after the invasion of Iraq has struck some as a late and insufficient response to the crisis , and has been a reminder that the Administration , ever since its halting response to Hurricane Katrina , has been judged harshly on questions of competence .
Newt Gingrich is one of those who fear that Republicans have been branded with the label of incompetence .
He says that the Bush Administration has become a Republican version of the Jimmy Carter Presidency , when nothing seemed to go right .
“ It ’s just gotten steadily worse , ” he said .
“ There was some point during the Iranian hostage crisis , the gasoline rationing , the malaise speech , the sweater , the rabbit ” — Gingrich was referring to Carter ’s suggestion that Americans wear sweaters rather than turn up their thermostats , and to the “ attack ” on Carter by what cartoonists quickly portrayed as a “ killer rabbit ” during a fishing trip — “ that there was a morning where the average American went , ‘ You know , this really worries me . ’ ” He added , “ You hire Presidents , at a minimum , to run the country well enough that you do n’t have to think about it , and , at a maximum , to draw the country together to meet great challenges you ca n’t avoid thinking about . ”
Gingrich continued , “ When you have the collapse of the Republican Party , you have an immediate turn toward the Democrats , not because the Democrats are offering anything better , but on a ‘ not them ’ basis .
And if you end up in a 2008 campaign between ‘ them ’ and ‘ not them , ’ ‘ not them ’ is going to win . ”
If Gingrich were an ordinary politician and not someone brimming with futurist and other ideas — some logical , some loopy , many interesting — he would have passed his sell - by date a long time ago .
But Gingrich is not ordinary ; he did not , in the manner of many ex-congressmen , become a lobbyist ( like Dick Armey , the Majority Leader when Gingrich was Speaker ) .
Instead , he has spent his exile lecturing , appearing on Fox News , writing and co-writing books at a ruthless pace ( eight so far , including a recent novel about Pearl Harbor ) , and advertising his thoughts on how to transform government and how to save his party .
Gingrich ’s strength was always insurgency , and after he won his majority , his Achilles ’ heel , which was actual governance , became visible to the world .
In 1994 , his Contract with America promised , among other things , to reform the way Congress did business ; in 1995 and 1996 , in a standoff with the Clinton White House , parts of the federal government were shut down for a total of twenty - seven days , and Gingrich received much of the blame .
Three years later , Republicans , who by then held only a narrow majority in the House , lost five seats ; the Gingrich revolution was over and so was Gingrich ’s congressional career .
But Gingrich seemed to me to believe that , having led one Republican revolution , he is well positioned to lead another — one that would place him in the position of Presidential candidate .
Though he says that he wo n’t decide whether he is running until the fall — and although the clamor for his candidacy has so far not been shrill — he is behaving in many ways like a candidate , taking on speaking engagements and constructing elaborate defenses of his record .
He has admitted having committed adultery , and he sought penance on the radio show of James Dobson , a prominent leader of the Christian right .
He is also mindful of his weight .
When we met recently at the McLean Family Restaurant , in suburban Virginia , near the headquarters of the C.I.A. — one of many government agencies that he says require “ radical transformation ” — he ordered oatmeal with no milk or sugar .
Republicans will be studying Gingrich ’s waistline this summer for signs of a pre-campaign regimen of self - denial just as closely as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will be studying Al Gore’s .
Gingrich does not seem to have aged much in the eight years since he left Congress .
His manner has not changed much , either .
He has a fondness for ideas that he deems large and not much talent for small talk .
Charm is a chore , though he was not at all crabby — as he sometimes is — when we met .
The condition of his party had put him in a noticeably buoyant mood .
On being asked whether Republicans would be able to capture the White House in 2008 or 2012 , he said , smiling , “ Or 2016 , or 2020 . ”
Not since Watergate , Gingrich said , has the Republican Party been in such desperate shape .
“ Let me be clear : twenty - eight - per- cent approval of the President , losing every closely contested Senate seat except one , every one that involved an incumbent — that ’s a collapse .
I mean , look at the Northeast .
You ca n’t be a governing national party and write off entire regions . ”
For this disarray he blames not only Iraq and Hurricane Katrina but also Karl Rove ’s “ maniacally dumb ” strategy in 2004 , which left Bush with no political capital .
“ All he proved was that the anti-Kerry vote was bigger than the anti-Bush vote , ” Gingrich said .
He continued , “ The Bush people deliberately could not bring themselves to wage a campaign of choice ” — of ideology , of suggesting that Kerry was “ to the left of Ted Kennedy ” — and chose instead to attack Kerry ’s war record .
The only way to keep the White House in G.O.P. hands , Gingrich said , would be to nominate someone who , in essence , runs against Bush , in the style of Nicolas Sarkozy , the center - right cabinet minister who just won the French Presidency by making his own President , Jacques Chirac , his virtual opponent .
Sarkozy is a transforming figure in French politics , Gingrich said , and he suggested that the only Republican who shared Sarkozy ’s “ transformative ” approach to governing was , at that moment , eating a bowl of oatmeal at the McLean Family Restaurant .
“ What ’s fascinating about Sarkozy is that you have an incumbent cabinet member of a very unpopular twelve - year Presidency , who over the last three years became the clear advocate of fundamental change , running against an attractive woman ” — the Socialist leader Ségolène Royal — “ who is the head of the opposition , ” Gingrich went on .
“ In a country that wanted to say , ‘ Not them , ’ he managed to switch the identity of the ‘ them . ’
He said , ‘ I ’m different from Chirac , and she ’s not .
If you want more of the same , you should vote for her . ’
It was a Lincoln - quality strategic decision . ”
Gingrich ’s ego is robust — Barack Obama is not the only national politician to fashion himself as an inheritor of Lincoln ’s mantle .
He seems convinced that the Republican Party ’s salvation lies in his fecund mind , and believes that truly transformative conservative ideas , when well articulated , will be enough to attract large majorities .
He cited global warming as an example .
Very few Republicans these days talk about global warming as a reality , the way Gingrich does .
Before a recent debate on Capitol Hill with John Kerry ( reporters were promised a “ smack - down ” ) , Kerry seemed flustered when Gingrich shifted the debate from the basic science to a discussion of market - based solutions to the problem .
Gingrich explained it this way : “ There ’s a short - term way out of this and a long - term way out of this .
The long - term way is to create a new intellectual battleground , which you ca n’t do if you start out by saying ‘ No , no , no , no , no . ’
But if you say , ‘ O.K. , let ’s talk about , for example , how you best have conservation in America , do you think trial lawyers , regulators , bureaucrats , and higher taxes are the answer , then you ought to be with Al Gore .
If you think that markets , incentives , prizes , and entrepreneurs are the answer , you ought to be with us . ’ ”
I asked Gingrich if it was a mistake to appeal to the religious - conservative base of the Party on such issues as the fate of Terri Schiavo , a woman who was living in a persistent vegetative state .
In 2005 , Republicans — supported by , among others , DeLay , and the former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist — engineered quick passage of a special law requiring that Schiavo be kept on a feeding tube , against her husband ’s wishes but in accord with her parents ’ demands and the demands of many evangelicals and conservative Catholics .
( Frist , a physician , diagnosed Schiavo , noting that she was “ clearly responsive , ” after watching her on videotape . )
The courts intervened , and the feeding tube that kept Schiavo alive was removed ; she died thirteen days afterward .
That episode , though , frightened members of what the anti-tax agitator Grover Norquist calls the “ leave - me- alone coalition . ”
It certainly frightened centrists , without whom neither party could flourish .
At Apple Inc.'s May 10 annual shareholder meeting , a series of proposals were presented for voting after which CEO Steve Jobs answered a series of questions from the audience .
As has been the case over the last three years , a large portion of the questions and comments from the audience were presented by environmental groups who attended to present issues related to green conscious , non-toxic manufacturing goals along with e-waste takeback and recycling programs .
Two shareholder proposals pertaining to manufacturing and takeback were slated for a vote at the meeting but were withdrawn by their presenters in response to the recent public comments made by Jobs recognizing the need for the company to publicize its environmental efforts .
One of the withdrawn proposals belonged to Trillium Asset Management , a member of the Investor Environmental Health Network .
Trillium holds over $ 5 million in Apple shares .
The second proposal , presented by the As You Sow Foundation , involved Apple 's takeback and recycling efforts .
Both groups praised Apple 's new public commitments , saying that their their immediate concerns had been addressed satisfactorily , and that they hoped to continue progress on future goals with the company .
Jobs ' Challenges Greenpeace Incompetence .
Those comments did n't stop Greenpeace representatives from using the meeting as an opportunity to advertise the groups anti-Apple campaign .
Among the activists sent by Greenpeace was Iza Kruszewska , one of the key architects of the corporation 's Apple - oriented fundraising program .
Kruszewska was wearing a Greenpeace t- shirt styled after the former iPod ads , presenting Apple 's products as dangerously toxic and encouraging user donations to Greenpeace to somehow solve that issue .
After attempting to take credit for Apple 's announcements , Kruszewska questioned Jobs about Apple 's potential do more to advance Greenpeace 's political goals in announcing principles , but Jobs insisted that such “ flowery ” announcements were not really doing anything for the environment .
Jobs suggested that Greenpeace hire staff with engineering backgrounds who could understand the issues involved , and insisted that Apple does more to push innovative manufacturing techniques than other PC makers .
When Apple talks to its manufacturers , he said , they report that no other companies are pushing for similar , real changes .
He questioned the real efforts HP and Dell were making to back up their announcements .
Jobs also blasted the criteria behind Greenpeace 's highly publicized Greener Guide to Electronics , which ranks a random assortment of manufactures according to commitments listed on their websites .
Jobs said Greenpeace needed to develop rankings that reflected what companies actually do , not just what they promise to do at some point in the future .
Questions About Options Backdating .
Many of the other questions presented related to Apple 's stock options backdating issues , with one speaker dramatically presenting outraged comments about Apple 's options backdating " shenanigans . "
He pointedly asked Jobs to refund Apple for the value of stock grants Jobs was awarded in exchange for giving up the tainted options he had been issued with disputed grant dates .
Jobs replied that reports about Apple 's backdated options had not presented all the facts about a complex subject .
He explained that Apple 's board of directors had originally approved a stock option package for him , but that he was not awarded the grant until several weeks later , resulting in his options being priced higher than they had originally been approved .
He stated that he did not demand Apple make good on the original price .
Along with the options discussion was a series of comments regarding transparent employee and executive compensation reporting , along with new shareholder proposals presented by the Teamsters and the AFL - CIO .
None of the five shareholder proposals passed the tentative shareholder vote , including the union proposals and the two proposals on manufacturing issues which were withdrawn prior to voting .
i Phone and Other Future Plans .
A member of the audience questioned Jobs on Apple 's relatively low figure of reinvestment in R&D , saying that he felt the company was missing low handing fruit with new product opportunities , particularly with the delay of Leopard .
Jobs responded , “ I wish developing great products was as easy as writing a check .
If that were the case , then Microsoft would have great products . ”
Jobs also noted that his decision to delay Leopard was a difficult choice , made in part because hiring the right new people was a difficult task that took time .
He stated that simply filling seats with unqualified employees was not an option for building the kind of projects Apple has underway , but that Apple is in a position to hire pretty much anyone the company finds who is talented and ready to work .
Another commenter asked about Apple 's plans for the iPhone going forward , prompting Jobs to pull an iPhone out of his front pocket and describe the vast potential market for mobile phones .
Jobs said that compared to the music player and PC markets , the much larger mobile phone market presented a critical opportunity for the company , despite it being an entirely new venture for Apple .
Questions from RoughlyDrafted .
I asked Jobs three questions .
The first was about .
Mac :
“ With so much innovation and execution in hardware , software and in retail , what is Apple doing in online services ?
Apple is in a unique position to offer its customers personalized services , so why have we seen so little investment in this area of Apple 's business ?
Is it not something the company recognizes as a potential revenue source , or is Apple leaving it to other companies like Google to provide ? .
Mac is a pretty weak offering that has made little advancement in the last half decade . ”
Jobs acknowledged that Apple ’s .
Mac service was not a strong product but that improvements to Apple 's online services were in the works and would show up shortly , leaving the impression with me that Leopard would deliver a stronger set of services .
If that ’s the case , next month ’s WWDC may deliver new information on the issue .
I also asked about the iPhone :
" Comments from Steve Ballmer aside , I have many business clients very interested in the iPhone , and I 'm working with a large government project interested in using consumer technologies in place of the expensive and problematic custom development of mobile devices .
While Apple 's closed platform policy may make sense for consumers , does Apple recognize the needs of large , institutional buyers who are excited about the prospect of applying low cost , handheld computers with their own custom development ? "
Jobs stated that Apple is working to balance the needs of software security and deployment with demands for custom development on the iPhone .
There Is One More Thing .
I snuck in one more question :
" Will Apple be targeting developing countries with Mac OS X in the way that Microsoft is working to sell Windows Vista Starter , which is essentially Windows XP re-badged for the third world ? "
Jobs jokingly asked if I thought Apple should sell Mac OS 9 , eliciting some laughs from the audience .
“ No , ” I said , “ I think Apple could sell the developing world Tiger while selling Leopard here . ”
Jobs paused for a moment and said that could be an option .
After the meeting , I briefly talked to Apple COO Tim Cook , who pulled out his own iPhone and scrolled around on it .
This is n’t a prototype mockup ; they actually use it as their regular phone .
I 'd seen the device in its dramatic glass hyperbaric chamber at Macworld Expo , but it looks even smaller in person .
I 'm so ready to kill my Palm Treo to get one .
The SF Chronicle Goes Bananas .
Anyone actually at the meeting will find it hard to read the Ellen Lee 's report in the SF Chron , which described the laidback Jobs as “ feisty , ” and characterized his joking comments as “ fired back ” into a purportedly embittered and hostile crowd .
Lee actually managed to use “ fired ” twice in her article as a stand in for “ said . ”
It 's too bad Lee did n't seek to capture the truth in her article , rather than invent a scandalous performance of arrogant tyranny out of Jobs .
Frequently making humorous asides during the question and answer session , Jobs ’ made light of the the dollar salary he is assigned , quipping “ I get 50 cents just for showing up .
And 50 cents for my performance . ”
Lee repositioned the joke as a bitter remark “ fired back ” at the audience .
Rather than being launched into an angry mob , the comment really only drew laughs and applause , as did his comments to Greenpeace , where Jobs said , “ We 'd like to work with you to improve your measures . ”
Lee suggested that audience comments demonstrated “ a rare show of dissent . ”
Perhaps
Lee has been under a rock for the last decade , but criticism of the company is nothing new , nor is it rare .
Neither are the media exaggerations created to dramatize and vilify the company .
Shame on the Chron .

Some books are considered classics for their ability to provide us with insight into human nature .
Recently , while studying George Orwell ’s 1984 , I had the epiphany that talk radio is , in many ways , becoming a modern - day Ministry of Truth .
But I ’m probably not the only one to notice that what once was a voice for limited government and free speech has taken on a clear authoritarian tone .
In Orwell ’s novel , the Ministry of Truth was tasked with spinning the facts to make them fit the party line , and keeping the public in a mindset of never - ending war .
It was Big Brother ’s chief means of controlling the information available to the people of Oceania .
One of its handiest tools was the infamous “ two minutes hate ” broadcast daily for the purpose of whipping the people ’s emotions into frenzied hatred for the regime ’s enemies and critics and into adoration of Big Brother .
Dissent was effectively curtailed .
Much of national talk radio today serves the same purpose as Big Brother ’s Ministry of Truth by endlessly spinning coverage of the issues in a light favorable to the chosen party line .
Narrowly constructed arguments attempt to define issues with the false choices of liberal vs. conservative , Republican vs. Democrat , etc .
Airwaves bristle with constant agitation for war and the demonizing of those who are designated as enemies .
Even the “ two minutes hate ” has its place wherein those who refuse to toe the party line can expect to be labeled , denounced and berated by the ministry ’s defenders .
And , as in Orwell ’s novel , the audience screams its approval .
Talk radio was once a place where disagreement was actually encouraged in contrast to the more sedate National Public Radio programs that consisted primarily of folks sitting around politely agreeing with one another .
Disagreement provided the catalyst for wide - ranging discussions .
Though the politics of talk radio ran hard to the political right , many listeners found that it tended to stimulate independent thought .
If nothing else , it made for compelling exchanges and vigorous dialogue .
Throughout the Clinton years , talk radio was a rallying point for the political right while engaging in a boisterous and vigorous resistance to the left .
It was highly ideological , but provided a counter to the political left ’s mainstream media juggernaut .
Where the major media was more likely to embrace a collectivist viewpoint , talk radio for the most part still held to traditional beliefs in constitutional government , personal liberty , religious freedom , and strong national defense .
But the 9/11 attacks were the watershed moment from which the new voice of talk radio would emerge .
With a nominal conservative in the White House , talk radio donned a cloak of nationalism thinly disguised as patriotism and became the unwavering mouthpiece of the administration .
The same voices which once decried governmental intrusion under the Clinton administration instead became the prime defenders of exactly such policies by the current administration .
Now , as a tool to stifle dissent , talk radio is actually working to limit the debate on issues that profoundly affect all of us .
The days in which opinions could be exchanged and the truth could stand on its own merits are fading .
Perhaps it ’s still possible in some circles , but talk radio is increasingly becoming a medium where the polarization is nearly absolute .
When we ’ve reached the point where we can no longer talk to one another , we ’re setting the stage for real conflict such as we ’ve seen in the Balkans and Middle East .
Some will certainly counter that talk radio is only giving the audience what it wants .
I understand perfectly how the game is played and I ’ve successfully thrown red meat to the crowd to generate ratings and can testify that it does work .
But if it ’s just about the ratings and doing whatever it takes to create them , then let ’s at least be honest and admit that talk radio now has more in common with Jerry Springer or pro wrestling .
Though it ’s never been perfect , there was a time when talk radio provided an accessible forum in which free speech thrived .
Now it loves Big Brother .
Given the choice to inspire instead of tear down or to inform instead of propagandize , is n’t it obvious where the greater value lies ?

The Best of Bryan Hyde
I know , no one ever could have imagined that George Bush would lie about the war .
But what 's interesting is that the Pentagon seems to have had it with their commander in chief and his lies .
From AP :
The Pentagon says it has enough money to pay for the Iraq war through June , despite warnings from the White House that troops are being harmed by Congress ' failure to quickly deliver more funds .....
The Army also will delay contracts for facilities repair and environmental restoration , according to instructions issued by Army Comptroller Nelson Ford .
Ford said the accounting moves are " similar to those enacted last year " when [ the Republican ]
Congress failed to deliver a war funding bill to Bush until mid-June .
Japanese Jeans … Bringing Sexy Back
Japan has come out with yet another sexy , wild , and edgy fashion trend with these Bikini Jeans , that act as both underwear and jeans .
Sandra Tanimura , a Sanna designer , created these jeans after customers mentioned they had a hard time keeping their low cut jeans up .
“ We specialize in making low - rise trousers and our customers wanted them to get even lower .
It was very difficult meeting these demands without the trousers falling down .
I came up with the idea of using the bikini strings to let the trousers hang really low without falling , ” she added .
Below are some shots of the jeans on a popular Japanese television show :
You can purchase these Bikini Jeans from Sanna ’s Shop for about $ 88 .
Like all trends , not everyone can pull it off quite the same .

It 's been said by everyone from Cyndi Lauper to Alex Rodriguez that " money changes everything . "
Now psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis have published a paper to support that claim .
Studying delayed gratification and risk , the psychologists found that people are more likely to wait on collecting full payment for a non-consumable monetary reward than they are for any of three consumable rewards — beer , candy and soda .
Leonard Green , Ph.D. , professor of psychology , and Joel Myerson , Ph.D. , research professor of psychology , in Arts & Sciences at Washington University , along with their graduate students , Daniel D. Holt and Sara J. Estle , study the effect that delay to receipt of a reward has on the subjective value of that reward .
Their research looks at factors that affect the degree of self - control that people exercise , both the factors that increase the degree of self - control and those that increase impulsive decision - making .
More specifically , the researchers recently found that delayed monetary rewards are discounted less steeply than rewards that are directly consumable , such as soda .
For instance , if the average person were given the choice between an amount of soda right away and $ 50 worth of soda that they would have to wait six months to get , most people would take significantly less than $ 50 worth of soda now ( discounting the value of the delayed soda considerably ) .
advertisement
In contrast , the person given a choice between an amount of money right now and $ 50 in six months would not discount the delayed money nearly as much as the soda .
Their paper reporting this research was published in the January 2007 edition of Psychological Science .
The work has far - reaching implications for many fields , including marketing , economics and the psychology of self - control .
Green and Myerson found that delayed money was discounted less steeply than beer , candy and soda , which were all discounted at approximately the same rate .
Additionally , smaller delayed rewards of all types were discounted more steeply than corresponding larger amounts of rewards .
Interestingly , if the rewards are probabilistic , meaning that there is only a chance that one will get the reward ( say , a 50 percent chance ) , then there is no difference in the rates at which money , candy , soda and beer are discounted .
' Money retains its utility '
Green and Myerson 's results suggest that although previous researchers have claimed that abused substances , such as alcohol , have an inherent quality that makes them steeply discounted , abused substances may be discounted at the same rate as other directly consumables , such as candy and soda , at least by people without substance - abuse problems .
advertisement
So what makes money different from directly consumable goods ?
" Money retains its utility , despite the inconstancy of desire , " says Green .
" Money can be exchanged for almost any other reward that one might want , but the desire for beer , candy or soda is dependent upon a number of factors that vary over time — hunger , thirst , etc . "
Thus , the average person exercises more self - control in waiting for a monetary reward because money is always useful , while we have " inconstant desire " for things like beer , candy and soda .
On the other hand , when the rewards are probabilistic , there is a chance that one might not get the money , beer , soda or candy .
In this case , the average person discounts all the types of reward at the same rate .
So although probabilistic and delayed rewards may seem to be similar as far as " risk " — after all , you risk not getting the reward if there is a delay , and if there is some probability that you 'll get it , then there also is some probability that you wo n't — the way people think about their choices is different , depending on whether the outcomes are monetary or directly consumable rewards , as well as whether the outcomes are delayed or probabilistic .
If left to our own devices ...
Myerson says that findings from their research on discounting and self - control can be readily applied to savings and investments .
Think of an employer - sponsored 401k retirement plan .
Allowing automatic payroll deductions on a monthly basis would suggest that a participant " intuitively understands discounting , " says Myerson .
If left to our own devices , he said , many of us would spend all of the money each month , and not exercise the self - control it takes to invest it ourselves .
Thus , we commit to a monthly payroll withdrawal because we intuitively understand our tendency to discount .
We know that we are likely to take a smaller , immediate reward rather than wait for the larger , long - term reward that comes from saving for retirement .
The researchers ' work helps in understanding the factors that influence choices involving certificates of deposit , retirement plans , health - club annual memberships , Social Security , automatic investments and so on , and also helps in the identification of weaknesses in people 's decision - making processes .
The researchers suggest that such understanding may enable people to make better choices — those that lead to greater benefits in the long run .
The largest predators to ever stride the earth — T. rex and its kin— often left indelible footprints with their massive steps , and some of their tracks are still evident millions of years after the dinosaurs perished .
In most cases , dinosaur footprints are less than ideally preserved , and many times are barely recognizable as tracks .
Now a field guide of sorts amassing research on how such footprints can get eroded could help identify these tracks , no matter their state .
This could help reveal details about dinosaur anatomy and locomotion otherwise lost to history .
" Commonly it 's hikers that bring these tracks to the attention of scientists , " said University of Nebraska geologist David Loope .
" This work could help people find more tracks than they might find otherwise , a lot of subtle , poorly preserved tracks that you might have walked over . "
Milàn and Loope detailed their footprint findings in the May issue of the Journal of Geology .
Utah theropods Tyrannosaurus rex and its kin were a kind of dinosaur known as theropods , or " beast - footed . "
Footprints of theropods are especially impressively preserved at the Twentymile Wash Dinosaur Tracksite at Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah .
There , therapods strode across soft sand , more than 160 million years ago in middle of the Jurassic , in what were windswept dunes .
Loope and University of Copenhagen paleontologist Jesper Milàn analyzed theropod footprints at the Utah site .
Dinosaur footprints may still exist as true tracks — that is , the original prints left in the sand by these " terrible lizards , " filled in later with darker sediment .
True tracks preserve many of the anatomical details of the foot , such as number of digits and impressions of claws .
Often tracks get worn away .
Still , erosion can expose the underlying layers of sand that got ruptured when the dinosaurs took a step .
Such " undertracks " extend to considerable depths below and around actual tracks , radiating out in concentric circles .
Undertracks can appear quite different from one another depending on how much erosion they experienced and what type of surface they were originally printed in , making them potentially hard to identify .
Broader implications Milàn and Loope 's guide also features details on a range of theropod undertracks , showing how researchers have to , for instance , account for whether the step was taken on a sloping or flat surface , or whether it was taken during the wet or dry season .
This work should also shed light on footprints made by other ancient creatures , they said .
" This work will help us understand more about the trackmakers and their tracks , " said Brent Breithaupt , curator and director of the University of Wyoming 's Geological Museum in Laramie , who also studies dinosaur tracks .
" It 's just the tip of the iceberg concerning the story of dinosaur tracks at this specific , particularly impressive site . "
Loope added that finding these poorly preserved tracks could help reveal places dinosaurs traveled , " shedding light on what kinds of ecosystems they were part of . "

If you ’ve always dreamed of being the next Hemingway or Vonnegut ( or even Grisham ) , or perhaps if you just want to write better essays for school or posts for your blog … you need to sharpen those writing skills .
Becoming the best writer you can be is n’t easy , I wo n’t lie to you .
It takes hard work .
But it ’s worth the effort .
And if it seems like an insurmountable task , there are some concrete things you can do today that will get you on the road to improvement .
Personally , I ’ve been a fiction , newspaper , magazine and blog writer for 17 years now , writing for a variety of publications … and I ’m still trying to improve .
Every writer can get better , and no writer is perfect .
I think I ’ve grown tremendously as a writer over the last couple of decades , but it has been a painful journey .
Let me share some of what I ’ve learned .
Advertising
No matter what level of writer you are , there should be a suggestion or twelve here that will help .
1. Read great writers .
This may sound obvious , but it has to be said .
This is the place to start .
If you do n’t read great writing , you wo n’t know how to do it .
Everyone starts by learning from the masters , by emulating them , and then through them , you find your own voice .
Read a lot .
As much as possible .
Pay close attention to style and mechanics in addition to content .
2. Write a lot .
Try to write every day , or multiple times a day if possible .
The more you write , the better you ’ll get .
Writing is a skill , and like any other skill , you have to practice it to get better .
Write stuff for yourself , write for a blog , write for other publications .
Write just to write , and have a blast doing it .
It gets easier after awhile if you practice a lot .
3 . Write down ideas , all the time .
Keep a little notebook handy ( Nabokov carried around index cards ) and write down ideas for stories or articles or novels or characters .
Write down snippets of conversation that you hear .
Write down plot twists and visual details and fragments of song lyrics or poems that move you .
Having these ideas written down helps , because they can inspire you or actually go directly into your writing .
I like to keep a list of post ideas for my blog , and I continually add to it .
4. Create a writing ritual .
Find a certain time of day when you can write without interruptions , and make it a routine .
For me , mornings work best , but others might find lunch or evenings or midnight hours the best .
Whatever works for you , make it a must - do thing every single day .
Write for at least 30 minutes , but an hour is even better .
If you ’re a full - time writer , you ’ll need to write for several hours a day , as I do .
But do n’t worry !
It helps you get better .
Advertising
5 . Just write .
If you ’ve got blank paper or a blank screen staring at you , it can be intimidating .
You might be tempted to go check your email or get a snack .
Well , do n’t even think about it , mister .
Just start writing .
Start typing away — it does n’t matter what you write — and get the fingers moving .
Once you get going , you get in the flow of things , and it gets easier .
I like to start out by typing things like my name or a headline or something easy like that , and then the juices start flowing and stuff just pours out of me .
But the key is to just get going .
6. Eliminate distractions .
Writing does not work well with multi-tasking or background noise .
It ’s best done in quiet , or with some mellow music playing .
Do your writing with a minimal writer like WriteRoom or DarkRoom or Writer , and do it in full - screen .
Turn off email or IM notifications , turn off the phone and your cell phone , turn off the TV , and clear off your desk … you can stuff everything in a drawer for now until you have time to sort everything out later … but do n’t get into sorting mode now , because it ’s writing time !
Clear away distractions so you can work without interruption .
7. Plan , then write .
This may sound contradictory to the above “ just write ” tip , but it ’s not really .
I find it useful to do my planning or pre-writing thinking before I sit down to write .
I ’ll think about it during my daily run , or walk around for a bit to brainstorm , then write things down and do an outline if necessary .
Then , when I ’m ready , I can sit down and just crank out the text .
The thinking ’s already been done .
For a great method for planning out a novel , see the Snowflake Method .
8. Experiment .
Just because you want to emulate the great writers does n’t mean you have to be exactly like them .
Try out new things .
Steal bits from other people .
Experiment with your style , your voice , your mechanics , your themes .
Try out new words .
Invent new words .
Experimentalize everything .
And see what works , and toss out what does n’t .

9. Revise .
If you really crank out the text , and experiment , and just let things flow , you ’ll need to go back over it .
Yes , that means you .
Many writers hate revising , because it seems like so much work when they ’ve already done the writing .
But if you want to be a good writer , you need to learn to revise .
Because revision is where good writing really is .
It separates the mediocre from the great .
Go back over everything , looking not only for grammar and spelling mistakes , but for unnecessary words and awkward structures and confusing sentences .
Aim for clarity , for strength , for freshness .
10 . Be concise .
This is best done during the revision process , but you need to edit every sentence and paragraph and remove everything but the essential .
A short sentence is preferred over a longer one , and a clear word is preferred over two in jargonese .
Compact is powerful .
11 . Use powerful sentences .
Aim for shorter sentences with strong verbs .
Of course , not every sentence should be the same — you need variation — but try to create sentences with oomph .
You might find this easier to do in the revision stage , as it might not be something you ’re thinking about when you ’re pumping out that first draft .
12 . Get feedback .
You ca n’t get better in a vacuum .
Get someone to read over your stuff — preferably a good writer or editor .
Someone who reads a lot , and can give you honest and intelligent feedback .
And then listen .
Really try to understand the criticism and accept it and use it to improve .
Instead of being hurt , thank your editor for helping you get better .

13 . Put yourself out there .
At some point , you ’ll need to let others read your writing .
Not just the person who you ’re allowing to read it , but the general public .
You ’ll need to publish your book or short story or poem , or write for a publication .
If you ’re already doing a blog , that ’s good , but if no one reads it , then you need to find a bigger blog and try to submit a guest post .
Putting your writing out in the public can be nerve - wracking , but it is a crucial ( if painful ) part of every writer ’s growth .
Just do it .
14 . Learn to be conversational .
Many people write too stiffly .
I find that it ’s so much better to write like you talk ( without all the umms and uhhs ) .
People relate to it better .
It ’s not an easy task at first , but it ’s something to strive for .
And that brings up another point — it ’s better to break the rules of grammar in order to sound conversational ( as I did in the last sentence ) than to sound stilted just so you can follow the proper rules .
But do n’t break the rules of grammar without good reason — know that you ’re doing it , and why .
15 . Start and end strong .
The most important parts of your writing are the beginning and end .
Especially the beginning .
If you do n’t hook your reader in the beginning , they wo n’t read the rest of your writing .
So when you ’ve written your first draft , spend some extra time crafting a good beginning .
Get them interested and wanting to know more .
And when you ’re done with that , write a good ending … that will leave them wanting more of your writing .

He has a book to sell too , but I ’ve heard that the email course is enough to get you started .
AdSense – Generate revenue by placing Google contextual ads on your website or blog .
Pays per click .
Again , there are many sources of guidance for how best to use Adsense .
Here is Google ’s online webinar .
And here are a few more guides : The Ultimate Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Effective Adsense Link Units … ( Dosh , Dosh ) , and Ultimate Adsense Guide – Video : Google AdSense Secrets ( Joel Comm ) .
Big Brother ?
I ’d like to address the concern about privacy .
Google must abide by all the same privacy laws that any online provider must follow .
If you use email or if you process transactions online , then you are putting a certain amount of trust in the vendors who provide those services .
If you do n’t trust Google , then you probably should n’t trust any vendor , and probably should n’t transact any business online .
This is how I personally look at it : so much of our information is already out there in cyberspace and even in analog form , that this is something I ’m not going to worry about unless I need to .
This is how I look at it personally .
I respect that others may have different feelings .
If you have thoughts on this , please feel free to share them .

Sometimes it really is déjà vu all over again .
Those who have hoped for a peaceful resolution of the outstanding issues between the United States and Iran must have been discouraged to watch the June 5 Republican presidential candidates ’ debate .
With the honorable exception of Ron Paul , the Republicans lined up firmly in support of a policy to stop Iran ’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon using whatever means are necessary to do so , including the American nuclear arsenal .
All except Paul derided Iran as the main source of terrorism in the world .
Rudy Giuliani repeated the now familiar “ you should n’t take any options off the table ” when asked about the possible use of nuclear weapons against Iran and stated that he even opposes Iran ’s acquisition of “ nuclear power . ”
Duncan Hunter said flatly that he “ would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons ” against Iran .
The top Republican candidates united in their view that the Democrats would be soft on the issue of Iran , a charge that lacks validity as the leading Democratic candidates for president are as bellicose as the Republicans when it comes to Tehran ’s ambitions .
And the media is doing its bit to help the cause , just like in the lead - up to Iraq , this time by completely ignoring the issue .
The New York Times ‘ coverage of the debate did not even mention Iran , stressing instead disagreements on immigration policy .
The Washington Post also was silent , as if the general agreement by presidential candidates to use nuclear weapons to bomb a sovereign nation that has not attacked the United States is not newsworthy .
It is arguable that the candidates are just polishing up their pro-Israel credentials and are not to be taken seriously when they speak about Iran , a subject on which they appear to know little or nothing .
But is also possible that momentum is building that will lead to a war willy - nilly , whether or not it is in the national interest and whether or not anyone genuinely wants it .
Iran ’s alleged support of terrorism refers to its links to Hamas and Hezbollah , groups operating against the Israeli occupation of Palestine and parts of Lebanon and not against the United States , a refinement that appears to exceed the grasp of America ’s political elite .
Sam Brownback specifically insisted that “ we have to stand with our allies like Israel , ” revealing that he considers Israel ’s security paramount .
Several candidates referred to the Iranians killing American soldiers , an allegation that has been around for some months and is clearly becoming the focal point for efforts to create a consensus that Iran must be stopped , no matter the costs or consequences .
The rhetoric is particularly significant in that it parallels recent developments in Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office , where hope springs eternal that Iran will be nuked before the sun sets on the Bush administration .
Cheney is reportedly very interested in obtaining definitive evidence confirming that Iran is arming the Taliban against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , and it appears that he has been sending his staffers to get the goods by attending the weekly Afghanistan Interagency Operating Group .
On one level , if the Iranians were assisting the Iraqi Shi’ite militias with which they have had long - standing relations , it should not come as a great surprise .
The United States armed militias against the Russians in Afghanistan and against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua , setting the precedent for such activity .
Iran is confronted by 160,000 U.S. soldiers across the border in Iraq and two carrier groups in the Persian Gulf .
It has been hearing mostly threats from Democrats , Republicans , and the White House .
Nonetheless , the case that Iran is arming insurgents with sophisticated weapons able to destroy any of the armored vehicles in the U.S. arsenal is tenuous at best .
The evidence for the existence of so - called enhanced improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) in Iraq consists of reports that go back more than two years .
The first reports stated that there was a new type of sophisticated IED being used in Iraq .
By one account , the new IEDs appeared to be the product of a weapons factory because they were all machined in the same way , while in another version the IEDs had some parts of Iranian origin , though how that was determined is unclear .
It was further claimed that some of these weapons were intercepted on the border between Iraq and Iran .
Variations on the story indicated either that Iranian “ experts ” were helping the Iraqis build IEDs that were more effective or that Iran was training Shi’ite militiamen in their use .
More recently , it has been alleged that Iran is even supplying the highly effective ordnance to its traditional enemies , including Sunni insurgents and al - Qaeda .
One thing that all the stories about Iranian involvement have in common is their lack of substantiating detail .
There are no names , dates , places , or corroborating information , and most rely on anonymous government sources or bald assertions that are presented as fact .
Photos of alleged captured ordnance have been unconvincing .
Further , the presence of the weapons , even if true , cannot be traced back to any official Iranian government body or policy through documentary or other evidence .
In March 2006 , Gen . Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , conceded that there was no evidence to back up the claims of direct Iranian involvement in the development of the more effective IEDs , referred to as explosively formed projectiles ( EFPs ) .
The United Kingdom media has reported that the EFP is , in fact , a British design that was inadvertently given to the IRA in a sting operation that went horribly wrong in Northern Ireland in the early 1990s .
It is not an Iranian innovation or something that is unique to Tehran ’s arsenal .
A widely advertised Pentagon briefing in Baghdad in February 2007 was supposed to provide stacks of documents and examples of hardware that would make the case for Iranian involvement .
The press conference turned out to be a bust , with little more than fragments of ordnance actually on display .
When questioned , a senior Defense Department analyst admitted that there was no “ smoking gun . ”
Other sources familiar with the weapons themselves and with Asian weapons markets in general have noted that Iraqis hardly need instruction or assistance in constructing the IEDs and EFPs , as they have become the real experts in their design and deployment .
The Iraqi army of Saddam Hussein had many specialists in ordnance design working in its armories , most of whom have been unemployed since 2003 .
The sources also note that Iraq is well supplied with all the artillery shells and bombs it could possibly need to construct huge and highly sophisticated roadside weapons , all accomplished without any need for Iranian assistance .
One British Defense Ministry source estimates that the Iraqis have enough high explosives on hand to continue IED attacks at the current level for the next 274 years .
When Iranian - origin weapons do show up , many can be traced to illegal and quasi-legal arms markets that exist throughout central Asia .
More recently , there are claims that Iranian - produced IEDs and EFPs are appearing in Afghanistan .
The first alleged Iranian EFP , discovered this past spring by a British unit fighting as part of the NATO force in southern Afghanistan , was found among a shipment of weapons that was presumed to be going to the Taliban .
The British initially were hesitant about passing the information to the United States because of serious concerns that Cheney would use the new intelligence as a pretext to start a bombing campaign against Iran .
In April 2007 Gen. Peter Pace said that other Iranian - made weapons had been captured at Taliban bases in Kandahar and along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The claim was then reiterated by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher , and White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino .
Defense experts in Europe who monitor weapons sales and arms smuggling dispute the claim , however , noting that the Iranians have a particular antipathy for the Taliban .
The Taliban executed eight Iranian diplomats in Mazar - i- Sharif in 1997 and have declared Shi’ite Islam to be a heresy .
Iran undoubtedly is working to cultivate its ties with Afghanistan ’s Shi’ite minority the Hazars , who live close to the border between the two countries , but there is no love lost between Tehran and the Taliban .
As for the weapons themselves , Afghanistan is awash with arms that were manufactured by Iran , Russia , the United States , and China .
Many of the weapons are leftovers from the years of Russian domination , while the newer equipment derives from the civil war that followed in which the Taliban fought the Northern Alliance .
The Iranians provided the Northern Alliance with weapons , as did the United States and Russia .
One journalist source describes the Pace allegations as a “ war of words with little relationship to reality . ”
Another diplomatic source speculated that the statements appear to be part of a coordinated effort to demonize Iran , possibly to prepare the American public and world opinion for a military strike later this year .

We learned the news in March : Contrary to decades of denials , the U.S. Census Bureau used individual records to round up Japanese - Americans during World War II .
The Census Bureau normally is prohibited by law from revealing data that could be linked to specific individuals ; the law exists to encourage people to answer census questions accurately and without fear .
And while the Second War Powers
Act of 1942 temporarily suspended that protection in order to locate Japanese - Americans , the Census Bureau had maintained that it only provided general information about neighborhoods .
New research proves they were lying .
The whole incident serves as a poignant illustration of one of the thorniest problems of the information age : data collected for one purpose and then used for another , or " data reuse . "
When we think about our personal data , what bothers us most is generally not the initial collection and use , but the secondary uses .
I personally appreciate it when Amazon.com suggests books that might interest me , based on books I have already bought .
I like it that my airline knows what type of seat and meal I prefer , and my hotel chain keeps records of my room preferences .
I do n't mind that my automatic road - toll collection tag is tied to my credit card , and that I get billed automatically .
I even like the detailed summary of my purchases that my credit card company sends me at the end of every year .
What I do n't want , though , is any of these companies selling that data to brokers , or for law enforcement to be allowed to paw through those records without a warrant .
There are two bothersome issues about data reuse .
First , we lose control of our data .
In all of the examples above , there is an implied agreement between the data collector and me :
It gets the data in order to provide me with some sort of service .
Once the data collector sells it to a broker , though , it 's out of my hands .
It might show up on some telemarketer 's screen , or in a detailed report to a potential employer , or as part of a data - mining system to evaluate my personal terrorism risk .
It becomes part of my data shadow , which always follows me around but I can never see .
This , of course , affects our willingness to give up personal data in the first place .
The reason U.S. census data was declared off - limits for other uses was to placate Americans ' fears and assure them that they could answer questions truthfully .
How accurate would you be in filling out your census forms if you knew the FBI would be mining the data , looking for terrorists ?
How would it affect your supermarket purchases if you knew people were examining them and making judgments about your lifestyle ?
I know many people who engage in data poisoning : deliberately lying on forms in order to propagate erroneous data .
I 'm sure many of them would stop that practice if they could be sure that the data was only used for the purpose for which it was collected .
The second issue about data reuse is error rates .
All data has errors , and different uses can tolerate different amounts of error .
The sorts of marketing databases you can buy on the web , for example , are notoriously error - filled .
That 's OK ; if the database of ultra-affluent Americans of a particular ethnicity you just bought has a 10 percent error rate , you can factor that cost into your marketing campaign .
But that same database , with that same error rate , might be useless for law enforcement purposes .
Understanding error rates and how they propagate is vital when evaluating any system that reuses data , especially for law enforcement purposes .
A few years ago , the Transportation Security Administration 's follow - on watch list system , Secure Flight , was going to use commercial data to give people a terrorism risk score and determine how much they were going to be questioned or searched at the airport .
People rightly rebelled against the thought of being judged in secret , but there was much less discussion about whether the commercial data from credit bureaus was accurate enough for this application .
An even more egregious example of error -rate problems occurred in 2000 , when the Florida Division of Elections contracted with Database Technologies ( since merged with ChoicePoint ) to remove convicted felons from the voting rolls .
The databases used were filled with errors and the matching procedures were sloppy , which resulted in thousands of disenfranchised voters – mostly black – and almost certainly changed a presidential election result .
Of course , there are beneficial uses of secondary data .
Take , for example , personal medical data .
It 's personal and intimate , yet valuable to society in aggregate .
Think of what we could do with a database of everyone 's health information : massive studies examining the long - term effects of different drugs and treatment options , different environmental factors , different lifestyle choices .
There 's an enormous amount of important research potential hidden in that data , and it 's worth figuring out how to get at it without compromising individual privacy .
This is largely a matter of legislation .
Technology alone can never protect our rights .
There are just too many reasons not to trust it , and too many ways to subvert it .
Data privacy ultimately stems from our laws , and strong legal protections are fundamental to protecting our information against abuse .
But at the same time , technology is still vital .
Both the Japanese internment and the Florida voting - roll purge demonstrate that laws can change ... and sometimes change quickly .
We need to build systems with privacy - enhancing technologies that limit data collection wherever possible .
Data that is never collected can not be reused .
Data that is collected anonymously , or deleted immediately after it is used , is much harder to reuse .
It 's easy to build systems that collect data on everything – it's what computers naturally do – but it's far better to take the time to understand what data is needed and why , and only collect that .
History will record what we , here in the early decades of the information age , did to foster freedom , liberty and democracy .
Did we build information technologies that protected people 's freedoms even during times when society tried to subvert them ?
Or did we build technologies that could easily be modified to watch and control ?
It 's bad civic hygiene to build an infrastructure that can be used to facilitate a police state .
