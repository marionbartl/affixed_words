Code == Data : The Basics
There have been a lot of blog entries lately about code versus data : which is more valuable , are they the same , or maybe different , and so on .
Most recently , here .
That blog entry argues that code is data , and points out Turing ’s work on universal Turing machines as an example .
The dual argument , that data is code , can be attributed to Church , thereby completing the pair of early computer science figureheads .
This wo n’t be new to most advanced computer science students , but I was unable to find a single place where it ’s written down .
To start , two special cases will be helpful .
I will be assuming that the reader knows the basic evaluation rules of lambda calculus .
The technique here will be the same : use an appropriate function to represent data .
Special Case 1 : Finite Enumerated Types
Suppose I want to write lambda calculus expressions to represent the four cardinal directions ( north , south , east , and west ) , and left and right turns .
Here ’s what I ’m shooting for , in Haskell .
data Dir = East | West | North | South left East = North left West = South left North = West left South = East right East = South right West = North right North = East right South = West
To do this in lambda calculus , I need four “ data ” values , and as promised they will be defined as functions .
East := λabcd .a
West := λabcd .b
North := λabcd .c
South := λabcd.d
( Note that I ’m using := to denote definition of short - hand names ; it is not , of course , part of the lambda calculus itself .
In particular , you have the right to complain loudly if I try to give circular definitions ; there is no such thing as direct general recursion . )
These are functions that take four parameters and return , respectively , the first , second , third , and fourth ones .
Now defining functions case - wise on these values is trivial :
left := λd.d ( North ) ( South ) ( West ) ( East ) right := λd.d ( South ) ( North ) ( East ) ( West )
Now the left function take a parameter d , which is itself a function , and operates by calling that function and passing it four arguments .
Now if the function happens to be East , then it will return its first result , thereby correctly concluding that north is a left turn from east .
Special Case 2 : Church Numerals
A slightly more involved data type is natural numbers .
Alonzo Church defined natural numbers in terms of Church numerals .
The idea is that a natural number n is a function which iterates another function n times on some initial value .
For example , using the functions above , we can say that :
0 left North = North 1 left North = West 2 left North = South 3 left North = East 4 left North = North
So the first few natural numbers are :
0 := λfx.x 1 := λ fx.fx 2 := λfx.f( fx ) 3 := λfx.f( f( fx ) ) 4 := λfx.f( f( f( fx ) ) )
And here are a few operations on these natural numbers .
It can take some hard work with a pencil and paper to see why some of them work .
inc := λp.( λfx.f( pfx ) ) add := λ pq.(λfx.pf( qfx ) ) mul := λpq.(λfx.p( qf ) x )
General Case : Algebraic Data Types
Algebraic data types are a general approach to defining data types in a programming language .
A type may have several different forms , each of which may have several fields .
Another way of saying this is that an ADT is a sum of products of other types .
Here ’s an example in Haskell :
data Discount = FixedAmount Double | Percent Double | Rebate Date Double
In other words , a discount is either a fixed amount of money at purchase , or a percent off the purchase price , or a rebate of some amount that happens at some future date .
Another example :
data Tree = Leaf Char | Branch Tree Tree
So a tree is either a leaf , or a branch node whose left and right children are trees in their own right .
Both of the special cases above are also algebraic data types .
Directions have four forms , each of which is an empty product :
data Dir = East | West | North | South
Church numerals implement natural numbers defined as :
data Nat = Succ Nat | Zero
As you may guess , we ’re going to write functions to represent any kind of data of any algebraic data type as a function in the lambda calculus .
The idea will be this : we will ask the person using the data to write a handler for each form that the data may take .
Then they ’ll give us all of these handler functions , and we ’ll use the one that applies .
So a value of some algebraic data type will be a function that takes a bunch of handlers , and produces the result of one of them .
Examples follow :
For the Discount data type , the value FixedAmount $ 2.75 looks like this :
FixedAmount $ 2.75 := λfpr . f ( $ 2.75 )
In other words , this is a function that takes three handlers f , p , and r ( one for fixed amounts , one for percentages , and another for rebates ) .
It then calls the first handler , passing it the amount of the fixed discount .
To calculate the amount of money to hand someone as they are buying an item at a price p with a discount d , one may write :
d ( λa.a ) ( λp. ( p*a ) ) ( λda.0 )
The first handler says that if the discount is for a constant amount , you give back that amount .
The second says that if the discount is for some percent , you multiply it by the price and give that back .
The third handler says that if the discount is a rebate to be filled later , you do n’t give them anything right now .
This is all done by calling the data as a function .
To use a Church numeral , you pass it two handlers .
The first says what you want back if it ’s the successor of another number .
The next handler says what to do if it ’s zero .
Using this , we can write a slightly wordier version of the inc function from before :
inc := λp.p ( λfx.f( pfx ) ) ( λfx.fx )
The second handler is just a value , since there are no fields in that case .
So there you have it , not only is code a type of data ( Turing ’s approach ) , but also data is a type of code ( Church ’s approach ) .
Coming in July , the sequel to the 1983 hit War Games .
But do n't look for War Games : The Dead Code at your local multiplex .
In fact , judging from this trailer , you 're better off not looking for it at all .
But if you have an insatiable craving for scary AIs with funny acronyms ( R.I.P.L.E.Y is the new W.O.P.R ) , ominous ticking countdown timers and lines like " I want to hack Ripley 's game - bot network , " add this sucker to your Netflix queue today .

BEIJING , April 7 , 2008  --
When pro-Tibet activists disrupted the Olympic torch relay in London , television viewers in China might be forgiven for thinking everything was going well in the British capital thousands of miles away .
The London relay was not broadcast live on Chinese TV and the widely watched evening newscast did not mention the protests that night .
Those who had access to CNN International and BBC World Service — mainly foreigners staying in select hotels and residential compounds and a growing number of Chinese homes equipped with satellite dishes — got their first indication of the protests when their cable TV signals were interrupted several times during the broadcast , particularly when the activists got in the way of the torch - bearer .
Perhaps it was because it happened on a Sunday evening in China when people , including officials , were enjoying a slow weekend .
At any event , the state of blissful ignorance for ordinary Chinese viewers lasted for about seven hours .
The first indication of official anger finally came in a dispatch from the official Xinhua news agency after midnight .
A report described how London police foiled an attempt to grab the Olympic torch and a statement from a Beijing Olympic official strongly criticized the activists for attempting to " sabotage " the Olympic torch relay and " defying " the Olympic spirit .
The stage was now set for explaining the protests to the Chinese public .
The Monday editions of Chinese newspapers all carried the same Xinhua report and the statement from the Beijing Olympic official , although these items were downplayed in comparison to longer reports about the Olympic torch 's " warm reception in cold London , " as the China Daily put it in its headline .
State TV newscasts on Monday began to show the video of the pro-Tibet protests in London , using the same video distributed by international news agencies but with a Chinese spin .
Chinese viewers saw what other international viewers saw the night before : an activist trying to grab the torch from a young female torch - bearer , another activist being subdued by British police after he tried to put out the torch 's flame with a fire extinguisher , and other activists being pinned down by the police after they tried to approach the torch - bearer .
" A small number of ' pro - Tibet independence activists ' tried to sabotage the torch relay in London , " the voiceover said on state TV , " but many spectators voiced disapproval of these attempts to mix politics with sports . "
These disruptive acts " were no deterrent to thousands of Londoners , and a large number of Chinese working and studying here , who packed the streets and cheered the torch on its way around the city , " another state media report said .
By the time of Monday 's early evening newscast in China , the Olympic torch relay in Paris had already started and the international cable news channels were reporting the protests live from the French capital .
But Chinese TV did not carry the live broadcast and the evening newscast led with a report on new government incentives for Chinese farmers .
In the middle of the 30 - minute newscast came the report from Paris , about the arrival of the Olympic flame the night before and no mention of the brewing protests around the city .
This time , Chinese authorities displayed a quicker reaction time .
Before midnight , state TV newscasts were carrying reports about the protests in Paris , blaming these on " a small number of pro-Tibet independence activists " who once more tried to " sabotage the Olympic torch 's journey of peace and harmony . "
Chinese TV may not yet be ready for live and timely news reports on sensitive issues , but it now seems prepared to report on pro-Tibet protests and other anti-China demonstrations during this global Olympic torch relay — with a dose of its own spin .

Just a few days after I reported that Salesforce had approached Oracle to gauge interest in a buyout at $ 75 per share , Marc Benioff , CEO of Salesforce visited Cisco Systems .
A senior source close to Cisco , said that Mr Benioff was summoned as a direct result of my post .
One of his meetings was with executives of Webex , a software as a service ( SAAS ) company acquired by Cisco last year for $ 3.2 bn in cash .
Foremski's
Take :
What does this mean ?
It could mean that Cisco had exploratory talks with Mr Benioff about Saleforce.com being for sale .
Cisco 's acquisitions such as Webex , have pushed it towards the SAAS market as it seeks new growth areas related to its network business .
An acquisition of Salesforce.com [ CRM ] would vault Cisco into the middle of the SAAS market as a major player .
Other companies that would likely be interested in Salesforce are IBM , Microsoft , Hewlett - Packard , and SAP .
Google might also interested in Salesforce because its footprint in the enterprise IT sector is very small .
A Salesforce acquisition would provide it with a well recognized brand in IT markets .
And Google 's computing platform could be used to scale Salesforce 's applications and improve perceptions of reliability .
Scaling has been an issue for potential customers of Salesforce .
Google has shown its computing platform can scale rapidly by tens of millions of users .
Cisco does n't understand the enterprise software market , at least yet .
It would be difficult for it to leverage Salesforce .
Microsoft is distracted by its takeover of Yahoo .
SAP is too slow moving and has yet to demonstrate a viable SAAS strategy .
HP really gets SAAS .
It 's top strategist Shane Robison recently described a strategy in which HP sees every aspect of its future business through services :

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2bFUkocthY
IBM has been determined to stay out of the IT applications business since the late 1990s and has avoided acquiring any IT apps companies .
But Salesforce could be seen as a type of " middleware " play with its application platform strategy .
I think Salesforce is more compatible with the Oracle culture .
And that Mr Benioff 's ambitions would be far better fulfilled as an eventual replacement for Larry Ellison , the 63 year old CEO of Oracle , who is nearing retirement .
Please see : Is Salesforce Worth $ 75 / Share To Oracle ?
I 'm hearing from a reliable source that Salesforce.com has approached Oracle to gauge if there is any interest in a sale at $ 75 a share .
That would be almost a 50 per cent premium over Friday 's close of $ 50.87 .
The deal would make sense :
- It would provide Oracle with a strong brand in online apps and a strong transition road map to cloud computing and a software as a service business model .
- Salesforce would benefit from Oracle 's dominant position in enterprise IT markets , which would help in convincing corporations that Salesforce is a scalable and viable enterprise solution .

March 24 , 2008  --
Concern over sex education is alive and well in the nation 's capital .
The political and ethical debate over what to teach teenagers about sex is being reinvigorated after a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) revealed that one in four teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease .
Now some say the study , the first of its kind , reveals why it 's so important to teach teens not to have sex at all ; others argue that the study proves that federally funded abstinence - only education is n't working .
Stoking the fire , a study published in the April edition of the Journal of Adolescent Health found that those who received comprehensive sex education were 50 percent less likely to become pregnant than those who received abstinence - only education .
The study also found that those who received comprehensive sex education were 60 percent less likely to become pregnant than those who received no sex education at all .
" I do think that there 's strong evidence that comprehensive sex education is more effective at preventing teen pregnancies , " said Pamela Kohler , lead author of the study and program manager at the University of Washington 's Center for AIDS and STD .
" I think we pretty much debunked the myth that comprehensive sex education causes teenagers to have sex . "
In Washington , D.C. , however , the debate continues to be politicized .
On March 20 , 76 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the House panel that considers federal funding levels , arguing that the government 's abstinence - only education program should be eliminated .
The majority of government money for abstinence - only education comes from a program established in 2001 under President George W. Bush .
Money for that program , which is given directly to state and local groups , has increased from $ 20 million to $ 113 million per year .
A smaller pool of money that is divvied out to states to promote abstinence - only education was created under President Bill Clinton in 1996 .
Seventeen states have started refusing that money , some citing the lack of evidence that abstinence programs work .
But the Family Research Council said the CDC study illustrates why abstinence education is crucial .
" The risk - avoidance or sexual abstinence - until - marriage strategy must be adopted to reverse the STD epidemic , " said Moira Gaul , the Family Research Council 's director of women 's and reproductive health , in a statement .
" Abstinence education is increasingly providing an efficacious and holistic approach to protect our young people 's current and future health , " she said .
But the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , Cecile Richards , said " this abstinence - only education has really silenced teachers and has left kids completely in the dark . "
Beyond the Beltway , medical professionals such as Dr. Kristine Zanotti , a gynecologic oncology physician at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland , said the information teens receive is extremely varied .
" Some of them are remarkably well - informed , but some of them are n't , " Zanotti said .
" Until there are resources put towards comprehensive programs , much of this care is kind of piecemeal . "
This article was originally published in 2008 , but has been updated several times now to keep track with our advancing knowledge of the cosmos !
My six - year old daughter is a question - asking machine .
We were driving home from school a couple of days ago , and she was grilling me about the nature of the Universe .
One of her zingers was , “ What ’s the Biggest Star in the Universe ” ?
I had an easy answer .
“ The Universe is a big place , ” I said , “ and there ’s no way we can possibly know what the biggest star is ” .
But that ’s not a real answer .
So she refined the question .
“ What ’s the biggest star that we know of ? ”
Of course , I was stuck in the car , and without access to the Internet .
But once I got back home , and was able to do some research , I learned the answer and thought I ’d share it with the rest of you But to answer it fully , some basic background information needs to be covered first .
Ready ?
Solar Radius and Mass :
When talking about the size of stars , it ’s important to first take a look at our own Sun for a sense of scale .
Our familiar star is a mighty 1.4 million km across ( 870,000 miles ) .
That ’s such a huge number that it ’s hard to get a sense of scale .
Speaking of which , the Sun also accounts for 99.9 % of all the matter in our Solar System .
In fact , you could fit one million planet Earths inside the Sun .
Using these values , astronomers have created the terms “ solar radius ” and “ solar mass ” , which they use to compare stars of greater or smaller size and mass to our own .
A solar radius is 690,000 km ( 432,000 miles ) and 1 solar mass is 2 x 1030 kilograms ( 4.3 x 1030 pounds ) .
That ’s 2 nonillion kilograms , or 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg .
Another thing worth considering is the fact that our Sun is pretty small , as stars go .
As a G - type main - sequence star ( specifically , a G2V star ) , which is commonly known as a yellow dwarf , its on the smaller end of the size chart ( see above ) .
While it is certainly larger than the most common type of star – M - type , or Red Dwarfs – it is itself dwarfed ( no pun ! ) by the likes of blue giants and other spectral classes .
Classification :
To break it all down , stars are grouped based on their essential characteristics , which can be their spectral class ( i.e. color ) , temperature , size , and brightness .
The most common method of classification is known as the Morgan–Keenan ( MK ) system , which classifies stars based on temperature using the letters O , B , A , F , G , K , and M , – O being the hottest and M the coolest .
Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest ( e.g. O1 to M9 are the hottest to coldest stars ) .
In the MK system , a luminosity class is added using Roman numerals .
These are based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star ’s spectrum ( which vary with the density of the atmosphere ) , thus distinguishing giant stars from dwarfs .
Luminosity classes 0 and I apply to hyper - or supergiants ; classes II , III and IV apply to bright , regular giants , and subgiants , respectively ; class V is for main - sequence stars ; and class VI and VII apply to subdwarfs and dwarf stars .
There is also the Hertzsprung - Russell diagram , which relates stellar classification to absolute magnitude ( i.e. intrinsic brightness ) , luminosity , and surface temperature .
The same classification for spectral types are used , ranging from blue and white at one end to red at the other , which is then combined with the stars Absolute Visual Magnitude ( expressed as Mv ) to place them on a 2 - dimensional chart ( see above ) .
On average , stars in the O - range are hotter than other classes , reaching effective temperatures of up to 30,000 K .
At the same time , they are also larger and more massive , reaching sizes of over 6 and a half solar radii and up to 16 solar masses .
At the lower end , K and M type stars ( orange and red dwarfs ) tend to be cooler ( ranging from 2400 to 5700 K ) , measuring 0.7 to 0.96 times that of our Sun , and being anywhere from 0.08 to 0.8 as massive .
Based on the full of classification of our Sun ( G2V ) , we can therefore say that it a main - sequence star with a temperature around 5,800K .
Now consider another famous star system in our galaxy – Eta Carinae , a system containing at least two stars located around 7500 light - years away in the direction of the constellation Carina .
The primary of this system is estimated to be 250 times the size of our Sun , a minimum of 120 solar masses , and a million times as bright – making it one of the biggest and brightest stars ever observed .
There is some controversy over this world ’s size though .
Most stars blow with a solar wind , losing mass over time .
But Eta Carinae is so large that it casts off 500 times the mass of the Earth every year .
With so much mass lost , it ’s very difficult for astronomers to accurately measure where the star ends , and its stellar wind begins .
Also , it is believed that Eta Carinae will explode in the not - too - distant future , and it will be the most spectacular supernovae humans have ever seen .
In terms of sheer mass , the top spot goes to R136a1 , a star located in the Large Magellanic Cloud , some 163,000 light - years away .
It is believed that this star may contain as much as 315 times the mass of the Sun , which presents a conundrum to astronomers since it was believed that the largest stars could only contain 150 solar masses .
The answer to this is that R136a1 was probably formed when several massive stars merged together .
Needless to say , R136a1 is set to detonate as a hypernova , any day now .
In terms of large stars , Betelgeuse serves as a good ( and popular ) example .
Located in the shoulder of Orion , this familiar red supergiant has a radius of 950 - 1200 times the size of the Sun , and would engulf the orbit of Jupiter if placed in our Solar System .
In fact , whenever we want to put our Sun ’s size into perspective , we often use Betelgeuse to do it ( see below ) !
Yet , even after we use this hulking Red Giant to put us in our place , we are still just scratching the surface in the game of “ who ’s the biggest star ” .
Consider WOH G64 , a red supergiant star located in the Large Magellanic Cloud , approximately 168,000 light years from Earth .
At 1.540 solar radii in diameter , this star is currently one of the largest in the known universe .
But there ’s also RW Cephei , an orange hypergiant star in the constellation Cepheus , located 3,500 light years from Earth and measuring 1,535 solar radii in diameter .
Westerlund 1 - 26 is also pretty huge , a red supergiant ( or hypergiant ) located within the Westerlund 1 super star cluster 11,500 light - years away that measures 1,530 solar radii in diameter .
Meanwhile , V354 Cephei and VX Sagittarii are tied when it comes to size , with both measuring an estimated 1,520 solar radii in diameter .
The Largest Star : UY Scuti
As it stands , the title of the largest star in the Universe ( that we know of ) comes down to two contenders .
For example , UY Scuti is currently at the top of the list .
Located 9.500 light years away in the constellation Scutum , this bright red supergiant and pulsating variable star has an estimated average median radius of 1,708 solar radii – or 2.4 billion km ( 1.5 billion mi ; 15.9 AU ) , thus giving it a volume 5 billion times that of the Sun .
However , this average estimate includes a margin of error of ± 192 solar radii , which means that it could be as large as 1900 solar radii or as small as 1516 .
This lower estimate places it beneath stars like as V354 Cephei and VX Sagittarii .
Meanwhile , the second star on the list of the largest possible stars is NML Cygni , a semiregular variable red hypergiant located in the Cygnus constellation some 5,300 light - years from Earth .
Due to the location of this star within a circumstellar nebula , it is heavily obscured by dust extinction .
As a result , astronomers estimate that its size could be anywhere from 1,642 to 2,775 solar radii , which means it could either be the largest star in the known Universe ( with a margin of 1000 solar radii ) or indeed the second largest , ranking not far behind UY Scuti .
And up until a few years ago , the title of biggest star went to VY Canis Majoris ; a red hypergiant star in the Canis Major constellation , located about 5,000 light - years from Earth .
Back in 2006 , professor Roberta Humphrey of the University of Minnesota calculated its upper size and estimated that it could be more than 1,540 times the size of the Sun .
Its average estimated mass , however , is 1420 , placing it in the no.
8 spot behind V354 Cephei and VX Sagittarii .
These are the biggest star that we know of , but the Milky way probably has dozens of stars that are even larger , obscured by gas and dust so we ca n’t see them .
But even if we cannot find these stars , it is possible to theorize about their likely size and mass .
So just how big can stars get ?
Once again , Professor Roberta Humphreys of the University of Minnesota provided the answer .
As she explained when contacted , the largest stars in the Universe are the coolest .
So even though Eta Carinae is the most luminous star we know of , it ’s extremely hot – 25,000 Kelvin – and therefore only 250 solar radii big .
The largest stars , in contrast , will be cool supergiants .
Case in point , VY Canis Majoris is only 3,500 Kelvin , and a really big star would be even cooler .
At 3,000 Kelvin , Humphreys estimates that cool supergiant would be as big as 2,600 times the size of the Sun .
This is below the upper estimates for NML Cygni , but above the average estimates for both it and UY Scutii .
Hence , this is the upper limit of a star ( at least theoretically and based on all the information we have to date ) .
But as we continue to peer into the Universe with all of our instruments , and explore it up close through robotic spacecraft and crewed missions , we are sure to find new and exciting things that will confound us further !
And be sure to check out this great animation that shows the size of various objects in space , starting with our Solar System ’s tiny planets and finally getting to UY Scuti .
Enjoy !

How Iran pulls the strings in Iraq
By Roger Hardy
BBC Middle East analyst
Iran played a crucial role in securing the recent ceasefire in the Sadr City area of Baghdad , just as it helped broker an earlier truce in the southern city of Basra .
Its role in curbing fighting between Iraqi Shia factions sheds a revealing light on the extent of its influence in the country .
It also appears that the Iraqi president , Kurdish politician Jalal Talabani , has been a key intermediary between the Iraqi government and the Iranians .
Phase One : Basra
The latest phase in the Shia power struggle in Iraq began in March when , without warning , Prime Minister Nouri Maliki sent his forces to break the power of the militias who had taken over Basra .
The Sadr City fighting has killed about 1,000 people , including many civilians
Their prime target was the Mehdi Army , the militia of the young Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr .
But in six days of fighting , the Mehdi Army managed to hold its own .
To the prime minister 's embarrassment , hundreds of his troops deserted .
Iran , with its close ties to both the government and the Shia factions , intervened to end the violence .
According to a detailed report in the Christian Science Monitor , this followed an appeal from President Talabani to the commander of Iran 's Quds Force , Brig Gen Qassem Soleimani .
US officials have accused the Quds Force - the external arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards - of arming and training Iraqi Shia militias .
Phase Two : Sadr City
The fighting in Basra eventually subsided , but the intra-Shia violence shifted to the Baghdad suburb of Sadr City .
We must all work together - Iraq , Iran and the United States - to stabilise the situation
Gen Qassem Soleimani
The sprawling suburb is home to more than two million Shia and is the stronghold of the Mehdi Army .
The fighting was intense , lasting seven weeks and leaving up to 1,000 dead and many more displaced .
Government forces had the backing of US troops and US air power .
Despite the prime minister 's tough talk , it looked as though he was unwilling to take the risky step of an all - out assault on Sadr City .
Once again , there was an appeal to Iran .
A delegation of Iraqi Shia politicians close to Mr Maliki went to Tehran , ostensibly to present the Iranians with evidence of their interference in Iraq .
But the unstated purpose was to seek Iran 's help in ending the violence in Sadr City .
The fact that Moqtada al - Sadr is widely believed to be in Iran encourages the view that Iran may have some leverage over him .
The truce signed on Monday is fragile , but the episode is further proof that Iran can be very influential when it chooses to be .
A message to Petraeus Even more intriguingly , the Christian Science Monitor reports a second meeting between President Talabani and Gen Soleimani , in early April .
According to the paper , the latter sent a message to the top American commander in Iraq , Gen Petraeus .
Its tone was surprisingly conciliatory .
" We must all work together - Iraq , Iran and the United States - to stabilise the situation , " the Iranian general reportedly said .
More surprising still , he described Moqtada Sadr as " the biggest threat to peace in Iraq " and said his movement was " outside anyone 's control " .
It is hard to judge the significance of the message , and the Americans are said to be sceptical .
In public , there is no let - up in the hostility between Tehran and Washington , with each blaming the other for the violence in Iraq .
But what the whole affair illustrates is that Iran 's ability to pull strings in Iraq is not to be underestimated .

Updated BT Retail wheeled out Emma Sanderson , its " director of value added services " , on BBC Breakfast today to account for its secret profiling and targeting of credit card advertising to 18,000 of its customers using Phorm technology in 2006 .
She parroted the same line we 've been hearing from BT since the 2007 secret trial was revealed : that no information was divulged , and that people were completely anonymous .
You can watch the interview here .
Sanderson said : " We do n't believe this is illegal .
We have sought extensive advice , both internally and externally , and prior to conducting this trial ... um ... yeah ?
It 's not illegal .
" Customers absolutely can trust BT , and I 'm here to reassure them that , y'know , this is a service that is looking to provide them with an improved browsing experience .
We have not let our customers down .
" We do not know whether they were participating in the trial or not ... it should reassure them . "
This is all moving fast , so here 's a handy cut -out and keep guide to BT 's current position :
BT has not apologised .
BT has not said why it believes its actions were lawful .
Unlike Carphone Warehouse , BT has not committed to making the system opt - in only .
BT has not made any effort to inform the people it spied on what happened , claiming it does n't know who they were .
BT has not commented on the role played in the deal by Stratis Scleparis , the BT Retail CTO who became Phorm CTO after the first successful secret trial .
We requested an interview with a BT executive who can answer to the concerns of thousands of the firm 's paying customers on Monday , and received no response .
Here 's what chief press officer Adam Liversage had to say today : " I have sent you a statement which answers the questions you have asked .
We do n't feel it 's appropriate to offer [ The Register ] an interview . "
Here 's the statement he 's referring to :
BT can confirm that a small scale technical test of a prototype advertising platform took place for two weeks during September - October 2006 .
The purpose of the test was to evaluate the functional and technical performance of the platform .
It is important for BT to ensure that before any new technologies are deployed , they are robust and fit for purpose .
No personally identifiable information was processed , stored or disclosed during this test .
Here 's the questions he says it answers , sent in an email on Friday 28 March :
Which exchange were the 18,000 test subjects connected to ?
Given the facts that the Home Office advice is that the technology would only be legal under RIPA if consent is obtained , and no consent was obtained from the 18,000 test subjects , does BT believe that this trail was a legal act ?
If so , why ?
Is BT comfortable with the role played by Stratis Scleparis , who was CTO of BT Retail during the trials , and is now CTO of Phorm ?
We argued today that BT 's statement does not answer our questions and asked why it thinks it is not appropriate to explain its actions to its customers .
" We 're going to have to beg to differ , " was the response from Liversage . ®

Friends tell us BT will get a grilling on Channel 4 News today .

Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg wants to sit down with Google and work out the privacy issues that caused Facebook to block Google 's Friend Connect last week , he said Monday .
" We want to talk to Google about this and see if there 's a way we can make it work , " said Zuckerberg at a news conference in Tokyo .
He was in the Japanese capital to launch the a local - language version of the social networking site .
Google Gets Friendly
Google Friend Connect allows
Web site operators to add social networking functions to their Web sites .
Users visiting the sites will be able to interact with new people or existing friends from social networking sites like Facebook , Orkut and Plaxo .
It 's the possibility of data redistribution to third - party sites by Google that caused Facebook to block access , it said last week .
" Part of the issue with Google 's Friend Connect is that when users grant access to Google 's product , Google might share their information with another application , or some part of it , maybe not all of it , without that user knowing .
And part of what makes our system work is that people know exactly who they are sharing all their information with , " he said .
Zuckerberg contradicted Google Engineering Director David Glazer , who said last week in a phone interview with IDG News Service that Google had spoken to Facebook about the service prior to its launch .
" They launched that without asking us or talking to us about it first so we had no choice but to follow the rules that we had set forth for any developer on top of our platform and we followed them , " said Zuckerberg .
" But Google 's a big player in the space and they make good things and our goal is to work with them to figure this out . "
Zuckerberg also noted that Facebook has had a similar service , Facebook Connect , available since late 2006 .
" We think it 's good that other people are picking up on this trend now , " he said .
International Competition
Facebook faces a tough market in Japan .
The number one social networking site , Mixi , has the market virtually sewn up with more than 10 million users , and some doubt whether Facebook 's top selling point , that people use real names , will appeal to Japanese users , many of whom only feel free to express themselves when hiding behind a pseudonym .
Zuckerberg hinted that an update to the company 's site for cell phone users , Facebook Mobile , might be coming for Japan and other advanced mobile markets .
" We have a mobile version of the site and that 's just a first version .
We realize that in a lot of more advanced , technical cultures that phones are in many ways more important than the Web but this is just a first approach to that , " he said .
The number of people accessing the Internet via cell phones in Japan outnumbers those accessing the network from personal computers , so a strong mobile site is also important .
I ’m a little late to the party , as this was covered in the New York Times back in June , but the insight stuns me — we may well not have enough data in our corner of the universe to learn important physics :
Our successors , whoever and wherever they are , may have no way of finding out about the Big Bang and the expanding universe , according to one of the more depressing scientific papers I have ever read .
If things keep going the way they are … in 100 billion years the only galaxies left visible in the sky will be the half - dozen or so bound together gravitationally into what is known as the Local Group , which is not expanding and in fact will probably merge into one starry ball .
Unable to see any galaxies flying away , those astronomers will not know the universe is expanding and will think instead that they are back in the static island universe of Einstein . …
It makes you wonder just how smug we should feel about our own knowledge .
" There may be fundamentally important things that determine the universe that we ca n’t see , " Dr. Krauss said in an interview .
" You can have right physics , but the evidence at hand could lead to the wrong conclusion .
The same thing could be happening today . "
I read about it in the latest Scientific American , and there is also a short article in a recent New Scientist .
Corey Tomsons blogs that this is not a new insight :
This is a ‘ rediscovery ’ of sorts .
There are two other papers which cover this type of analysis , although Krauss and Scherrer provide the most comprehensive short treatment .
T. Rothman & G.F.R. Ellis .
The epoch of observational cosmology .
The Observatory , vol. 107 , p. 24-29 ( 1987 ) .
Abraham Loeb .
Long - term future of extragalactic astronomy .
Phys. Rev. D 65 , 047301 ( 2002 ) . …
Librarians :
You might start thinking about how to store cosmological data for the next 100 + billion years .
Acid free paper wo n’t cut it , so think big .
…
No matter the record , it would doubtless be received with skepticism .
Think of the amount of trust future scientists would need to possess if they were to take seriously any surviving arXiv records about the Big Bang , and how empiricists of the time would heap scorn upon them .
This is tremendously unsettling , but ‘m fascinated by the idea that in the distant future , the Big Bang theory would become akin to Intelligent Design – a theory contradicted by the best evidence .
To turn it around , there may well be physics that we can only learn via records saved by ancient aliens – which gives us another good reason to seek such aliens .
Krauss was at first scheduled to speak at that recent SETI workshop – it would have been fun to talk to him about this .

I find it amazing the way you can take a bunch of abstract nonsense and turn it into concrete Haskell code for doing something mundane .
Having down - to - earth examples really does help with getting your head around the abstractions .
Anyway , on page 43 of Categories for the Working Mathematician ( 2nd Ed. ) is the ' interchange law ' for horizontal and vertical composition of natural transformations .
Not only can we find a nice mundane example to help thinking about it , we can even test it using Quickcheck
For convenience we can define a natural transformation type :
Where f and g are intended to be instances of If we have a natural transformation from f to g , and another from g to h , then we can compose them using the ordinary Haskell composition operator .
In Haskell , functors are frequently containers , so we can use containers as a guiding example .
If we know how to map a bag of stuff to a sack of stuff , and we know how to map a sack of stuff to a box of stuff , then we just perform the two operations in sequence and we can map a bag of stuff to a box of stuff .
This is known as vertical composition .
But there is also another way to compose natural transformations known as horizontal composition .
Again we can think about containers .
Suppose we know how to map a bag of stuff to a sack of stuff , and we know how to map a box of stuff to a crate of stuff , then we also know how to map a bag of boxes of stuff to a sack of crates of stuff .
There are two obvious ways to do this : we could convert the bag of boxes of stuff to a sack of boxes , and then convert each box to a crate .
Or we could convert the boxes to crates first , and then map the resulting bag of crates to a sack of crates .
We can define two binary operatorsandto perform each of these tasks : Intuitively we 'd expect these things to be equal , and in fact they always are .
( Exercise : write a quickcheck for this based on the code below . )
Now we need some functorial containers to play with :
Now we can define a bunch of natural transformations mapping between these containers and some others :
On page 43 is the interchange law .
Superficially it looks a lot like abiding .
For any α , β , α' and β' with compatible types , we have This is the identity I want to check for the special case of the types I 've chosen above .
So we can define the left and right hand sides :
And here we go : Just typein ghci to hear the sweet sound of 100 tests passing .
Anyway , we 're just a hair 's breadth away from defining 2 - categories now .
But I 'll leave that for another day .
Thinking about it , I gave slogans for the previous theorems so why do n't I give one for the interchange law .
Take a deep breath .
If you know how to convert a bowl of stuff into a box of stuff , and a box into a bag , and an urn into a crate , and a crate into a sack , then there are two equivalent ways to convert a bowl of urns into a bag of sacks : we can either construct methods going from bowl to bag and from urn to sack and combine them to go from bowl of urns to a bag of sacks , OR , we can go from a bowl of urns to a box of crates to a bag of sacks .
I 'm sure it 's all a lot clearer now .
;-)
Well that 's enough abstract nonsense .
Time to get away from it all and watch some youtube videos .
Eh ?
Oh well .
Just wish me luck for tomorrow when I try to beat my fastest time in Bay to Breakers .
Maybe some other bayfpers will be there too .

Pandas are only sexually active for a few days each year
Their encounter is filmed by one of the keepers .
And scientists at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding now play this mating tape to other pandas in the hope that it will encourage them to do the same .
" Here you can see the female is very co-operative , " says reproduction specialist Hou Rong - who is known here as the Goddess of Fertility .
She watches the video closely .
The two pandas writhe about for a bit longer .
Then they untangle .
It may be best to stop male pandas from watching what comes next .
" The female is not co-operative , " says Dr Hou laconically .
That is an understatement .
The tape shows the female , Qing Qing , attacking the male , Ha Lei .
He runs off to the corner , looking sheepish .
Qing Qing looks angry .
Apparently this is normal behaviour for pandas after mating .
Still at least Qing Qing and Ha Lei get their job done .
That is quite something .
Crucial timing
Some species cannot seem to stop mating , but pandas cannot seem to start .
Females commonly attack males after mating
Female pandas are only interested in reproducing for two or three days a year .
For males it is the same .
Luckily for the survival of the panda species , these days of interest happen to coincide .
Scientists here have to make the most of this brief mating season .
There are only around 2,000 pandas left in the world - including about 250 in captivity .
So the trick for everyone here at the Chengdu reserve is to get their pandas together on the right days , and then nudge them along a bit by playing them the video of Qing Qing and Ha Lei .
No one here can remember who came up with the idea - it was possibly a behaviour specialist from abroad , they say .
And there is one problem - no one is sure whether or not the mating tapes make any difference .
" We do n't know if its useful for pandas or not , " says Dr Hou .
" Some pandas are interested .
Others are not interested .
They prefer to eat or rest - and not pay attention to the video . "
So the reserve lets us play the video to the pandas ourselves .
Headache ?
We get together a small monitor and some loudspeakers , put some plastic bags onto our shoes and head into a small enclosure .
One panda lies on its back among piles of bamboo leaves .
Another is asleep .
It does not look like they have mating on their minds .
We set up a small TV screen in front of a seven - year - old female panda called Shu Qing .
She is busy crunching her way through an apple .
We play her the tape of Qing Qing and Ha Lei .
Shu Qing shows no interest .
She is much more concerned about finishing her apple .
After a couple of minutes she glances over at the TV monitor .
Then she seems lost in thought .
She vaguely waves a paw , but nothing more .
So the video does not appear to work .
Perhaps Shu Qing has a headache , or perhaps she just prefers apples to adult videos .
 from TomDispatch
Can there be any question that , since the invasion of 2003 , Iraq has been unraveling ?
And here 's the curious thing : Despite a lack of decent information and analysis on crucial aspects of the Iraqi catastrophe , despite the way much of the Iraq story fell off newspaper front pages and out of the TV news in the last year , despite so many reports on the " success " of the President 's surge strategy , Americans sense this perfectly well .
In the latest Washington Post / ABC News poll , 56 % of Americans " say the United States should withdraw its military forces to avoid further casualties " and this has , as the Post notes , been a majority position since January 2007 , the month that the surge was first announced .
Imagine what might happen if the American public knew more about the actual state of affairs in Iraq -- and of thinking in Washington .
So , here , in an attempt to unravel the situation in ever - unraveling Iraq are twelve answers to questions which should be asked far more often in this country :
1. Yes , the war has morphed into the U.S. military 's worst Iraq nightmare :
Few now remember , but before George W. Bush launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , top administration and Pentagon officials had a single overriding nightmare -- not chemical , but urban , warfare .
Saddam Hussein , they feared , would lure American forces into " Fortress Baghdad , " as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld labeled it .
There , they would find themselves fighting block by block , especially in the warren of streets that make up the Iraqi capital 's poorest districts .
When American forces actually entered Baghdad in early April 2003 , however , even Saddam 's vaunted Republican Guard units had put away their weapons and gone home .
It took five years but , as of now , American troops are indeed fighting in the warren of streets in Sadr City , the Shiite slum of two and a half million in eastern Baghdad largely controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia .
The U.S. military , in fact , recently experienced its worst week of 2008 in terms of casualties , mainly in and around Baghdad .
So , mission accomplished -- the worst fear of 2003 has now been realized .
2 . No , there was never an exit strategy from Iraq because the Bush administration never intended to leave -- and still does n't : Critics of the war have regularly gone after the Bush administration for its lack of planning , including its lack of an " exit strategy . "
In this , they miss the point .
The Bush administration arrived in Iraq with four mega - bases on the drawing boards .
These were meant to undergird a future American garrisoning of that country and were to house at least 30,000 American troops , as well as U.S. air power , for the indefinite future .
The term used for such places was n't " permanent base , " but the more charming and euphemistic " enduring camp . "
( In fact , as we learned recently , the Bush administration refuses to define any American base on foreign soil anywhere on the planet , including ones in Japan for over 60 years , as permanent . )
Those four monster bases in Iraq ( and many others ) were soon being built at the cost of multibillions and are , even today , being significantly upgraded .
In October 2007 , for instance , National Public Radio 's defense correspondent Guy Raz visited Balad Air Base , north of Baghdad , which houses about 40,000 American troops , contractors , and Defense Department civilian employees , and described it as " one giant construction project , with new roads , sidewalks , and structures going up across this 16 - square - mile fortress in the center of Iraq , all with an eye toward the next few decades . "
These mega - bases , like " Camp Cupcake " ( al - Asad Air Base ) , nicknamed for its amenities , are small town - sized with massive facilities , including PXs , fast - food outlets , and the latest in communications .
They have largely been ignored by the American media and so have played no part in the debate about Iraq in this country , but they are the most striking on - the - ground evidence of the plans of an administration that simply never expected to leave .
To this day , despite the endless talk about drawdowns and withdrawals , that has n't changed .
In fact , the latest news about secret negotiations for a future Status of Forces Agreement on the American presence in that country indicates that U.S. officials are calling for " an open - ended military presence " and " no limits on numbers of U.S. forces , the weapons they are able to deploy , their legal status or powers over Iraqi citizens , going far beyond long - term U.S. security agreements with other countries . "
3 . Yes , the United States is still occupying Iraq ( just not particularly effectively ) :
In June 2004 , the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , then ruling the country , officially turned over " sovereignty " to an Iraqi government largely housed in the American - controlled Green Zone in Baghdad and the occupation officially ended .
However , the day before the head of the CPA , L. Paul Bremer III , slipped out of the country without fanfare , he signed , among other degrees , Order 17 , which became ( and , remarkably enough , remains ) the law of the land .
It is still a document worth reading as it essentially granted to all occupying forces and allied private companies what , in the era of colonialism , used to be called " extraterritoriality " -- the freedom not to be in any way subject to Iraqi law or jurisdiction , ever .
And so the occupation ended without ever actually ending .
With 160,000 troops still in Iraq , not to speak of an unknown number of hired guns and private security contractors , the U.S. continues to occupy the country , whatever the legalities might be ( including a UN mandate and the claim that we are part of a " coalition " ) .
The only catch is this :
As of now , the U.S. is simply the most technologically sophisticated and potentially destructive of Iraq 's proliferating militias -- and outside the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad , it is capable of controlling only the ground that its troops actually occupy at any moment .
4 . Yes , the war was about oil : Oil was hardly mentioned in the mainstream media or by the administration before the invasion was launched .
The President , when he spoke of Iraq 's vast petroleum reserves at all , piously referred to them as the sacred " patrimony of the people of Iraq . "
But an administration of former energy execs -- with a National Security Advisor who once sat on the board of Chevron and had a double - hulled oil tanker , the Condoleezza Rice , named after her ( until she took office ) , and a Vice President who was especially aware of the globe 's potentially limited energy supplies -- certainly had oil reserves and energy flows on the brain .
They knew , in Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz 's apt phrase , that Iraq was afloat on " a sea of oil " and that it sat strategically in the midst of the oil heartlands of the planet .
It was n't a mistake that , in 2001 , Vice President Dick Cheney 's semi-secret Energy Task Force set itself the " task " of opening up the energy sectors of various Middle Eastern countries to " foreign investment " ; or that it scrutinized " a detailed map of Iraq 's oil fields , together with the ( non-American ) oil companies scheduled to develop them " ; or that , according to the New Yorker 's Jane Mayer , the National Security Council directed its staff " to cooperate fully with the Energy Task Force as it considered the ' melding ' of two seemingly unrelated areas of policy : ' the review of operational policies towards rogue states , ' such as Iraq , and ' actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields ' " ; or that the only American troops ordered to guard buildings in Iraq , after Baghdad fell , were sent to the Oil Ministry ( and the Interior Ministry , which housed Saddam Hussein 's dreaded secret police ) ; or that the first " reconstruction " contract was issued to Cheney 's former firm , Halliburton , for " emergency repairs " to those patrimonial oil fields .
Once in charge in Baghdad , as sociologist Michael Schwartz has made clear , the administration immediately began guiding recalcitrant Iraqis toward denationalizing and opening up their oil industry , as well as bringing in the big boys .
Though rampant insecurity has kept the Western oil giants on the sidelines , the American - shaped " Iraqi " oil law quickly became a " benchmark " of " progress " in Washington and remains a constant source of prodding and advice from American officials in Baghdad .
Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan put the oil matter simply and straightforwardly in his memoir in 2007 : " I am saddened , " he wrote , " that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
In other words , in a variation on the old Bill Clinton campaign mantra :
It 's the oil , stupid .
Greenspan was , unsurprisingly , roundly assaulted for the obvious naiveté of his statement , from which , when it proved inconvenient , he quickly retreated .
But if this administration had n't had oil on the brain in 2002 - 2003 , given the importance of Iraq 's reserves , Congress should have impeached the President and Vice President for that .
5 . No , our new embassy in Baghdad is not an " embassy " :
When , for more than three - quarters of a billion dollars , you construct a complex -- regularly described as " Vatican - sized " -- of at least 20 " blast - resistant " buildings on 104 acres of prime Baghdadi real estate , with " fortified working space " and a staff of at least 1,000 ( plus several thousand guards , cooks , and general factotums ) , when you deeply embunker it , equip it with its own electricity and water systems , its own anti-missile defense system , its own PX , and its own indoor and outdoor basketball courts , volleyball court , and indoor Olympic - size swimming pool , among other things , you have n't built an " embassy " at all .
What you 've constructed in the heart of the heart of another country is more than a citadel , even if it falls short of a city - state .
It is , at a minimum , a monument to Bush administration dreams of domination in Iraq and in what its adherents once liked to call " the Greater Middle East . "
Just about ready to open , after the normal construction mishaps in Iraq , it will constitute the living definition of diplomatic overkill .
It will , according to a Senate estimate , now cost Americans $ 1.2 billion a year just to be " represented " in Iraq .
The " embassy " is , in fact , the largest headquarters on the planet for the running of an occupation .
Functionally , it is also another well - fortified enduring camp with the amenities of home .
Tell that to the Shiite militiamen now mortaring the Green Zone as if it were … enemy - occupied territory .
6 . No , the Iraqi government is not a government :
The government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has next to no presence in Iraq beyond the Green Zone ; it delivers next to no services ; it has next to no ability to spend its own oil money , reconstruct the country , or do much of anything else , and it most certainly does not hold a monopoly on the instruments of violence .
It has no control over the provinces of northern Iraq which operate as a near - independent Kurdish state .
Non-Kurdish Iraqi troops are not even allowed on its territory .
Maliki 's government cannot control the largely Sunni provinces of the country , where its officials are regularly termed " the Iranians " ( a reference to the heavily Shiite government 's closeness to neighboring Iran ) and are considered the equivalent of representatives of a foreign occupying power ; and it does not control the Shiite south , where power is fragmented among the militias of ISCI ( the Badr Organization ) , Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army , and the armed adherents of the Fadila Party , a Sadrist offshoot , among others .
In Afghanistan , President Hamid Karzai has been derisively nicknamed " the mayor of Kabul " for his government 's lack of control over much territory outside the national capital .
It would be a step forward for Maliki if he were nicknamed " the mayor of Baghdad . "
Right now , his troops , heavily backed by American forces , are fighting for some modest control over Shiite cities ( or parts of cities ) from Basra to Baghdad .
7 . No , the surge is not over :
Two weeks ago , amid much hoopla , General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker spent two days before Congress discussing the President 's surge strategy in Iraq and whether it has been a " success . "
But that surge -- the ground one in which an extra 30,000 - plus American troops were siphoned into Baghdad and , to a lesser extent , adjoining provinces -- was by then already so over .
In fact , all but about 10,000 of those troops will be home by the end of July , not because the President has had any urge for a drawdown , but , as Fred Kaplan of Slate wrote recently , " because of simple math .
The five extra combat brigades , which were deployed to Iraq with the surge , each have 15 - month tours of duty ; the 15 months will be up in July … and the U.S. Army and Marines have no combat brigades ready to replace them . "
On the other hand , in all those days of yak , neither the general with so much more " martial bling " on his chest than any victorious World War II commander , nor the white - haired ambassador uttered a word about the surge that is ongoing -- the air surge that began in mid-2007 and has yet to end .
Explain it as you will , but , with rare exceptions , American reporters in Iraq generally do n't look up or more of them would have noticed that the extra air units surged into that country and the region in the last year are now being brought to bear over Iraq 's cities .
Today , as fighting goes on in Sadr City , American helicopters and Hellfire - missile armed Predator drones reportedly circle overhead almost constantly and air strikes of various kinds on city neighborhoods are on the rise .
Yet the air surge in Iraq remains unacknowledged here and so is not a subject for discussion , debate , or consideration when it comes to our future in Iraq .
8 . No , the Iraqi army will never " stand up " :
It can't .
It 's not a national army .
It 's not that Iraqis can't fight -- or fight bravely .
Ask the Sunni insurgents .
Ask the Mahdi Army militia of Muqtada al - Sadr .
It 's not that Iraqis are incapable of functioning in a national army .
In the bitter Iran - Iraq War of 1980 - 88 , Iraqi Shiite as well as Sunni conscripts , led by a largely Sunni officer corps , fought Iranian troops fiercely in battle after pitched battle .
But from Fallujah in 2004 to today , Iraqi army ( and police ) units , wheeled into battle ( often at the behest of the Americans ) , have regularly broken and run , or abandoned their posts , or gone over to the other side , or , at the very least , fought poorly .
In the recent offensive launched by the Maliki government in Basra , military and police units up against a single resistant militia , the Mahdi Army , deserted in sizeable numbers , while other units , when not backed by the Americans , gave poor showings .
At least 1,300 troops and police ( including 37 senior police officers ) were recently " fired " by Maliki for dereliction of duty , while two top commanders were removed as well .
Though American training began in 2004 and , by 2005 , the President was regularly talking about us " standing down " as soon as the Iraqi Army " stood up , " as Charles Hanley of the Associated Press points out , " Year by year , the goal of deploying a capable , free - standing Iraqi army has seemed to always slip further into the future . "
He adds , " In the latest shift , the Pentagon 's new quarterly status report quietly drops any prediction of when local units will take over security responsibility for Iraq .
Last year 's reports had forecast a transition in 2008 . "
According to Hanley , the chief American trainer of Iraqi forces , Lt. Gen. James Dubik , now estimates that the military will not be able to guard the country 's borders effectively until 2018 .
No wonder .
The " Iraqi military " is not in any real sense a national military at all .
Its troops generally lack heavy weaponry , and it has neither a real air force nor a real navy .
Its command structures are integrated into the command structure of the U.S. military , while the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy are the real Iraqi air force and navy .
It is reliant on the U.S. military for much of its logistics and resupply , even after an investment of $ 22 billion by the American taxpayer .
It represents a non-government , is riddled with recruits from Shiite militias ( especially the Badr brigades ) , and is riven about who its enemy is ( or enemies are ) and why .
It can not be a " national " army because it has , in essence , nothing to stand up for .
You can count on one thing , as long as we are " training " and " advising " the Iraqi military , however many years down the line , you will read comments like this one from an American platoon sergeant , after an Iraqi front - line unit abandoned its positions in the ongoing battle for control of parts of Sadr City : " It bugs the hell out of me .
We do n't see any progress being made at all .
We hear these guys in firefights .
We know if we are not up there helping these guys out we are making very little progress . "
9 . No , the U.S. military does not stand between Iraq and fragmentation :
The U.S. invasion and the Bush administration 's initial occupation policies decisively smashed Iraq 's fragile " national " sense of self .
Since then , the Bush administration , a motor for chaos and fragmentation , has destroyed the national ( if dictatorial ) government , allowed the capital and much of the country ( as well as its true patrimony of ancient historical objects and sites ) to be looted , disbanded the Iraqi military , and deconstructed the national economy .
Ever since , whatever the administration rhetoric , the U.S. has only presided over the further fragmentation of the country .
Its military , in fact , employs a specific policy of urban fragmentation in which it regularly builds enormous concrete walls around neighborhoods , supposedly for " security " and " reconstruction , " that actually cut them off from their social and economic surroundings .
And , of course , Iraq has in these years been fragmented in other staggering ways with an estimated four - plus million Iraqis driven into exile abroad or turned into internal refugees .
According to Pepe Escobar of the Asia Times , there are now at least 28 different militias in the country .
The longer the U.S. remains even somewhat in control , the greater the possibility of further fragmentation .
Initially , the fragmentation was sectarian -- into Kurdish , Sunni , and Shia regions , but each of those regions has its own potentially hostile parts and so its points of future conflict and further fragmentation .
If the U.S. military spent the early years of its occupation fighting a Sunni insurgency in the name of a largely Shiite ( and Kurdish ) government , it is now fighting a Shiite militia , while paying and arming former Sunni insurgents , relabeled " Sons of Iraq . "
Iran is also clearly sending arms into a country that is , in any case , awash in weaponry .
Without a real national government , Iraq has descended into a welter of militia - controlled neighborhoods , city states , and provincial or regional semi-governments .
Despite all the talk of American - supported " reconciliation , " Juan Cole described the present situation well at his Informed Comment blog : " Maybe the US in Iraq is not the little boy with his finger in the dike .
Maybe we are workers with jackhammers instructed to make the hole in the dike much more huge . "
10 .
No , the U.S. military does not stand between Iraq and civil war :
As with fragmentation , the U.S. military 's presence has , in fact , been a motor for civil war in that country .
The invasion and subsequent chaos , as well as punitive acts against the Sunni minority , allowed Sunni extremists , some of whom took the name " al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia , " to establish themselves as a force in the country for the first time .
Later , U.S. military operations in both Sunni and Shiite areas regularly repressed local militias -- almost the only forces capable of bringing some semblance of security to urban neighborhoods -- opening the way for the most extreme members of the other community ( Sunni suicide or car bombers and Shiite death squads ) to attack .
It 's worth remembering that it was in the surge months of 2007 , when all those extra American troops hit Baghdad neighborhoods , that many of the city 's mixed or Sunni neighborhoods were most definitively " cleansed " by death squads , producing a 75 - 80 % Shiite capital .
Iraq is now embroiled in what Juan Cole has termed " three civil wars , " two of which ( in the south and the north ) are largely beyond the reach of limited American ground forces and all of which could become far worse .
The still low - level struggle between Kurds and Arabs ( with the Turks hovering nearby ) for the oil - rich city of Kirkuk in the north may be the true explosion point to come .
The U.S. military sits precariously atop this mess , at best putting off to the future aspects of the present civil - war landscape , but more likely intensifying it .
11 . No , al - Qaeda will not control Iraq if we leave ( and neither will Iran ) :
The latest figures tell the story .
Of 658 suicide bombings globally in 2007 ( more than double those of any year in the last quarter century ) , 542 , according to the Washington Post 's Robin Wright , took place in occupied Iraq or Afghanistan , mainly Iraq .
In other words , the American occupation of that land has been a motor for acts of terrorism ( as occupations will be ) .
There was no al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia before the invasion and Iraq was no Afghanistan .
The occupation under whatever name will continue to create " terrorists , " no matter how many times the administration claims that " al - Qaeda " is on the run .
With the departure of U.S. troops , it 's clear that homegrown Sunni extremists ( and the small number of foreign jihadis who work with them ) , already a minority of a minority , will more than meet their match in facing the Sunni mainstream .
The Sunni Awakening Movement came into existence , in part , to deal with such self - destructive extremism ( and its fantasies of a Taliban - style society ) before the Americans even noticed that it was happening .
When the Americans leave , " al - Qaeda " ( and whatever other groups the Bush administration subsumes under that catch - all title ) will undoubtedly lose much of their raison d'être or simply be crushed .
As for Iran , the moment the Bush administration finally agreed to a popular democratic vote in occupied Iraq , it ensured one thing -- that the Shiite majority would take control , which in practice meant religio- political parties that , throughout the Saddam Hussein years , had generally been close to , or in exile in , Iran .
Everything the Bush administration has done since has only ensured the growth of Iranian influence among Shiite groups .
This is surely meant by the Iranians as , in part , a threat / trump card , should the Bush administration launch an attack on that country .
After all , crucial U.S. resupply lines from Kuwait run through areas near Iran and would assumedly be relatively easy to disrupt .
Without the U.S. military in Iraq , there can be no question that the Iranians would have real influence over the Shiite ( and probably Kurdish ) parts of the country .
But that influence would have its distinct limits .
If Iran overplayed its hand even in a rump Shiite Iraq , it would soon enough find itself facing some version of the situation that now confronts the Americans .
As Robert Dreyfuss wrote in the Nation recently , " [ D]espite Iran 's enormous influence in Iraq , most Iraqis -- even most Iraqi Shiites -- are not pro-Iran .
On the contrary , underneath the ruling alliance in Baghdad , there is a fierce undercurrent of Arab nationalism in Iraq that opposes both the U.S. occupation and Iran 's support for religious parties in Iraq . "
The al - Qaedan and Iranian " threats " are , at one and the same time , bogeymen used by the Bush administration to scare Americans who might favor withdrawal and , paradoxically , realities that a continued military presence only encourages .
12 . Yes , some Americans were right about Iraq from the beginning ( and not the pundits either ) :
One of the strangest aspects of the recent fifth anniversary ( as of every other anniversary ) of the invasion of Iraq was the newspaper print space reserved for those Bush administration officials and other war supporters who were dead wrong in 2002 - 2003 on an endless host of Iraq - related topics .
Many of them were given ample opportunity to offer their views on past failures , the " success " of the surge , future withdrawals or drawdowns , and the responsibilities of a future U.S. president in Iraq .
Noticeably missing were representatives of the group of Americans who happened to have been right from the get - go .
In our country , of course , it often does n't pay to be right .
( It 's seen as a sign of weakness or plain dumb luck . )
I 'm speaking , in this case , of the millions of people who poured into the streets to demonstrate against the coming invasion with an efflorescence of placards that said things too simpleminded ( as endless pundits assured American news readers at the time ) to take seriously -- like " No Blood for Oil , " " Do n't Trade Lives for Oil , " or " " How did USA 's oil get under Iraq 's sand ? "
At the time , it seemed clear to most reporters , commentators , and op - ed writers that these sign - carriers represented a crew of well - meaning know - nothings and the fact that their collective fears proved all too prescient still can't save them from that conclusion .
So , in their very rightness , they were largely forgotten .
Now , as has been true for some time , a majority of Americans , another obvious bunch of know - nothings , are deluded enough to favor bringing all U.S. troops out of Iraq at a reasonable pace and relatively soon .
( More than 60 % of them also believe " that the conflict is not integral to the success of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts . " )
If , on the other hand , a poll were taken of pundits and the inside - the - Beltway intelligentsia ( not to speak of the officials of the Bush administration ) , the number of them who would want a total withdrawal from Iraq ( or even see that as a reasonable goal ) would undoubtedly descend near the vanishing point .
When it comes to American imperial interests , most of them know better , just as so many of them did before the war began .
Even advisors to candidates who theoretically want out of Iraq are hinting that a full - scale withdrawal is hardly the proper way to go .
So let me ask you a question ( and you answer it ) : Given all of the above , given the record thus far , who is likely to be right ?
Tom Engelhardt , who runs the Nation Institute 's Tomdispatch.com , is the co-founder of the American Empire Project .
His book , The End of Victory Culture ( University of Massachusetts Press ) , has been updated in a newly issued edition that deals with victory culture 's crash - and - burn sequel in Iraq .
[ Tomdispatch recommendations :
For another numbered piece on Iraq , check out Gary Kamiya 's eminently sane reprise of the Ten Commandments as applied to the launching of the 2003 invasion -- to be found at Salon.com .
( " Commandment I , " Thou shalt not launch preventive wars… " ; Commandment VI : " Do not allow neoconservatives anywhere near Middle East policy … Special Bill Kristol Sub - commandment VI a : Stop giving these buffoons prestigious jobs on newspaper - of - record Op - Ed pages , top magazines and television shows .
They have been completely and consistently wrong about everything .
Must we continue to be subjected to their pontifications ? " ) .
Also let me offer a Tomdispatch bow of thanks to Cursor.org 's daily " Media Patrol " column .
Someone at that site with a keen eye for the less noticed but newsworthy pieces of any day ( and an always splendid set of links ) makes my life so much easier , when gathering material for essays like this one . ]

A family I know has a tradition of making a book when their children hit 13 .
Everyone writes a memory , or a piece of advice .
I set down to write a list of 25 things that are * actually * true .
Is there anything wrong here ?
Is there anything I 'm missing ?
1 . You are somewhat better looking that you think you are .
2 . You are somewhat more popular that you think you are .
3 . Your parents are somewhat more cool than you think they are .
They are somewhat less cool than they think they are .
4 . Your parents are sometimes wrong .
You are wrong more often .
5 . For any given " grown up " activity , somewhat fewer people are doing it than you think .
6 . For any given " grown up " activity , somewhat fewer people are doing it than say they are doing it .
7 . People are not thinking about you .
They are thinking about what you 're thinking about them .
8 . You are entering a period of chronic , low - level insanity .
You will look back on your teen age years and realize this .
All teenage girls are insane .
9 . Teenage boys are worse .
They are stark , raving , often droolingly insane , and generally remain so well into their twenties .
10 .
There is nothing wrong with your breath .
11 . Your body smells just fine .
12 . Noses never hit .
Braces do not lock .
Teeth sometimes hit .
Lips chap , but it take a long , long time .
You now know absolutely everything about the dangers of kissing .
13 . Oh , I forgot .
It 's much easier than you think to get a hickie .
If you get one , you will try hard to hide it .
Your parents and teachers will try equally hard to pretend they do n't see it , or do n't know what it is .
14 .
The coolest kids in my class are failures now .
This is a simple fact .
If I had known it at the time I would have thought it a very fun fact .
Now I realize it 's kind of sad .
15 .
The nerdiest kid in my mother 's class went on to win a Nobel Prize in Physics .
( He is , however , still a major nerd . )
16 . No teacher ever hates you .
They just do n't think that way .
The good ones will love you a little or a lot .
The bad ones will have the same emotion toward you that a factory worker has toward objects flying past on an assembly line .
17 . Your parents do n't hate you .
Your parents love you more than you can even understand now .
18 . If something is illegal , there is probably a good reason .
19 .
The things that you think will get you into trouble probably wo n't get you into as much trouble as you think , but will still get you into trouble .
20 .
The things you think might be dangerous are probably more dangerous than you think .
21 . Tattoos last an extremely long time .
Studies have shown that only 1 % of teenagers who get a tattoo like them ten years later .
22 . Nose rings and tongue studs last only as long as you want them , but bother parents just as much .
23 .
You 're not stuck .
It will end .
But it 's going to take a long , long time .
24 .
When you enter a room and everyone is laughing , it is n't about you .
25 .
When you enter a room and everyone is laughing , and you recently blew your nose , and they 're all pointing at you , and there 's something green swinging in the corner of your vision , considering revising rule 24 .
2readafew Sep 29 , 2007 , 9:58 am Nice !
3 MerryMary Oct 1 , 2007 , 6:14 pm Perfect !
4NonfictionFanatic Jan 15 , 2008 , 4:57 pm
Wow !
That pretty much sums up teenagers in a nut shell !
5 januaryw Jan 18 , 2008 , 2:25 am
Everyone is as insecure about things as you are .
Even the cool kids think they need to change everything about themselves .
Nerds are true and genuine people who make excellent friends .
6 NonfictionFanatic Jan 18 , 2008 , 3:58 pm # 5 ...
Are you a teenager or have been there done that ?
Cause either way serious words of wisdom and I totally agree !
I hate it when people act like they think they are perfect .
No one is totally comfortable with themselves .
7 januaryw Jan 18 , 2008 , 4:37 pm # 6
Been there done that , wore that ugly t- shirt 8 NonfictionFanatic Jan 25 , 2008 , 4:08 pm
That 's where I am at right now .
But thinks for the outlook cause so many of those rules totally applied to me .
9emaestra Mar 4 , 2008 , 6:36 pm 26 .
The clothing and hair style that you think are so very cool now will make you cringe when you look at photos of yourself ten years from now .
27 . Contrary to what people may tell you , these are not the best years of your life .
They may , in fact , be the worst years of your life .
But you will survive and it will get better .
I think I am going to post your list in my classroom .
I know it made my day .

Agree , agree !
I 'm sending this to my parents - we are all way past the teenage years , but I know they will get a kick out of it .
13echomikeromeo May 26 , 2008 , 9:05 pm
Speaking as someone on the upper end of the teenage years , I completely agree with all except number 18 , which is absolutely wrong .
14whersmacheese Jun 16 , 2008 , 11:25 am
Spoken like a true teenager 15 kaelirenee Jun 16 , 2008 , 12:06 pm For # 22 - You might want to make mention of the fact that you 'll still get a scar when you take out the tongue stud , navel ring , or whatever .
Oh , and labret piercings are just annoying ( boy did I learn that one the hard way ) .
And I think all of those upset my mother more than my tattoos , though now that a decade has past , she 's better with them .
16 Cavale Jun 20 , 2008 , 11:02 pm
What 's wrong with this list :
You use ' that ' instead of ' than ' in the first two .
Number 18 is untrue .
Number 21 is made up .
And the entire list is trite .
17 januaryw Jul 7 , 2008 , 1:01 pm Message 16 : Cavale
What 's wrong with your response :
1 . It 's overcritical
2 . It shows that you lack all sense of sentimentality
3 . It 's a bit rude 18 MistyMikoK Aug 8 , 2008 , 10:28 pm i love this 19 chefgirl95 Oct 18 , 2008 , 8:09 pm wow whoever wrote that list should so consider maybe writing like a book or something ... its good 20 KathiJ Oct 18 , 2008 , 9:30 pm
I have just sent the list off to many people .
Including my 19 year old child .
I have another child turning 13 in a month .
Will make a copy to give to her on her birthday .
Wonderful list .
21thedailyuplift Oct 22 , 2008 , 5:19 pm 12 . chins will get raw but it takes a bit of time or fun for this to happen .
my blog below ....
www.thedailyuplift.com 22 Pemberley Oct 31 , 2008 , 5:03 pm - Books you read , should be reread later on .
- Do not read books about teenagers when a teenager .
They are much better , when you think you do n't need them anymore .

I 'm rather fond of this too .
It 's trite , I know , and I can understand why it 's attacked .
Nevertheless , I think it says some true things , and some things that -- however obvious -- seemed like real discoveries to me at the time .
Over and over again I am confronted with evidence that " all the bullshit is true , " or anyway most of it .
I 'm particularly attached to the idea of asking a teenage to consider themselves seriously from another point of view .
The idea that everyone is thinking about you , or about how you smell , that your teachers " hate " you -- well , they all stem from the same teenage affliction : an inability to imagine a world in which you , and what you are going through are n't the center .
It has this weirdly distoring effect on everything .
I should say that the girl I wrote this for is now finishing up high - school , and applying for colleges .
Except she is n't really .
Like so many teenagers she has this idea that the world is out to get her , and parents and colleges are part of that .
She has vague ideas of living at home and doing nothing for a year instead .
She does n't know what she wants to do with her life and considers this to be an existential crisis rather than a restatement of her age and situation .
The application essays do n't help .
They all pretend to believe the applicants ar- and ought to be fully formed .
If I worked in an admissions department , I 'd gladly let someone in who simply confessed " I want to go to college so I get past being a dumb - ass high - school student and becoming something else .
I 'll try hard . "
I want to strangle her .
Or leave her along in the woods with a rifle , a canteen and a wilderness survival guide so she could learn something about the world 's combination of cold indifference and reward for learning and industry .
I do think this would make a nice impulse buy book , small , one page per rule and with some cute cartoons .
The cartoons would make it , probably .
But being a " published " author is an extremely frustrating , random and unpleasant business -- and I have a job .
26 Pemberley Edited : Nov 5 , 2008 , 5:47 pm
This book sounds like a great idea !
I 've worked in a bookshop for several years and from my experience there I think that this book will be appreciated by many book buyers .
You 're probably right about the cartoons .
That 's what catches the eye in the first place .
I hope I was n't misunderstood , when I stated " do n't read books about teenagers when a teenager . "
When I wrote this , I had those novels in mind that are particularly written for teenagers .
Sometimes it 's better for a teenagers to read some " real " novels , especially in times of change .
At least , it was for me .
Those teenage books are much more fun to read , when you are grown up and can look at these coming - of - age years from a distance .
27 Taleri Dec 31 , 2008 , 6:50 pm
Speaking from experience as a teacher , # 11 is wrong .
You might want to change it to say " Your body smells just fine , as long as you shower regularly and dont drench yourself in Axe or Tag . "
The only thing that smells worse than BO is someone who overcompensates with smelly " deoderant . "
I would reverse 8 and 9 , Teenage girls are worse , specifically middle school girls , as they can be incredibly vindictive .
Boys will do something stupid , but at least tend to be honest about it .
Girls will do soomething stupid , and then blame it on someone else to get them in trouble instead .
Unfortunately they almost always get away with it because they are also very good at exploiting many adults ' perception that girls are innocent and need to be protected from " evil " influences .
Message 9 - I agree with your # 27
Message 22/26 - I agree with your idea of not reading books about teenagers while a teenager .
28 AngelaB86 Dec 31 , 2008 , 7:04 pm
" She has vague ideas of living at home and doing nothing for a year instead . "
I stayed home for a year after graduating from high school .
However , I had a job ( well , not all the time ) , and I studied independently for CLEP tests so when I started college , I had a semester 's worth of college credits under my belt already .
I wish more kids would take a year off before going to college , because I 'm sick of watching kids wash out in their first semester / year because they just were n't prepared for college .
" I want to go to college so I get past being a dumb - ass high - school student and becoming something else .
I 'll try hard . "
Hear , hear !
I would buy your book , especially if it was part of a duology - the first part is the " Teens Should Know ... " and the second half a wilderness survival guide for those teens who respond with " Or else what ? ! "
29 Taleri Dec 31 , 2008 , 7:10 pm " Hear , hear !
I would buy your book , especially if it was part of a duology - the first part is the " Teens Should Know ... " and the second half a wilderness survival guide for those teens who respond with " Or else what ? ! "
Precisely ! :) 30 alloverme Feb 28 , 2009 , 2:16 pm i did actually have a teacher that hated me she was actually fired for hostility to students 31ianea Feb 10 , 2010 , 7:50 am it is cool and still absolutely true !!!
i agree with you and try to give you an extra tipp so
26 . your junger sister / brother understands more than you think she / he does - even if that goes with a good or bad meaning - sometimes it was your fault and not their
by the way still being a teen that tries to accept that .
anyway your list was ....
True after all !!! :) 32ianea Feb 10 , 2010 , 7:59 am what is wrong with your list :
- do not like - do not judge so rudely
- try to give explanations
- think before writting , i mean noone told you that all 25 things are that true or that you have to have experienced so or even that you should feel those 25 ways being a teen if one of them worked for you then you are just fine , are n't you ?
33 brittney - olet7 Sep 28 , 2010 , 2:05 pm
This is pretty good , but you forgot to mention heartbreak .
Lot 's of teenagers go through so much heartbreak , and some have trouble dealing with it .
I 'm actually a teenager , and this would have been great when I was at the deepest point in my depression because of a break up .
But otherwise , good job for the rest !
34ianea Sep 30 , 2010 , 4:01 pm
Yeah , that 's so true ....
But it is also the crazy heartbeat and the fast breathing after a kiss .
I am a teenager too so trust me i think it goes like that .
First hearbeat then heartbreak .
Anyway i hope things are fine now and you have moved on . :)
Besides there 's so much more to come !
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The price of gold can very well reach $ 1,100 an ounce this year or early 2009 , the London - based consultancy group GFMS Ltd. said Wednesday in its latest survey of the gold market .
While gold , along with other metals and overall commodities have experienced a correction in prices in recent weeks , GFMS expects the ongoing credit crisis to continue fueling investment demand for the precious metal .
" We were n't at all surprised that the market saw a hefty correction in the last few weeks , as the speed of the earlier gains looked a little unsustainable , " said Philip Klapwijk , GFMS ' executive chairman in the report .
" However , we do n't think current hesitancy means it 's game over for the rally . "
After breaking out through a series of all - time highs early this year , gold peaked at over $ 1,030 an ounce in mid-March before sliding back below $ 900 recently .
On Tuesday , gold for June delivery closed at $ 918 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
See full story .
" Many of the drivers behind this investor push after all - dollar weakness , skeletons in banks ' closets - are still very much with us , " Klapwijk said .
" But quite where [ gold will ] top out is a difficult call - maybe $ 1,100 is achievable this year but $ 1,200 plus could be going a bit far " .
Jewelry demand seen falling
GFMS , which provides data to the World Gold Council , said its outlook remained cautious because of the rapidly growing gap between mine production and jewelry demand , the metal 's fundamental support .
In spite of a drop in production in South Africa , global production levels in 2008 should be on par with 2007 , the group said .
But jewelry demand has been hit by the surge and volatility of gold prices , which leads GFMS to predict a drop in demand of over 200 tons this year .
In its 2007 survey , the group found that the interplay between investors and the jewelry sector had largely determined the course that prices took .
During the first half of last year , western investment fell but gold remained supported mainly by jewelry demand , GFMS said .
But investment was the key driver for prices from September onwards , as the credit crisis flared up globally .
" Driven by growing risk aversion , a weakening U.S. dollar , a clearly problematic financial services sector and expectations of lower equity prices , investors have increasingly recognized gold 's safe - haven attributes , " Klapwijk said .
Looking ahead , GFMS said it expects the positive climate for gold investment to continue at least until late 2008 and quite possibly into the first half of 2009 .
The consultancy group expects the credit - market crisis to persist in the medium term , fueling continued risk aversion and creating a bearish outlook for the U.S. dollar , the global economy and equity markets .
Expectations of rising inflation , boosted by a weak dollar and rising crude - oil prices , will also likely support the precious metal , it said .

THE Israeli army has decided not to order a disciplinary probe into the killing of 21 Palestinian civilians in November 2006 .
The dead men , women and children included at least 13 members of the Athamneh family , among them a one - year - old girl .
Another 35 people were injured as 12 155 - millimetre heavy artillery shells struck the north Gaza town of Beit Hanoun for several minutes .
Israeli rights groups yesterday claimed there was a " culture of impunity " in the Israeli security forces , after the decision was announced .
This week the Israel Defence Forces ' ( IDF ) adjutant - general announced that an extremely rare computer malfunction had caused the shells to strike 500 metres from their intended target , a field that had been used by militants to fire missiles at Israel .
There was therefore no reason to charge any soldier with negligence or any other offence , Brigadier - General Avihai Mandelblit decided .
The announcement did not consider the gunners ' supposed failure to notice their shells going astray .
Some oil executives are sounding the alarm bell .
At a recent energy conference , John Hess , the chief executive of Hess Corporation , the international oil company , warned that an oil crisis was looming if the world did n’t deal with runaway demand and strained supplies .
The chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell , Jeroen van der Veer , said recently , with some understatement , that , “ the energy outlook does not look rosy . ”
For one thing , the world ’s oil supplies are already stretched .
Countries outside of the OPEC cartel  which have been the main source of new oil discoveries and production since the 1970s  have said they expect little to no growth this year in oil production .
The North Sea and Alaska are slowly running out of oil and producers there are struggling to keep production from falling .
Russia ’s phenomenal oil surge is coming to an end ; a top executive of Lukoil , the country ’s second - largest oil group , said last week that the country ’s production was unlikely to grow much .
Nigeria is battling a violent militancy .
And Mexico , the third - most - important supplier of crude to the United States , has been stuck in a crippling political debate over keeping out foreign investors while witnessing a dramatic drop in production that some analysts say may be irreversible .
What about OPEC ?
The 13 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries account for three - quarters of the world ’s proven oil reserves .
But for various reasons , most of those countries are making it harder , if not impossible , for foreign oil companies to invest within their borders .
With energy prices rising , OPEC producers are seeing record revenues , which have reduced the incentive to dip into their supplies by boosting production .
At the same time , major oil companies like Exxon Mobil , BP and Chevron are finding it harder to compete worldwide , as national oil companies erode their once - dominant positions .
Fourteen of the world ’s Top 20 oil companies are state - owned giants , like Saudi Aramco and Russia ’s Gazprom .
That leaves Western oil companies in control of less than 10 percent of the world ’s oil and gas reserves .
Facing higher costs , those companies are also having greater difficulty locating new oil deposits .
Despite spending over $ 100 billion on exploration last year , the five largest international oil companies found less oil last year than they pumped out of the ground .
A small band of skeptics view today ’s record prices as evidence that oil supplies have peaked  that half the globe ’s oil supply has already been used up .
But most experts believe that there are still enough oil reserves , both discovered and undiscovered , to last at least through the middle of the century .

As Project Chanology continues , thousands of people worldwide will stage a protest on March 15th against the Church of Scientology 's corruption , and abuse of its members and critics .
The group Anonymous , will picket at local Church of Scientology centers around the world , beginning at 11 a.m. local time in each respective time zone .
Anonymous has been increasing awareness for the cause , whilst simultaneously acquiring and spreading new information about the Church of Scientology obtained from their increasing number of informants within the organization , as part of its campaign to " systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in it 's present form " .
A number of former Scientology members who had previously been afraid to give their own testimonies for fear of retribution from church officials have joined the movement , and a number of new websites informing the public about Scientology have been launched .
Of special note is ExScientologyKids.com [ 1 ] , known as " ESK " within the critic community .
The ESK website is owned and administered by Kendra Wiseman , Astra Woodcraft and Jenna Miscavige - Hill .
All three women are former members who grew up in Scientology , and are related to high ranking officials of the Church of Scientology and its associated front - groups .
Kendra Wiseman is the daughter of the President of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) [ 2 ] , and niece of the President of Narconon [ 3 ] .
Jenna Miscavige - Hill is the niece of the Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center ( RTC ) David Miscavige , who is generally considered to be the " Leader " of the Church of Scientology .
Both Kendra and Jenna have been " disconnected " by their family since leaving the church .
Astra , whose mother is a high - ranking Sea Org [ 4 ] member , fled the Sea Org when they insisted she terminate her pregnancy .
ESK tells these stories , and the stories of many other former Scientology children .
Kendra Wiseman has said that in light of the recent efforts of Anonymous , and because of the efforts of those who have supported her over the last two years while she dealt with her families disconnection from her , she has been made to feel safe in speaking out and now wants to afford the same luxury to others , who may not feel as safe .
Douglas Frantz , a former editor at the L.A. Times who has covered Scientology for the New York Times in the 1990s has said " Before this Internet onslaught , they were always able to go after their critics and do a good job of being able to discredit or intimidate them " [ 5 ] .
The date of the March 15th Protest , referred to as " Operation Party Hard " and " The Ides of March " has been chosen as it falls near a major Scientology holiday , the birthday of Church founder L. Ron Hubbard .
The 15th also marks the death of Ellie Perkins , a Scientologist who was killed by her son Jeremy .
Jeremy , a sufferer of the disease of schizophrenia was denied Psychiatric drugs , and was instead treated with vitamins and auditing [ 6 ] .
Anonymous intends to continue its campaign to educate the public about the true nature of the Church of Scientology ; with the March 15th protest , and future events such as Operation Reconnect .
Scheduled to take place during April , Operation Reconnect [ 7 ] will shine a spotlight on families torn apart by the Church of Scientology .
The aim is to bring these families together , with a number of the " disconnected " giving detailed accounts of their experience with Scientology and making public pleas to their families to " reconnect " with them .
On the 15th of March , Anonymous intends to bring " cake , good will and the gift of knowledge . "
As usual , Anonymous have contacted and worked with city officials to ensure safe and law - abiding protests .
Many protesters will wear masks , scarves and other facial obstructions to protect their identities due to organization .s practice of intimidating and silencing those that speak out against it .

Blackwater 's licence has been renewed for another year Security firm Blackwater has had its contract to protect US diplomats in Iraq extended .
The move comes despite the continuing FBI investigation into the killing of 17 Iraqis by Blackwater staff guarding US officials in Baghdad last September .
Blackwater says its guards acted in self - defence .
An Iraqi inquiry concluded the shooting was unprovoked .
The security company 's contract was due to expire in May , but the government of Iraq said it had now set new criteria .
State department head of security Gregory Starr said on Friday the contract had been extended for another year .
Judicial violation ?
Iraq 's government said requests for tighter controls on Blackwater 's activities had been met .
The Americans want to show that Iraq is under their control
Iraqi opposition spokesman
" The demands of the Iraqi government have been taken into consideration and Blackwater will follow the Iraqi government 's laws , " said Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh .
However , the Iraqi government 's political opponents called the move a " violation of the Iraqi judicial system " .
" The government should have shown its influence and authority by taking the initiative , " a spokesman for the mainly Sunni Arab Accordance Front bloc told Reuters .
" But the Americans want to show that Iraq is under their control . "
' Unjustified ' deaths Blackwater employees have been used as guards and armed drivers in the US embassy complex in the Iraqi capital .
Essentially I think they do a very good job
Gregory Starr
State Department
The FBI started its investigation into the killing of 17 Iraqis in November .
That month , the New York Times reported the bureau had found that 14 of the deaths were unjustified .
When asked if the company 's contract could be cancelled if Blackwater was found at fault , Mr Starr was quoted by Reuters as saying : " We can terminate contracts at the convenience of the government if we have to . "
" I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going to find in their investigation .
I think really , it is complex .
I think that the US government needs protective services , " he said .
" Essentially I think they do a very good job .
The 16 September incident was a tragedy .
It has to be investigated carefully , " he added .
In October the Iraqi government approved a draft law revoking the immunity from prosecution that private security contractors enjoyed under Iraqi law .
The US has since put in place new guidelines for private security contractors .

What are these ?
Hillary Clinton crisscrossed Pennsylvania and unveiled a last - minute television ad invoking Pearl Harbor and Osama bin Laden , in hopes that a big victory in the state 's Democratic primary Tuesday could turn around her long - shot presidential bid .
While she is widely expected to win Pennsylvania , a new financial report showed the New York senator 's campaign struggling for cash .
That could limit her ability to stay competitive in the final nine Democratic contests with Barack Obama , who has considerably more money to spend on ...
It 's time for a little outrage .
POPLINE , a federally funded database of reproductive health information , has removed " abortion " as a possible search term .
A researcher wrote and asked why they were getting fewer results than before , and got this reply : INFO Project111 Market Place , Suite 310 , Baltimore , MD 21202I would also suggest contacting your senators and USAID directly .
Resource Shelf , and others have blogged this as well .
We are all basing it on the original email and the fact that if you search for " abortion " in Popline now , without applying fancier search techniques , you get no results .
My former taxonomy prof also wrote about it .
He makes the point that knowledge organization schemes always have a political viewpoint , which is true -- how we think the world is organized determines what we think it means .
But I think this all begs the point that popline is an open database for the public as well as researchers ; and this move effectively cuts off providing abortion information from this source .
Are such things unprecedented ?
No , of course not .
That does n't make it , however .
26.2 . Log-Shipping Standby Servers
Continuous archiving can be used to create a high availability ( HA ) cluster configuration with one or more standby servers ready to take over operations if the primary server fails .
This capability is widely referred to as warm standby or log shipping .
The primary and standby server work together to provide this capability , though the servers are only loosely coupled .
The primary server operates in continuous archiving mode , while each standby server operates in continuous recovery mode , reading the WAL files from the primary .
No changes to the database tables are required to enable this capability , so it offers low administration overhead compared to some other replication solutions .
This configuration also has relatively low performance impact on the primary server .
Directly moving WAL records from one database server to another is typically described as log shipping .
PostgreSQL implements file - based log shipping by transferring WAL records one file ( WAL segment ) at a time .
WAL files ( 16MB ) can be shipped easily and cheaply over any distance , whether it be to an adjacent system , another system at the same site , or another system on the far side of the globe .
The bandwidth required for this technique varies according to the transaction rate of the primary server .
Record - based log shipping is more granular and streams WAL changes incrementally over a network connection ( see Section 26.2.5 ) .
It should be noted that log shipping is asynchronous , i.e. , the WAL records are shipped after transaction commit .
As a result , there is a window for data loss should the primary server suffer a catastrophic failure ; transactions not yet shipped will be lost .
The size of the data loss window in file - based log shipping can be limited by use of the archive_timeout parameter , which can be set as low as a few seconds .
However such a low setting will substantially increase the bandwidth required for file shipping .
Streaming replication ( see Section 26.2.5 ) allows a much smaller window of data loss .
Recovery performance is sufficiently good that the standby will typically be only moments away from full availability once it has been activated .
As a result , this is called a warm standby configuration which offers high availability .
Restoring a server from an archived base backup and rollforward will take considerably longer , so that technique only offers a solution for disaster recovery , not high availability .
A standby server can also be used for read - only queries , in which case it is called a Hot Standby server .
See Section 26.5 for more information .
26.2.1 . Planning
It is usually wise to create the primary and standby servers so that they are as similar as possible , at least from the perspective of the database server .
In particular , the path names associated with tablespaces will be passed across unmodified , so both primary and standby servers must have the same mount paths for tablespaces if that feature is used .
Keep in mind that if CREATE TABLESPACE is executed on the primary , any new mount point needed for it must be created on the primary and all standby servers before the command is executed .
Hardware need not be exactly the same , but experience shows that maintaining two identical systems is easier than maintaining two dissimilar ones over the lifetime of the application and system .
In any case the hardware architecture must be the same — shipping from , say , a 32 - bit to a 64 - bit system will not work .
In general , log shipping between servers running different major PostgreSQL release levels is not possible .
It is the policy of the PostgreSQL Global Development Group not to make changes to disk formats during minor release upgrades , so it is likely that running different minor release levels on primary and standby servers will work successfully .
However , no formal support for that is offered and you are advised to keep primary and standby servers at the same release level as much as possible .
When updating to a new minor release , the safest policy is to update the standby servers first — a new minor release is more likely to be able to read WAL files from a previous minor release than vice versa .
26.2.2 . Standby Server Operation
In standby mode , the server continuously applies WAL received from the primary server .
The standby server can read WAL from a WAL archive ( see restore_command ) or directly from the primary over a TCP connection ( streaming replication ) .
The standby server will also attempt to restore any WAL found in the standby cluster 's pg_wal directory .
That typically happens after a server restart , when the standby replays again WAL that was streamed from the primary before the restart , but you can also manually copy files to pg_wal at any time to have them replayed .
At startup , the standby begins by restoring all WAL available in the archive location , calling restore_command .
Once it reaches the end of WAL available there and restore_command fails , it tries to restore any WAL available in the pg_wal directory .
If that fails , and streaming replication has been configured , the standby tries to connect to the primary server and start streaming WAL from the last valid record found in archive or pg_wal .
If that fails or streaming replication is not configured , or if the connection is later disconnected , the standby goes back to step 1 and tries to restore the file from the archive again .
This loop of retries from the archive , pg_wal , and via streaming replication goes on until the server is stopped or failover is triggered by a trigger file .
Standby mode is exited and the server switches to normal operation when pg_ctl promote is run , pg_promote ( ) is called , or a trigger file is found ( promote_trigger_file ) .
Before failover , any WAL immediately available in the archive or in pg_wal will be restored , but no attempt is made to connect to the primary .
26.2.3 . Preparing the Primary for Standby Servers
Set up continuous archiving on the primary to an archive directory accessible from the standby , as described in Section 25.3 .
The archive location should be accessible from the standby even when the primary is down , i.e. , it should reside on the standby server itself or another trusted server , not on the primary server .
If you want to use streaming replication , set up authentication on the primary server to allow replication connections from the standby server (s ) ; that is , create a role and provide a suitable entry or entries in pg_hba.conf with the database field set to replication .
Also ensure max_wal_senders is set to a sufficiently large value in the configuration file of the primary server .
If replication slots will be used , ensure that max_replication_slots is set sufficiently high as well .
Take a base backup as described in Section 25.3.2 to bootstrap the standby server .
26.2.4 . Setting Up a Standby Server
To set up the standby server , restore the base backup taken from primary server ( see Section 25.3.4 ) .
Create a file standby . signal in the standby 's cluster data directory .
Set restore_command to a simple command to copy files from the WAL archive .
If you plan to have multiple standby servers for high availability purposes , make sure that recovery_target_timeline is set to latest ( the default ) , to make the standby server follow the timeline change that occurs at failover to another standby .
Note
Do not use pg_standby or similar tools with the built - in standby mode described here .
restore_command should return immediately if the file does not exist ; the server will retry the command again if necessary .
See Section 26.4 for using tools like pg_standby .
If you want to use streaming replication , fill in primary_conninfo with a libpq connection string , including the host name ( or IP address ) and any additional details needed to connect to the primary server .
If the primary needs a password for authentication , the password needs to be specified in primary_conninfo as well .
If you 're setting up the standby server for high availability purposes , set up WAL archiving , connections and authentication like the primary server , because the standby server will work as a primary server after failover .
If you 're using a WAL archive , its size can be minimized using the archive_cleanup_command parameter to remove files that are no longer required by the standby server .
The pg_archivecleanup utility is designed specifically to be used with archive_cleanup_command in typical single - standby configurations , see pg_archivecleanup .
Note however , that if you 're using the archive for backup purposes , you need to retain files needed to recover from at least the latest base backup , even if they 're no longer needed by the standby .
A simple example of configuration is : primary_conninfo = ' host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo password=foopass options=''- c wal_sender_timeout=5000 ''' restore_command = 'cp / path/to/archive/%f %p ' archive_cleanup_command = ' pg_archivecleanup /path/to/archive %r '
You can have any number of standby servers , but if you use streaming replication , make sure you set max_wal_senders high enough in the primary to allow them to be connected simultaneously .
26.2.5 . Streaming Replication Streaming replication allows a standby server to stay more up - to - date than is possible with file - based log shipping .
The standby connects to the primary , which streams WAL records to the standby as they 're generated , without waiting for the WAL file to be filled .
Streaming replication is asynchronous by default ( see Section 26.2.8 ) , in which case there is a small delay between committing a transaction in the primary and the changes becoming visible in the standby .
This delay is however much smaller than with file - based log shipping , typically under one second assuming the standby is powerful enough to keep up with the load .
With streaming replication , archive_timeout is not required to reduce the data loss window .
If you use streaming replication without file - based continuous archiving , the server might recycle old WAL segments before the standby has received them .
If this occurs , the standby will need to be reinitialized from a new base backup .
You can avoid this by setting wal_keep_size to a value large enough to ensure that WAL segments are not recycled too early , or by configuring a replication slot for the standby .
If you set up a WAL archive that 's accessible from the standby , these solutions are not required , since the standby can always use the archive to catch up provided it retains enough segments .
To use streaming replication , set up a file - based log - shipping standby server as described in Section 26.2 .
The step that turns a file - based log - shipping standby into streaming replication standby is setting the primary_conninfo setting to point to the primary server .
Set listen_addresses and authentication options ( see pg_hba.conf ) on the primary so that the standby server can connect to the replication pseudo - database on the primary server ( see Section 26.2.5.1 ) .
On systems that support the keepalive socket option , setting tcp_keepalives_idle , tcp_keepalives_interval and tcp_keepalives_count helps the primary promptly notice a broken connection .
Set the maximum number of concurrent connections from the standby servers ( see max_wal_senders for details ) .
When the standby is started and primary_conninfo is set correctly , the standby will connect to the primary after replaying all WAL files available in the archive .
If the connection is established successfully , you will see a walreceiver in the standby , and a corresponding walsender process in the primary .
26.2.5.1 . Authentication
It is very important that the access privileges for replication be set up so that only trusted users can read the WAL stream , because it is easy to extract privileged information from it .
Standby servers must authenticate to the primary as an account that has the REPLICATION privilege or a superuser .
It is recommended to create a dedicated user account with REPLICATION and LOGIN privileges for replication .
While REPLICATION privilege gives very high permissions , it does not allow the user to modify any data on the primary system , which the SUPERUSER privilege does .
Client authentication for replication is controlled by a pg_hba.conf record specifying replication in the database field .
For example , if the standby is running on host IP 192.168.1.100 and the account name for replication is foo , the administrator can add the following line to the pg_hba.conf file on the primary : # Allow the user " foo " from host 192.168.1.100 to connect to the primary # as a replication standby if the user 's password is correctly supplied .
# # TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD host replication foo 192.168.1.100/32 md5
The host name and port number of the primary , connection user name , and password are specified in the primary_conninfo .
The password can also be set in the ~/. pgpass file on the standby ( specify replication in the database field ) .
For example , if the primary is running on host IP 192.168.1.50 , port 5432 , the account name for replication is foo , and the password is foopass , the administrator can add the following line to the postgresql.conf file on the standby : #
The standby connects to the primary that is running on host 192.168.1.50 # and port 5432 as the user " foo " whose password is " foopass " .
primary_conninfo = ' host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo password=foopass ' 26.2.5.2 .
Monitoring
An important health indicator of streaming replication is the amount of WAL records generated in the primary , but not yet applied in the standby .
You can calculate this lag by comparing the current WAL write location on the primary with the last WAL location received by the standby .
These locations can be retrieved using pg_current_wal_lsn on the primary and pg_last_wal_receive_lsn on the standby , respectively ( see Table 9.85 and Table 9.86 for details ) .
The last WAL receive location in the standby is also displayed in the process status of the WAL receiver process , displayed using the ps command ( see Section 27.1 for details ) .
You can retrieve a list of WAL sender processes via the pg_stat_replication view .
Large differences between pg_current_wal_lsn and the view 's sent_lsn field might indicate that the primary server is under heavy load , while differences between sent_lsn and pg_last_wal_receive_lsn on the standby might indicate network delay , or that the standby is under heavy load .
On a hot standby , the status of the WAL receiver process can be retrieved via the pg_stat_wal_receiver view .
A large difference between pg_last_wal_replay_lsn and the view 's flushed_lsn indicates that WAL is being received faster than it can be replayed .
26.2.6 .
Replication Slots Replication slots provide an automated way to ensure that the primary does not remove WAL segments until they have been received by all standbys , and that the primary does not remove rows which could cause a recovery conflict even when the standby is disconnected .
In lieu of using replication slots , it is possible to prevent the removal of old WAL segments using wal_keep_size , or by storing the segments in an archive using archive_command .
However , these methods often result in retaining more WAL segments than required , whereas replication slots retain only the number of segments known to be needed .
On the other hand , replication slots can retain so many WAL segments that they fill up the space allocated for pg_wal ; max_slot_wal_keep_size limits the size of WAL files retained by replication slots .
Similarly , hot_standby_feedback and vacuum_defer_cleanup_age provide protection against relevant rows being removed by vacuum , but the former provides no protection during any time period when the standby is not connected , and the latter often needs to be set to a high value to provide adequate protection .
Replication slots overcome these disadvantages .
26.2.6.1 . Querying and Manipulating Replication Slots Each replication slot has a name , which can contain lower - case letters , numbers , and the underscore character .
Existing replication slots and their state can be seen in the pg_replication_slots view .
Slots can be created and dropped either via the streaming replication protocol ( see Section 52.4 ) or via SQL functions ( see Section 9.27.6 ) .
26.2.6.2 . Configuration Example
You can create a replication slot like this : postgres= # SELECT * FROM pg_create_physical_replication_slot(' node_a_slot ' ) ; slot_name | lsn -------------+----- node_a_slot | postgres=# SELECT slot_name , slot_type , active FROM pg_replication_slots ; slot_name | slot_type | active -------------+-----------+--------
node_a_slot | physical | f ( 1 row )
To configure the standby to use this slot , primary_slot_name should be configured on the standby .
Here is a simple example : primary_conninfo = ' host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo password=foopass ' primary_slot_name = ' node_a_slot '
26.2.7 . Cascading Replication
The cascading replication feature allows a standby server to accept replication connections and stream WAL records to other standbys , acting as a relay .
This can be used to reduce the number of direct connections to the primary and also to minimize inter -site bandwidth overheads .
A standby acting as both a receiver and a sender is known as a cascading standby .
Standbys that are more directly connected to the primary are known as upstream servers , while those standby servers further away are downstream servers .
Cascading replication does not place limits on the number or arrangement of downstream servers , though each standby connects to only one upstream server which eventually links to a single primary server .
A cascading standby sends not only WAL records received from the primary but also those restored from the archive .
So even if the replication connection in some upstream connection is terminated , streaming replication continues downstream for as long as new WAL records are available .
Cascading replication is currently asynchronous .
Synchronous replication ( see Section 26.2.8 ) settings have no effect on cascading replication at present .
Hot Standby feedback propagates upstream , whatever the cascaded arrangement .
If an upstream standby server is promoted to become the new primary , downstream servers will continue to stream from the new primary if recovery_target_timeline is set to ' latest ' ( the default ) .
To use cascading replication , set up the cascading standby so that it can accept replication connections ( that is , set max_wal_senders and hot_standby , and configure host - based authentication ) .
You will also need to set primary_conninfo in the downstream standby to point to the cascading standby .
26.2.8 . Synchronous Replication PostgreSQL streaming replication is asynchronous by default .
If the primary server crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been replicated to the standby server , causing data loss .
The amount of data loss is proportional to the replication delay at the time of failover .
Synchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction have been transferred to one or more synchronous standby servers .
This extends that standard level of durability offered by a transaction commit .
This level of protection is referred to as 2 - safe replication in computer science theory , and group - 1 - safe ( group - safe and 1 - safe ) when synchronous_commit is set to remote_write .
When requesting synchronous replication , each commit of a write transaction will wait until confirmation is received that the commit has been written to the write - ahead log on disk of both the primary and standby server .
The only possibility that data can be lost is if both the primary and the standby suffer crashes at the same time .
This can provide a much higher level of durability , though only if the sysadmin is cautious about the placement and management of the two servers .
Waiting for confirmation increases the user 's confidence that the changes will not be lost in the event of server crashes but it also necessarily increases the response time for the requesting transaction .
The minimum wait time is the round - trip time between primary to standby .
Read only transactions and transaction rollbacks need not wait for replies from standby servers .
Subtransaction commits do not wait for responses from standby servers , only top - level commits .
Long running actions such as data loading or index building do not wait until the very final commit message .
All two - phase commit actions require commit waits , including both prepare and commit .
A synchronous standby can be a physical replication standby or a logical replication subscriber .
It can also be any other physical or logical WAL replication stream consumer that knows how to send the appropriate feedback messages .
Besides the built - in physical and logical replication systems , this includes special programs such as pg_receivewal and pg_recvlogical as well as some third - party replication systems and custom programs .
Check the respective documentation for details on synchronous replication support .
26.2.8.1 . Basic Configuration
Once streaming replication has been configured , configuring synchronous replication requires only one additional configuration step : synchronous_standby_names must be set to a non-empty value .
synchronous_commit must also be set to on , but since this is the default value , typically no change is required .
( See Section 19.5.1 and Section 19.6.2 . )
This configuration will cause each commit to wait for confirmation that the standby has written the commit record to durable storage .
synchronous_commit can be set by individual users , so it can be configured in the configuration file , for particular users or databases , or dynamically by applications , in order to control the durability guarantee on a per-transaction basis .
After a commit record has been written to disk on the primary , the WAL record is then sent to the standby .
The standby sends reply messages each time a new batch of WAL data is written to disk , unless wal_receiver_status_interval is set to zero on the standby .
In the case that synchronous_commit is set to remote_apply , the standby sends reply messages when the commit record is replayed , making the transaction visible .
If the standby is chosen as a synchronous standby , according to the setting of synchronous_standby_names on the primary , the reply messages from that standby will be considered along with those from other synchronous standbys to decide when to release transactions waiting for confirmation that the commit record has been received .
These parameters allow the administrator to specify which standby servers should be synchronous standbys .
Note that the configuration of synchronous replication is mainly on the primary .
Named standbys must be directly connected to the primary ; the primary knows nothing about downstream standby servers using cascaded replication .
Setting synchronous_commit to remote_write will cause each commit to wait for confirmation that the standby has received the commit record and written it out to its own operating system , but not for the data to be flushed to disk on the standby .
This setting provides a weaker guarantee of durability than on does : the standby could lose the data in the event of an operating system crash , though not a PostgreSQL crash .
However , it 's a useful setting in practice because it can decrease the response time for the transaction .
Data loss could only occur if both the primary and the standby crash and the database of the primary gets corrupted at the same time .
Setting synchronous_commit to remote_apply will cause each commit to wait until the current synchronous standbys report that they have replayed the transaction , making it visible to user queries .
In simple cases , this allows for load balancing with causal consistency .
Users will stop waiting if a fast shutdown is requested .
However , as when using asynchronous replication , the server will not fully shutdown until all outstanding WAL records are transferred to the currently connected standby servers .
26.2.8.2 .
Multiple Synchronous Standbys Synchronous replication supports one or more synchronous standby servers ; transactions will wait until all the standby servers which are considered as synchronous confirm receipt of their data .
The number of synchronous standbys that transactions must wait for replies from is specified in synchronous_standby_names .
This parameter also specifies a list of standby names and the method ( FIRST and ANY ) to choose synchronous standbys from the listed ones .
The method FIRST specifies a priority - based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to the requested number of synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities .
The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher priority and will be considered as synchronous .
Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys .
If any of the current synchronous standbys disconnects for whatever reason , it will be replaced immediately with the next - highest - priority standby .
An example of synchronous_standby_names for a priority - based multiple synchronous standbys is : synchronous_standby_names = ' FIRST 2 ( s1 , s2 , s3 ) '
In this example , if four standby servers s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 are running , the two standbys s1 and s2 will be chosen as synchronous standbys because their names appear early in the list of standby names .
s3 is a potential synchronous standby and will take over the role of synchronous standby when either of s1 or s2 fails .
s4 is an asynchronous standby since its name is not in the list .
The method ANY specifies a quorum - based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to at least the requested number of synchronous standbys in the list .
An example of synchronous_standby_names for a quorum - based multiple synchronous standbys is : synchronous_standby_names = ' ANY 2 ( s1 , s2 , s3 ) '
In this example , if four standby servers s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 are running , transaction commits will wait for replies from at least any two standbys of s1 , s2 and s3 .
s4 is an asynchronous standby since its name is not in the list .
The synchronous states of standby servers can be viewed using the pg_stat_replication view .
26.2.8.3 .
Planning for Performance Synchronous replication usually requires carefully planned and placed standby servers to ensure applications perform acceptably .
Waiting does n't utilize system resources , but transaction locks continue to be held until the transfer is confirmed .
As a result , incautious use of synchronous replication will reduce performance for database applications because of increased response times and higher contention .
PostgreSQL allows the application developer to specify the durability level required via replication .
This can be specified for the system overall , though it can also be specified for specific users or connections , or even individual transactions .
For example , an application workload might consist of : 10 % of changes are important customer details , while 90 % of changes are less important data that the business can more easily survive if it is lost , such as chat messages between users .
With synchronous replication options specified at the application level ( on the primary ) we can offer synchronous replication for the most important changes , without slowing down the bulk of the total workload .
Application level options are an important and practical tool for allowing the benefits of synchronous replication for high performance applications .
You should consider that the network bandwidth must be higher than the rate of generation of WAL data .
26.2.8.4 .
Planning for High Availability synchronous_standby_names specifies the number and names of synchronous standbys that transaction commits made when synchronous_commit is set to on , remote_apply or remote_write will wait for responses from .
Such transaction commits may never be completed if any one of synchronous standbys should crash .
The best solution for high availability is to ensure you keep as many synchronous standbys as requested .
This can be achieved by naming multiple potential synchronous standbys using synchronous_standby_names .
In a priority - based synchronous replication , the standbys whose names appear earlier in the list will be used as synchronous standbys .
Standbys listed after these will take over the role of synchronous standby if one of current ones should fail .
In a quorum - based synchronous replication , all the standbys appearing in the list will be used as candidates for synchronous standbys .
Even if one of them should fail , the other standbys will keep performing the role of candidates of synchronous standby .
When a standby first attaches to the primary , it will not yet be properly synchronized .
This is described as catchup mode .
Once the lag between standby and primary reaches zero for the first time we move to real - time streaming state .
The catch - up duration may be long immediately after the standby has been created .
If the standby is shut down , then the catch - up period will increase according to the length of time the standby has been down .
The standby is only able to become a synchronous standby once it has reached streaming state .
This state can be viewed using the pg_stat_replication view .
If primary restarts while commits are waiting for acknowledgment , those waiting transactions will be marked fully committed once the primary database recovers .
There is no way to be certain that all standbys have received all outstanding WAL data at time of the crash of the primary .
Some transactions may not show as committed on the standby , even though they show as committed on the primary .
The guarantee we offer is that the application will not receive explicit acknowledgment of the successful commit of a transaction until the WAL data is known to be safely received by all the synchronous standbys .
If you really cannot keep as many synchronous standbys as requested then you should decrease the number of synchronous standbys that transaction commits must wait for responses from in synchronous_standby_names ( or disable it ) and reload the configuration file on the primary server .
If the primary is isolated from remaining standby servers you should fail over to the best candidate of those other remaining standby servers .
If you need to re-create a standby server while transactions are waiting , make sure that the commands pg_start_backup ( ) and pg_stop_backup ( ) are run in a session with synchronous_commit = off , otherwise those requests will wait forever for the standby to appear .
Did Texas Officials Botch the Polygamy Bust ?
Some experts say it was wrong to remove polygamists ' children from families .
April 25 , 2008  --
Ever since the children were removed from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound , the state of Texas has maintained that it had no choice but to act .
" There was a clear pattern of sex abuse , of young girls being groomed to be sexually abused by older men and of young boys being groomed to become sexual predators , " Texas Child Protective Services told ABC News .
As a result , children as young as 2 years old have been abruptly separated from their mothers .
But Gary Gates , the founder of the Texas Center for Family Rights , and other family advocates said removing the children from their families should have been the very last option .
" It should only be done when there is an immediate danger to the health and safety of the children , not because CPS thinks there might be risk of abuse , not because CPS thinks differently of their religious beliefs , " Gates said .
Even so , child advocates warn that not acting aggressively is dangerous .
" If you can save four or five children from continued abuse by having to separate a couple of 100 children from their parents , you do the math .
Is it worth it ?
I would say so , " said Alan Steinberg of the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress in Los Angeles .
But some say there may have been another option .
Martin Guggenheim , a law professor at New York University , is one of them .
" That would be to try to get a court order to remove any adult who they have reason to believe might have violated the law , " he said .
There is a provision in Texas law that would have allowed for just that kind of action .
Officials could have removed the men who were the alleged abusers , leaving the children with their mothers .
Richard Wexler , executive director of Child Protection Reform , said , " They did n't need to be taken from their mothers .
Their mothers have been accused of nothing -- not of abusing them , not of harming them .
To tear the children from their mothers on top of all the other trauma is like pouring salt into an open wound . "
But Steinberg disagrees .
" For some children , it may be a relief .
For some children , it may be upsetting .
But I think it 's a mistake to think that separation equals trauma , " he said .
There obviously is no perfect solution in such an unusual case .
But these extreme circumstances , which involve so many children , are precisely why some are asking if the state should have taken a different course .
Texas authorities maintain they 're absolutely certain they 've done the right thing to protect the safety of the 437 children .

Bear Stearns Customers Were Not at Risk
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

Thursday 's Senate Banking Committee hearing regarding the Fed 's involvement in the purchase of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan was somewhat enlightening , but also disturbing .
Probably the most important and responsible statements came from Christopher Cox , the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , who correctly noted that " Despite the run on the bank to which Bear Stearns was subjected , its customers were fully protected . "
Cox continued " At no time during the week of March 10th through the 17th were any of the customers of the Bear Stearns ' broker - dealers at risk of losing their cash or their securities . "
Cox also clarified the distinction between capital ( a solvency buffer ) and liquidity , noting that SEC regulations are designed to ensure the adequacy of both .
But he noted that the surprise in the Bear Stearns case - not well covered by existing regulations - was the unforeseen possibility that the markets would be unwilling to provide capital that was fully collateralized even by Treasury securities and the mortgage securities of government sponsored entities like Fannie Mae .
My impression is that this is exactly the situation in which the Fed has an important role - the short - term provision of liquidity against government - backed collateral .
The Fed always had the ability to provide funds to Bear Stearns , fully collateralized by Treasury and agency securities of the type and quality regularly accepted by the Fed , with the expectation of being made entirely whole even in the event that Bear Stearns went bankrupt .
The troubling aspect of the Fed 's action was not that it lent to a non -bank entity .
That ability is clearly authorized by Section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
The problem is that it made its " loans " as " non-recourse " funding - meaning that it would not stand to be repaid if the collateral itself was to fail , even if Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan survived .
This feature converted the " loans " by the Fed into unauthorized " put options , " benefiting private entities at potential public expense .
This is a terrible precedent , and it deserves far more scrutiny and reluctance before we accept that this was the only available option .
Another troubling aspect was that shortly after making an initial non-recourse loan to Bear Stearns , and indicating the funds would be available for " as much as 28 days , " the Fed pulled the funding over the weekend .
By doing so , the Fed itself forced the de facto collapse of Bear Stearns .
Bear Stearns ' CEO Alan Schwartz testified " We believed at the time that the loan and corresponding back - stop from the New York Fed would be available for 28 days .
We hoped this period would be sufficient to bring order to the chaos and allow us to secure more permanent funding or an orderly disposition of assets to raise cash , if that became necessary . "
As the New York Times summarized , " by the end of the day , with continuing problems surfacing and the downgrading of the firm 's credit rating , he said he was told by the Federal Reserve of New York that he had misunderstood the terms of the deal .
He was told that the loan would expire on Sunday , and that he had to find a buyer for the bank by then â€ ” before the Asian markets opened .
The decision , Mr. Schwartz testified , left him with no negotiating leverage as talks proceeded with JPMorgan .
" On Friday night , we learned that the JPMorgan credit facility would not be available beyond Sunday night , " Mr. Schwartz said .
" The choices we faced that Friday night were stark : find a party willing to acquire Bear Stearns by Sunday night , or face what my advisers were telling me could be a bankruptcy filing on Monday morning , which could likely wipe out our shareholders and cause losses for certain of our creditors and all of our employees . "
Note that Schwartz did n't say " losses for our customers and counterparties . "
He did n't , because he could n't .
As SEC Chairman
Cox noted previously , there was never a point where Bear 's customers and counterparties were at risk .
What 's in that $ 30 billion " portfolio " ?
The odd secrecy and vague description of the portfolio of assets held by the Fed is , let 's say , curious .
On what might be called the " bright side , " evidently , a good portion of the collateral taken by the Fed in the Bear Stearns deal represents government mortgage obligations , including those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The portfolio also includes non-agency securities rated BBB - or higher among its " cash assets . "
The characterization of these as " investment grade " is not reassuring , given that many such structured mortgage securities maintain such ratings only because of bond insurance from companies that are themselves increasingly in question .
More troublesome is the part of the portfolio described as " related hedges . "
The question here is that the net value of a so - called " portfolio " might be $ 30 billion , but the gross or " notional " value of the portfolio can conceivably be a substantial multiple of that .
If you own $ 100 billion in assets , but have $ 70 billion in offsetting liabilities against that , then sure , you 've got a portfolio " worth " $ 30 billion , but as Long - Term Capital Management discovered , you could end up losing a whole lot more than $ 30 billion , depending on how well those assets and " hedges " offset .
The description is just unclear - I would be a lot more comfortable about this if we were assured that the total notional value of the portfolio held by the Fed does not exceed $ 30 billion .
We should also know what portion of that $ 30 billion represents strictly government agency obligations .
That would clarify how large the maximum potential loss might be on this portfolio of " cash assets and related hedges . "
If the collateral was just a plain vanilla portfolio of securities , literally the only reason for the Fed to do the " non-recourse " loan would be to protect Bear Stearns ' bondholders from losses , since J.P. Morgan was willing to assume all customer accounts and counterparty liabilities of Bear Stearns , plus over $ 75 billion in debt obligations to Bear Stearns bondholders , yet needed only $ 30 billion of Federal assurances to do it .
Think of Bear Stearns ' assets as being divided into two boxes .
One box holds $ 45 billion worth of valuable customer relationships ( the actual customer securities are segregated and are not at risk even if the company fails ) and a " book " of investment positions and transactions , including claims and obligations to counterparties .
In the other box is either $ 30 billion in mortgage - backed securities , or a pile of packing peanuts .
The only thing not in one of those two boxes is a $ 75 billion liability to Bear Stearns own bondholders ( we 'll assume that shareholder equity has already been wiped out ) .
How much would an acquirer pay ?
Well , if you were J.P. Morgan , you would say : I 'll take the $ 45 billion worth of known , valuable stuff , and the Fed can have the mystery box in return for $ 30 billion .
That gives me $ 75 billion in assets .
I 'll also take on the $ 75 billion in Bear Stearns debt .
And of course , since the assets I 'm getting are worth the same as the liabilities , I 'm going to pay essentially nothing for the deal .
If you were Ben Bernanke , you would say , " I can't lose !
I love packing peanuts ! "
This is the deal that was actually struck .
But why did n't J.P. Morgan say : I 'll take the $ 45 billion of valuable stuff , and the mystery box .
In that case , even if J.P. Morgan thought the box contained packing peanuts , it would still have been willing to pay a minimum of $ 45 billion for those boxes , provided it did not take on any of the debt to Bear Stearns bondholders .
Customers and counterparties would have been protected , and despite " technical " default for Bear Stearns ' bonds , there would have been enough to pay at least 60 % , and possibly 100 % of bondholder claims , without the need for public funds .
In this case , if you were Ben Bernanke , you could have said , fine , we 'll stand behind that deal and provide a loan of $ 30 billion , or even $ 45 billion in medium - term liquidity to facilitate that outcome .
But you , J.P. Morgan , the bank , will have to put up Treasury and government agency collateral , and assume all risk of the deal .
The Fed 's only risk , in that case , would have been the risk that J.P. Morgan itself would default .
Instead , Bernanke 's actual response was apparently " Nope !
I want a shot at those packing peanuts !
And we ought to be using public funds to bail out Bear Stearns ' bondholders ! "
So that 's what they did .
In any event , the markets do not care about Bear Stearns ' stockholders or its bondholders .
The only thing they care about is that J.P. Morgan is willing to stand behind all the customer accounts and counterparty obligations of Bear Stearns .
That commitment could have been achieved without the commitment of public funds , because the value of that book was unquestionably positive .
As I noted last week , Title IX of the 2005 Bankruptcy
Act includes expanded provisions for the rapid transfer and netting of derivatives and over - the - counter obligations of the sort to which Bear Stearns was a party .
Current law does not allow broker - dealers to cherry pick counterparties that owe them , and default on counterparties that are owed .
There was no risk of a long delay or " automatic stay " even if Bear had nominally defaulted on its bonds .
As for actions that might have prevented Bear 's sudden collapse , Timothy Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , indicated that the Fed had not made funds available to Bear earlier in the week , saying " I would not have been comfortable lending to Bear at that time .
We only lend to sound institutions .
Lending freely to Bear would not have been a prudent act . "
Evidently it was prudent to commit $ 30 billion in public funds without the assurance of being made whole .
On Friday , former Fed official Robert McTeer gave high marks to Geithner on CNBC for his performance during the Senate hearing .
Adding to the impression that the hearings had not been entirely illuminating , McTeer 's praise included an odd compliment that Geithner had " answered the questions that he answered very well , and he dodged some questions very beautifully too , and he got away with it . "
Among those was a question by the Committee to the effect that while it was clear that Bear Stearns ' shareholders had not been " bailed out , " the same could not be said for Bear Stearns ' bondholders - did n't this send a signal to the credit markets that could encourage excessive risk taking in the belief that the government stood behind the bonds of private companies ?
Geithner gave a general response that credit spreads among financial companies remained relatively wide , so the market had not been provided with that sort of confidence .
There was no follow - up question .
The Senate Banking Committee never put two and two together that the primary beneficiaries of the Fed 's action had been Bear Stearns ' bondholders , while Bear 's customers were never at risk .
The upshot is that the Fed could have provided early , fully - collateralized liquidity to Bear Stearns , but failed to do so .
It then provided emergency funding to Bear Stearns as a " non-recourse " loan , but promptly called in those funds over the weekend , forcing Bear Stearns into a corner .
Though customers and counterparties were never at risk of loss , Bear Stearns feared for its own shareholders , its bondholders and its employees .
The Federal Reserve could have provided Bear with short - term , fully collateralized funds through the weekend , allowing Bear Stearns more bargaining time , but instead , it provided public funds in return for a long - term investment in questionable collateral to finance a private transaction between Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan .
The effect of this public guarantee was to defend the value of a private company 's bonds .
But we 're all OK with this , I guess , so barring any substantial new developments , this is the last I 'll write extensively about it .
In any event , SEC Chairman Cox is right - Bear Stearns ' customers and counterparties were never at risk of loss .
Though counterparties do n't have the SIPC protections , they did in the Bear Stearns instance have a substantial capital wall and legal safe harbors specifically designed to limit systemic problems .
There was a willing buyer for Bear 's entire book , so the book did n't need to be unwound , just sold in its entirety on day one .
Major U.S. financial companies have enough capital ( shareholder equity and bondholder debt ) to provide a cushion in the event of substantial writeoffs , without customers or counterparties being at risk of loss in the event of outright bankruptcy .
The only instance where there would be a question would be if the book value of the failing company was negative after entirely zeroing out all shareholder equity and bondholder debt , or if the only way to liquidate the book was to unwind it .
That was not the case for Bear Stearns .
As I said a couple of weeks ago , if we keep on believing that the default of Bear Stearns bonds ( " bankruptcy " ) would have caused a global financial crash , then I expect that we are in for a global financial crash anyway .
Not because there is any true risk to customers and counterparties , but because investors are misinformed about how the financial markets work , and they will panic as foreclosures and writedowns inevitably soar in the months ahead .
A financial panic is fully avoidable if Wall Street and the media stop propagating the utterly false belief that a Bear Stearns bankruptcy would have led to a " chain reaction " of financial losses .
While we might very well see some over - leveraged firms go bankrupt , with substantial losses to their own stockholders and bondholders , the customers and counterparties are generally not at risk if there is enough stockholders equity and bondholder capital to eat through without leaving the remaining book value negative .
Bankruptcy or no bankruptcy , the underlying book of assets and liabilities can be transferred quickly .
The only question is how much the bondholders come away with .
That " chain reaction " theory is just utterly irresponsible fearmongering .
Look .
I would welcome lower stock market valuations because they would increase prospective long - term returns enough to accept a significant amount of market risk , but I have no desire to see the financial markets in distress .
The U.S. economy will get through this , but the credit problems are not over .
Even if they were , the U.S. stock market would still be vulnerable because the valuations of recent years have been based on unsustainably high profit margins .
Unfortunately , profit margins are cyclical , and competitive forces bring them down over time .
So even if investors are inclined to celebrate the Fed 's intervention over the near term , it does not alter the broader risk to stock market values .
In short , stocks are still vulnerable , but there is no need for an outright financial panic , and no need to misuse public funds to benefit the bondholders of individual companies .
I am very concerned that investors and even Congress have swallowed the " chain reaction " theory hook , line and sinker .
The fact that they have makes me more concerned about crash risk , not less .
In any event , it is wishful to believe that a $ 30 billion misuse of public funds has suddenly put problems of mortgage foreclosures , profit margin risks , rich valuations , and an oncoming ( not outgoing ) recession behind us .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate in stocks was characterized by unfavorable valuations and still unfavorable market action , holding the Strategic Growth Fund to a fully hedged investment stance .
Market action has been relatively good even in the face of poor employment numbers and upward revisions in job losses .
Moreover , new claims for unemployment shot above 400,000 last week , as is characteristic of early recessions .
The first chart on Bill Hester 's recent piece ( Recessions and the Duration of Bad News ) provides a good picture of where the economy probably stands .
New claims are an early , not late indicator of recessions .
Counter to the assertions that the current job losses are simply a delayed reflection of a credit crisis that is now averted thanks to Uncle Ben , my impression is that the difficulties in the job market and in profit margins are early in the making .
Nonetheless , we 'll respond to the evidence as it emerges .
If market action improves , we would expect to reduce the short - call side of our hedges moderately .
Unfortunately , valuations are still too rich to remove hedges outright , but lifting off a portion of the short calls would open up the potential to participate in any sustained speculative run .
I use the word " speculative " because the elevated valuations suggest there is no compelling long - term " investment " merit in accepting market risk .
While we are willing to lift a moderate portion of our short calls if the recent improvement in market action broadens further , my guess ( and it 's presently only a guess ) is that the market may be vulnerable to a steep break here .
From the fact that I have an opinion on market direction , you can immediately infer that the market is either a ) overbought in an unfavorable Market Climate , or b ) oversold in a favorable Market Climate .
At present , of course , the answer is a ) .
Such conditions do n't guarantee a market slide , but the average outcomes are not good .
We are hedged and defensive here .
The only thing that would improve the current picture would be for the Market Climate itself to shift as a result improved market internals .
In effect , further strength would tend to confirm and reinforce a speculative mood among investors .
With earnings season upon us , a great deal will depend on guidance about coming quarters .
This could be an Achilles ' heel , but we 'll take our evidence as it comes , and respond accordingly .
In bonds , the Market Climate remains characterized by unfavorable yield levels and relatively neutral yield trends .
The StrategicTotal Return Fund continues to have an unusually short duration of about 1 year , largely in Treasury bills .
The Fund also has just over 15 % of assets in precious metals shares , where the Market Climate remains favorable .
As I 've noted before , at the point where real interest rates become positive and trend higher , we may observe a softening in commodities .
Presently , we do n't observe that , but it is important to keep in mind that the strength in commodities largely mirrors a persistent decline in U.S. real interest rates , and in the value of the U.S. dollar .
As the downward pressure on real interest rates abates , so most probably will the upward pressure on commodity prices , particularly as measured in US dollars .

With the war in Iraq , the faltering economy , and health care dominating the issues front for the candidates , it ’s no wonder technology issues have largely been back - burnered in the mainstream political debate .
But that does n’t make them any less relevant or important–or less requiring of coverage .
CNet ’s Declan McCullagh and Anne Broache sent 10 technology - oriented questions to the candidates , discussing net neutrality , Internet taxation , REAL ID , wiretapping , and other issues , and CNet has published the answers as part of their Technology Voter ’s Guide .
After the jump , we ’ll take a closer look at who answered ( and who did n’t ) , and what they said .
So far , the guide has answers from Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , Ron Paul and John McCain , with John Edwards and Chris Dodd ’s answers still to come .
It ’s worth noting that none of the frontrunner Republican candidates answered this questionnaire–not Romney , Giuliani , or Huckabee .
On the Dem side , Neither Biden nor Richardson have a realistic chance of winning the nomination at this point , nor have either of them made technology innovation a primary focus of their campaigns , so their failing to answer is understandable , if regrettable .
( Note that CNet apparently did n’t bother to include Dennis Kucinich or Mike Gravel . )
I urge everyone interested to read each questionnaire in depth , but here ’re brief summaries :
John McCain favors a very hands - off , pro-market approach to technology issues .
He opposes net neutrality laws and government actions to increase broadband development .
He claims to oppose illegal wiretapping , but defers the question of retroactive immunity for telecom companies to following the “ process ” of investigating what they did .
He supports REAL ID , opposes Internet taxation , is a strong proponent of greater regulation of social networking sites against sexual predators , and would favor expansion of H1 - B visas for skilled immigrants according to “ market conditions . ”
Ron Paul , as you might expect , is pretty much anti-everything that would increase government activity with regard to technology .
He ’s against net neutrality legislation , and opposes REAL ID , warrantless wiretapping , regulation of social networking sites , governmental retention of data records from ISPs , and supports a permanent Internet tax ban and expansion of the H1 - B program .
Hillary Clinton sees a much more central role for government in spurring broadband development and adoption , including offering tax incentives for building new connections in rural areas and improving the FCC ’s data collection efforts on broadband penetration .
She evinces strong support for net neutrality , tends to favor stronger laws against copyright infringement and tracking sex offenders , and supports expanding the H1 - B visa program and extending the moratorium on Internet taxation .
Barack Obama supports full broadband availability for all Americans , and wants reformation of the Universal Service Fund as well as tax incentives and grants in order to spur development and ensure the money is spent right .
In his words , he will “ take a backseat to no one in his support of net neutrality , ” and opposes warrantless wiretapping and retroactive immunity , as well as REAL ID .
Obama advocates a stronger look at privacy policies and legislation for companies that trade in the sharing of information , prefers shifting a focus towards funding law enforcement over targeting social networking sites for sex offenders , and wants America to turn out more skilled workers with IT abilities ( especially among minorities ) in order to compete with H1 - B holders .
As a thumbnail analysis , all of the candidates have responded in manners consistent with their positions , even if their positions are n’t always consistent .
McCain ’s “ hands off ” attitude toward the Internet seems grounded in his very cushy relationship with certain telecom lobbyists , and is at odds with his “ Protect the children ! ” attitude about social networking sites and willingness to support governmental intrusions into American lives in the name of “ security . ”
Paul ’s answers are consistent with his Libertarian leanings –if it ’s from the government , he wants it gone .
I respect his cohesive policy framework , even if his attitude about net neutrality and broadband development is dead wrong .
Clinton ’s answers are a frustrating mix of progressive innovation and regressive corporatism to me .
While I think she ’s on point with providing incentives towards broadband development , her support of expanding the H1 - B visa program strikes a sour note when you consider how many American IT professionals are out of work , having been outsourced or replaced by foreign nationals working at lower pay .
Obama ’s answers are the most forward - thinking for me , especially when he makes a point of addressing how our education system is not only failing minorities in general , but specifically in technology and tech - related areas , and that we ca n’t rely on foreign workers to fill that gap forever .
And to this date , no candidate has eclipsed him on the net neutrality issue that I can see .
Overall , I ’m unsurprised at these answers , but glad to have them in concrete to refer to for the future .
I ’ll publish a follow - up post next week once Edwards ’ and Dodd ’s positions are live .
This is a welcome and necessary look at how our potential leaders have ( or do n’t have ) a handle on some extremely relevant issues of technology that affect us all .

Whether the problem is feeding a hungry world or simply increasing the productivity of a small backyard garden , the solution might well be biodynamic gardening .
Back in 1966 Alan Chadwick — an English actor , painter , pianist , and master horticulturist — was offered a chance to demonstrate the techniques of biodynamic ( aka French intensive ) gardening on a barren four - acre clay hillside at the University of California 's Santa Cruz campus .
Chadwick tackled the little " desert " ( land that was so inhospitable that few weeds even grew there ) with hand tools , a love for the garden that he knew the plot could become , and incredible energy .
Before long the once dead - looking slope was a veritable paradise of vegetables and flowers , and a beacon that attracted students and followers .
Since then , biodynamic gardening ( often referred to as permaculture or " the method " ) has slowly gained a reputation among organic gardeners in North America , largely through the efforts of Chadwick and John Jeavons ( of Ecology Action of the Mid-Peninsula in Stanford , California ) .
It was Jeavons who eventually took the technique — which Chadwick had synthesized from the intensive gardening practiced in turn - of - the - century France and the biodynamic theories developed by Rudolf Steiner in early 20th century Austria — and subjected it to careful modification and testing .
He was always striving to produce the optimum yield from the smallest possible space .
And John 's harvests have been little short of amazing !
His per-acre " method " crop production has , for example , climbed to between four and six times that of the average U.S. yield ( while , in rare cases , the biodynamic gardens have produced as much as 31 times the national crop average for a given amount of space ! ) .
In fact , Jeavons has gone so far as to estimate that it would be possible for an urban , suburban , or rural gardener to net as much as $ 10,000 a year from the produce that he or she could grow on a scant 1/10 acre !
- Advertisement -
Furthermore , as if such incredible results were n't enough to recommend this revolutionary gardening technique , the biodynamic system uses no polluting fuel , no toxic pesticides , and no highly processed chemical fertilizers .
In fact , the technique actually improves the quality of the soil with each crop that 's grown !
And it does so while using only 1/100 as much energy and 1/8 as much water as does commercial agriculture .
How Is Biodynamic Gardening Done ?
All the different facets of the permaculture method serve to allow the gardener to produce as many healthy plants as possible on a given piece of land .
The raised beds that are characteristic of such gardens , for instance , serve several purposes .
First , since the growing areas are wider than are " normal " garden rows ( approximately five feet ... in order to allow the gardener to reach plants in the middle without stepping on , and compacting , the soil in the bed ) , less space must be wasted on walkways .
The rectangular beds are raised from four to 10 inches above the original ground level , too , and their edges are angled down at a 45 * slope ... effectively providing more ( curved ) surface area than if the same piece of ground were left flat .
But the document said that there were cases in which such approval was not required : when American forces were in hot pursuit of former members of Mr. Hussein ’s government or terrorists .
Approval by the defense secretary “ is not required to conduct uninterrupted pursuit and engagement of positively identified former regime military aircraft , terrorist and senior [ former ] military leadership and senior nonmilitary elements of former Iraqi regime command and control across international borders , ” the document said .
It stated that the American commander engaged in the pursuit , however , should consult with top commanders in Baghdad , “ time permitting . ”
It is not known if the authority to conduct hot pursuits across the Iranian and Syrian borders was ever used or what authority exists today .
In October 2005 , The New York Times reported that there had been a series of clashes between Army Rangers and Syrian troops along the border with Iraq .
According to the 2005 document , American forces were also authorized to respond to a “ hostile force ” that used Syrian or Iranian territory to attack American troops in Iraq or that posed an “ imminent threat ” to American operations there .
They were instructed to consult with a senior American commander if there was time .
Apparently in a carryover from the intelligence failures of the Iraq invasion in early 2003 , the document says the United States Central Command , which oversees operations in the Middle East , gave American commanders in Iraq the authority to attack mobile “ W. M.D. labs ” ; such labs for making germ weapons were later determined not to exist .
The 2005 document also referred to a Central Command list of the “ hostile forces ” that may be “ engaged and destroyed . ”
It focused heavily on Mr. Hussein ’s former security forces , like the Special Republican Guard and members of the Baath Party militia that were said to have shifted from “ overt conventional resistance to insurgent methods of resistance . ”
Reflecting the clash the year before between American forces and Mr. Sadr ’s militia , the document said the militia and other armed supporters of the cleric had also been on the list of paramilitary forces deemed to be “ hostile . ”
L. Paul Bremer III , the head of the American occupation authority in Iraq until June 2004 , had branded Mr. Sadr an outlaw , and an Iraqi judge had issued a secret warrant for his arrest .
But a truce was later worked out with Mr. Sadr , and Iraqi politicians sought to bring him into the political process .
Apparently as a result of those developments , the rules of engagement were modified .
Referring to Mr. Sadr and the Mahdi Army , the document says : “ Their status as a declared hostile force , however , is suspended and such individuals will not be engaged except in self - defense . ”
The extreme thickness of its bones is a trait seen often in animals that are aquatic waders ( thick , heavy bones counteract buoyancy and allow the animal to stay underwater more easily ) , and chemical traces in its teeth indicate that the animal ate plants in a freshwater environment .
Scientists know that Indohyus belongs in the evolutionary path with whales because it has skeletal similarities to both modern whales and known primordial whale ancestors .
Foods to Never Use
This list is of foods that were generally unknown in the Middle Ages .
Please be aware that turkey , the large drumstick of which is ubiquitous at the modern Renaissance Faire , is included here , as well as potatoes .
Neither of these foods , so often erroneously associated with medieval feasts , should be served at any authentic medieval dinner , in addition to the rest of the modern or New World items mentioned here .
Foods To Never Use List Allspice - a New World food item , also called Jamaican Pepper .
Artichokes Bananas - known about , but still a foreign fruit and considered exotic .
Their short shelf - life prohibited easy transportation to Europe .
Sir John Mandeville ( 14th c. ) writes of them in his Travels and refers to them as " long apples " & " apples of paradise . "
Broccoli - although a variety of broccoli was known by the Romans , it was not introduced into France until the 1500's and not into England until the 1720's , making it a rather unknown vegetable during medieval times .
Chili Peppers Chocolate - New World .
Cocoa - New World .
Coffee - did not reach Europe until after the Middle Ages , but was common in Arabia by the medieval period .
Cranberries Green Beans Green Peppers Iceberg Lettuce Indian Corn - our modern corn , the large cobs with yellow , white , or brown kernels .
Kiwi Margarine - an invention of the modern food - chemistry industry .
Peanuts Pineapple Potatoes - despite their association with Ireland , potatoes originally came from South America .
Red Peppers Rhubarb - like the banana , possibly known about but never used .
Shortening - an invention of the modern food - chemistry industry .
Tea - did not reach Europe until after the Middle Ages .
Turkey - Turkey is a New World food that reached Asia Minor only after 1500 and did not come into general use in Europe until the mid 16th century .
( Turkey is documented as being in London markets by the 1540's . )
They are perfectly period for Tudor or Elizabethan feasts , but not for either the Middle Ages or most of the Renaissance .
( The debate on when the Renaissance ended is still on going , but many historians agree that it was over in most of Europe by the early to mid 1500's . )
Many medieval themed restaurants and Renaissance Fairs should be sternly admonished for serving turkey ( and potatoes ) as authentic food !
The only instance in which turkey should be considered for a modern medieval dinner is as a replacement for peacock or swan , two large birds not readily available for the kitchen today and whose meat is not nearly as tender & moist as turkey .
There is also evidence to show that before 1540 - 50 , the bird Europeans often called " turkey " was actually the West African Guinea Fowl ; Webster 's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary says of the name turkey : " confusion with the guinea fowl , supposed to be imported from Turkish territory ( 1555 ) "
One theory claims that Europeans took to the North American turkey faster than they did to other New World foods ( such as the tomato ) because of its resemblance , in both physical form and in its name , to the Guinea Fowl , frequently referred to as a " turkey . "
Tomatoes - a member of the Nightshade family , it was considered inedible or poisonous .
Vanilla Bean Yams - New World .
Yellow Peppers
Paris , New York , December 7 , 2007 – Human rights groups issued an open letter [ attached below ] yesterday to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner detailing dangerous repercussions of a decision to dismiss a complaint filed on October , 25 , 2007 against Donald Rumsfeld for acts of torture .
The groups include the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , the International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) , the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights ( ECCHR ) and the French League for Human Rights ( LDH ) .
The letter is directed at Kouchner because the Paris prosecutor cited a Foreign Ministry opinion that Rumsfeld was immune from prosecution despite specific language to the contrary in international laws and treaties , particularly the 1984 Convention Against Torture , to which France is a signatory .
It also points out contradictions in the Ministry ’s support for the prosecutions of former heads of state for serious crimes and questions the motives and the independence of the decision .
The letter states , “ Your Department 's interpretation amounts to giving de facto impunity for all former high - level officials responsible for international crimes and turns the French territory into a haven for torturers .
Its only objective is to give priority to the diplomatic and political relationships between states over justice and the rule of law . ”
“ The Foreign Minister ’s interpretation is a giant step backward from the movement toward accountability for heinous crimes which has characterized the development of international law since Nuremberg , ” said CCR President Michael Ratner .
According to attorneys in the case , former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld , on a private visit to France , cannot be granted criminal immunity under conventional or customary international law .
On the contrary it has been well established that , after leaving office , immunity from criminal jurisdiction cannot be applied to acts of such gravity , defined as crimes under international law , as illustrated by the statute of the International Criminal Court which does not uphold any immunity .
According to rights experts , acts of torture cannot seriously be considered part of anyone ’s official functions .
The same principle has been applied to former heads of state , as demonstrated in the case of General Augusto Pinochet , against whom no immunity was found following an order issued by a Belgian investigating judge , as well as in a decision of the United Kingdom ’s House of Lords .
This international jurisprudence should be very well known to the Paris Prosecutor in charge of the Rumsfeld case , who signed an order himself calling for General Pinochet to appear before the Paris Court of Appeals .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - About 60 protesters opposed to the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s help in bailing out Bear Stearns entered the lobby of the investment bank ’s Manhattan headquarters on Wednesday , demanding assistance for struggling homeowners .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
Demonstrators organized by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America chanted “ Help Main Street , not Wall Street ” and entered the lobby without an invitation for around half an hour before being escorted out by police .
“ There are no provisions for homeowners in this deal .
There are people out there struggling who need help , ” said Detria Austin , an organizer at NACA , an advocacy group for home ownership .
Bear Stearns employees were amused and perplexed , some taking pictures .
One man in the lobby applauded .
“ Homeowners , that ’s more than $ 1 trillion ( in mortgage debt ) , you ’re crazy , ” another man in a suit screamed at a protester on the street .
The protesters blamed Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase & CoCo employees for helping fuel the mortgage crisis .
Demand for mortgage debt from investment banks including Bear Stearns encouraged lenders to drop standards to create new loans .
Some lenders resorted to scams and fraud to initiate loans .
The banks repackaged and resold the debt to investors .
“ Blame the mortgage tsunami on Bear Stearns , ” read one sign .
Another read , “ Bear Stearns employees are n’t worth $ 2 . ”
After leaving Bear Stearns , the crowd moved to JPMorgan .
“ We will go to their neighborhood , we will educate their children on what their parents do .
They should be ashamed , ” NACA founder Bruce Marks said of employees at both banks .
On March 16 , JPMorgan Chase & said it would acquire its rival the Bear Stearns Co Inc. for $ 2 per share , in a deal brokered by the Federal Reserve aimed at heading off a bankruptcy and a spreading crisis of confidence in the global financial system .
On Monday , JPMorgan raised its offer to about $ 10 a share to appease angry stockholders who vowed to fight the original deal .
Bear Stearns traded at $ 11.25 a share at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday , up 2.8 percent .
As part of the deal , the Fed agreed to guarantee up to $ 29 billion of Bear Stearns assets .
The agreement has raised concerns that the U.S. government is prepared to help rescue a failing Wall Street bank while declining to bail out millions of home owners facing the possibility of foreclosure .
Occasionally encounters with human intelligence can be entirely bewildering .
Suddenly you ’re faced with the fact that other minds move in the same world and speak the same language , and yet have thoughts and intellectual processes going on that are entirely alien – and superior – to your own .
That ’s certainly how it feels to be shown the work of Eskil Steenberg , while sat at a spare table in a GDC conference hall .
Steenberg ’s temperamental laptop might not have wanted to help out , but what we saw flickering on that screen was astonishing and somewhat unsettling .
Steenberg is working on quite a different plane .
Not just from wishful luddites like me , but also other developers and artists .
He casually chats away about the procedural multiplayer adventure that he ’s creating by himself , and in doing so reveals glimpses of a kind of creative genius that you ’d be lucky to find anywhere , but that you could only find in the games industry .
Steenberg is an artist and a prodigiously talented programmer .
He has both the vision and the technical skill to create something spectacular , all on his own .
Hell , if Eskil gives up tomorrow and never gets this game out to its audience it will still be important to me .
Just the idea that one man can set out to make an mini MMO that looks like lavish impressionistic artwork brought to life … well , just look at it .
In motion it was suggestive of a smokey , dynamically lit version of Okami .
He pulled up his tools , applications for object rendering and design that are more like game interfaces than things designed for hard work .
In fact , as he ’s showing us some graphical tech he suddenly clicks on a ghostly spaceship that ’s passing over his rendered street scene and the tool window instantly becomes a game of Asteroids .
As I said ; bewildering .
The game itself , dubbed Love ( as in For The Love Of Game Development ) , is an exploration - based moderately - multiplayer FPS with astounding impressionistic visuals and a procedurally generated universe .
Since Steenberg is a one man show , he ’s relying on clever maths to build the world for him and then clever gamers to come in and help him figure out where to take it , and what to do with it .
So far he ’s already populated it with weird animals and wondrous , gaseous visuals , and he intends to build the world into a kind of communal adventure , where gamers work together to furnish a central village , defend it from enemy attack , and explore the surround world and its many dungeons .
Players will be able to do things like deform elements of terrain , allowing them to build tunnel networks or walls to defend their property .
Items will also be intended for the good of all as Steenberg creates them and drops them into the world .
You wo n’t be picking up rifles in your adventures , but more likely the plans for the rifle - building machine , that can then be utilised by everyone in your village .
Part Zelda , part Tale In The Desert , part adventure shooter , and wholly abstract and beautiful , Love looks the kind of amalgam of art , programming and internet savvy that we ’ve desired without even being able to imagine .
It has the potential , and Steenberg has the huge intellect , for this to be one of the most precious events in PC gaming .
Nonetheless it ’s unclear what ’s going to happen to Steenberg and his project .
He says he ’s not doing it for the money and that he only needs 200 - or - so subscribers to justify running the live game .
From what I ’ve seen he ’ll be lucky to avoid being swamped by thousands , those hungry legions of gamers who want something quite different from their MMO experience , and just are n’t getting it .
Love , oh Love , it has me quite giddy indeed .
[ You ’ll find more screens of Love here .
More details when we have them . ]
Germany 's highest court apparently had memories of Nazi and Stasi abuses in mind when it ruled on a series of surveillance and data privacy cases this year .
In the most recent ruling , made today in Karlsruhe , the Constitutional Court found that Germany 's recent data retention directive targeting ISPs and telephone companies was problematic ; going forward , the data retention will still be mandatory , but the information can only be accessed with a warrant and only for serious crimes .
Germany 's law went into effect last December , and it ordered telecommunications companies to keep various kinds of data ( e- mail addresses , numbers dialed , etc. ) for at least six months , and to turn this information over to investigators who requested it .
30,000 Germans promptly filed a class - action suit over the law , concerned about the implications of data retention .
Could the data be used in any investigation , for instance , such as copyright infringement cases or file - sharing ?
Would it make personal information too easy for law enforcement to obtain ?
The court found that parts of the law were unconstitutional .
In its ruling , it upheld the retention requirement but instituted much stricter safeguards around who might get access to the information .
The ruling follows other , similar rulings this year .
Last week , the court also struck down indiscriminate license plate monitoring in the states of Schleswig - Holstein and Hesse , saying that authorities needed to have a reason for running people 's plates .
The court hoped to prevent the creation of automated systems that track movement around the country .
In late February , the court also ruled on the matter of police spyware .
German authorities and intelligence agencies had developed spyware ( much like the FBI in the US has done ) that can monitor suspects ' computers and remotely glean information from their hard drives .
The court said that judicial oversight of this process was required , and it also carved out areas that can not be examined .
Police are not allowed to include unrelated personal information in their investigations of suspects .
This is similar to restrictions faced by traditional surveillance , where authorities have to cut a phone tap if suspected terrorists start talking religion .
Keeping up appearances
While the decisions have all favored privacy rights , the court did not altogether eliminate remote computer snooping or data retention .
They can continue under certain conditions , but the fact that the court does keep whacking away bits of legislation on these issues leads some German observers to wonder why such boundary - pushing legislation continues to get passed .
One might ask the same question about video game violence laws in the US , which have been repeatedly struck down by courts but continue to pass legislatures around the country .
The answer in both cases seems to be that it 's politically more expedient to look " tough " on crime , violence , and terrorism and then leave the courts to sort out what 's actually constitutional .
Such votes rarely have negative political consequences , though can end up costing governments plenty of money when the rules end up in court .
Florian Glatzner , a German critic of data protection rules , told Deutsche Welle that he hopes the recent court decisions cause politicians to rethink this strategy .
" The politicians are being shown that by first enacting laws and then seeing whether or not they are unconstitutional is the wrong way to go , " he said .
The issue was immediately a subject of debate and AFW organisers did n't waste time .
" Effective immediately , both male and female models participating in Rosemount Australian Fashion
Week will need to be at least 16 years of age and must be represented by a model agency , " organisers said in a statement .
Clements said yesterday that Jacaciak , who has previously fronted a campaign for French fashion house Hermes and has been photographed in a white swimsuit being sprayed by a shower jet , was just too young .
Clements said she has kids around that age and could not equate the sexy poses and backstage drama of modelling with her own children .
" What are we doing to our girls ? " she said .
" When will casting agents think that , maybe because a 10 - year - old looks beautiful , then it 's OK to have her representing a woman of 30 or more ?
" I think as women we need to make a stand . "
Clements was not short of allies yesterday , including Melbourne 's Fashion Festival director Karen Webster , who banned models under the age of 16 from her catwalks last year .
She said she worried as much about the women at the fashion shows , as she did about the girl - women on the catwalk .
" My feeling is that using a 14 - year - old to pitch to a sophisticated and mature market is sending the wrong message .
There is just no need to use a 14 - year - old . "
But fashion has in fact invented a need .
" The thinness you only get before a girl even has breasts , even has curves , " says Clements , " This is what it 's all about " .
Clements and Webster identified at least half a dozen issues triggered by the Jacaciak affair , including the sexualisation of children , the extraordinary thinness of pre-pubescent models ( understood to trigger low self - esteem and eating disorders among aspirational teens ) , exposure of under - 16s to an adult environment , and the fundamental unfairness of pitching fashion products to y grown women using unattainable youth and beauty .
But Matthew Anderson , director of top Melbourne modelling agency Chadwick , begged to differ yesterday .
" People who say , ' But it 's not real , it 's not reality , to have a girl ( made up as a woman ) ' are missing the point , " he said .
" It 's not supposed to be real .
Fashion is fantasy .
It 's art . "
In other words , do n't copy the models , copy the clothes .
The issue of when young is too young is certainly not a new one for the industry .
In 1980 , Brooke Shields appeared on the cover of US Vogue at the age of 14 .
And in 1994 , Vogue Australia featured a 14 - year - old Kristy Hinze , ( pictured right ) grand - daughter of the famous Queensland politician Russ , on its cover and in an editorial spread .
" It was a lot of fun , " a chirpy Hinze said at the time .
" But it was also very nerve - racking .
I mean , I was a kid and I was doing this couply - type shoot where I had to wrap my legs around this guy and , of course , I had no idea . "
Poor Huckabee is getting so frightened that his war - mongering , neocon positions might be exposed he is resorting to force to suppress the information ( surprise ! ) :
Sgt. Vincent Valdez of the Des Moines Police Department said officers responded to an early afternoon complaint from the Huckabee Campaign office and arrested Robert Braam , Mona Shaw and Kathy Kelly … Valdez said the officers had no trouble making the arrests and the three were taken to the Polk County jail .
In a news release issued earlier by the Des Moines Catholic Worker , Kelly , co-director of VCNV , was quoted as saying , “ We ’re very respectful of the Iowa caucus process and the long history behind it but we feel quite strongly that the issues of this war must be inserted into the process of narrowing down the candidates for the presidential election . ”
Huckabee spokesperson , Eric Woolson , could not be reached for comment after several attempts .
News in Science
Big quake for California a ' certainty '
California will almost certainly be hit by a killer earthquake in the next 30 years , US scientists say .
New calculations reveal there is a 99.7 % chance a magnitude 6.7 quake or larger will strike before 2038 .
" It basically guarantees it 's going to happen , " says Dr Ned Field , a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey in Pasadena and lead author of the report .
The predictions were the result of a new system that combines information from seismology , earthquake geology , and precise measurements from the earth 's surface , allowing the probabilities of a major earthquake to be forecast .
" This new , comprehensive forecast advances our understanding of earthquakes and pulls together existing research with new techniques and data , " Field says .
The earthquake forecasts , known as the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast , were developed by Field 's working group of scientists and engineers .
The group found that two of California 's largest cities , Los Angeles and San Francisco , were more than 63 % likely to face a 6.7 quake .
The 6.7 earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994 left 60 people dead and did an estimated US $ 10 billion damage , while a 6.9 quake in San Francisco in 1989 claimed the lives of 67 people .
Geologists say one of the biggest areas of concern in California is the southern section of the San Andreas fault in Riverside County , east of Los Angeles , which is described as being " 10 months pregnant " .
Hammered
" You have to realise this is a very long pregnancy , and it is way overdue , " says Professor Tom Jordan , director of the Southern California Earthquake Centre at the University of Southern California .
" We can expect that we 're going to get hammered by a big earthquake and we 'd better be prepared . "
Jordan says an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude might span 322 kilometres of fault length and have a displacement of 3.6 metres or more .
" If that were to take place in the Los Angeles region then you would have a big problem , " he says .
Jordan says the chance of a 7.5 magnitude quake hitting Southern California is 37 % , compared with 15 % in Northern California .
This is largely because the 1906 San Francisco earthquake relieved stress from the San Andreas Fault there .
The 1906 San Francisco quake was thought to have been a magnitude of around 7.8 or higher .
The last temblor of that size in Southern California was in 1857 , and the southernmost section of the San Andreas Fault has not seen such an event since 1680 .
" Those faults have been accumulating stress all this time and that makes large earthquakes highly probable , " Jordan says .

Neocon William " the Bloody " Kristol has been wrong about nearly everything concerning Iraq since before the 2003 invasion , yet he still manages to proudly sit on the FOXNews panel with that silly smirk on his face , touting the same , fact - free rhetoric .
This morning on Fox News Sunday , Kristol once again sings the praises of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on the amazing success of the Bush / McCain surge and how they 've done an exemplary job of turning things around in Iraq .
Juan Williams points out that Petraeus is seen as a mouthpiece for the Bush administration and what he and Crocker have really done is help to bring the level of violence down to 2005 levels and that any gains that have been made by the surge are fragile at best -- which is not exactly seen as a triumph by the American people .
As expected , Billy - boy takes exception to this and he scolds Williams for daring to speak ill of General Petraeus :
Unexpectedly Intriguing !
Last week , we featured a quote by President John F. Kennedy in which he stated in a speech to the Economic Club of New York on December 14 , 1962 that :
" it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low - and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now . "
That left us with a hanging question .
Is he right ?
To find out , at least using our back - of - the - envelope methods , we decided to do a quick comparison between 1954 and today , at least as represented by the tax rates and income tax revenue for 2006 .
Why 2006 ?
Well , those income taxes for 2007 are still in the process of being collected ( remember , April 15 is a week away , and that 's not even taking those who'll be filing for extensions instead of taxes into account .... )
So our first comparison is to look at the extremely progressive income tax rates of 1954 vs the more moderately progressive income tax rates of 2006 , after adjusting the 1954 income bracket thresholds for inflation .
The chart below shows our initial result over the range from $ 0 to $ 1.7 million in 2006 U.S. dollars :
So we can see right off that tax rates are generally much lower today than they were 52 years previously , with the general exception of those earning between $ 30,650 and $ 45,113 in constant 2006 U.S. dollars , whose statutory tax rates are only slightly lower today than in 1954 .
In the next part of our back - of - the - envelope analysis , we 'll look at the percentage of GDP that each year 's personal income tax revenue represented .
Here , we used the nominal GDP figures for 1954 and 2006 that we obtained from the invaluable Measuring Worth website .
For the percentage of GDP represented by personal income taxes in 1954 , we used this report produced by the left - leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
For the same 2006 figure , we found the amount of personal income tax revenue collected for 2006 in this Congressional Budget Office report , and found the percentage by dividing the corresponding GDP figure we obtained from the Measuring Worth site .
The following chart reveals the share of GDP represented by both 1954 and 2006's personal income tax revenues :
Remarkably , despite having a much more progressive income tax rate structure with much higher income tax rates in 1954 , the percentage share of GDP for both 1954 and 2006 is nearly identical , coming in at 7.8 % and 7.9 % respectively .
We also provided the nominal ( non-inflation adjusted ) GDP figures for 1954 and 2006 in the chart above .
Our next step was to adjust these figures for inflation and , as with the income levels previously , we adjusted these figures according to changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) .
Then we multiplied the results for each year by the percentage shares of GDP , which will provide the inflation adjusted revenue for each year in constant 2006 U.S. dollars .
The following chart shows our final results :
We find that revenue generated by the much flatter income tax rate structure of 2006 is nearly 4.7 times that produced by the much more progressive income tax rate structure of 1954 , coming in at $ 1,044 billion compared to $ 223.1 billion respectively .
We likewise find , as the result of this back - of - the - envelope analysis , that John F. Kennedy is right .

Theory
Hex letters can be used to write english words , like cafebabe , or deadbeef .
This is handy for developers , because we can put “ recognizable text ” in binary data .
Unfortunately , there are n’t that many words spelled with just the letters a through f .
Using creative ( or l337 ) spelling , we can expand the list .
Practice
Using an existing list of common words , and a small Python program , I created an 1196 - word list of hex words .
I used two different words lists , including the common word list from the Moby lexicon , but there are others to choose from , if you want .
This is the Python script :
import re , string
minlen = 3
subs = [
# ( ' for ' , ' 4 ' ) ,
# (' four ' , ' 4 ' ) ,
# ( 'to ' , ' 2 ' ) ,
( ' ate ' , ' 8 ' ) ,
# ( 'ten ' , ' 10 ' ) ,
# ('g ' , ' 6 ' ) ,
( 'l ' , ' 1 ' ) ,
( 'o ' , ' 0 ' ) ,
( 's ' , ' 5 ' ) ,
( 't ' , ' 7 ' )
]
reHexWord = re . compile ( " [ a - f0 - 9 ] * " )
fWords = open ( ' words.txt ' , 'r ' )
for w in fWords .
xreadlines ( ) :
w = w . strip ()
for old , new in subs :
w = string .
replace ( w , old , new )
if len ( w ) >= minlen :
match = reHexWord . search ( w )
if match and match .
group ( ) == w :
print w
The table of substitutions can be adjusted to broaden the list even further .
The code above shows some substitutions commented out , because I did n’t think they generally worked well .
My favorites
Words
I liked from this list that I have n’t seen before ( the 8 - letter ones are especially appealing as DWORDs ) :
ba5eba11
bedabb1e
be5077ed
b0a710ad
b01dface
cab005e
ca11ab1e
ca55e77e
deadbea7
defec8
f01dab1e
f005ba11
0ddba11
5ca1ab1e
7e1eca57
The words
Some things to notice :
Lots of these words are obscure , and therefore useless .
For example , what ’s an abaca ?
( a banana - like plant )
Some useful words were not in the list ( decaf and f005 ba11 )
These are only single words , not combinations , so cafebabe and decafbad do n’t appear .
The letters “ ate ” are translated to “ 8 ” in this list , not “ a7e ” , as they also could have been , so you wo n’t find “ 10 ca7e ” here , but you will find “ 10c8 ” .
If we could figure out a way to make an R , we could have acce1er8 !
And now , all 1196 words .
( And do n’t miss the 136 hex color words )

Commercial Banks Heading for Huge Derivatives Losses - Credit Crisis Turning into Credit Armageddon
While most investors are focused on the latest stock market rally , hidden from view is a monumental change that few recognize and fewer understand : Unprecedented amounts of old debts are coming due in America , and many are not getting refinanced .
Even worse , borrowers are going into default , lenders are taking huge losses , and outstanding loans are turning to dust .
The numbers are large ; the government 's response is equally massive .
So before you look at one more stock quote or any other news item , I think it behooves you to understand what this means and what to do about it ...
New Evidence of A Credit Crack - Up
Until recently , economists have had only anecdotal evidence of credit troubles .
They knew that individual banks were taking losses .
They knew that many banks were tightening their lending standards .
And they realized that there were hiccups in the credit markets .
So they called it the “ credit crunch ” — essentially a slowdown in the pace of new credit growth .
But we did n't buy that .
Earlier this year , we warned that America 's credit woes involved much more than just a slowdown .
We wrote that it was actually a credit crack - up — an outright contraction of credit the likes of which had never been witnessed in our lifetime .
Wall Street scoffed .
No one had seen anything like this happen before , and almost everyone assumed that it would not happen now .
They were wrong .
Indeed , three new official reports are now telling us , point blank , that the credit crack - up is already beginning !
First , the Federal Reserve is reporting a big contraction in short - term debts .
The specifics : Based on its Flow of Funds Report ( pdf page 18 ) , we can clearly see that ...
Just in the third quarter of last year , “ open market paper ” ( mostly short - term commercial loans ) was slashed at the annual rate of $ 682 billion ...
In the fourth quarter , it shrunk again — at the rate of $ 337 billion per year , and ...
This shrinkage does n't even begin to reflect the impact of the Bear Stearns failure or the huge additional bank losses announced so far this year .
I repeat :
This is not a mere “ slowdown ” in new lending , which would be relatively routine .
This is an actual reduction in the short - term loans outstanding , which is anything but routine ... which implies a rupture in the nation 's credit spigots ... and which could deliver a new shock to the U.S. economy .
If this represented a planned and voluntary effort by lenders to begin trimming America 's debt excesses , it might actually be a good thing .
But that 's not the case here , not even close .
Rather , this debt reduction is almost exclusively forced on lenders by the pressure of events — the plunging value of mortgages , the surging defaults by debtors , and the huge losses that have caught both banks and regulators off guard .
Second , the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) is reporting havoc in the derivatives market .
Derivatives are bets and debts placed by banks and others .
In recent decades , derivatives have grown far beyond any semblance of reason .
But in its latest report , the OCC reveals that in the fourth quarter of 2007 ...
For the first time in history , the notional value of derivatives held by U.S. commercial banks plunged dramatically — by $ 8 trillion ...
For the first time in history , U.S. banks suffered a massive overall loss on their derivatives — $ 9.97 billion , and , again ...
These numbers do not yet reflect this year 's disasters at Bear Sterns and other institutions .
The OCC 's chart below illustrates the magnitude and drama of the decline :
The chart shows that , until the third quarter of last year , U.S. commercial banks had been making consistent profits from their derivatives quarter after quarter .
Their total revenue from these and related transactions ( red line ) never dipped into negative territory ... rarely suffered a significant decline ... and was even making brand new highs through the first half of 2007 .
Then , suddenly , in the fourth quarter of last year , we witnessed a landmark game - changing event :
For the first time ever , U.S. commercial banks lost big money in derivatives in the aggregate ( as you can plainly see by the sharp nosedive of the red line ) .
Again , if this were part of a planned retreat by the banks to more prudent trading approaches , it would be a positive .
But it 's anything but !
Indeed , the OCC specifically states in its report that the sudden and unusual reduction in derivatives was due entirely to the turmoil in the credit markets .
And ironically , nearly all of that turmoil was concentrated in “ credit swaps ” ( blue line in the chart ) — the one sector that was designed to protect investors from this precise situation .
These credit swaps were supposed to act as insurance policies that big banks and others bought to help cover their risk in the event of defaults and failures .
But they 're not working out as planned : Just in the fourth quarter , U.S. banks had a net loss ( after all profitable trades ) of $ 11.8 billion on credit swaps alone , according to the OCC .
Those losses helped wipe out all the profits they made in other derivatives , leaving a net overall loss of $ 9.97 billion .
Third , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) predicts that this crisis is barely ONE - THIRD over !
In its Global Financial Stability Report ( see Executive Summary ) , the IMF predicts that the total losses from the subprime and related credit crises could reach $ 945 billion , or more than triple the already - huge losses that have been announced so far .
The IMF further warns that ...
“ There has been a collective failure to appreciate the extent of the leverage taken on by a wide range of institutions — including banks , monoline insurers , government - sponsored entities , and hedge funds — and the associated risks of a disorderly unwinding . ”
Now , both the OCC and the Fed reports confirm that this “ disorderly unwinding ” is already beginning .
“ The transfer of risks off bank balance sheets was overestimated .
As risks have materialized , this has placed enormous pressures back on the balance sheets of banks . ”
Now , the OCC report confirms that “ the transfer of risk ” ( with credit swaps ) has often failed .
“ Notwithstanding unprecedented intervention by major central banks , financial markets remain under considerable strain , now compounded by a more worrisome macroeconomic environment , weakly capitalized institutions , and broad - based deleveraging . ”
This is precisely what we have been warning you about .
Now , it 's happening !
Looking ahead , the IMF also warns about ...
“ Deep - seated balance - sheet fragilities and weak capital bases , which mean the effects [ of the crisis ] are likely to be broader , deeper and more protracted . ”
“ A serious funding and confidence crisis that threatens to continue for a significant period . ”
The U.S. Government 's Response
You 've seen what the Fed has already done — six rate cuts since August of last year ... unprecedented broker bailouts ... and massive new amounts of liquidity pumped into the banking system .
You 've seen where a lot of that money has gone — into foreign currencies , gold and oil .
And you 've seen the dramatic market surges which that money can generate .
Case in point :
The latest jump in crude oil to $ 117 per barrel .
Now , get ready for more of the same :
More rate cuts , with the next expected as soon as April 30 ...
More Fed bailouts ...
Even wilder money printing , and ...
Larger surges in foreign currencies and commodities , despite intermediate setbacks .
But also start preparing for the day when the credit crack - up temporarily overwhelms the Fed , driving the U.S. economy into a far deeper recession than most people expect .
The Bottom Line for You Right Now
The three official reports support several related conclusions :
First , whether the stock market goes up or down in the near term , this crisis is far from over — and it 's likely to get a lot worse .
Bottom line :
It 's far too soon to waver from a path of safety .
Second , credit is already scarcer and is probably going to be even harder to get as this crisis progresses .
Bottom line :
If you 're looking forward to a future day when you can buy properties at bargain prices , do n't count on doing so with a lot of borrowed money .
Instead , be prepared to put up substantial amounts of cash .
Third , some banks wo n't survive this crisis .
Bottom line :
Be sure to keep your bank accounts — including principal , accrued interest and checks outstanding — under the FDIC's $ 100,000 insurance limit .
( Amounts that run above the limit could be at risk . )
Plus , for maximum safety , use U.S. Treasury bills or money market funds invested exclusively in short - term Treasuries .
Fourth , for protection and profit from a falling dollar , invest in the strongest foreign currencies plus other assets that naturally rise with the falling dollar .
Fifth , right now , for specific steps to take as this crisis unfolds , register for our upcoming emergency briefing titled ...

If the rampant out - and cross-sourcing between LCD and plasma TV makers did n't tell you that it's a nasty and brutish time in the TV biz , this should : Philips is officially pulling out of the US market , and is licensing its brand name for TVs over to Funai — best known for supplying Wal - Mart 's Black Friday TVs and DVD players .
Funai will be making , distributing and marketing TVs under the Philips and Magnavox brands in the US for the next five years , starting Sept.
1 . They 'll also get full access to Philips ' R&D , including its Eco TV , but it 's anyone 's guess as to how much of its CES lineup will materialize now ..
Here 's the full press release :
Philips is a mammoth of a CE company , but in the US it 's not always easy to see what those guys are
April 8 , 2008
PHILIPS TAKES DECISIVE STEPS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY OF ITS TELEVISION BUSINESS
• Philips will enter into a brand license agreement to transfer its North American consumer TV activities to Funai
• Philips will continue to take steps to improve profitability of its TV operations by further optimizing its supply base
• Charges of up to EUR 125 million will be taken during 2008 in connection with the above
Amsterdam , The Netherlands - Royal Philips Electronics ( NYSE : PHG , AEX : PHI ) and Funai Electric Co Ltd ( TSE / OSE : 6839 ) of Japan today announced their intention to enter into a brand licensing agreement under which Funai will assume responsibility for the sourcing , distribution , marketing and sales of all Philips ' consumer television activities in the United States and Canada .
The five - year minimum agreement takes effect September 1 , 2008 and stipulates Philips will receive royalty payments in exchange for Funai 's right to exclusively use the Philips and Magnavox brand names for its consumer television offerings in North America during this period .
This agreement secures continued presence of Philips and Magnavox branded TV's in North America in a model that safeguards Philips profitability in this highly competitive market .
Philips today also announced that it will continue to take steps to improve the financial performance of its television operations by further optimizing its existing global supply base and focusing its TV business on its strongest markets , especially in Europe and in key emerging countries .
To cover for the costs associated with these additional steps , and the costs associated with the transfer of the company 's North American TV activities to Funai , Philips will take total charges of up to EUR 125 million during 2008 .
" The agreement with Funai and the other measures to improve profitability we are planning , follow our commitment that we would take decisive steps in addressing the unacceptable profitability levels in our TV business in 2008 , " Philips President and Chief Executive Officer Gerard Kleisterlee said .
" We have an 18 year working relationship with Funai and are confident it is an excellent partner to implement this new model for Philips ' television business in North America .
This agreement will ensure a presence for Philips television in North America and uninterrupted access to innovative products for consumers . "
Other Philips consumer business categories in North America are not affected by this agreement and will continue to be manufactured , marketed and sold by Philips .
Philips ' television position in the rest of the world is also unaffected by this partnership with Funai .
Funai will have access to Philips ' world - class Research and Design experts to ensure Philips televisions deliver continuous innovation to consumers in both technology and form .
These include the recently launched Design Collection and energy - efficient range of televisions dubbed the ' Eco TV ' .
Funai will be licensed on condition of compliance with Philips requirements on brand use , product quality , product design and provision of consumer care .
Philips television sales in North America amounted to EUR 1 billion in 2007 .
Completion of this intended agreement is subject to any mandatory governmental regulatory approvals .
According to Tetsuro Funai , President and CEO of Funai Electric Co. , Ltd , " Philips and Funai have a long history together , and we are proud to be the trusted partner charged with managing this important and high profile product category for Philips .
As a premium brand , Philips will add lustre to our existing portfolio and consumers can continue to count on the Philips quality , design and innovation to which they have become accustomed .
We look forward to working together to ensure a seamless transition of the business . "
When Rupert Murdoch spoke yesterday at Georgetown , he indicated that a long - standing Wall Street Journal tradition could be changed in 2008 :
The paper might endorse a presidential candidate .
The Journal has refrained from endorsing a presidential candidate for more than seven decades .
In a July 2007 editorial regarding the possible sale of Dow Jones , when Murdoch was only a suitor , the editorial board wrote the following :
" The Journal has n't endorsed a Presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover , preferring instead to praise or assail the candidates ' ideas . "
But here 's what the Journal reported yesterday :
Asked about endorsements for the 2008 U.S. presidential election , Mr. Murdoch said that " we have n't made up our minds yet . "
He noted The Wall Street Journal has a history of not endorsing presidential candidates , but The New York Post endorsed Illinois Sen. Barack Obama during New York 's Democratic presidential primary .
" I do n't know what we 'll do in the general election , " Mr. Murdoch said .
Seems like Murdoch , whose NY Post endorsed Obama while attacking Clinton , is leaving open the window for the general election .
Deputy editorial page editor Daniel Henninger , when reached by Politico over e-mail , declined to comment .

Obama on Grand Theft Auto and personal responsibility
GamePolitics.com noted that presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama had some comments upon the release of Grand Theft Auto IV this week , and they were n’t actually half bad .
Indeed , instead of engaging in the typical game - bashing hysteria we ’ve gotten used to , Obama instead focused on the need to find the right balance in terms of getting kids as interested in education as they are in games and other forms of entertainment .
( This is something I was just discussing in the comments to another post I made yesterday ) .
Obama wondered , “ How are we giving our kids a thirst for knowledge ?
And turning off the TV set , and getting them to be engaged and interested , like their future really does matter on how well they do in school . ”
That ’s a good question , and I ’ve provided some of my own thoughts on that here .
Importantly , I just want to remind everyone of the very sensible things Obama said when asked at a debate earlier this year about the role of government when it comes to media content .
“ [ T ] he primary responsibility is for parents , ” he said .
“ And I reject the notion of censorship as an approach to dealing with this problem . ”
Better yet , he went on to stress the importance of making sure that parents have the tools to make these determinations for their families :
“ [ I ]t is important for us to make sure that we are giving parents the tools that they need in order to monitor what their children are watching .
And , obviously , the problem we have now is not just what ’s coming over the airwaves , but what ’s coming over the Internet .
And so for us to develop technologies and tools and invest in those technologies and tools , to make sure that we are , in fact , giving parents power — empowering parents I think is important . ”
He ’s got it exactly right .
I just wish he ’d stress personal responsibility and limited government solutions across the board !
The Washington Post reports that Al Gore and his Alliance for Climate Protection are launching one of the most expensive advocacy programs ever .
The We campaign will run over the next three years and cost $ 300 million , of which about half has already been raised .
The goal of the campaign is to change ingrained habits and behaviors directly if possible , but primarily through legislation .
“ This climate crisis is so interwoven with habits and patterns that are so entrenched , the elected officials in both parties are going to be timid about enacting the bold changes that are needed until there is a change in the public ’s sense of urgency in addressing this crisis , ” Gore said .
“ I ’ve tried everything else I know to try .
The way to solve this crisis is to change the way the public thinks about it . ”
League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski , whose group is supporting the effort , said he ’s optimistic the “ We ” campaign will succeed in a way that traditional environmental groups have not .
“ It heightens both the urgency and the sense we can get the job done with the broad middle that will make the difference , ” Karpinski said , “ while having the resources to communicate in a sophisticated way , in a more expansive fashion than the community has done before . ”
According to the press release :
The We campaignâ€™s first television ad , titled â€ œAnthem , â€ highlights the historic nature of the challenge and the need for a society - wide commitment to finding comprehensive solutions .
The ad draws a dramatic parallel between the collective spirit of American leadership that helped us win the Second World War , overcome segregation and put a man on the moon to the spirit needed today to solve the climate crisis .
The ad will run nationally on network and cable channels , including placements on shows such as American Idol , House and Law & Order .
Naturally , however , there are a number of organizations that are already spending money to blunt the impact of this campaign , ranging from the coal - industry astroturf non-profit Americans for Balanced Energy Choices to the conservative / libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute .
Myron Ebell , who directs energy and global warming policy for CEI , said the fact that Gore feels compelled to run such an elaborate ad campaign highlights the extent to which his conservation message has failed to resonate with the American public .
“ He ’s spending a hundred million dollars to convince the American people to make sacrifices that he and his elite friends are not willing to make , ”
Ad hominim attacks on Al Gore .
To paraphrase Jeff Foxworthy , you know you ’re arguments are weak when … .

The state of California has an economy that , if it were a nation , would be in the top ten largest economies in the world .
So what happens in California tends to impact what happens in the rest of the U.S.
This is why , when California applied for an EPA waiver that it needed to limit carbon emissions from motor vehicles , car manufacturers fought it tooth and claw ( and that ’s why the Congressional investigation and lawsuits now facing the EPA over the waiver denial are going to be hard fought ) .
Because of California ’s national influence , when the state requires it ’s electricity providers and motor vehicles to become greener , it changes things nationwide .
And there have been a number of stories recently about how California is doing exactly that .
First , the Contra - Costa Times reports that there is renewed interest in building more nuclear power plants in the state as a means to reducing the state ’s carbon emissions , but that there are a number of impediments to doing so .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to change the state laws that prevent the construction of new reactors , and while the story quotes Emily Christensen , spokeswoman for Pacific Gas & Electric ( PG&E ) , as saying “ We are n’t even looking at the possibility of building any more nuclear power plants .
We have no plans to do so , ” there are other interests in California outside the incumbent utilities who are interested in going nuclear – such as the Fresno Energy Group , a group devoted to building a nuclear power plant for the city of Fresno and then selling the surplus to PG&E or other cities nearby .
Southern California Edison ( SCE ) is required by California law to produce 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources like solar and wind by 2010 .
According to The New York Times , SCE is going to be installing 250 megawatts on large industrial and commercial rooftops over the next five years and hopes to have enough capacity installed by August of this year to take some of the strain off existing power plants during the summer usage peak .
The Times reports that SCE will own the solar cells and lease the rooftops from the building ’s owners .
Leasing arrangements have been proposed as a way to improve the economics of solar power , since they do n’t require the building ’s owner to front the high costs of solar .
Given that commercial and industrial rooftops alone would provide tens of thousands of megawatts of power while still limiting the expense of new transmission line construction , this is excellent news both for California and for the solar power industry .
There was some mixed news on the subject of zero-emissions and low - emissions vehicles last week .
The LA Times reported that the state Air Resources Board voted to reduce the number of zero-emissions vehicles required from automakers over the next few years .
The state had previously required sales of 25,000 zero-emission vehicles from 2012 to 2014 , and that was dropped to 7,500 .
However , as the San Francisco Chronicle reports , the Board also voted to require sales of 58,000 low - emissions vehicles over the same period .
It ’s not clear to me that the hybrid vehicle requirement will actually mean anything , though , given that there was over 67,000 hybrids sold in California alone in 2006 .

Popular Mechanics reports that Global Research Technologies has developed a material that absorbs carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) as air passes through it .
It is capable of passively pulling CO 2 out of the air directly , but once material is saturate , the CO 2 has to be removed from the material , a process that requires energy .
It ’s this energy requirement that makes this invention more of a curiosity than a practical atmospheric CO 2 scrubbing method , but with wide scale solar power or a catalytic method to extract the CO 2 , it could become more economically and environmentally feasible – especially if , as the article suggests , conversion of CO 2 into easily buried solid carbonate minerals becomes a viable sequestration method .

In an interesting turn of events , a story at Canada.com reports that carbon tariffs on goods from nations that do n’t have carbon emission limits could reverse offshoring , the process by which manufacturing is sent overseas .
Essentially , if the U.S. applies a carbon tariff to goods from China and developing nations , that tariff will increase inflation and slow the economic growth of developing nations , but much of the inflationary hit could be reduced by pulling manufacturing back home , or at least in to countries that have similar carbon taxes or cap & trade systems .
“ Throw $ 40 - $ 50 US per tonne carbon costs into an environment of triple - digit oil prices and you suddenly redefine the meaning of competitiveness , ” [ Jeff Rubin , chief economist at CIBC World Markets ] wrote .
“ In a whole swath of manufacturing industries , ranging from chemicals to primary metals , energy costs and their carbon trail , not labour costs , will soon become key . ” …
Ultimately , a carbon tariff could reverse current trade and offshoring patterns , Rubin said .
For people concerned about the economic and manufacturing health of the U.S. , this report ( available here ) supports the proposition that reducing carbon emissions can also be good for jobs and the economy if done properly .
The main concern , however , is to ensure that it does n’t automatically relegate developing nations to being “ developing ” perpetually .
Japan has built a space station lab that is being called the Lexus of space stations for its size and sophistication .
The station will launch Saturday with the space shuttle Discovery .
It is called Kibo ( which means “ hope ” in Japanese ) and costs a whopping $ 1 billion .
Kibo will be the biggest and , by far , the most elaborate room at the international space station – a 37 - foot - long scientific workshop as large as a school bus , with its own hatch to the outside for experiments and a pair of robot arms .
It also contains a closet and porch .
The station is so big that three shuttle flights were needed to get the whole thing up .
Kibo ( pronounced KEE ’ - boh ) is much larger than the two labs already in orbit ” ” NASA ’s modest - size Destiny and the even smaller European Space Agency ’s Columbus .
“ It ’s usually the other way around , is n’t it ?
Japanese products should be smaller , but this time it ’s the other way around , ” said Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide .
The 16 - ton Kibo is 9 feet longer than the U.S. Destiny lab , which was launched in 2001 , and more than 14 feet longer than Europe ’s Columbus , which flew to the space station in February .
It took twenty years to complete the station .
Shuttle commander Mark Kelly calls it “ the Lexus of the space station modules . ”
It ’s big and it ’s capable , said Kelly .
“ I mean , it ’s got its own dedicated robotic arm .
It ’s got its own air lock .
Eventually , it ’s going to have an external platform for experiments .
It ’s got a lot of capable science racks that are going in .
So yeah , I think it ’s pretty impressive . ”
Kelly and his crew will install Kibo during the 14 - day shuttle flight .
In March , they will attach the Japanese storage compartment that was left in a temporary parking position .
The crew will undergo three spacewalks to hook up Kibo and handle other space station work , like replacing an empty nitrogen gas tank and seeing how best to clean a jammed solar - wing rotary joint .
NASA ’s space operations chief Bill Gerstenmaier , said it wo n’t be as simple as it sounds .
“ When you get into the details of what ’s actually involved … it ’s an extremely complicated mission , ” he said .
While up there , one of the Discovery astronauts , Gregory Chamitoff , will swap places with the space station ’s current U.S. resident , Garrett Reisman , who will return to Earth on the shuttle following a three - month stay .
Chamitoff will spend six months up there .
NASA decided last week to proceed with its shuttle mission as planned , even as the Russians continue to investigate April ’s rocky landing by a Soyuz spacecraft carrying three astronauts home from the space station .
A Soyuz constantly is docked at the orbiting outpost for use as a lifeboat in an evacuation .
Discovery ’s flight will set a variety of milestones for NASA .
This will be the 10th shuttle mission since the Columbia tragedy in 2003 , leaving just 10 more shuttle flights before the fleet is retired in 2010 ″ ” marking the end of space station construction .
The fuel tank on Discovery is the first to incorporate all the post -Columbia changes from the start of construction instead of later in the construction phase .
While shuttle managers expect this fuel tank to be the best one yet .
It will have minimal insulating - foam loss .
Still , a full inspection of the spaceship ’s thermal skin still will be required .
That inspection will be done later in the flight than usual because Kelly and his crew wo n’t get their inspection boom until they arrive at the space station .
The previous shuttle visitors left the 50 - foot laser - tipped pole in March ; it could n’t fit in Discovery ’s payload bay given the size of Kibo .
Astronaut Karen Nyberg , the lone woman on the crew , will become the 50th woman to fly in space ” ” setting another important milestone for the upcoming Discovery mission .
Nyberg will be rocketing into orbit just a few weeks before the 45th anniversary of the first woman in space , Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova , and the 25th anniversary of the first American woman in space , Sally Ride .
“ What I ’m really looking forward to is the time when we ’re not counting anymore , ” Nyberg said .

Central Command oversees all US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has recommended the top military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , be appointed head of US Central Command .
CentCom covers an area from the Horn of Africa into central Asia and includes all operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Gen Petraeus 's appointment is subject to the approval of the US Senate .
He would replace Navy Adm William Fallon , who stepped down in March after a reported split with President George W Bush over his policy on Iran .
An article by Esquire magazine , titled The Man Between War and Peace , said he was opposed to the use of force against the Islamic Republic over its nuclear activities .
Adm Fallon said the report , while not true , had become a distraction .
' Asymmetric warfare '
At a news conference at the Pentagon , Mr Gates said the joint chiefs of staff had agreed that Gen Petraeus should be nominated as head of CentCom and " I am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job " .
I do not anticipate General Petraeus leaving Iraq until late summer or early fall ...
[ This should ] ensure that there is plenty of time to prepare and for a good hand - off
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates
Profile : General Petraeus Profile : General Odierno
" The kinds of conflicts that we 're dealing with , not just in Iraq , but in Afghanistan and some of the challenges that we face elsewhere in the region , and the Central Command area , are very much characterised by asymmetric warfare , " he added .
" I do n't know anybody in the United States military better qualified to lead that effort . "
The 55 - year - old has overseen since last year the " surge " of an additional 30,000 US troops in Iraq , which has been credited widely with improving security and helping reduce violence .
Mr Gates said Gen Petraeus would not leave Iraq until later summer or early autumn , if his appointment is confirmed , in order to ensure he had enough time for a proper handover .
Lt - Gen Ray Odierno , his deputy in Iraq and currently commander of the Army 's 3rd Corps , has been nominated to replace him .
Mr Gates said Gen Odierno had gained plenty of experience as " Petraeus 's right - hand man " in Iraq over the past year .
He said he hoped both appointments would be approved by the Senate by Memorial Day , which is on 26 May this year .
In a brief statement from Baghdad , Gen Petraeus said he was " honoured to be nominated for this position and to have an opportunity to continue to serve with America 's soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , coastguardsmen and civilians " .

U.S. military commander Gen. David Petraeus reported a slight increase in suicide - vest attacks in Iraq .
He said the suicide vests were being handed to women , regarded as being more capable of reaching their targets than car bombs .
" We are going after Al Qaida relentlessly wherever they are , and wherever we can find them , we put our teeth into their jugular , " Petraeus said on March 2 .

The FBI is concerned about mortgage fraud
FBI crime head
It did not identify the companies but said the investigation encompassed developers , sub - prime lenders and investment banks .
FBI officials said the agency was looking at instances of accounting fraud and insider trading .
The cases could lead to potential civil or criminal charges , the FBI said .
The FBI said it viewed mortgage fraud as an increasing threat to the national economy .
It said that there had been 1,200 cases of mortgage fraud for the 2007 financial year compared with just 400 in 2006 .
The crisis in the sub - prime lending market has hit financial markets worldwide .
Joint investigation
The FBI said it was investigating the cases with the US market regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The SEC has opened about three dozen investigations into the collapse of the sub - prime market .
Targets of the SEC probe include Swiss bank UBS and US banks Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns , Reuters news agency reported .
It was not clear whether any of these firms were involved in the FBI investigation .
The sub - prime market is focused on providing home loans to those with poor or limited credit histories .
Many of these borrowers have been unable to keep up with payments and face losing their homes .
The wider crisis emerged as many of these mortgages were converted into financial instruments and sold on to investors including the big investment banks .
Defaults on these loans caused a steep drop in the value of related investments and has led to more than $ 100bn of losses at banks worldwide .
先 月Daryl Leeが 「
It ’s time to learn Scheme 」という記事の中で、C++のコードを生成する例を挙げてScheme言語の紹介をしていた。本稿では、
SCSH （Scheme Shell） で書いた実用的な例――複数のファイル内のテキスト検索/置換、ファイルのソート、CSVファイルからHTMLファイルへのデータ変換――を紹介する。
SCSH は 、Schemeプログラミング言語をベースとしたスクリプト言語だ。shやbashの長いスクリプトに置き換わることと、Scheme言語をシェルスクリプト作成により向いたものに拡張することを目的として、Olin Shivers氏によって作成された。
SCSH はUnixシステム （Linux、BSD、Cygwin）にLisp的なインターフェースを持たせるもので、SCSHでは正規表現のDSL（ドメイン固有言語）とawkのDSLを利用することができる。UnixとLispがそれぞれ元にしている考え方に違いがあるため、スクリプトの作成にPerlやシェルを使用しているUnixユーザには一見するとSCSHが奇妙に感じられるかもしれない。
Unixの考え方 とLispの考え方
Unixでは、 「 専門化 」 と「文字列」というキーワードで表わされる考え方をする。Unixにおける「専門化」の意味は、複数の仕事を行う一つの巨大なプログラムを作成するのではなく、それぞれは一つの仕事をうまく行う小さなプログラムを複数作成するということだ。そうすることにより、組み合わせて大きなプログラムを作成することのできる小さくて単純なコンポーネントが作成されるので、モジュール性が高まる。
またUnixでは「文字列」を引数としてプログラムを実行することが、一つのプログラムから別のプログラムにデータを渡すための唯一の方法となっている。言い換えれば、渡されるデータのデータ型が失われるため、データを受け取るプログラムがデータをパースして文字列を適切なデータ型に変換する必要があるということだ。例を挙げると、「 kill 223 」を実行したときには、「223」という文字列がパースされて数値に変換される。このように、入力を受け取るUnixのプログラムはすべて、受け取った文字列を何らかの必要なデータ型のオブジェクトに変換するパースを自ら行わなければならない。そのためオブジェクトとして受け渡しを行うことが面倒になっている。
（ Scheme系の言語で もCommon Lisp系の言語でも ）Lispのプログラムでは、モジュール性が同様に好まれるものの、整数/シンボル/リストなどのオブジェクトという形でプログラム間でデータを受け渡しするということも好まれる。このことは例えばEmacsにも見ることができて、Emacsでは文字列だけではなく様々な型のオブジェクトを扱う複数の小さなEmacs-Lispプログラムが使用されている。
SCSH （Scheme Shell）の特徴
SCSHでは、他のたいていの言語とは異なり正規表現エンジンが文字列ベースでは“なく”
、Lisp風の文法を持った組み込みDSLになっている。またSCSHでは「/」（スラッシュ）をシンボル名の中で使用することができるので、文字列型を使用せずにファイル名を作成することができる。さらにSCSHではサーバやクライアントの作成を自動化する高レベル関数も備えたネットワークソケットインターフェースが提供されている。
正規表現を作成するための文法は「SRE」と呼ばれるもので、Schemeに似ている（つまりリストの集まり）。文字列である通常の正規表現の表記法と比べると、正規表現を説明するためのコメントを書き加えることができたり、正規表現を組み合わせて作成することができたりするなどの利点がいくつかある。SREコードにコメントを書き加えることは、Schemeのコメントを書き加えることで行われる。SREはリストなので、Perlのようにコメントを正規表現の表記中に直接的に書き入れる必要はない（そのような書き方は正規表現のPOSIX標準に反していて、おそらく他の正規表現エンジンとの互換性はない）。このことは例えばPerlの正規表現で書いた数独の解答プログラムや、有名な電子メール確認用の正規表現など、長々しい正規表現が必要な場合に役立つ。正規表現には実行時に具体的な内容の決まる動的正規表現を使用することもできる。これはPerlなどの言語で行うことのできる変数展開に似ているが、SCSHでは変数展開がPOSIXの正規表現の標準とかち合うことがないという点が異なる。
Lispのマクロを使えば、コンパイル時に文法を操作することができる。つまり自分で自由に新しい文法を定義することができるということだ。Schemeの仕様ではマクロは構文と呼ばれていて、Schemeには新たな構文を定義するのに役立つパターンマッチングツールがある。SCSHでは、正規表現エンジン、プロセスの表記法、awkの表記法はすべてマクロ（構文）として定義されている。新たな構文を定義することは、行いたいことの乱雑な詳細を隠蔽するのに役立つ。例えばawkの構文では、使用するべきレコードリーダーをユーザが指定できるようにすることで、レコードを検索するためにファイルを一行ずつループで処理するコードを隠蔽している。
複数のHTMLファイルに対し一部のテキストを置換する
それで はSCSHが実際に役立つ例を紹介しよう。以前、latex2htmlプログラムを使用してLaTexファイルからHTMLファイルを生成しなければならないことがあった。ところが困ったことに、引数を指定せずにlatex2htmlを実行するとナビゲーションバー用の画像のパス名が絶対パス名として生成された。生成したHTMLを表示するウェブブラウザは/usr/lib/latex2html/icons/の中で画像を探そうとするのだが、このウェブページをインターネット経由で閲覧する場合や、latex2htmlをインストールしていない場合には画像を見つけることができない。
解決方法は、（HTMLファイルと一緒に配布するように）ナビゲーションバー用の画像をパッケージにまとめて、HTMLファイル内で絶対パス名になっている箇所を見つけ出して置換することだった。そのため、まずlatex2htmlに一つの引数を指定して「 latex2html testdoc.latex 」として実行した。これによりtestdocという名前のディレクトリが作成されて、そのディレクトリの中にHTMLファイルが生成された。
<!--ここまでHTMLファイルの内容-->
<!--ナビゲーションバー--> <A NAME =" tex2html2 " HREF=" node1.html " < IMG WIDTH = " 37 " HEIGHT = " 24 " ALIGN = " BOTTOM " BORDER = " 0 " ALT = " next " SRC= " file:/usr/lib/latex2html/icons/next.png
"
></ A> < IMG WIDTH = " 26 " HEIGHT = " 24 " ALIGN = " BOTTOM " BORDER = " 0 " ALT = " up " SRC= " file:/usr/lib/latex2html/icons/up_g.png " > <!— この後もHTMLが続く —>
ここで 「 file:/usr/lib/latex2html/icons/
」となっている箇所を見つけ出して、別のパスか空の文字列に置換する必要がある。私の場合は空の文字列に置き換えて、使いたいアイコン画像をHTMLファイルと一緒に配布することにした。この単純作業を行うためのコードを以下に示す。
#!/usr/bin/scsh -s !# ( define replace ( rx " file:/usr/lib/latex2html/icons / " ) ) ( define ( read - lines ) ( port - > string - list ( current - input - port ) ) ) ( define ( replace - line line ) ( regexp - substitute / global ( current - output - port ) replace line ' pre ' post ) ( newline ) ) ( for -each ( lambda ( fname ) ( let ( ( lines ( with - input - from - file fname read - lines ) ) ) ( rename - file fname ( string - append fname " .bak " ) ) ( with - output - to - file fname ( lambda ( ) ( for- each replace - line lines ) ) ) ) ) ( glob " *.html " ) )
このコードは 、SCSHの基本的な使い方を示す良い例だ。最初の行は、使用するインタプリタをシェルに伝えるためのシェバング行だ。次の3行では、置換したい正規表現、現在の入力ポートを文字列のリストに変換する関数、正規表現にマッチした文字列を空の文字列で置き換える関数をそれぞれ定義している。この例の正規表現には特別な点は特になくて、単にマッチさせる文字列を指定しているに過ぎない。
続く行では for - each 関数を呼び出して、「*.html」に該当するすべてのファイルに対して lambda で定義する関数を適用している。 lambda で定義した関数の中では、 let フォームを使用して、ファイル fname から読み取った行のリストを変数 lines に代入している。この関数の後半部分では、バックアップのためにファイルをファイル拡張子「.bak」を付け足したファイル名に改名している。その後いよいよ、文字列の置換を行っている。
( with - output - to - file fname ( lambda ( ) ( for- each replace - line lines ) ) ) ) )
この部分では、まずファイル fname を開いて、次に変数 lines 内の各文字列について関数 replace - line を適用することで、すでに指定した正規表現に対するマッチを見つけて置換し、開いているファイルに行を出力している。
ファイルを日時に基づいてソートする
次に紹介する実用的な例は、最近更新されたファイルをソートして表示するためのスクリプトだ。
#!/usr /bin/scsh \ -o sort -s !# ( define ( new - date day month year ) ( make - date 0 0 0 day ( - month 1 ) (- year 1900 ) ) ) ( define older - than ? <= ) ( define newer - than ? >= ) ( define ( date - is comparison - proc day month year ) ( lambda ( f ) ( comparison - proc ( file - last - mod f ) ( time ( new - date day month year ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( sort - by - date filter - proc filenames ) ( sort - list ( filter filter - proc filenames ) ( lambda ( a b ) ( older - than ? ( file - last - mod a ) ( file - last - mod b ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( display - filename / date filename ) ( format #t " ~a - ~a ~ % " ( format - date " ~d ~B ~Y " ( date ( file - last - mod filename ) ) ) filename ) ) ( for - each display - filename / date ( sort - by - date ( date - is newer - than ? 21 4 2008 ) ( directory - files ) ) )
最初の行はやはりシェバング行だ。二行目は、 scsh の実行ファイルに渡されるコマンドライン引数だ。
続く行では、日付/時刻オブジェクトを作成するための関数を定義しているのだが、SCSHがそれらを作成する通常のやり方に変わった特徴があることを考慮している（月のパラメータは0から11までの範囲でなければならず、年のパラメータはその年から1900年を引いた値）。その次の2行では、以上/以下を比較する関数の別名として older - than ?
と newer - than ?
を定義している。関数 date - is は、ファイル名fのファイルの変更時刻を date - is に与えられた日/月/年と比較する比較関数を使用した匿名関数を返す。このようにしておくと、
sort - by - date の呼び出しが読みやすくなるという利点がある。例えば「 date - is newer - than 2 1 2008 」はファイルの更新時刻が2008年1月2日よりも後の場合に真を返す関数を返すことになる。その次の行では、ファイル名の文字列のフィルタ/ソート済みのリストを返す
sort - by - date 関数を定義している 。
次に、関数 display - filename / date を定義し、その後その関数を使ってソートされたファイル名を表示する。なお関数 display - filename / date では、ファイル名と日付の表示の仕方を決めている。上記の場合は「日 月 年」の後にファイル名が表示される。
CSVファイルからデータを取り出してHTMLに変換する
SCSHのもう一つの組み込 みDSLはawkだ。awkとはもちろんテキストストリーム内のレコードやフィールドをパースするのに役立つUnixツールのことで、SCSHのDSLのawkはマクロ「 awk 」を使用して呼び出し、レコードとフィールドの切り分け方やレコードの取捨選択のための基準を指定することができる。awk構文ではファイル内のレコードやフィールドをループで処理する作業が隠蔽されていて、レコードがどのようなときにレコードをどのようにするのかを定義することができる。
awk構文には、レコード処理関数、処理関数が返す値の名前、条件文のリストを与える必要がある。レコード処理関数は、入力ストリームからレコードを読み取って、そのレコードからパースしたレコードとフィールドを返す。フィールドリーダーは、SCSHの関数である field - reader を使用して作成することができる。レコード処理関数は通常、読み取ったレコードと、フィールドのリストを返す。そのような各値は、構文に与えておいた変数名のおかげで簡単に参照することができる。
グラフや円グラフやスプレッドシート用のデータを保存するためによく使われる形式の一つに、CSV（Comma Separated Value）がある。CSVでは一行ごとにレコードが記述されていて、各フィールドは「 ,」で区切られている。
a , 3 , apple b,23 , banana c,1, camel
上に示した例では、一行ごとのレコードが3つあって、各レコードには3つのフィールドがある。awk構文はこれらをすべて文字列に変換して、処理を行うためのリストの中に保存する。
今後実際に対処する必要が出てくる可能性もあるより現実的なCSVファイルの例として、連絡先を保存したファイルを扱ってみよう。CSV形式のファイルに保存しておくとバックアップの観点から都合が良い場合があったり、別プログラムにインポートする作業を自動化するのに便利だったりすることがある。
Name , E-mail Address , Notes , E-mail 2 Address , E-mail 3 Address , Mobile Phone , Pager , Company , Job Title , Home Phone , Home Phone 2 , Home Fax , Home Address , Business Phone , Business Phone 2 , Business Fax , Business Address , Other Phone , Other Fax , Other Address Hiro Protagonist , , " Last of the freelance hackers " , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Mr. Lee,lee@greaterhongkong.com , , , , , , Mr. Lee 's Greater Hong Kong , President , , , , , , , , , , , Casimir Radon , cradon@megaversity.edu , " Physics club head , friend of Sarah " , , , , , , ,555.555.1234 , , , , , , , , ,
このCSVファイルでは、一行目が各フィールド名のリストになっている。そのため一行目は読み飛ばす必要があるのだが、SCSHのawk構文ではこのことを簡単に行うことができる。
以下のコードは、メールアドレスが含まれているレコードについてのみ、名前とメールアドレスをHTML形式で出力する。
#!/usr/bin/scsh -s !# ( define read - csv ( field - reader ( infix - splitter " , " 20 ) ) ) ( define ( empty - field ? x ) ( string= x " " ) ) ( define ( start - html page - title ) ( format #t #<< END < html > < head > < title >~a</ title > </ head > < body > < h1>~a</h1 > < p> END page - title page - title ) ) ( define ( end - html ) ( display " </ p > </body > </html > " ) ) ( define ( display - email - address email name ) ( format #t # < @ < a href= " mailto : ~a " >~a</a>< br/>~ %@ email name name ) ) ( with- input - from - file " contacts.csv " ( lambda ( ) ( define $ list - ref ) ( start - html " Contact List " ) ( awk ( read-csv ) ( record fields ) n- records ( ) ( range : 1 #f ( if ( not ( empty - field ? ( $ fields 1 ) ) ) ( display - email - address ( $ fields 1 ) ( $ fields 0 ) ) ) ) ) ( end -html ) ) )
このCSVファイルでは、フィールドの中にコンマ「,」が含まれているものもある。このことはパースの際に大きな問題となり得るが、SCSHでは簡単に対処することができる。ダブルクォートで囲まれたフィールドにはコンマが含まれていても良いことになってるので、CSVのレコードとフィールドを読み取るための関数を定義する際には特に気にせずにコンマをフィールドのデリミタとして指定するのに infix -splitter を使用すれば良い 。
次の行は、与えられた文字列が空かどうかを確認する関数 empty - field ?
を定義している。その次の start - html はHTMLページの先頭を出力するための関数で、ページのタイトルを指定することができる。この関数ではHTMLの内容にヒア文字列を使用しているので、エスケープしなくてもダブルクォートを使用することができる。 end -html 関数は、単にHTMLページの最後の部分を出力している。 display-email - address 関数は、ヒア文字列を使用して、メールアドレスへのHTMLリンクを作成して出力している。ここではヒア文字列のデミリタとして「 @ 」記号を使用している。
そして最後にcontacts.csvファイルを開いてlambda関数を実行している。なおファイルはlambda関数の最後で自動的に閉じられる。lambda関数の中では、まず
start - html 関数が呼ばれ、次に read - csv レコードリーダーを用いたawk構文が使用されている。そしてレコードを読み取る度に、条件に該当するかどうかの確認をする。この例では、レコード番号が1より大きければ次の文を実行して、現在のレコードの2つめのフィールド（メールアドレス）が空かどうかを確認している。空でなければメールアドレスを出力する。
な おawkでは、行番号や、読み取ったレコードが正規表現にマッチするかどうかや、単純なif条件など、他のタイプの条件も指定することができる。
ライブラ リ
SCSHには 、Perl 、Python、Rubyにも引けを取らないほどSCSHを便利にすることができるライブラリやモジュールがある。特に便利なライブラリとしては、XMLをパースするためのSSAXや、インターネット関連のスクリプトを作成するためのSUNetなどがある。SUNetにはFTP、SMTP、POP3、Daytime、Time、DNSプロトコル用のクライアントに加えて、FTPサーバやHTTP/Webサーバも含まれている。その他にも、PostgreSQLやMySQLといったデータベースとのやり取りを行うためのライブラリや、画像についての情報を抽出するためのライブラリなどがある。
まとめ
SCSH は、特定領域（シェルスクリプトの作成）の問題解決を行うように変更することのできる基礎となる小さな言語（Scheme）の存在が、いかにパワフルかを体現している。また正規表現を作成するための革新的な手法を提供しているため、これまでよりも少し楽にシェルスクリプトを作成することができるようになっている。一部のPerlコードと比べると長々しいように感じられるかもしれないが、文字数やワード数でコードを判断していると、最終的にはAPLのような言語に行き着く悪循環に陥ってしまうだろう。シェルスクリプトの作成は重要な作業なので、長い関数名を書くために数分の時間が余分にかかったとしても、それを重荷だというようにとらえるべきではないだろう。SCSHを使えば、ウェブサーバも、GUIアプリケーションも、典型的なNcursesベースのインストールスクリプトも作成することができる。

f -brilliant :
KKOB Radio afternoon drive time news anchor Laura MacCallum quit her job last Thursday after the station ’s news director pulled her stories about alleged vote - buying efforts at the recent Bernalillo County Republican Party delegate nominating conventions .
MacCallum , a 32 - year radio and TV news veteran who has worked in Chicago , Denver and Los Angeles , said the station caved to complaints from Congresswoman Heather Wilson ’s Senate campaign about the stories .
Wilson campaign spokeswoman Whitney Cheshire called the station to argue the unfairness of stories alleging that many delegates to the ward conventions were paid by Wilson ’s and other campaigns to show up and cast their votes for certain delegates .
Critics of the alleged vote - buying effort say it was an unfair scheme to lock out any challengers to Wilson ’s senate and Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White ’s congressional campaigns
KKOB News Director Pat Allen said the stories were pulled , not because of the campaign ’s complaints , but because he felt they lacked corroboration and that a source in some of MacCallum ’s stories , former New Mexico Governor Dave Cargo , was bitter because he was n’t elected as a delegate to the upcoming state Republican Party nominating convention .
As with previous polls , the numbers suggest resentment from the primary battle may carry over into the fall campaign against Republican John McCain -- even more so if Obama is the nominee .
Some 22 percent of Democrats called it either " not very likely " or " not at all likely " that they 'd vote for Obama in the fall , while the comparable number for Clinton is 17 percent .
Despite that , a narrow margin -- 45 - to - 43 percent -- believed that Obama has a better chance of winning the overall general election .
The poll 's margin of error is plus or minus 4 percent .
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Says the Republican Party needs to Move Left
Rino Arnold Schwarzenegger believes that the Republican party needs to move to the left .
This is really nothing new , but with the emergence of John McCain as the Republican nominee that appears to be where the Republican party is headed .
Here is what Arnold had to say recently :
“ The Republican idea is a great idea , but we ca n’t go and get stuck with just the right wing , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ Let ’s let the party come all the way to the center .
Let those people be heard as much as the right .
Let it be the big tent we ’ve talked about . ”
By moving to the center Republicans would be moving further left .
The Republican party is n’t ruled by or “ stuck with ” the right wing as Arnold says .
If it were , Mike Huckabee would be the disastrous nominee instead of John McCain .
If either party is ruled by the fringe wingers it is the Democrats .
They are controlled by the moveon.org types , just let someone in the Democrat party suggest that the Democrats need to move to the center and watch the insuing outrage .
Let Obama or Hillary play to the center and watch the fireworks begin .
The truth is that with John McCain as the disastrous Republican nominee the party has already shifted left .
Arnold goes on :
“ Let ’s invade and let ’s cross over that ( political ) center , ” he said .
“ The issues that they ’re talking about ?
Let them be our issues , and let the party be known for that . ”
Now he is saying we need to cross over the center .
That would put us on the left , would n’t it ?
He wants us to make the left ’s issues the right ’s issues as well .
I have news for you Arnold , the issues belong to both parties .
We are just on different sides of these issues .
By crossing over , Republicans would be giving up what they supposedly believe in .
When a person is willing to compromise his beliefs , he has none .
The Republican party is now seemingly willing to compromise their beliefs .
How else can you explain the nomination of John McCain .
I am tired of fighting for a party that wo n’t fight for themselves , that ’s all I have the patience for tonight .
This is the last straw , I am leaving the Republican party .
Stay tuned .

NEW YORK , March 17 ( Reuters ) -
The yield on U.S. 3 - month Treasury bills fell below 1 percent on Monday to levels not seen in 50 years prompted by intense safety bids for cash spurred by the ongoing global credit crunch .
Investors were pulling money out of stocks and even the booming commodity market even after the Federal Reserve conducted a fresh round of measures over the weekend to alleviate the credit crisis .
Major U.S. stock indexes .
DJI.SPX.IXIC were down as much as 1 percent .
Oil prices CLc1 were off 2.6 percent at $ 107 a barrel .
“ People are confused .
They are in a reactive mode , ” said Lou Brien , market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago .
The yield on three - month T - bills , considered by economists as a " risk - free " benchmark return on U.S. assets , was last quoted at 0.84 percent US3MT=RR , down 36 basis points from late Friday .
It reached a low of 0.63 percent earlier .
“ It ’s a complete place to hide out , ” Brien said .
The yield on 1 - month Treasury bills US1MT=RR traded even lower than their three - month counterparts .
It was last quoted at 0.55 percent , down 64 basis points from late Friday .
Six - month bill yield US6MT=RR last traded at 1.23 percent , compared with 1.34 percent late on Friday .

Someday soon , the phrase " dripping with light " wo n't just be an abstruse lyric in a post - punk song you 've written ... light may actually be dripping on things .
At least that 's what researchers at Nikki Chemical Co. and the Nagoya Institute of Technology hope to see happening by 2010 .
The team of scientists has created a white , fluorescent material which can be used to create white light , yet can be molded into a number of shapes .
The mushy lamps consist of an organic compound , which is coupled with ultraviolet light and a glasslike inorganic compound that gives the substance structural protection .
The combo can handle temperatures to 500 degrees Celsius , uses half the power of typical fluorescent lights , and will last longer than white LEDs due to heat resistance .
Also , did we mention it 's like Silly Putty ?

When presenting hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts this week , John McCain and his campaign said the cuts would n't necessarily worsen the deficit .
The key , they said , is McCain 's commitment to cutting spending by eliminating congressional earmarks .
On its face , the claim is simply foolish .
Even if McCain could eliminate the entire practice of placing earmarks in spending bills -- a dubious proposition -- Taxpayers for Common Sense did an exhaustive review of the 2008 expenditures and found $ 18.3 billion in earmarks .
With McCain 's tax cuts poised to cost about 22 times that much , the " solution " is n't exactly budget neutral .
But this gets even more entertaining when we take a closer look at what 's included among the earmarks McCain plans to eliminate .
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) has long portrayed himself as a staunch supporter of Israel .
" Obviously , " McCain has said , " I have been a very strong proponent to the State of Israel . "
He recently told the Jewish Journal that if elected president , he would " hit the ground running " and immediately get involved in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
It is astounding then that McCain has essentially vowed to eliminate U.S. funding assistance for Israel .
As it turns out , McCain economic adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin said McCain , if elected , would eliminate earmarks based on the definition used by the Congressional Research Service .
And that includes , among other things , " economic and military aid to Israel . "
Confronted with the implications of McCain 's proposal , his campaign said earmarked aid to Israel would n't count .
It 's a reminder of why it 's difficult to take McCain seriously on matters of public policy .
Pressed for details on what he believes , McCain a ) loves vague generalities ; b) gets easily confused ; or c ) decides his commitments are a lot more flexible than he'd like us to believe .
As for earmarks , he 's embraced a simplistic maxim : earmarks = waste .
Confronted with evidence to the contrary , his opposition wanes .
But therein lies the point -- every earmark has a purpose and supporters who can defend it .
Where will McCain draw the line ?
He does n't know .
How much will it save ?
He does n't know .
When can we expect more concrete answers ?
He does n't know .
Post Script : Just as an aside , if Dems really wanted to be aggressive , for the rest of the year , they 'd argue , " McCain said , if elected , he would cut off aid to Israel , but later changed his mind . "
Just sayin' .
Zenn Electric Cars to Steal Some Thunder ?
April 12th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
This was too good to pass up .
It ’s a tale of intrigue , exciting new technology , and a secretive business deal that could change the automotive industry as we know it .
Canadian electric car company Zenn Cars already sells city - only electric cars , but they claim they ’ll sell a new model in 2009 that can go 80 mph with a 250 mile range .
So what makes Zenn Cars special among the EV contenders ?
They ’ve thrown their money behind a different kind of battery .
Solid - state super capacitors ( not technically batteries ) supposedly last longer , store more energy , and cause less ecological harm than lithium - ion or lead - based batteries .
This is where the story gets interesting .
EEstor is the secret behind this promising promise , and the operative word here is “ secret ” .
EEstor shuns publicity , refuses to give interviews , and certainly has n’t been showing off their product .
Everyone ’s trying to learn more about this company and its technology , but I ca n’t seem to find their web page – if they have one .
Yet EEstor ( if that ’s their real name ) has already raised a few brows by signing a deal with Lockheed Martin for defense and homeland security applications ( details not disclosed ) .
If they can deliver what they promise it will change everything .
We ’re talking batteries that are lighter , stronger , faster , cheaper , and they never lose their charge capacity .
The possibilities for everything from autos to cell phones are exciting to put it mildly .
Imagine buying one rechargeable battery for every cell phone , laptop , gadget , appliance , etc. you ’ll ever use .
Ever .
Imagine car batteries that never go to the landfill and eliminate the need for gasoline .
Exciting ?
You bet .
But only if EEstor can walk the walk , after trying their hardest to avoid the talk .
On top of all this , it seems like everyone is coming out with electric vehicles in the near future .
Tesla ’s Roadster is already under production and promises to come out later this year .
Aptera ’s futuristic Typ1 could also come out at the end of this year or in 2009 .
In 2010 GM swears they ’ll roll out the much - awaited Volt .
The Zenn Citycar could be available in Fall of 2009 , which would put it right in the middle of the hot new EV market .
It ’ll be fun to see who , if any , come out on top with the “ Prius ” of electric vehicles .

The Cup Stops Here
Perhaps among the most important pieces of male athletic gear , the protective cup has n't changed much over the years .
Inspired by a recent NHL hockey incident , The Score seeks to find out why
On the face of it , John McCain ’s proposal to offer a gasoline tax “ holiday ” during the summer driving season might sound like a good way to cut gas prices at the busiest time of the year .
But economists and energy analysts say it would have little impact on mitigating the rise in gasoline prices .
In fact , it could lead to the opposite result .
The federal gasoline tax represents a flat fee of 18.4 cents a gallon nationwide .
With gasoline currently averaging $ 3.39 a gallon , the tax represents a mere 5 percent of today ’s pump price .
While that ’s not trivial , consider that gasoline prices have more than doubled since 2004 .
The problem is that lowering gasoline prices at the pump would encourage more consumption .
So in the long run , it would push prices up .
Video
The timing of the proposal matters .
Senator McCain called on Congress to suspend the gas tax from Memorial Day until Labor Day .
That ’s typically the period of highest gasoline use in the country as Americans drive to their holiday destinations .
“ You do n’t want to stimulate consumption , ” said Lawrence Goldstein , an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation .
“ The signal you want to send is the opposite one .
Politicians should say that conservation is where people ’s mindset ought to be . ”
Mr. Goldstein said that instead of freezing the federal tax , the government should help lower - income populations pay for gasoline .
It would be cheaper and benefit those households that need it most .
The United States the has lowest gasoline taxes among industrialized countries .
It also has the highest gasoline consumption level in the world .
Energy experts say the two are related .
America ’s cars and trucks burn nearly one out of every nine barrels of oil produced around the world each day .
The country also accounts for a quarter of global oil demand .
Gasoline taxes in Europe , for example , can account for up to 70 percent of fuel prices .
Of course , Europeans pay much higher gasoline prices , but the high tax levels have shielded drivers there from the wild price swings that American motorists have experienced in recent years .
The federal gasoline tax funds government programs , such as the federal highway system .
Cutting the tax would do only one thing : send more money to oil producers .
“ Higher demand just pushes the world price a bit higher , giving a sizable share of the tax refund to oil producers , ” said Lee Schipper , an energy expert and a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley .
He also pointed out that lower gasoline taxes , and hence spurring consumption , contradicts Senator McCain ’s stated goal of reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels .
“ And would the higher carbon dioxide emissions from the higher gasoline demand be consistent with his previous stance on restraining those emissions ? ”
Deadly Greed The Role of Speculators in the Global Food Crisis
Vast amounts of money are flooding the world 's commodities markets , driving up prices of staple foods like wheat and rice .
Biofuels and droughts can't fully explain the recent food crisis -- hedge funds and small investors bear some responsibility for global hunger .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Scientists studying Antarctic waters have filmed and captured giant sea creatures , like sea spiders the size of dinner plates and jelly fish with six meter ( 18 feet ) tentacles .
A fleet of three Antarctic marine research ships returned to Australia this week ending a summer expedition to the Southern Ocean where they carried out a census of life in the icy ocean and on its floor , more than 1,000 meters ( yards ) below the surface .
“ Gigantism is very common in Antarctic waters -- we have collected huge worms , giant crustaceans and sea spiders the size of dinner plates , ” Australian scientist Martin Riddle , voyage leader on the research ship Aurora Australis , said on Tuesday .
“ Many live in the dark and have pretty large eyes .
They are strange looking fish , ” Riddle told local radio .
“ Some of the video footage we have collected is really stunning -- it ’s amazing to be able to navigate undersea mountains and valleys and actually see what the animals look like in their undisturbed state , ” Riddle said .
“ In some places every inch of the sea floor is covered in life .
In other places we can see deep scars and gouges where icebergs scour the sea floor as they pass by , ” he said .
The Australian Antarctic Division expedition will help scientists monitor how the impact of environmental change in Antarctic waters , such as ocean acidification caused by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , will make it harder for marine organisms to grow and sustain calcium carbonate skeletons .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ It is predicted that the first effects of this will be seen in the cold , deep waters of Antarctica , ” said Riddle .
“ What we saw down there were vast coraline gardens based on calcareous organisms and these are the ones that could really be lost in an increasing acidic ocean , ” he said .
The three ships , the Aurora Australis , France ’s L’Astrolabe and Japan ’s Umitaka Maru docked in Hoabrt on Australia ’s southern island state of Tasmania , with their decks full of an array of sealife including unknown species of sea creatures collected near the eastern Antarctic land mass .
Some creatures , which were retrieved from between 200 - 1,400 meters ( yards ) below the surface , weighed up to 30 kg ( 65 pounds ) , while some 25 percent of the sealife chronicled was previous unknown .
The census of life in the Southern Ocean is known as the Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census ( CEAMARC ) .
The French and Japanese ships examined the mid and upper ocean , while the Australian ship studied the ocean floor .
“ This research will help scientists understand how communities have adapted to the unique Antarctic environment , ” said Graham Hosie , leader of the census project on Umitaka Maru .
“ Specimens collected will be sent to universities and museums around the world for identification , tissue sampling and bar - coding of their DNA .
Not all of the creatures that we found could be identified and it is very likely that some new species will be recorded as a result of these voyages . ”
CEAMARC is part of the international Census of Antarctic Marine Life , coordinated by the Australian Antarctic Division , which will see some 16 voyages to Antarctic waters during this , the International Polar Year ( 2007 -2009 ) .
The census will survey the biodiversity of Antarctic slopes , abyssal plains , open water , and under disintegrating ice shelves .
It aims to determine species biodiversity , abundance and distribution and establish a baseline dataset from which future changes can be observed .

Bill W. already posted about Conyers ' statement that he is committed to getting Rove to testify in the Don Siegelman case , even if it means having him arrested .
However , this segment from MSNBC's Verdict , where Catherine Crier explains to host Dan Abrams the process and the seriousness of an Inherent Contempt of Congress charge is was too good not to use , so I asked Heather to make the video for me .
Besides , it 's small and petty of me , but I do n't think you can hear " haul Karl Rove to jail " too many times .
Crier :
Well here 's the way this plays out .
If the full House issues the contempt citation then it's supposed to go to the Department of Justice and they 're supposed to take it to a Grand Jury .
They 're supposed to enforce it .
Well they 've already , the Bush administration says no , uh , there 's Executive authority , we 're saying privilege .
They 're not going to enforce it .
You might then try the Federal courts .
The Federal courts are liable to say it 's a political question .
But the Constitution gives the Congress the inherent power to issue contempt and then to prosecute on this .
Abrams :
On their own .
Crier :
They can send the Sergeant at Arms out into the countryside , arrest , haul somebody in and in days gone by used to literally hold them in the basement of Congress in an impromptu jail and then they could have a trial .
That is still their power today .
Full transcript ( courtesy of Heather ) below the fold .
Abrams :
We have got breaking news tonight .
The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has threatened to have Karl Rove arrested .
At issue , whether Rove will testify about the prosecution of AL former Democratic Governor Don Siegelman .
What role if any did Rove play in bringing down the popular Democrat ?
Thus far Rove has refused to testify and the committee has given him another week or they say they 'll subpoena him .
If he still refuses , Politico.com reporting that John Conyers , Chairman of the Judiciary Committee said today " We 'll do what any self - respecting committee would do .
We 'd hold him in contempt .
Either that or go and have him arrested . "
" We 're closing in on Rove . " Conyers said .
Catherine , the Congress has to be getting very serious about this .
Crier :
It 's about time .
Abrams :
Tell me why .
Crier : I 'm serious because we 've got whether it was the Hariet Miers , there 've been several individuals if you go back throughout this Bush administration that have n't responded .
Now they 've got Karl Rove in the Siegelman affair and he has refused repeated offers for compromise to give him an opportunity to testify , and it 's finally to the point where you say either this third branch has power or it has been completely emasculated .
Abrams :
Because up to now what they 've been saying is we'd like you to come in voluntarily uh and testify .
So far he 's been saying he will answer questions in writing , will come in and talk but there can't be a transcript , not under oath , etc. , and now it sounds like Congress is getting a little tired of it .
This is Congressman Wexler , also a member of this committee on this program last night .
Wexler :
And if he refuses to honor the subpoena then the full House of Representatives must hold Mr. Rove in contempt of Congress and then we must ask that Attorney General to enforce the contempt of Congress subpoena or citation .
Abrams :
But inherent contempt .
What does that mean ?
Crier :
Well here 's the way this plays out .
If the full House issues the contempt citation then it's supposed to go to the Department of Justice and they 're supposed to take it to a Grand Jury .
They 're supposed to enforce it .
Well they 've already , the Bush administration says no , uh , there 's Executive authority , we 're saying privilege .
They 're not going to enforce it .
You might then try the Federal courts .
The Federal courts are liable to say it 's a political question .
But the Constitution gives the Congress the inherent power to issue contempt and then to prosecute on this .
Abrams :
On their own .
Crier :
They can send the Sergeant at Arms out into the countryside , arrest , haul somebody in and in days gone by used to literally hold them in the basement of Congress in an impromptu jail and then they could have a trial .
That is still their power today .
Abrams :
Unlikely to happen here but it does sound like they 're getting ready to move forward with something here .
Crier :
Well unlikely to happen in the sense that they might not jail them in the basement any longer , but at this point and time if you look at , if the DOJ has already basically said we 're not going to do what we 're supposed to do , they must take it to a Grand Jury .
Says no , Executive privilege , we 're not going to act .
The courts probably wo n't and it will be , if they , if the full Congress asserts , if the full House votes , then they will have to try this case themselves , which means issue the arrest warrant and try this .
Abrams : Again final question .
Executive privilege , Karl Rove has said that he did n't talk to anyone in the White House about it so what 's the potential Executive privilege ?
Crier :
Well he 's making the claim and that assertion I do n't think anywhere .
It might be something the Federal court will go with but right now the Department of Justice has given no indication that they will , that they will go out and serve those subpoenas issued by Conyers .
Abrams :
Does it surprise you Conyers is using language like arrested ?
Crier :
At this point .. no. I 'm a big rule of law , this has nothing to do with politics for me , it is respecting the rule of law , regardless of Democrat or Republican , and at this point in time if they do n't show back bone then there are not three branches of government in this country .
Abrams :
And we should say again the subpoena has not been issued yet so we shall see what happens if and when uh the subpoena is issued ... uhmmm and I 'll continue to follow this case .

In real life she ’s a little girl whose story is a reminder that medical research can change lives and that the pioneers include patients , some of whom are babies .
Melanie was 9 months old when her parents faced an agonizing decision .
She had already had two operations for a malignant brain tumor , and doctors could not be sure they had removed all the cancer .
She needed more treatment , but standard chemotherapy offered little hope in exchange for its harsh side effects .
And yet the McDaniels knew that if they did nothing , the odds were high that the tumor would come back .
Doctors at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston offered another option , an experimental treatment .
To qualify , a child had to have a progressive cancer , and it had to be terminal .
The McDaniels took a gamble and a leap of faith , and signed Melanie up .
“ It wo n’t save her , but it may help other people , ” her father , Paul McDaniel , told me in an interview for a Science Times article published in April 2002 .
Then he paused and added , “ Maybe it will save her . ”
Radiotherapy for cancer can also damage healthy cells A drug which may protect the body against damage from radiation has been developed by US scientists .
It is hoped it could make radiotherapy safer for people with cancer and could also be used in the event of a " dirty bomb " or nuclear disaster .
Known as CBLB502 , and so far tested in animals , it switches on a biological mechanism that helps healthy cells survive blasts of radiation .
The findings published in Science are set to be tested in clinical trials .
Radiation kills cells by causing damage which encourages cell suicide , or apoptosis .
But healthy cells may be killed alongside tumour cells in the process which is why radiologists need to target the tumour as specifically as possible .
If the protective properties seen in this laboratory study can be reproduced in people with cancer , this could be an important step towards reducing side effects for people having radiotherapy
Dr Joanna Owens , Cancer Research UK
Researchers developed the drug after looking at how some resistant cancer cells are able to withstand radiotherapy .
It works by inhibiting the protein that initiates the cell suicide programme .
Studies in animals suggest CBLB502 protects healthy cells in the bone marrow and digestive tract against radiation but does not seem to protect tumour cells which remain vulnerable to treatment .
Mice and monkeys injected with the drug between 45 minutes and 24 hours before being subjected to normally lethal radiation were more likely to survive or live longer than untreated animals , the researchers found .
Side - effects
One risk of preventing cell death is that defective cells may be allowed to survive which could then turn cancerous .
However , the researchers found no sign of this happening in the laboratory tests on mice .
Also , there were no apparent side effects .
Protecting healthy cells against the effects of radiation may allow cancer patients to receive higher doses of radiotherapy , or longer courses of treatment .
The drug may also be useful in protecting against fall out from a nuclear disaster , such as Chernobyl , or the effects of a terrorist " dirty bomb " .
Dr Andrei Gudkov from the Lerner Research Institute in Cleveland , Ohio , said they had set out to enable healthy cells to imitate the ability of tumour cells to avoid cell death .
But they had to develop a way of making this effect temporary and reversible .
" We demonstrated the drug is efficacious when injected before radiation and after radiation .
" In summary , CBLB502 reduces radiation toxicity without diminishing the therapeutic anti-tumour effect of radiation and without promoting radiation - induced carcinogenicity . "
Dr Joanna Owens , science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " These are interesting results and we look forward to following the progress of CBLB502 through planned clinical trials .
" If the protective properties seen in this laboratory study can be reproduced in people with cancer , this could be an important step towards reducing side effects for people having radiotherapy . "

What are these ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
For the first time in 70 years , the U.S. Supreme Court will take on the question of whether individual Americans have the right to keep and bear arms or whether it a collective right of the people for service in a state militia .
Senior Special Agent in charge William Newell holds a Colt. 38 Super semi-automatic pistol that was confiscated and is being stored in one of the " vaults " at the local office of the ATF ( Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ) as evidence for trial or waiting to be melted down in Phoenix , Arizona , July 6 , 2007 .

That question is at the heart of a long , impassioned debate about how much power the government has to keep people from owning guns and it could soon be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case about one of the nation ’s strictest gun control laws .
Set for arguments on March 18 and with a decision expected by late June , the nation ’s highest court could resolve once and for all the much - disputed meaning of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
Written 219 years ago , the amendment says , “ A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ”
Few constitutional law issues have triggered more scholarly debate and historical research on whether the Constitution ’s authors intended to guarantee an individual right or a collective right tied to service in a state - regulated militia , like today ’s National Guard .
The arguments follow a series of mass shootings in the past year -- multiple killings on at least three college campuses , two shopping centers and one Missouri town meeting .
Gun deaths average 80 a day in the United States , 34 of them homicides , according to Centers for Disease Control data , and yet the gun issue has barely registered in the U.S. presidential campaign .
If the court finds it is an individual right , gun control advocates fear it could place in jeopardy not only the ban on private handgun ownership in the U.S. capital at issue in the case , but also other laws around the country regulating and restricting private possession of firearms .
The Supreme Court ’s last review of the Second Amendment came in a five - page discussion in an opinion issued nearly 70 years ago that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional issue .
That could change when the justices consider whether a 32 - year - old Washington , D.C. , law banning private possession of handguns violates the Second Amendment rights of individuals unaffiliated with any state - regulated militia .
DIVISIVE ISSUE
Former top U.S. Justice Department officials including former Attorney General Janet Reno , law professors , linguistic experts and historians all argued the Second Amendment protects the right of people only to keep arms for militia service .
On the other side , the Bush administration , the powerful National Rifle Association , a majority of the U.S. Senate and a majority of the House of Representatives argued an individual has the right to possess arms .
The administration , under then - Attorney General John Ashcroft , reversed the position the federal government had taken for decades and said in 2001 the Second Amendment protected an individual right to possess firearms for a lawful private purpose .
Solicitor General Paul Clement , the administration ’s chief advocate before the Supreme Court , filed a brief with the justices that adopted many arguments made previously by legal scholars for an individual right to keep arms .
He said placement of the Second Amendment within the Bill of Rights reinforced the view that it was intended to put certain individual private activities beyond the reach of the national government .
Others disagreed , including 15 historians .
“ As histories of the Revolutionary era , we are confident ... that the authors of the Second Amendment would be flabbergasted to learn that in endorsing the republican principle of a well - regulated militia , they were also precluding restrictions on such potentially dangerous property as firearms , ” they said .
Three professors of linguistics and English said the amendment ’s purpose was to preserve or perpetuate a well - regulated militia and that it used unmistakably military language .
“ The term ‘ bear arms ’ is an idiom that means to serve as a soldier , do military service , fight , ” they said in citing the Oxford English Dictionary .
Former high - ranking U.S. military officers filed a brief that argued another interpretation -- that the amendment guarantees a blend of individual and community rights .
“ The Second Amendment ensures both the individual ’s right to posses firearms , subject to reasonable regulation , and the constitutional goal of collective defense readiness , ” they said .
Take the Easy Way Out
When I was a kid , people were always telling me that there was no substitute for hard work .
If I wanted to be smart , I had to sit and force myself to read hard books .
If I wanted to lose weight , I had to force myself to exercise .
If I wanted to play piano , I had to force myself away from the computer to practice .
Cheating , they explained , would only cheat myself in the end .
And yet today I eagerly ran to the library to grab five large books ( and return seven more ) , felt an itch to go jogging , and walked away from web surfing so I could go practice a musical instrument .
The adults were completely wrong .
Your body ’s resistance to an activity is n’t an obstacle to be overcome , it ’s a message that you ’re being an idiot , just like when your hand hurts after you punch a wall .
The right solution is n’t to start punching the wall harder , it ’s to look around for a tool to help you do the job .
In the case of books , the key is that you need to be sure to read books that are at your level .
If you read books about subjects you do n’t know enough to understand or that use a dialect you ’re not familiar with , it ’s going to be hard and it ’s going to be a waste of time .
With losing weight , the key is things like the Shangri - La Diet .
And with learning an instrument , the key is using Bemani games that actually make music fun .
I ’ve discussed the other two in other places , but why do Bemani games work ?
First , you ’re playing real music .
Normally when you play piano , you have to start on baby songs which are both infantilizing and uninteresting , with real music not even on the horizon .
Bemani games start you on real songs from the beginning .
Since the reason many people get excited about musical instruments in the first place is the chance to play their favorite song , this is a pretty compelling difference .
And the fact that the computer simplifies the song and fills in the notes you do n’t play for you makes it possible .
Second , Bemani games provide clear additional results in proportion to additional effort .
This is what makes them so much fun .
I do n’t know about the real science , but in Barbara Ehrenreich ’s novel Kipper ’s Game the plot revolves around some research showing that games like that stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain .
You get the high of achievement , but it quickly wears off as you get used to your new skill level , and so you want to do better so you can get another high .
This is also what makes these games so educational .
Research on experts has found such immediate feedback is essential to learning , calling the general process “ deliberate practice ” .
In deliberate practice , “ subjects should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of their performance .
The subjects should repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks .
When these conditions are met , practice improves accuracy and speed of performance on cognitive , perceptual , and motor tasks ( Fitts & Posner , 1967 ; Gibson , 1969 ; Welford , 1968 ) . ” ( K. Anders Ericsson , et. al , “ The Role of Deliberate Practice ” , Psychological Review )
Your attempts are n’t random — it ’s very clear what works and what does n’t and you can adjust your strategies accordingly .
Third , you can do them in small chunks .
When you normally play an instrument , if you hit a wrong note you often keep trying until you get it right .
But with Bemani games , the music just keeps marching on without you .
This might at first seem a disadvantage , but it means you do n’t get hung up on a mistake , each attempt takes at most as long the song does .
With real music , if you hit a difficult part of the song you can easily get stuck trying over and over to get it right , before getting frustrated and giving up on the whole thing .
Keeping the music moving forces you to look at the bigger picture .
The flip side of this is that playing the games gives you a continuous sense of motion and progress .
In the mid-1980s — the heyday of video game research — some psychologists were trying to find out what video games quite so much fun .
They took the classic Wozniak / Atari game Breakout and started removing components to see if kids stopped playing it .
What they found was you could remove just about everything — the levels , the score , the bouncing off the paddle — everything except for the animations of the bricks disappearing .
It was making the bricks disappear , somehow , that made the game fun .
( Mind at Play , Loftus and Loftus )
I doubt Bemani games were made with these kind of principles in mind — considering the history , it was probably just a coincidence .
But it shows that you could have created Bemani from them .
All you needed to do was pay attention to the fact that learning an instrument was frustrating and tried to eliminate the frustrating part .
Good designers , when they see people having trouble using something they designed , do n’t tell the user to try harder .
They fix the design .
We should take the same attitude when we design our life as well .

The reason of such threads are first of all psychological .
This is called waiting for " situation X " .
This X thing can be anything ; from Niburu to Ufos .
People who are not satisfied with his own life and not enough socially or political active , expect a sudden change in his life and in the world with the help of " outside " forces .
The reason of it , that they cannot find the power to change their own life .
They always need an " external " force .
This has of course not only psychological reasons .
We are living in an age that most of us are disconnected from political activites and concrete responsibilities ( I am not talking about writing in political conspiracy forums ) .
This disconnection from a shared meaningfulness results in a kind of suffering which results to trying to establish a meaningful totality with artificial means , such as " situation X " that will never come .
I am not saying that the OP has psychological problems , but this is a result of a common suffering which is produced by our modern life systems .
We are living in an age that most of us are disconnected from political activites and concrete responsibilities
Well would it have been better if i did not post the information that credible witnesses to these events have given .
I do not have any psychological problems ... but if believing that there are other intelligent races in the universe and the set of current events seems to be leading to some kind of disclosure in the near future is a psychological problem then go at it .
I admit life is hard , even mine ... i would love for something to come down from the sky and say " look this is the truth , you do n't have to work so had to live , you do n't have to see your loved ones in pain " , you must have it good if you do n't have one problem in your life and are very satisfied .
Lets hope your case is the same as the billions of other people that are in debt , have relationship troubles , lose loved ones , and are themselves dieing from hunger and discrimination and oppression .
The thing that sets this situation x apart from all the others is it is not about DOOM and GLOOM .
This one actually has a happy ending But heyI sure am not disconnected from the political scene , in fact i can see past it as a way to blind the people form the truth .
Judging from what has been happening in the political and world scene for the past 40 or so odd years , there seems to be a regime set on getting control of the world .
How much longer are we going to be going into meaningless wars that are a product of the Machine bent on making money off of innocent lives ?
How are u supposed to fight the " NWO " if people still believe that what they see on cnn and fox news is the truth .
If and when this fly over happens i think that people will really wake up , and it will change our world for the better !
When I started MicroSolutions I was 24 years old .
I had just gotten fired from my job and was sleeping on the floor of a 3 bedroom apartment with 5 other guys living there .
I did n’t have a closet or a bed , but I had 2 suits .
I bought both of those polyester wonders , one Grey pinstripe , the other blue pinstripe for a total of $ 99 dollars plus tax .
To go with those fashion forward wonders , I had several white polo button downs that I had purchased used from a re-sale shop , and a couple ties that I had bought on sale or had gotten as hand me downs from friends .
I wore those babies when it was cold .
I wore them when it was 100 degrees plus .
I ironed them and when I could I got them dry cleaned .
MicroSolutions was started in June and over the next 7 years , starting with those first 2 suits , I wore a suit every work day .
I bought new suits as the business grew .
I bought shirts and ties and shoes new instead of used .
I went 7 years without a vacation to make that company work , but I did n’t go a work day without a suit .
Someone had once told me that you wear to work what your customers wear to work .
That seemed to make sense to me , so I followed it , and expected those who worked for me to follow it as well .
After I sold MicroSolutions I decided that I never would wear a suit again .
I was able to hold true to that while I was making a lot of money trading stocks for the next 5 years , but then Todd and I started AudioNet which would morph into Broadcast.com .
With our new business , I decided that I would have to wear a suit , but would modify the rule so that I would only wear a suit when someone I was selling to was wearing a suit .
If they were selling to me , I did n’t care if they were wearing a tux .
I was going to go comfortable and not wear a suit .
When Broadcast.com was sold , the suit went out the window completely .
I vowed to never wear one again other than weddings and funerals , and only then because it was n’t worth the hassle to deal with people asking why you did n’t wear a suit .
I ’m certain the people getting married dint care , and I do n’t think anyone is going to be looking down at me wondering why I showed up at their funeral without a suit .
Suits make no sense whatsoever .
Why am I such a suit hater ?
I ’m not a suit hater , I just could never think of any good reason for any sane person to wear a suit in the first place .
Exactly what purpose does a suit serve ?
Why in the world are so many people required to wear a suit to work ?
Do the clothes make the man or woman in the western world today ?
Does wearing a tie make us work harder or smarter ?
Is this a conspiracy by the clothing , fabric or dry cleaning industry to take our money ?
Or are we all just lemmings following a standard we all know makes zero sense , but we follow because we are afraid not to ?
If you are a CEO , are there not better things your employees could spend money on than multiple suits , ties , dress shirts , dress shoes , dress socks , dry cleaning , and all the other associated costs ?
Gee , no suits would be the same as giving your employees a tax free raise .
Think that might make them happy ?
Or do employees consider having to spend money on suits a perk ?
Now I understand some people think wearing a suit provides them with a certain level of stature .
It gives them confidence .
It helps them feel good about themselves .
Well let me be the first to tell you that if you feel like you need a suit to gain that confidence , you got problems .
The minute you open your mouth , all those people who might think you have a great suit , forget about the suit and have to deal with the person wearing it .
Is there a reason other than “ thats just the way it is ” ?
Have n’t you looked at someone in a suit , trying to look important and just thought how stupid and out of place it is ?
Why do we do this to ourselves ?
I know this all is a crazy rant , but come on now .
If you have had to wear a suit to work every day , have n’t you wondered why ?
If you are the CEO or in charge of a company , have n’t you wondered yourself why you are making your employees waste all that money and come to work and spend the day in uncomfortable clothing ?
Give your suit wearing employees a raise .
Tell them every day is casual day .

Circa dieci giorni fa mi becca in MSN una vecchia conoscenza .
Dopo i convenevoli , mi informa che verrà a Milano per un colloquio di lavoro allora , molto educatamente , gli rispondo di farmi sapere quando sarà , in modo tale da poter organizzare per vederci .
Venerdì scorso mi ribecca , sempre in MSN e mi dice che lunedì , cioè oggi sarà qui , che intende fermarsi fino a martedi sera e se lo posso ospitare .
Siccome da quando è morto mio padre io sono tornata a vivere a casa dei miei , non ho più la possibilità di offrire asilo a nessuno , quindi gli propongo di prenotare un albergo ed eventualmente di rimanere fuori assieme ; lui accetta la cosa di buon grado .
Questo week end , di totale relax e fancazzismo , all ’insegna delle letture in francese ( grazie trippi per il libro , è bellissimo , prima o poi ci farò un post ) e con la colonna sonora di Burt Bacharach , ho ripercorso le tappe della pseudo - frequentazione con l’ometto in questione :
Da quando l’ho conosciuto ( nel 2005 ) , le poche volte che ci siamo visti sono sempre andata io nella sua città ;
La prima volta che sono andata a trovarlo mi ha tirato un mega pacco e se l’è anche presa perchè io gli ho fatto una scenata epocale .
D’altronde avevo fatto solo 650 Km per vederlo , cosa vuoi che sia ( meno male che ero ospite da amiche e non sono riamsta sola come una scema ) ;
( meno male che ero ospite da amiche e non sono riamsta sola come una scema ) ;
Le altre volte non sono state meno significative in tal senso , insomma un vero gentleman ;
L’ultima visita , risalente a più di un anno fa , fini con i saluti in stazione poi , mai più una telefonata , un messaggio , una chattata , un piccione viaggiatore ;
A ottobre , per il suo compleanno gli mandai un sms di auguri e lui mi rispose “ grazie , ma chi sei ? ” ( il mio n. di cellulare era stato cancellato dalla rubrica ) .
Quando conobbi questo “ fenomeno ” mi presi una sonora cotta e , come tutte le donnine in amore non mi curai di quanto si comportasse da stronzo ( probabilmente perchè non era affatto coinvolto , ma non voglio fargliene una colpa per questo ) .
Comunque , alla fine delle mie riflessioni sono arrivata alla conclusione che
A ) non ho voglia di farmi sbattimenti di lunedì , con tutti i casini che ho da sbrigare al lavoro
B ) Non ho voglia di dormire fuori , per poi svegliarmi all 6 del mattino e scappare come una ladra da una camera d’albergo
C ) Non ho voglia di fare sesso con una persona di cui non me ne può pregare di meno
D ) Sono rimasta seduta in riva al fosso per tanto tempo , volete mettere che soddisfazione vedere che ti passa davanti il cadavere putrido e gonfio di qualcuno che ti ha trattato da zerbino ?
EH ! GIA ’ IL PACCO ERA D’OBBLIGO – L’EQUILIBRO TRA YING E YANG E’ FINALMENTE RISTABILITO !
A Mother 's Prerogative
When you are young and single , your mother will nag you for not having a girlfriend or boyfriend .
When you have a significant other , your mother will complain that you are not married .
When you are married , your mother will complain that you have n't given her a grandchild yet .
When you are married and have a child , your mother will criticize that an only child will become spoiled and needs a sibling or two .
And finally , when you are married with children , your mother will whine that you do not spend enough time with her !
Whatever you do , your mother will never stop nagging you , so my only advice is to try to accept it .

On Sept. 10 , 2001 , then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld gave a speech at the Pentagon on the need to combat “ an adversary that poses a threat , a serious threat , to the security of the United States of America . ”
The enemy was n’t Russia , China or Al Qaeda .
It was the Pentagon bureaucracy .
Rumsfeld declared a crusade not merely to attack waste but to transform the military into a technologically superior fighting force that would achieve what no modern military ever had : corporate - style efficiency .
Alas , the dream of managing the government more like a business is central to some of the Bush administration ’s most disastrous mistakes .
It was at the heart of the decision to browbeat the generals into agreeing to invade Iraq with a “ light footprint , ” which allowed the insurgency to flourish .
Contempt for the bureaucratic process doomed serious postwar planning -- after all , governmental decision - making is political , collaborative and agonizingly slow , and the result is almost always a compromise that may avoid disaster but stifles innovation .
To run the occupation of Iraq , President Bush chose a man who promised to make decisions like a CEO , which is why L. Paul Bremer III made the fatal mistake of disbanding the Iraqi army without consulting the cumbersome Washington bureaucracy .
And corporate thinking about efficiency led to vastly expanding the outsourcing of functions traditionally performed by the military .
The biggest beneficiary has been Blackwater USA , a private security firm with powerful political and personnel ties to an administration that has awarded it more than $ 1 billion in contracts since 2002 .
A handful of prescient Democratic lawmakers trying to review the scope and nature of security outsourcing were ignored until Sept. 16 , when Blackwater personnel killed at least 11 Iraqis .
Now Congress is finally turning its attention to bringing corporate - style accountability and management to contracting .
Particularly worthy of support are a “ sunshine ” bill sponsored by Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill. ) , who has long been thwarted in her attempts to review taxpayer - funded contracts ; a transparency and accountability bill by Rep. David E. Price ( D - N.C. ) ; and a bill by Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) that incorporates many of the House proposals .
Congress also must answer an essential question that the Congressional Research Service , in a July report , said it could n’t :
For which functions is the use of private contractors cost - effective ?
It ’s a bad sign that the Pentagon does n’t have ready answers .
But Congress should also debate the overarching issue :
Which military and security functions should be outsourced in the first place ?
And which pose the potential to harm the national interest if delegated to the private sector ?
The traditional standard was that “ mission critical ” functions -- jobs that would lose the war if botched -- should n’t be outsourced .
What little is known about the Pentagon ’s use of security contractors indicates that standard is obsolete .
But what should the new criteria be ?

The Blackwater debacle suggests that at the very least , outsourcing the protection of U.S. diplomats operating in war zones -- a national security imperative -- is a bad idea .
Military officers complain that Blackwater ’s cowboy tactics reflect its mission , which is n’t to win Iraqi hearts and Iraq but to protect the diplomats in their care , no matter how many Iraqis are terrorized or harmed in the process .
The State Department admits that without Blackwater , it ca n’t safely escort its diplomats even around Baghdad .
So it ’s disturbing that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insists on relying on the firm instead of asking Congress to expand funding for the experts at protecting diplomats without antagonizing the local population , the professionals who are trained to used deadly force with restraint and who understand the standards and mission of the U.S.
After all , they work for her -- in the department ’s own Diplomatic Security unit .
If the U.S. is to calm volatile Iraq , it should start by requiring that those permitted to wield deadly force in America ’s name at least work for the U.S. government .
Critics who fear the cost might consider instead the consequences of the “ hollowing out ” of the government ’s capacity to protect its own , and of losing to the private sector the security know - how that is essential in a world ever more dangerous for Americans .
Well after being under NDA for so long , I ’m glad to be able to say that Amazon Simple DB has gone into limited beta .
Congratulations to everyone on the SDS / SimpleDB team ; their several years of work on SimpleDB ( formerly called SDS ) is a brilliant piece of engineering .
What ’s cool about SimpleDB
Really large data sets
Really Fast
Highly Available – It ’s Amazon .
Running Erlang .
Whoa .
On demand scaling – Like S3 , EC2 , with a sensible data metering pricing model
Schemaless – major cool factor for me here ; items are little hash tables containing sets of key , value pairs
Considerations you ’ll want to think about
Eventual Consistency – Data is not immediately propagated across all nodes … the latency is usually around a second , but for high data sets or loads , you may experience more latency .
On the plus side , your data is n’t lost !
Queries are lexigraphical –
You ’ll need to store data in lexicographical ordered form ( zero - pad your integers , add positive offsets to negative integer sets , and convert dates into something like ISO 8601 )
Search Indexes –
You ’ll need to construct your own indexes for text search – The SimpleDB query expressions do n’t support text search , so you ’ll have to construct inverted indexes to properly do “ text search ” .
This is actually a really great lightweight way to do this and I ’m sure many interesting indexing schemes will be possible .
Under the hood
According to the SimpleDB team , SimpleDB is built on top of Erlang .
One of the developers , Jim Larson and I worked together at Sendmail , and he was part of a team doing some amazing stuff with an Erlang message store way back in 2000 .
While you do n’t need to know Erlang to use SimpleDB , many people have visited here interested in its Erlang roots .
If you are interested in learning Erlang , I can recommend Programming Erlang , written by Erlang ’s creator – the best introduction you can find .
I ’ve associate - linked to it on Amazon ; just for a little meta-fun .
The data model is simply :
Large collections of items organized into domains .
organized into .
Items are little hash tables containing attributes of key , value pairs .
of key , value pairs .
Attributes can be searched with various lexicographical queries .
Now you can easily build :
Search indexes
Log databases / analysis tools –
Data mining stores
Tools for World Domination
Further Reading
I also wrote a very basic Python module for SimpleDB to handle the XML and REST stuff ( too bad it ’s not JSON , at least for now ) , which I ’ll release as soon as I figure out how much of the NDA is now lifted .
There are a few floating around , so it should n’t be too long before they appear publicly .
Updates :
Added a link to Nick Christenson ‘s paper on Sendmail ’s Erlang message store – A great read for those of you building large scale messaging systems or anything in Erlang .
Added a link to Werner Vogels ’ article on eventual consistency – a great background behind SimpleDB ’s consistency design choice .
Whether or not SimpleDB and Dynamo are the same underlying technology has never been confirmed by an authoritative source .
That ’s all I ’m allowed to say .

A new breakthrough superconducting material fabricated by a Canadian - German team has been made out of a silicon - hydrogen compound and does not require cooling .
The implications of the discovery are enormous and could transform the way people live by cutting power usage from everything from refrigeration to cell phones .
Instead of super - cooling the material , as is necessary for conventional superconductors , the new material is instead super - compressed .
The researchers claim that the new material could sidestep the cooling requirement , thereby enabling superconducting wires that work at room temperature .
" If you put hydrogen compounds under enough pressure , you can get superconductivity , " said professor John Tse of the University of Saskatchewan .
" These new superconductors can be operated at higher temperatures , perhaps without a refrigerant . "
He performed the theoretical work with doctoral candidate Yansun Yao .
The experimental confirmation was performed by researcher Mikhail Eremets at the Max Plank Institute in Germany .
The new family of superconductors are based on a hydrogen compound called " silane , " which is the silicon analog of methane -- combining a single silicon atom with four hydrogen atoms to form a molecular hydride .
( Methane is a single carbon atom with four hydrogens ) .
Researchers have speculated for years that hydrogen under enough pressure would superconduct at room temperature , but have been unable to achieve the necessary conditions ( hydrogen is the most difficult element to compress ) .
The Canadian and German researchers attributed their success to adding hydrogen to a compound with silicon that reduced the amount of compression needed to achieve superconductivity .
Tse 's team is currently using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron to characterize the high pressure structures of silane and other hydrides as potential superconducting materials for industrial applications as well as a storage mechanism for hydrogen fuel cells .
Subtitled : ‘ No comment ’ to the article title
A recent news article mentioned that a Kent State undergraduate received notice from the FBI that an opinion piece of hers had attracted the attention of a white nationalist internet group .
In “ I am not a white bitch , ” [ link broken , read full text here ] senior Beth Rankin complains about being “ ostracized ” for being white .
She claims she wants to be “ united ” in the “ fight against prejudice . ”
The problem is that the black people are being mean to her .
No , really !
And undoubtedly that ’s what ’s stopping her from being a good anti-racist .
But read through Rankin ’s piece , and you see the condescension , the arrogance and the privilege that too often are the hallmarks of the “ white anti-racist . ”
First , Rankin believes that she should be welcomed everywhere and is shocked to find that is not the case .
She attended a Black United Students event four years ago and it is still fresh in her mind :
From the moment Justin and I entered the ballroom , the tension was palpable .
We received puzzled stares from students sitting around us , and though we could n’t put a finger on why , we felt incredibly unwelcome .
I left feeling uncomfortable and unable to make sense of what had happened .
Many white people are unaccustomed to being the minority in a group .
They are used to being made to feel welcome , and are shocked and dismayed when this is not the case .
They conclude , as Rankin did , that it is because of racism !
She goes on to write that she confronted members of the Black United Students :
“ … but that ’s racism … ” we were told that as the majority , we were unable to feel racism .
We just could n’t understand .
Two years later , I was forced to understand .
She was “ forced to understand ” because on two separate occasions she claims she was called a “ white bitch . ”
By black people .
Because she experienced two or three acts of prejudice , she now claims to understand racism .
And it apparently stung her deeply .
Not only did black people not welcome her at their university event , but she was told that she might not have the life experience necessary to understand a viewpoint and people were mean to her to boot !
I would laugh if it were n’t for the fact that so many discussions of racism end up with white people similarly claiming all the air in the room for themselves .
Once during a discussion of systemic institutionalized racism , a white man talked about the racism he too had suffered .
He talked about how black people were racist too .
And when asked what he was referring to , he said a black boy had thrown pebbles at him once when he was walking down the street .
I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP .™
At another community meeting convened to discuss problems of racism in the schools , a white woman took up a large portion of time while she cried .
She said that she had tried , really tried , to be nice to black people .
But sometimes they were mean to her .
And of course , people of color should be extra-nice to white people who deign to come and help us out with our “ plight . ”
We should give them cookies and be very grateful .
Because of course , racism is n’t their responsibility .
Unless , of course , their feelings have been hurt .
“ Racism ” is an issue to white people when they believe that they have been on the receiving end .
For example , why did the FBI contact the writer of the original article ?
Because she had received attention on the St0rmfr0nt website ?
How often are people of color threatened there ?
Has the FBI contacted them as well ?
I do n’t recall ever hearing about it before , but maybe racism is n’t important unless it ’s reverse racism .
You know , racism that is going in an unexpected direction .
That ’s why they call it “ reverse ” racism –because it ’s not supposed to happen that way .
Additionally , racism really is n’t the problem of white people .
So give them cookies for wanting to help out , y’all .
Cookies are what they want , but they ’re not always going to get them .
As writer Kil Ja Kim notes :
… white people need to be willing to have their very social position , their very relationship of domination , their very authority , their very being … let go , perhaps even destroyed .
I know this might sound scary , but that is really not my concern .
I am not interested in making white people , even those so - called good - hearted anti-racist whites , comfortable about their position in struggles that shape my life in ways that it will never shape theirs .
But you get the feeling instead that they want to hold hands with us and sing “ Kum Bah Yah . ”
Good heavens !
Do n’t those black people understand that they should be grateful that a Well Intentioned White Woman like Rankin has come to tell them what racism is all about ?
Because she knows it more intimately and has a deeper understanding of it as a white person whose life has been affected by racism .
This is just one of the arenas in which white people demonstrate their inability to relinquish their dominant position .
So even when they want to do anti-racist work , they replicate racist behavior .
Rankin writes as follows :
So this is what I say to you , current members and leaders of BUS : Tell me again .
Tell me again what your goals are .
I certainly hope they differ from those expressed to me in 2004 .
Tell me what you are doing to reach out to non -black students who support your cause .
As a straight girl , PRIDE !
Kent has always welcomed me to their meetings and functions because they knew I supported their cause .
I want to be able to attend BUS functions and feel the same love .
Racism is still a problem in this country , and it will never be solved if we continue to divide black from white .
I have been called names and ostracized for the color of my skin , and I have been ridiculed for sharing my life with a man who is not white .
Got that ?
She demands to know BUS ’ goals , and she “ certainly hope (s ) ” that they are different from what she heard in 2004 .
Because an organization formed for the empowerment of black students should be held accountable by a white woman .
And because the great problem of racism in this country is centered around the racism directed at white people .
Got that ?
The single greatest problem of racism today is the fact that black people are mean to white people .
You can see this is true because black people are the CEOs of all the big corporations .
They tend to own the majority of the wealth in the United States .
They tend to get better education and go to better schools .
And not only do they have all these privileges handed to them , but they additionally get to be mean to white people and nobody ever gives a damn about it !
Except Beth Rankin , who is fighting tirelessly to end racism against white people .
( While you have the cookies out , give her one for having a non-white boyfriend !
Because that ’s so open - minded !
Really , she picked a boyfriend of color when she probably could have gotten a white one . )
She repeats this demand in the comments : “ What are you going to do about it ? ”
Kim addresses this as well :
Now I am sure that right now there are some white people saying that non-white people cannot understand what is going on , that we do not have the critical analysis to figure stuff out , or that we have fucked up ideas .
This is just white supremacist bullshit because it is rooted in the idea that non-white people have not interpreted our experiences and cannot run things ourselves .
It is also highly elitist because it assumes that only those who have adequate access to institutional and educational resources ( whites ) are able to understand reality .
It also assumes that there are not internal conversations within and between our communities — which I do not think white people need to be privy to or participate in — in which non-white people struggle over these contradictions , debate about our own visions for society and how to go about achieving them .
In short , this perspective by whites that non-white people cannot be in control of our own destinies is rooted in a paternally - racist approach to non-white people .
So if you want to call yourself a white anti-racist , start by giving up your privilege .
Of course , this is a trick request .
Because the privilege is n’t even visible to you .
Yet it , and you , are sucking all the air out of the room .
Edited to add : Apparently the “ discussions ” about race in the campus paper are part of a series called “ The Changing Face of Prejudice . ”
Really !

When Sam Houston was still hanging his hat in Tennessee in the 1830s , it was n't uncommon for fellow Tennesseans who were packing up and moving south and west to hang a sign on their cabins that read " GTT " – Gone to Texas .
Today obstetricians , surgeons and other doctors might consider reviving the practice .

It certainly could be the case that Obama personally did n’t hear Wright ’s 2003 sermon when he proclaimed : “ The government gives them the drugs , builds bigger prisons , passes a three - strike law and then wants us to sing ‘ God Bless America . ’
No , no , no , not God bless America , God damn America , that ’s in the Bible for killing innocent people .
...
God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human . ”
But Ronald Kessler , a journalist who has written about Wright ’s ministry , claims that Obama was in fact in the pews at Trinity last July 22 .
That ’s when Wright blamed the “ arrogance ” of the “ United States of White America ” for much of the world ’s suffering , especially the oppression of blacks .
In any case , given the apparent frequency of such statements in Wright ’s preaching and their centrality to his worldview , the pretense that over all these years Obama had no idea that Wright was saying such things is hard to sustain .
This does n’t mean that Obama agrees with Wright ’s thoroughgoing and conspiracy - heavy anti-Americanism .
Rather , Obama seems to have seen , early in his career , the utility of joining a prominent church that would help him establish political roots in the community in which he lives .
Now he sees the utility of distancing himself from that church .
Obama ’s behavior in dealing with Wright is consistent with that of a politician who often voted “ present ” in the Illinois State Legislature for the sake of his future political viability .
The more you learn about him , the more Obama seems to be a conventionally opportunistic politician , impressively smart and disciplined , who has put together a good political career and a terrific presidential campaign .
But there ’s not much audacity of hope there .
There ’s the calculation of ambition , and the construction of artifice , mixed in with a dash of deceit  all covered over with the great conceit that this campaign , and this candidate , are different .
Which brings us back to the “ Generation Obama ” event .
If you go to the Obama campaign Web site and click on “ people , ” you ’ll see 14 categories of people you can choose to hook up with  women , labor , people of faith ... and “ Generation Obama . ”

BROCKTON , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - Shards of broken glass outside the basement window of 31 Vine Street hint at the destruction inside the three - story home .
Marc Charney of Charney Real Estate shows where thieves have removed the copper plumbing from a sink in an empty , foreclosed home in Brockton , Massachusetts , March 25 , 2008 .
Real estate brokers and local authorities say once - proud homes coast - to - coast are being stripped for copper , aluminium , and brass by thieves .
Much of it ends up with scrap metal traders who say nearly all copper gets shipped overseas , much of it to China and India .

Thieves smashed the window to break in and then gutted the property for its copper pipes -- a crime that has spread across the United States as the economy slows and foreclosed homes stand empty and vulnerable .
“ They cut it here and then pulled it right out of the wall , ” real estate broker Marc Charney said , pointing to broken plaster near a wrecked baseboard heating system in the 2,774 - sq - ft home in Brockton , Massachusetts , a working - class city of 94,304 people .
Similar stories are unfolding nationwide as a glut of home foreclosures coincides with record highs in the price of copper and other metals .
Real estate brokers and local authorities say once - proud homes coast - to - coast are being stripped for copper , aluminum , and brass by thieves .
Much of it ends up with scrap metal traders who say nearly all copper gets shipped overseas , much of it to China and India .
In areas hit hardest by foreclosures , such as the Slavic Village neighborhood of Cleveland , Ohio , copper and other metals used in plumbing , heating systems and telephone lines are now more valuable than some homes .
“ We ’re in an incredibly unfortunate time where the nonferrous metals commodities market for scrap is at an all - time high .
Houses are getting stripped pretty quickly once they go through the foreclosure process , ” Cleveland city councilor Tony Brancatelli said .
“ We ’re seeing houses sold for $ 100 that are distressed houses that should not be recycled , ” he said .
Some boarded - up homes in his Slavic Village community have “ No copper , only PVC ” painted on the boards to stop would - be thieves .
In Brockton , which suffered 400 foreclosures last year , blamed largely on predatory lending , and which is bracing for another 400 this year , Charney said the thieves inflicted about $ 15,000 of damage on the home on Vine Street .
“ I had this property under agreement .
We negotiated .
The offer was accepted .
The buyer came back to the property three weeks later only to find they had gotten in and stolen the copper , so we had to go back to the bank and renegotiate , ” said Charney , president of CharneyRealEstate.com .
After haggling , the bank shaved $ 5,000 off the $ 105,000 price .

“ The problem is there ’s almost no security .
Does this look like anybody lives here ? ” he said , gesturing to the boarded - up home with chipped yellow paint and a “ notice of foreclosure ” letter affixed to its door .
“ It ’s like a big billboard saying ‘ come and take me , ’ ” he added .
“ It ’s an epidemic . ”
DEPRESSING HOME PRICES
Jonathan Osman , a broker in Charlotte , North Carolina , said growing numbers of banks are balking at lending to prospective buyers of foreclosed homes that are stripped of copper pipes and other metals , further depressing housing prices .
“ If the appraiser spots something that is not right , like copper tubing lying on the floor or something missing a lot of wiring , that ’s a red flag to the buyer ’s bank .
That will essentially melt down any transaction you ’ve got , ” he said .
“ They do n’t want to make a $ 200,000 loan on a house that has serious problems in case the buyer defaults and they are stuck with it , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ It stinks for the banks that have foreclosed on the property because they now have a house that they really ca n’t sell .
They have nothing to do but auction it off for whatever they can get for it . ”
Along with copper , he often sees air conditioners and garbage disposals torn out .
“ I do n’t know what the solution is other than for the banks to not put a sign in the window saying the house is vacant , ” he said , “ or maybe keep tenants there . ”
At least 15 U.S. states -- from California to New York -- drafted legislation in the past year to deal with the problem , from tighter regulations on scrap metals ’ traders to tougher penalties for metal theft , local authorities and metals industry officials say .
“ In my district , we ’ve got a lot of foreclosed homes and we ’ve got a ton of people who are breaking into these homes , stealing the copper wiring right out of the walls , ” said Andy Meisner , a lawmaker in Michigan ’s state Legislature who plans an April 15 hearing on two bills intended to tackle the issue .
“ It is a problem that is really affecting us throughout the whole state , ” he said .
“ When all the copper is taken out , the house basically becomes a knock - down .
It then has a depressing impact on property values . ”
He said authorities in Hazel Park , a city in his district , ran a clandestine sting operation on a metal trader .
“ They saw a guy literally walking down the street with bundles of wire in each hand .
They saw him walk into a scrap yard and walk out having sold this scrap he had obviously stolen , ” he said .
EXPORTED TO CHINA
Several scrap traders contacted by Reuters said they had measures in place to identify metals stolen from homes .
“ If somebody looks suspicious we do n’t buy the material , ” said Marc Kaplan , one of the largest scrap metals traders in New Jersey .
He said scrap copper sells for about $ 3.50 a pound -- against 70 cents just three years ago .
He and other scrap traders estimate that more than 80 percent of recycled copper is exported to China and India .
Warren Gelman , president of merchant broker Kataman Metals Inc in St Louis , Missouri , said illegal trade is just a small fraction of the scrap metals business .
He notes that the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries , an industry body , sends frequent alerts to all scrap traders on metal thefts in an attempt to stop illegal deals .
“ If local law enforcement has a theft , they report it to us and we then turn around and package it for our members in the region , ” said the institute ’s spokesman , Bruce Savage .
“ This problem has been gathering a certain amount of momentum over the last year as you ’ve seen commodity prices spike up to record highs at the same time you ’ve got an economy that ’s teetering domestically , ” he said .
But real - estate brokers say more needs to be done to stave off further damage to areas hit hard by waves of foreclosures .
“ It ’s happening in too many places throughout the country for people to be saying that they are policing who they are getting it from , ” said Bill Collins , president of the New Jersey chapter of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers .
At first glance Shawbo Ali Rauf appears to be slumbering on the grass , her pale brown curls framing her face , her summer skirt spread about her .

The 19 - year - old Iraqi was , according to her father , murdered by her own in - laws , who took her to a picnic area in Dokan and shot her seven times .
Her crime was to have an unknown number on her mobile phone .
Her " honour killing " is just one in a grotesque series emerging from Iraq , where activists speak of a " genocide " against women in the name of religion .
In the latest such case , it was reported yesterday that a 17 - year - old girl , Rand Abdel - Qader , was stabbed to death last month by her father for becoming infatuated with a British soldier serving in southern Iraq .

In Basra alone , police acknowledge that 15 women a month are murdered for breaching Islamic dress codes .
Campaigners insist it is a conservative figure .
Violence against women is rampant , rising every day with the power of the militias .
Beheadings , rapes , beatings , suicides through self - immolation , genital mutilation , trafficking and child abuse masquerading as marriage of girls as young as nine are all on the increase .
Du'a Khalil Aswad , 17 , from Nineveh , was executed by stoning in front of mob of 2,000 men for falling in love with a boy outside her Yazidi tribe .
Mobile phone images of her broken body transmitted on the internet led to sectarian violence , international outrage and calls for reform .
Her father , Khalil Aswad , speaking one year after her death in April last year , has revealed that none of those responsible had been prosecuted and his family remained " outcasts " in their own tribe .
" My daughter did nothing wrong , " he said .
" She fell in love with a Muslim and there is nothing wrong with that .
I could n't protect her because I got threats from my brother , the whole tribe .
They insisted they were gong to kill us all , not only Du'a , if she was not killed .
She was mutilated , her body dumped like rubbish .
" I want those who committed this act to be punished but so far they have not , they are free .
Honour killing is murder .
This is a barbaric act . "
Despite the outrage , recent calls by the Kurdish MP Narmin Osman to outlaw honour killings have been blocked by fundamentalists .
" Honour killings are not actually a crime in the eyes of the government , " said Houzan Mahmoud , who has had a fatwa on her head since raising a petition against the introduction of sharia law in Kurdistan .
" If before there was one dictator persecuting people , now almost everyone is persecuting women .
" In the past five years it is has got [ much ] worse .
It is difficult to described how terrible it is , how badly we have been pushed back to the dark ages .
Women are being beheaded for taking their veil off .
Self immolation is rising – women are left with no choice .
There is no government body or institution to provide any sort of support .
Sharia law is being used to underpin government rule , denying women their most basic human rights . "
In August last year , the body of 11 - year - old Sara Jaffar Nimat was found in Khanaqin , Kurdistan , after she had been stoned and burnt to death .
Earlier this month , two brothers and a sister were kidnapped from their home near Kirkuk by gunmen in police uniforms .
The brothers were beaten to death and the woman left in a critical condition after being informed that she must obey the rules of an " Islamic state " .
One week ago , a journalist , Begard Huseein , was murdered in her home in Arbil , northern Iraq .
Her husband , Mohammed Mustafa , stabbed her because she was in love with another man , according to local reports .
The stoning death of Ms Aswad led to the establishment of an Internal Ministry unit in Kurdistan to combat violence against women .
It reported that last year in Sulaymaniyah , a city of 1 million people , there were 407 reported offences , beheadings , beatings , deaths through " family problems " , and threats of honour killings .
Rape is not included as most women are too fearful to report it for fear of retribution .
Nevertheless , police in Karbala recently revealed 25 reports of rape .
The new Iraqi constitution , according to Mrs Mahmoud , is a mass of confusing contradictions .
While it states that men and women are equal under law it also decrees that sharia law – which considers one male witness worth two females – must be observed .
The days when women could hold down key jobs or enjoy any freedom of movement are long gone .
The fundamentalists have sent out too many chilling messages .
In Mosul two years ago , eight women were beheaded in a terror campaign .
" It was really , really horrifying , " said Mrs Mahmoud .
" Honour killings and murder are widespread .
Thousands [ of people ] ... have become victims of murder , violence and rape – all backed by laws , tribal customs and religious rules .
We urge the international community , the government to condemn this barbaric practice , and help the women of Iraq . "
Tiger Woods is growing more frustrated with photographers snapping pictures of him during his swing .
In an interview on " ESPN First Take " on Wednesday , Woods addressed an incident at last week 's WGC - CA Championship at Doral , Fla. , when he reacted to the click of a camera in his backswing with an obscenity - laced threat .
Woods ' intense competitive streak is well - known , and he's also been known to curse when his results do n't meet his high expectations .
But on Sunday , in a threat punctuated with profanity , he threatened bodily harm to the next photographer who snaps during his swing .
" It 's been frustrating because that 's what been happening lately , " Woods told " ESPN First Take . "
" It 's one of the things that comes with playing in the last group , one of the distractions we have to deal with . "
Under pressure from the chemical industry , the Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed an outspoken scientist who chaired a federal panel responsible for helping the agency determine the dangers of a flame retardant widely used in electronic equipment .
Toxicologist Deborah Rice was appointed chair of an EPA scientific panel reviewing the chemical a year ago .
Federal records show she was removed from the panel in August after the American Chemistry Council , the lobbying group for chemical manufacturers , complained to a top - ranking EPA official that she was biased .
The chemical , a brominated compound known as deca , is used in high volumes worldwide , largely in the plastic housings of television sets .
Rice , an award - winning former EPA scientist who now works at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services , has studied low doses of deca and reported neurological effects in lab animals .
Last February , around the time the EPA panel was convened , Rice testified before the Maine Legislature in support of a state ban on the compound because scientific evidence shows it is toxic and accumulating in the environment and people .
Chemical industry lobbyists say Rice ’s comments to the Legislature , as well as similar comments to the media , show that she is a biased advocate who has compromised the integrity of the EPA ’s review of the flame retardant .
The EPA is in the process of deciding how much daily exposure to deca is safe -- a controversial decision , expected next month , that could determine whether it can still be used in consumer products .
The role of the expert panel was to review and comment on the scientific evidence .
EPA officials removed Rice because of what they called “ the perception of a potential conflict of interest . ”
Under the agency ’s handbook for advisory committees , scientific peer reviewers should not “ have a conflict of interest ” or “ appear to lack impartiality . ”
EPA officials were not available for comment Thursday .
Environmentalists accuse the EPA of a “ dangerous double standard , ” because under the Bush administration , many pro-industry experts have served on the agency ’s scientific panels .
The Environmental Working Group , a Washington , D.C. - based advocacy group , reviewed seven EPA panels created last year and found 17 panelists who were employed or funded by the chemical industry or had made public statements that the chemicals they were reviewing were safe .
In one example , an Exxon Mobil Corp. employee served on an EPA expert panel responsible for deciding whether ethylene oxide , a chemical manufactured by Exxon Mobil , is a carcinogen .
Sonya Lunder , a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group , called it “ deeply problematic from the public interest perspective ” for the EPA to dismiss scientists who advocate protecting health while appointing those who promote industry views .
Lunder said it is unprecedented for the EPA to remove an expert for expressing concerns about the potential dangers of a chemical .
“ It ’s a scary world if we create a precedent that says scientists involved in decision - making are perceived to be too biased , ” she said .
Rice was unavailable for comment Thursday .
In addition to her testimony for the Maine Legislature , Rice has been quoted in media reports saying there is enough scientific evidence to warrant bans on deca .
“ We do n’t need to wait another five years or even another two years and let it increase in the environment , while we nail down every possible question we have , ” she told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer last March .
In a May letter to an assistant administrator at the EPA , Sharon Kneiss , a vice president of the American Chemistry Council , called Rice “ a fervent advocate of banning ” deca and said she “ has no place in an independent , objective peer review . ”
She told the EPA that Rice ’s role on the panel “ calls into question the overall integrity ” of the EPA ’s evaluation of chemicals and that Rice may have influenced the other panelists in their review of deca .
Top EPA officials met with the industry group ’s representatives in June and promised to take action , according to a letter that EPA Asst.
Administrator George Gray sent to the group last month .
In that letter , Gray said the EPA found “ no evidence ” that Rice “ significantly influenced the other panelists . ”
Environmentalists are concerned that Rice ’s removal could result in a less protective standard .
After EPA officials dismissed her from the five - member panel , they removed her comments from the panel ’s report on deca and removed all mention of her .
Three months later , at the request of the chemical industry group , the EPA added a note to the panel report that Rice was removed “ due to a perception of a potential conflict of interest ” and that none of her comments were considered in their review of the chemical .
EPA documents show that Rice ’s comments while serving on the panel focused on technical , scientific issues .
For example , she advised the EPA to consider the cumulative effects of not just deca , but chemicals with similar neurological effects .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) , chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said he was disturbed by Rice ’s dismissal and the Environmental Working Group ’s findings about pro-industry panelists .
“ If this information is accurate , it raises serious questions about EPA ’s approach to preventing conflicts of interest on its expert scientific panels , ” Waxman said .
The conflict of interest policies of another environmental institute , the National Toxicology Program , also has come under fire .
Last March , a major consultant for a federal center that evaluates reproductive hazards of chemicals was fired after The Los Angeles Times reported that the firm had financial ties to 50 chemical companies or associations .
Rice specializes in neurotoxins -- chemicals that harm developing brains .
Before she went to work for the state of Maine , she was a senior toxicologist at the EPA ’s National Center for Environmental Research , where she had a major role in setting the EPA ’s controversial guideline for exposure to mercury in fish .
In 2004 , the EPA gave Rice and four colleagues an award for what it called “ exceptionally high - quality research ” for a study that linked lead exposure to premature puberty in girls .
Many toxicologists and other environmental scientists have said they are highly concerned about flame retardants known as PBDEs , polybrominated diphenyl ethers .
In laboratory tests , PBDEs have been found to skew brain development and alter thyroid hormones , slowing the learning and motor skills of newborn animals .
Two of the compounds , called penta and octa , were banned in 2004 .
Before the ban , amounts in human breast milk and wildlife were doubling in North America every four to six years , a pace unmatched for any contaminant in at least 50 years .
Now they are decreasing .
Scientists had initially thought that the deca compound was not accumulating in people and animals as the other PBDEs were .
But it appears that deca turns into other brominated substances when exposed to sunlight , and now many scientists say it , too , is building up in the environment worldwide .
Deca has similar effects on animals ’ developing brains as the banned PBDEs .
The chemical industry contends that low doses pose no danger and that the compound is necessary to prevent fires in many consumer products .
In addition to TVs and other electronics , deca is used in furniture textiles , building materials and automobiles .
About 56,000 tons were used worldwide in 2001 , mostly in the United States and Asia .
Only Maine and Washington state restrict use of deca ; both passed laws last year that phase out some uses .
Similar bills have been introduced in California but have not passed .

The following is excerpted from Grand Theft Childhood , by Drs. Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl K. Olson , co-directors of the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media .
They weigh in on a longstanding debate : the relationship between video games and teen violence .
The book , published this month , is timely : Grand Theft Auto IV , the latest installment of the mega - selling and much - criticized series , goes on sale at midnight .
Thirteen - year - old Darren and a half dozen of his video game - playing friends are sitting around a table at the Boys and Girls Club in a working - class section of Boston .
We 're talking about the games , especially the violent ones .
They 've all played them .
Darren had a tough time in school earlier this week .
On Monday , a teacher said something that embarrassed him in front of his classmates .
When he went home that afternoon , he plugged in his video game console , loaded Grand Theft Auto III , blew up a few cars and shot a half - dozen people , including a young blond woman .
When asked , Darren admits that the woman he killed in the game looked a lot like his teacher .
If you listen to the politicians and the pundits , the relationship is blindingly clear : playing violent video games leads children to engage in real - world violence or , at the very least , to become more aggressive .
In August 2005 , the American Psychological Association issued a resolution on violence in video games and interactive media , stating that " perpetrators go unpunished in 73 per cent of all violent scenes , and therefore teach that violence is an effective means of resolving conflict . "
The attorney for Lee Malvo , the young " DC Sniper , " claimed that the teen had taught himself to kill by playing Halo on his Xbox game console .
" He 's trained and desensitized with video games ... to shoot human forms over and over . "
Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were avid computer gamers .
According to psychologists Craig Anderson and Karen Dill , " One possible contributing factor ( to the incident ) is violent video games .
Harris and Klebold enjoyed playing the bloody shoot - 'em - up video game Doom , a game licensed by the U.S. Army to train soldiers to effectively kill . "
We hear that youth violence , as reflected in violent crime and school shootings , is a growing problem , and that young game players are socially isolated and unable to form interpersonal relationships .
The growth in violent video game sales is linked to the growth in youth violence – especially school violence – throughout the country .
School shooters fit a profile that includes a fascination with violent media , especially violent video games .
A British study by Save the Children was described in the press as finding that " children are struggling to make friends at school because they spend too long playing computer games . "
A spokesperson for that organization added , " Children have always played alone , for example with dolls or train sets , but these activities required a certain level of imagination – they stimulated their brains .
That is not the case with modern computer games , which do children 's thinking for them and put them in their own little world . "
All of these statements are wrong .
In fact , much of the information in the popular press about the effects of violent video games is wrong .
The real puzzle is that anyone looking at the research evidence in this field could draw any conclusions about the pattern , let alone argue with such confidence and even passion that it demonstrates the harm of violence on television , in film and in video games .
The allegation that " perpetrators go unpunished in 73 per cent of all violent scenes " is based on research from the mid-1990s that looked at selected television programs , not video games .
The video game Halo involves shooting an unrealistic gun at a giant alien bug .
It is not an effective way to train as a real sniper .
In court , Lee Malvo admitted that he trained by shooting a real gun at paper plates that represented human heads .
Also , Malvo had a long history of anti-social and criminal behaviour , including torturing small animals – one of the best predictors of future violent criminal behaviour .
It 's unlikely that Harris and Klebold 's interest in violent video games or other violent media played any significant role in their actions .
An FBI investigation concluded that Klebold was significantly depressed and suicidal , and Harris was a sociopath .
Video game popularity and real - world youth violence have been moving in opposite directions .
Violent juvenile crime in the United States reached a peak in 1993 and has been declining ever since .
School violence has also gone down .
The U.S. Secret Service intensely studied each of the 37 non-gang and non-drug - related school shootings and stabbings that were considered " targeted attacks " that took place nationally from 1974 through 2000 .
The Secret Service found that there was no accurate profile .
Only one in eight school shooters showed any interest in violent video games ; only one in four liked violent movies .

On the other hand , reports of bullying are up .
Our research found that certain patterns of video game play were much more likely to be associated with these types of behavioural problems than with major violent crime such as school shootings .
For many children and adolescents , playing video games is an intensely social activity , not an isolating one .
Many games involve multi-person play , with the players either in the same room or connected electronically .
They often require that players communicate so that they can co-ordinate their efforts .
Our research found that playing violent video games was associated with playing with friends .
For younger children especially , games are a topic of conversation that allows them to build relationships with peers .
Although it came from a reputable organization , the widely cited British study claiming that increased use of electronic media has led to social isolation among children based its findings on the personal opinions of an unspecified group of primary school teachers who were asked to compare today 's children ( ages 5 to 11 ) to what they remembered about children who were in their classrooms when they started teaching , not on scientific observations of children conducted over time .
As Darren tells his story about feeling angry , then playing the violent video game in which he blew up cars and shot several people , including one who looked a lot like his teacher , the other kids sitting around the table nod their heads .
It 's clear that at one time or another , they have each done something similar .
" I guess I got my anger out , " Darren says .
" Then I sat down and did my homework . "

The answer was no longer a simple matter of faith .
As Stephens notes , all of this turmoil coincided with a time of intense questioning by theologians who were schooled in Scholasticism , the dominant philosophical doctrine of the time in Europe .
They struggled to reconcile the literal text of Scriptures with what they understood of physical reality by reading from Aristotle and other protoscientific texts .
Prior to around 1200 , most Christians held what Stephens calls the " uncomplicated belief in the reality of devils , angels , and the whole world of spirit . "
All of that was in the Bible , they were told , so they simply believed .
Two hundred years later , belief was no longer so uncomplicated .
Scholastic theologians pored over the Bible and asked , Why are there no more miracles ?
How was the Flood possible ?
That is , how could it really have happened ?
For example , what did God do with all of the water afterward ?
How did Noah get enough feed for the animals on the Ark ?
These questions may remind a modern reader of the insistent queries from children in Sunday school , but in the 15th century , some of Europe 's best - educated minds were wrestling with them .
Says Stephens , " There 's this increasing rationalism among theologians .
The Bible needs to be explained on a literal level , not as allegory , when stacked up against what they know of the world . "
Among the many things accomplished by the book is a vivid rendering of the witch hunts ' context .
The earliest documentary evidence of an actual European witch trial ( not trials for heresy or sorcery , which did not necessarily involve corporeal interaction with demons ) is circa 1430 .
The sanctioned , organized pursuit and persecution of witches , which peaked from 1560 to 1630 and was almost entirely a western European phenomenon , began during a time of grave concern in the Roman Catholic church .
The European world in the early 1400s was a wreck .
The preceding century has been labeled by historian Barbara Tuchman as " calamitous , " and she does not overstate .
Starting around 1315 , a great famine ravaged much of western Europe .
From 1347 to 1352 , the Black Death killed more than a third of the continent 's population .
Other diseases and additional outbreaks of the plague scourged the weakened survivors .
As if natural catastrophe were n't enough , England and France chose to fight the Hundred Years '
War from 1337 to 1453 , the longest war in history .
The Church itself fractured , riven by massive organized heresies , and by a schism that led to as many as three men simultaneously laying claim to be the true pope .
How could a world created by a watchful , benevolent , and engaged God be such a mess ?
On the desk of his Gilman Hall office , next to a Macintosh computer that announces the arrival of new e-mail seemingly every 10 minutes , Stephens has a paper witch .
It 's a Halloween decoration , so she 's decked out in a long black witch 's dress , with her traffic - cone hat and magic broom .
Stephens can look devilish himself , favoring black jeans , a distressed leather jacket , and a black fedora .
He has just published his new theory in the alluringly titled Demon Lovers : Witchcraft , Sex , and the Crisis of Belief ( University of Chicago Press , 2002 ) .
It 's a dense but engaging volume , praised by Umberto Eco as " a work of high and fascinating scholarship on a story which has frequently inspired only legends and occultism . "
Stephens ' thesis profoundly revises the conventional wisdom about centuries of cruelty and injustice .
The great European witch hunts , he says , were the outgrowth of a severe crisis of faith .
The men who wrote books like the Malleus , men who endorsed the torture and burning of tens of thousands of innocent people , desperately needed to believe in witches , because if witches were real , then demons were real , and if demons were real , then God was real .
Not just real but present and attentive .
Carefully read the works composed by the witchcraft authors , Stephens says , and you will see how profoundly disturbed these educated , literate men were by their accumulating suspicions that if God existed at all , He was n't paying much attention to the descendants of Adam .
For the next eight years Stephens read every treatise he could find on witchcraft , as well as accounts of interrogations , theological tracts , and other works ( his bibliography lists 154 primary and more than 200 secondary sources ) .
Most of the 86 witchcraft treatises he cites had been written in western Europe in the 15th , 16th , and 17th centuries , and one after another ( including the Malleus ) contain accounts of sexual intercourse with satanic spirits .
Why ?
Were the authors remorseless misogynists hellbent on portraying women in the worst possible light ?
Were they lurid , repressed celibates who got off by writing accounts of demon sex ?
Stephens did n't think so ; the texts , in his view , did n't support that reading .
Elsewhere in the Malleus he had found a key reference to accused witches under torture as being " expert witnesses to the reality of carnal interaction between humans and demons . "
These guys are trying to construct proofs that demons exist , he thought .
They 're trying to convince skeptics .
And then he thought , They 're trying to convince themselves .
Stephens , the Charles S. Singleton Professor of Italian Studies in the Hopkins department of romance languages , is a literary critic , and he sensed that something intriguing was going on beneath the text on the page .
Tasso , and especially the Malleus ' author , a Dominican theologian and inquisitor named Heinrich Kramer , had in their works invested a striking amount of energy in refuting doubt about the existence of demons .
What was that about ?
That convoluted sentence dovetailed with a curious line Stephens knew from Il messaggiero , a work from 1582 by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso : " If magicians and witches and the possessed exist , demons exist ; but it cannot be doubted that in every age specimens of the former three have been found : thus it is unreasonable to doubt that demons are found in nature . "
" It was 11 at night , " Stephens recalls .
" My wife had gone to bed , and on the first page [ of the Malleus ] was this weird sentence about people who do n't believe in witches and do n't believe in demons :
' Therefore those err who say that there is no such thing as witchcraft , but that it is purely imaginary , even although they do not believe that devils exist except in the imagination of the ignorant and vulgar , and the natural accidents which happen to man he wrongly attributes to some supposed devil . ' "
But by the 15th century , troubled theologians seeking proof of the existence of spirits had become attentive to stories of witches .
The poor illiterate , ignorant peasants still simply wanted an explanation for why their wheat had fungus or their new baby , seemingly healthy , had died the night before .
The learned theologians , says Stephens , had something else in mind .
The confessions of accused witches were useful if taken as the expert testimony of people who knew demons existed because they had n't just seen them , or heard them -- they 'd had sex with them .
Intercourse with one of Satan 's own met even Aristotle 's tough standard for experiential evidence , or so the theorists wanted to believe .
" Sex with demons was so important because it was the most intimate form of physical contact imaginable , " says Stephens .
" You can't have sex with something imaginary . "
" Sex with demons was so important because it was the most intimate form of physical contact imaginable .
You can't have sex with something imaginary . "
For decades , physicists have accepted the notion that the universe started with the Big Bang , an explosive event at the literal beginning of time .
Now , computational physicist Neil Turok is challenging that model – and some scientists are taking him seriously .
According to Turok , who teaches at Cambridge University , the Big Bang represents just one stage in an infinitely repeated cycle of universal expansion and contraction .
Turok theorizes that neither time nor the universe has a beginning or end .
It 's a strange idea , though Turok would say it's no stranger than the standard explanation of the Big Bang : a singular point that defies our laws of physics , where all equations go to infinity and " all the properties we normally use to describe the universe and its contents just fail . "
That inconsistency led Turok to see if the Big Bang could be explained within the framework of string theory , a controversial and so - far untested explanation of the universe as existing in at least 10 dimensions and being formed from one - dimensional building blocks called strings .
Within a school of string theory known as m-theory , Turok said , " the seventh extra dimension of space is the gap between two parallel objects called branes .
It 's like the gap between two parallel mirrors .
We thought ,
What happens if these two mirrors collide ?
Maybe that was the Big Bang . "
Turok 's proposition has drawn condemnation from string theory 's many critics and even opposition from the Catholic Church .
But it 's provoked acclaim and wonder , too : He and Princeton University physicist Paul Steinhardt published Endless Universe : Beyond the Big Bang last year , and Turok – also the founder of the South Africa - based African Institute for Mathematical Sciences – won 2008 's first annual TED Prize , awarded to the world 's most innovative thinkers .
Turok spoke with Wired.com about the Big Bang , the intellectual benefits of cosmology and his bet with Stephen Hawking .
Wired :
In a nutshell , what are you proposing ?
__Neil Turok : __In our picture , there was a universe before the Big Bang , very much like our universe today : a low density of matter and some stuff called dark energy .
If you postulate a universe like this , but the dark energy within is actually unstable , then the decay of this dark energy drives the two branes together .
These two branes clash and then , having filled with radiation , separate and expand to form galaxies and stars .
Then the dark energy takes over again .
It 's the energy of attraction between the two branes :
It pulls them back together .
You have bang followed by bang followed by bang .
You have no beginning of time .
It 's always been there .
__Wired : __But is n't there still a beginning ?
__Turok : __Imagine you have a room full of air , with all these molecules banging around .
The vast majority of time , these molecules spread uniformly – but once in a trillion trillion years , they all end up in the corner of the room .
If you look at the room and run the clock forward , they 'll eventually make themselves uniform :
But it would reverse , and you 'd watch them flying into the corner .
Then they 'd fly out again .
If this is right , it means that time runs forward for a while .
Then there 's a random state without an arrow of time , then time runs backwards , and then time runs forward again .
That 's the bigger picture :
We 're still very far away from understanding it , but that would be my bet .
But my main interest is the problem of the singularity .
If we can't understand what happened at the singularity we came out of , then we do n't seem to have any understanding of the laws of particle physics .
I 'd be very happy just to understand the last singularity and leave the other ones to future generations .
__Wired : __How do you test this theory ?
__Turok :
__If the universe sprung into existence and then expanded exponentially , you get gravitational waves traveling through space - time .
These would fill the universe , a pattern of echoes of the inflation itself .
In our model , the collision of these two branes does n't make waves at all .
So if we could measure the waves , we could see which theory is right .
Stephen Hawking bet me that we 'll see the signal from inflation .
I said that we wo n't , and he can take it for any amount of money at even odds .
So far he has n't named an amount .
He 's richer than me , so he 's being nice .
__Wired : __You 've said the standard explanation of the Big Bang is Rube Goldberg - ian , but this seems like quite the convoluted contraption , too .
__Turok : __The structure of the sandwich was forced on theorists by mathematicians :
It 's basically the only way you can make the equations consistent and avoid infinity .
The extent to which we believe it derives from the mathematics .
We 're not smoking something and making it up .
However , I feel that the main role for these scenarios of the early universe is to stimulate our thinking .
I do n't necessarily believe any of them .
The most important thing is that the only intellectually honest way to study such questions of cosmology is to make the most precise model you can .
I think of the whole thing as a giant intellectual exercise , a stimulating exercise , to make us better appreciate the universe .
__Wired : __It 's stirred a lot of emotion for an intellectual .
When Alan Guth criticized you and your theory at a conference , he showed a picture of a monkey .
Is this sort of vitriol normal ?
__Turok : __The monkey was maybe a bit exaggerated .
But I 'm actually good friends with Guth , and I 'm sure he did it as a joke .
I meet him regularly at conferences , and he 's a reasonable guy .
The field is driven by reason .
The inevitably human things that come into it do n't matter in the long run .
In the end , bad ideas will not survive .
If you have a good , clean idea that 's elegant and precise and agrees with observations , it 'll get through .
__Wired : __The Catholic Church has n't been very receptive to your ideas , either .
__Turok : __I think they like the Big Bang for obvious reasons .
It 's a creation event , and they find that appealing .
Whereas if you talk to most physicists , they 'd prefer that there was not a creation event , because there are no laws of physics that indicate how time could begin .
I 'm not motivated by [ theological considerations ] .
I 'd be perfectly happy with a mathematically precise description of how time began .
I see science and religion as being two completely different things .
I do n't see science as relevant to the question of whether or not there 's a God .
If the world is cyclical , in a sense you still need a policeman to enforce the laws of physics .
If you need a God to do that , fine – but I think that 's a belief in why the world is the way it is .
Science studies how the world operates , not why it 's here .
__Wired : __To many people , science is valuable because of the metaphors it gives us – a poetry of the natural world .
Does your work resonate that way with you ?
__Turok :
__We need poetry as well as science , but it 's completely irrelevant to the science .
That does n't motivate me either .
I just feel incredibly lucky and honored to think about these problems and try to make models that may or may not be relevant .
It 's a fantastic privilege to ponder these questions – even if we do n't succeed , even if all we do is appreciate how hard the problem is , it brings us together .
The world is an incredible miracle , and we have to do whatever we can to appreciate it .
__Wired : __Whatever you find , though , it 's not going to have much everyday importance .
__Turok : __No , but one of the extraordinary things about the field is that whatever culture people come from , they all love this stuff .
The popularity Hawking has achieved is due in part to him being an exceptional individual , but it's also because the questions and the science are inherently fascinating .
It 's been amazing to see students from all over Africa , from countries that have been disaster areas for 30 years , come to the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and try to best Einstein .
The side effects are quite good , too .
I teach math to hundreds of students every year , and because the stuff we work on is high - powered and rigorous , we add to the intellectual environment .
Many of the brightest students love to do this .
It 's like the Apollo moon program , which had a huge spinoff in technology .
So even though this kind of science and thinking has no intrinsic economic value , it 's hugely motivating and quite cheap .
__Wired : __With all your work with students from Africa , what do you think of James Watson 's remarks on Africans evolving to possess less intelligence than other racial groups ?
__Turok : __I think he 's nuts .
My students are highly motivated and have a very high success rate .
If he really believes they 're inferior , he should just come to the institute .
I guarantee that if he spends an afternoon with these students , he 'll revise his opinion .
“ They come in and shut us down periodically because they think we are too American , ” said Mr. Emami , owner of the ice cream shop .
That is why , Western diplomats in Iran said , the best thing Washington could do to encourage more moderate behavior in Tehran would be to ease off .
Less pressure would make it harder for Iran ’s leaders to keep out Western influences .
“ Take the foot off the gas , ” said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize the Iranians .
Another obstacle to repairing relations involves the deep internal divisions between Iranians .
Those appeared the day after the revolution , when the factions that united to take down the shah could not agree on how to run the country .
The Islamists won , and to this day have marginalized those who sought a softer approach .
“ Even the ruling elite recognize that there are good things we can get from opening to America , ” said a political analyst in Tehran who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution .
But , the analyst said , “ We know we have to reconcile internally first . ”
The headlines here still focus on conflict : the West ’s demands that Iran halt enrichment of nuclear fuel and Tehran ’s refusal .
Yet the hunger for all things Western is once again breaking through on the streets .
The signs tend to be most visible in the north of the city , which has always been wealthier and more oriented toward the West , with sound - alike shops : Starcups and Kabooky Fried Chicken .
“ Everyone here is thirsting for American brands , it ’s that simple , ” said Mehdi Mortazavi , who is helping create Friday ’s , a restaurant in Tehran .
The sign out front looks just like a T.G.I. Friday ’s in the States , with red and white stripes .
But the “ T.G.I.F. ” was dropped because Thursday is the last day of the work week here , and the reference to “ God ” might not have gone over well .
But there will be waiters with suspenders decorated with buttons , Cobb Salad and hamburgers on the menu .
MOSCOW ( AP ) — DNA tests carried out by a U.S. laboratory prove that bone fragments exhumed last year belong to two children of Czar Nicholas II , putting to rest questions about what happened to Russia 's last royal family , a regional governor said Wednesday .
Bone fragments dug up near the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg are indeed those of Crown Prince Alexei and his sister , Maria , whose remains had been missing since the family was murdered in 1918 as Russia descended into civil war , said Eduard Rossel , governor of the Sverdlovsk region .
" We have now found the entire family , '' he told reporters in Yekaterinburg , 900 miles east of Moscow .
The confirmation could bring the tortured history of the Russian imperial family closer to closure and end royal supporters ' persistent hopes that members of the czar 's immediate family survived the massacre .
Nicholas II abdicated in 1917 as revolutionary fervor swept Russia , and he and his family were detained .
The czar ; his wife , Alexandra , and their son and four daughters were fatally shot on July 17 , 1918 , in a basement room of the merchant 's house where they were being held in Yekaterinburg
The remains of Nicholas , Alexandra and three of their daughters were unearthed in Yekaterinburg in 1991 as the Soviet Union was collapsing .
After genetic tests convinced forensics experts of their authenticity , they were buried in 1998 in a cathedral in the imperial capital of St. Petersburg .
The Russian Orthodox Church canonized Nicholas and his family in 2000 , even as it expressed doubts that the remains were indeed those of the czar 's family .
The remains of Alexei and Maria , however , had never been located , leading to decades of speculation that perhaps one or both had survived .
Last summer , researchers dug up the bone shards near Yekaterinburg and enlisted Russian and U.S. laboratories to conduct DNA tests .
" The main genetic laboratory in the United States has concluded its work with a full confirmation of our own laboratories ' work , '' Rossel told reporters .
" This has confirmed that indeed it is the children .
It was unclear which laboratory Rossel was referring to but a genetic research team working at the University of Massachusetts Medical School has been involved in the process .
The press service for Russian Orthodox Church said no one could comment on the discovery .

A man accidentally shot himself in the stomach after waving his gun in anger at a fellow driver in Tempe , and police said Monday he will face charges .
David Lopez , 33 , is expected to survive and could face charges including disorderly conduct , reckless display of a firearm and felony flight from police in the Friday night incident , Tempe police spokesman Brandon Banks said .
Banks said soon after Lopez shot himself , he tried to evade police by driving into a nearby neighborhood , but he crashed his car into a canal embankment .
Lopez then ran on foot , but police soon caught up with him .
Banks said it 's unclear what sparked the incident and that Lopez has been evasive in police interviews .
The other driver , David Billy Jones , 33 , was uninjured but also fled the scene .
He was soon after arrested on a charge of misdemeanor drunken driving .
Banks said if drivers find themselves in a road - rage incident , they should always back off .
� Just back off , slow down and let that person go where they need to go , � he said .
� And if you are the person that finds yourself becoming so enraged that you 're going to actually draw your weapon , � he added , � you need to have some kind of system or check and balances in your head that prevents you from doing exactly like this guy did � pull a gun and actually shoot himself . �
Some drivers , he said , may even benefit from anger - management classes .

Right or more often the case wrong , athletes have been taking anabolic steroids since the early 1960’s .
Many competitive bodybuilders go to excess in taking steroids in order to compete citing that ‘ extreme sports require extreme measures , ’ using a plethora of various forms for different effects — one might increase muscle hardness while another will improve mass , strength or endurance — thus becoming human walking chemistry sets .
Synthetic anabolic steroids are potent medications designed to mimic the function of testosterone which can even perform better at promoting muscle growth than equivalent levels of testosterone .
Often coined as being juiced or juiced up amongst those who use the drugs , some say “ steroids are as American as Apple Pie . ”
Hazards of Steroids for Men and Women
While it ’s not as common to suffer critical or life - threatening effects , steroids are far from safe , causing potentially harmful side - effects with some being irreversible .
Both genders can experience increased acne on the face , chest and back .
Depending on the drug , anabolic steroids can cause a person ’s behavior can change with increased aggression and irritability .
Some of this aggression has caused people to commit armed robbery , use force to obtain something , and physical fighting .
This would not happen to a naturally calm person but someone who is naturally aggressive would become more aggressive by taking steroids .
Body Builder
Anabolic steroids have also been known to cause behavioral effects including euphoria , increased energy , sexual arousal , mood swings , distractibility , forgetfulness , and confusion .
Bad side - effects on blood pressure and the cardiovascular system can cause heart attacks , enlargement of the heart ’s left ventricle and people younger than 30 to develop Cardiovascular disease .
Blood chemistry can change causing blood clots in the blood vessels and potentially disrupt the blood flow , damaging the heart muscle so it does n’t pump blood effectively .
Heart disease can develop because it affects the cholesterol levels — over a period of time the cholesterol builds up and clogs the arteries .
Steroids affect the heart only if you have a heart disease to begin with , so it ’s very wise to stay away from them if you have a heart problem .
Anabolic steroids are especially dangerous for teenagers , interfering with the normal effect of hormones on a growing body , and premature development of the epiphysis — the end of the bone — resulting in stunted growth .

Steroids can be taken orally , by injection , with gels , patches and nasal sprays .
For the squeamish afraid of needles , it ’s not possible to get a doctor to inject you since steroids are illegal , so some resort to the oral method which has the greatest number of side effects .
They have to pass through the digestive system and the liver in order to get into the bloodstream , so they ’re designed to survive the process , and require large amounts to ensure that there ’s enough left afterwards to have an effect .
The liver ’s job is to remove such substances from the body which puts a great deal of strain on the liver and can result in significant liver damage and tumors which in turn can cause internal bleeding .
Some oral steroids can cause stomach distention — the lower abdomen becomes irritated and swollen , you can experience chronic constipation , water retention , and intestinal gas — the latter of which is not pretty if you want to keep your friends .

Taken in high doses , steroids can also develop jaundice , peliosis hepatitis , and cancer .
Injected steroids are put directly into the blood stream , making them far easier on your liver , but there is much concern over safe injection practices .
Depression is further aggravated if and when steroid use stops with rebound causing extreme depression , fatigue , apathy , and the likes .

Steroid Hazards for Men
Men can experience a short - term increase in the sex drive , followed by a suppression of natural testosterone output and potential shrinkage of the testes .
They can lower sperm count thus making men infertile , as well as develop gynecomastia — deposits of estrogen in the area of the nipple which can also grow breasts .
Steroid Hazards for Women
A very dangerous irreversible side - effect for women is masculinization due to the effects of testosterone and androsterone , including deepening of the voice , menstrual irregularities , development of facial and back hair , clitoral enlargement and even male - pattern baldness .

As one man reported to BodyBuilding of his former 3 - year relationship with a woman who used steroids , “ After my girlfriend made her decision to juice it up , with me as an up - close personal witness to all of her transformations during this time , it changed my mind about women on the juice forever .
I saw her go from a hot hard body to a bloated , mental mess . ” says Josh .
“ My girlfriends ’ skin became course and dry ; a lot of her hair fell out while it grew on her face , her chest , and down her butt ; her voice dropped three octaves ; her nose grew ; her jaw widened ; she got spaces between her teeth ; she got acne all over her chest , across her shoulders , and down her back , and she stopped having her period . ”
Rampant hair growth is an irreversible side - effect , sprouting up on the chin , chest , around the nipples , and the buttocks — particularly the lower inner glutes and around the anus .

“ The first thing you ’ll notice if you take up with a juiced chick is her heightened level of aggression .
When a woman ’s aggression is initiated by testosterone , the result can sometimes get ugly . ”
In another irreversible side effect of clitoral enlargement from androgen use , he saw his girlfriend ’s grow to be 2 inches long and as big around as his small finger .
When a woman in this condition becomes aroused , her clitoris becomes erect and sticks out just like a man ’s penis , complete with a little head and all .
While the condition is n’t harmful , many women get vaginal discharge , but it will cease once the drugs are stopped .
Another bothersome yet temporary condition for the juiced up woman is the increase of body odor .
Josh recalls lying in bed nestled in each other ’s arms after some particularly torrid sex that made him wonder if he was sharing the bed with an entire soccer team after a world championship .

The Wrap - up on Steroids
Unlike training for other sports , the goal in bodybuilding is to achieve a certain appearance .
For competitive bodybuilders , strength itself is not as important as size , symmetry and definition .
Steroids do give the advantage over other athletes as it helps to train with a higher intensity and for longer periods , and can speed up recovery time for the stress on the muscles .
A popular way to take steroids is by cycling , starting the dosage at very small amounts and increasing the dosage weekly , then decreasing it over a 6 to12 week period .
Bodybuilders then train without the drugs for 4 weeks and repeat the cycle all over again .
Perhaps the worst mistake most steroid users make is to become steroid abusers .
It ’s very common to overuse steroids which results in a wide range of health problems , some of which you will be living with for life .
It ’s critical when considering taking steroids to do as much research as possible .

Saying that you do n't believe in evolution is almost saying , for us , well , " We do n't believe that the Civil War ever took place in the United States . "
NARRATOR : Dover is split between those who accept Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution and those who reject it .
And that rift between science and scripture nearly destroyed the community .
Signs of trouble first appeared after a Dover High School student painted a mural showing the evolution of humans from ape - like ancestors .
BERTHA SPAHR ( Dover Science Teacher ) :
It was a lovely piece of artwork , very well done artistically , and it did not offend me in any way .
NARRATOR : But some in Dover were offended by the idea that humans and apes are related , and that mural was removed from the classroom and destroyed .
Flames soon spread to the local school board .
Angry that only Darwin 's theory of evolution was being taught , the board required students hear about a controversial idea , at odds with Darwin , called " intelligent design . "
BILL BUCKINGHAM ( Dover School Board Member ) :
To just talk about Darwin to the exclusion of anything else perpetrates a fraud .
NARRATOR : But many say intelligent design is the fraud .
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Brown University ) : Intelligent design is a science stopper .
KEVIN PADIAN ( University of California , Berkeley ) :
It makes people stupid .
NARRATOR : Eleven Dover residents sued their school board to keep intelligent design out of the classroom .
And almost overnight , Dover was catapulted to the front pages of the nation 's newspapers and the front lines in the war on evolution .
EUGENIE C. SCOTT ( National Center for Science Education ) :
Trials tear communities apart .
They set neighbor against neighbor .
Nobody wants to do this ; you do it when you have to .
NARRATOR : With Dover split down the middle , a federal court would decide if intelligent design is legitimate science or religion in disguise .
And the verdict would have consequences that reach far beyond the classrooms of Dover .
BARBARA FORREST ( Southeastern Louisiana University ) :
It 's about religion , politics and power .
NARRATOR : Up next on NOVA : Judgment Day : Intelligent Design on Trial .
Major funding for NOVA is provided by the following :
For each of us , there is a moment of discovery .
We understand that all of life is elemental , and as we marvel at element bonding with element , we soon realize that when you add the human element to the equation , everything changes .
Suddenly , all of chemistry illuminates humanity , and all of humanity illuminates chemistry .
The human element : nothing is more fundamental , nothing more elemental .

NARRATOR : In October , 2004 , a war broke out in the small town of Dover , Pennsylvania .
PETER JENNINGS ( ABC NEWSCAST ) :
Today , the teachers in a rural Pennsylvania town became the first in the country required to tell students that evolution is not the only theory .
NARRATOR : It started when the Dover Area School Board passed a policy requiring that its high school science classes include a controversial subject called intelligent design .
Proponents of intelligent design claim that many features of living organisms are too complex to have evolved entirely through the natural process of evolution , as Charles Darwin proposed .
Instead , they claim , some aspects of those organisms must have been created , fully - formed , by a so - called " intelligent designer . "
And advocates contend intelligent design is a bold , new scientific theory , with the power to overthrow the theory of evolution .
ROBERT MUISE ( Thomas More Law Center ) :
It 's scientists debating science based on the evidence–not any religious text or authority –and it 's clearly properly the subject of a science class .
STEVE FULLER ( University of Warwick ) :
It 's , in fact , opening the path of inquiry to new ways of thinking about things .
PHILLIP JOHNSON ( University of California , Berkeley School of Law ) :
If evolution by natural selection is a scientific doctrine , then a critique of that doctrine is a legitimate part of science as well .
NARRATOR : The Dover school board demanded that science teachers read their students a one minute statement claiming that gaps in the theory of evolution exist , and putting forward intelligent design as an alternative .
The statement also directed students to an intelligent design textbook called Of Pandas and People that would be made available .
But many Dover residents and an overwhelming number of scientists throughout the country were outraged .
They say intelligent design is nothing but religion in disguise , the latest front in the war on evolution .
EUGENIE C. SCOTT : The goal of intelligent design is to try to re-Christianize American society .
KEVIN PADIAN : Intelligent design is not , anywhere , a scientific concept .
It 's not a field of science .
It 's not being actively researched by anyone .
KEN MILLER : It 's a violation of everything we mean and everything we understand by " science . "
NARRATOR : The stage was set for a battle that would pit friend against friend and neighbor against neighbor .
BILL BUCKINGHAM :
It was like we shot somebody 's dog .
I mean , there was a blowup like you could n't believe .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III ( U.S. District Judge ) :
It was like a civil war within the community , there 's no question .
NARRATOR : Before it was over , this battle would land the school board in federal court .
No cameras were allowed in the courtroom , so to bring this historic showdown between evolution and intelligent design to light , NOVA has dramatized key scenes from court transcripts .
It was a six - week trial in which modern biology was Exhibit A , and hanging in the balance was not just the Dover biology curriculum .
The future of science education in America , the separation of church and state , and the very nature of scientific inquiry were all on trial .
In Dover , Pennsylvania , the debate over religion and evolution has long been personal .
BERTHA SPAHR : We live in a community that has a great many fundamentalist churches .
RAY MUMMERT ( Dover Pastor ) : I 've never appreciated the fact that my children are being taught to believe in evolution as opposed to creationism .
MALINDA FORREY : " In the beginning , God created ... "
To me , that 's all I need to know .
NARRATOR : Located in the southeastern part of the state , about 20 miles from the capital , it 's a quiet , rural place , home to about 20,000 people , more than a dozen churches , and one high school .
One of the first people in Dover to sense that trouble was brewing was Bertha Spahr .
She had been teaching science at Dover High School for almost 40 years .
In the spring of 2003 , she received some disturbing news from the school district 's assistant superintendent .
BERTHA SPAHR : He actually came to my classroom one evening after school and said , " Bert , I think I need to give you a heads up .
There is a school board member who is talking about equal time ... whether it be 50 percent ... but certainly equal time for creationism .
And I think you need to be aware of this . "
That 's when the red flag went up .
Another science teacher , Bryan Rehm , heard this too .
BRYAN REHM ( Dover Science Teacher ) :
I had actually laughed at him because I thought that was the funniest thing I 'd heard .
I mean , creationism was ruled out in public education and science when I was in junior high school .
NARRATOR : When Bertha Spahr asked which school board member was interested in creationism being taught alongside evolution , she was told it was a local businessman named Alan Bonsell , who had recently joined the school board .
ALAN BONSELL : My family and I have been very blessed here , and I 've had family that have lived in the Dover area for 100 years .
So it was something that ... to give back .
And I thought that I could help to try to make Dover , you know , the school district , a better place .
NARRATOR : When Bonsell had questions about how evolution was taught at Dover High School , Bertha Spahr and her biology teachers agreed to meet with him .
ALAN BONSELL : I had a meeting with some of the science teachers in the high school just to see what they taught or did n't teach in the high school science class .
JENNIFER MILLER ( Dover Science Teacher ) :
And creationism really did n't come up at that meeting , it was more , " how do we teach evolution ? "
And he seemed very satisfied .
He was okay with how we taught , and we thought everything was good , and we went on our merry way .
ROBERT ESHBACH :
If you 'll recall , he did enlighten us , at that time , that he did not ... was n't his belief that evolution is how things came about .
JENNIFER MILLER : Right .
That 's correct .
ROBERT ESHBACH :
He felt the Earth was not much more than 4,000 years old .
ALAN BONSELL : I personally do n't believe in Darwin 's theory of evolution .
I 'm a creationist .
I make no bones about that .
NARRATOR : Creationists like Bonsell reject much of modern science in favor a literal reading of the Bible .
They believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old , and that God created everything fully - formed , including humans , in just six days .
Although most mainstream religions made peace with evolution decades ago , many creationists still see evolution as incompatible with their faith .
And both creationism and evolution are no strangers to the court .
Their legal battles stretch back to the famous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 .
Dick York As Bertram T. Cates / Clip from Inherit the Wind ) :
As I told you yesterday , Darwin 's theory tells us that man evolved from a lower order of animals .
NARRATOR : In that case , a high school science teacher in Tennessee , named John Scopes , was accused of violating state law by teaching evolution .
( Frederic March as Matthew Harrison Brady ) : I hereby place you under arrest .
NARRATOR : Loosely portrayed in the classic film Inherit the Wind , the trial turned into a courtroom showdown between legendary lawyer Clarence Darrow ...
SPENCER TRACY As HENRY DRUMMOND Clip from Inherit the Wind ) :
The defense wishes to place Dr. Keller on the stand so that he can explain to the gentlemen of the jury the exact meaning of the theory of evolution .
NARRATOR : ... and three - time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan .
ELLIOT REED As PROSECUTER TOM DAVENPORT / Clip from Inherit the Wind ) :
If you had a son , Mr. Sillers , what would you think if that sweet child came home from school and told you that a godless teacher ...
SPENCER TRACY As HENRY DRUMMOND Clip from Inherit the Wind ) : Objection !
NARRATOR : Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution , and slapped with a mere hundred - dollar fine .
But the verdict would have a chilling effect on science education throughout the country for the next three decades .
EUGENIE C. SCOTT : After the Scopes trial , textbook publishers decided that evolution was just too controversial a subject , and so they just quietly removed it from the textbooks .
And for most of that time , the textbook was the curriculum , and , so , if it was n't in the textbook , it did n't get taught .
NARRATOR : The chilling effect of the Scopes trial did not thaw until the 1960s .
But as publishers slipped evolution back into their textbooks , creationists fought to teach their views in science class as well .
Over the next 30 years , the two sides battled it out in court .
The fight culminated in 1987 , when the Supreme Court decided that teaching creationism in public school science classes violated the separation of church and state mandated by the constitution in the Establishment Clause , which prevents the government from promoting or prohibiting any form of religion .
To this day , teaching creationism in public school science classes anywhere in the United States remains a violation of students ' constitutional rights .
Another Dover school board member , Bill Buckingham , a retired policeman , was appointed by Alan Bonsell to head the curriculum committee .
It was his job to review all requests for new textbooks .
The 9th grade biology teachers had asked for a widely used book , co-authored by biologists Ken Miller and Joe Levine .
But Buckingham did not like what he saw .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : In looking at the biology book the teachers wanted , I noticed that it was laced with Darwinism .
I think I listed somewhere between 12 and 15 instances where it talked about Darwin 's theory of evolution .
It was n't on every page of the book , but , like , every couple of chapters , there was Darwin , in your face again .
And it was to the exclusion of any other theory .
NARRATOR : And at a school board meeting in the summer of 2004 , Buckingham made it clear he was n't comfortable approving that book .
The school board put the purchase on hold .
So what was it about Charles Darwin 's theory that Buckingham objected to ?
Darwin published his theory of evolution in 1859 , in a book called On the Origin of Species , and it has been sparking controversy ever since .
It was the culmination of work Darwin started more than two decades earlier , after sailing around the world on a ship called the Beagle .
On that expedition , Darwin collected thousands of plants and animals that were unlike any he had ever seen before .
And when he returned home to England , he became particularly fascinated by the many different birds he had found on a remote chain of islands off the coast of South America called the Galapagos .
KENNETH R. MILLER : There was a bird that looked to him like a warbler , and another one that looked to him like a woodpecker , and another one that looked like a finch , and so forth .
And he was n't sure what these birds were .
But they were all clearly adapted for very different ways of life .
Some ate insects .
Some , for example , picked up small seeds .
Some could crush the large seeds of certain plants which were found on the Galapagos .
So they had different appearances , different beaks , different styles of life
NARRATOR : When Darwin asked for help identifying these birds , he was in for a surprise .
KENNETH R. MILLER : He was floored .
He was stunned to discover that the expert ornithologists in Great Britain told him , " They 're all finches .
That 's not a woodpecker , it 's a finch .
That 's not a warbler , it 's a finch . "
NARRATOR : But why , in this small chain of islands , had he found finches with such different characteristics ?
Darwin reasoned : in nature , individual organisms compete for limited resources like food .
If , for example , a bird is born with a slightly larger beak than the other members of the population , that might give it an advantage on an island where large seeds are more common .
Over many generations , birds with large beaks would be more likely to survive and reproduce , handing down this advantageous beak shape to greater numbers of offspring than those with smaller beaks .
Darwin called this process " natural selection , " because the forces of nature , such as the environment of an individual island in the Galapagos , select those organisms best suited to that environment .
And he believed that , over time , this could give rise to new species .
KENNETH R. MILLER : What Darwin pointed out was a general principle , which is easily observed in nature : species are not fixed , that with natural selection pushing or pulling or splitting , species can change over time .
NARRATOR : Darwin thought all the different kinds of plants and animals we see around us today , including humans , could have arisen by this process .
He called the gradual evolution of new species from old " descent with modification , " and he pictured the relatedness of all living things as a great tree of life , with each twig a different species ultimately springing from a common ancestor .
NEIL SHUBIN ( University of Chicago / The Field Museum ) :
As you follow the family tree farther and farther back , say , from our twig , which–we 're just one twig on this vast tree–what you see our similarities with apes ; and going further down , our similarities with other mammals ; further down , our similarities with reptiles ; further down , our similarities with amphibians , fish , all the way down to worms , and jellyfish and so forth .
What you see is a continuity of life on the planet , because we 're not exceptional in any great degree , we 're just a twig on a giant evolutionary tree that includes everything .
NARRATOR : The common ancestry of all forms of life was one of Darwin 's great insights .
But he recognized disturbing implications in the idea that humans had evolved from ape - like ancestors .
KENNETH R. MILLER : In the eyes of a lot of people , once Charles Darwin had proposed that natural processes could have produced every species on this planet , including us , they felt that took God out of the picture .
NARRATOR : And about a century and a half later , many people in Dover , like the United States as a whole , agree .
To this day , somewhere between a third and half the U.S. population does not accept evolution .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : I find it personally offensive , because I 'm a Christian .
I believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God , and that the Book of Genesis tells it like it is as to how we came into being .
God did n't create monkey and then take man from a monkey .
He created man .
NARRATOR : In Dover , hostility to the theory of evolution had already erupted in vandalism after a student at the high school painted a 16 - foot mural depicting the evolution of humans from ape - like ancestors .
The mural was on display in a science classroom , when someone removed it from the school and burned it .
Now , as Bill Buckingham continued fighting the purchase of the biology book at school board meetings , the science teachers began to suspect that he had been involved .
BERTHA SPAHR : This idea of man and monkey came into the conversation , and I immediately remember saying to him " Does this have anything to do with that mural that disappeared ? "
ROBERT ESHBACH :
And that 's when he made the remark that he gleefully watched it burn .
JENNIFER MILLER : Right , sort of under his breath , though we heard what he said .
NARRATOR : Though Buckingham denied any involvement in the incident , when he reportedly announced he was searching for a biology book that included evolution and creationism , the school board meeting erupted in chaos .
CHRISTY REHM ( Dover English Teacher ) :
Typically , a school board meeting is a very dry thing , couple of people show up because they have a certain issue they want to discuss .
But these meetings would be hundreds of people , and it would be hot , and people would be upset , and it was a zoo .
It was just an absolute madhouse .
TAMMY KITZMILLER ( Dover Parent ) : Ludicrous , bizarre ... there 's many adjectives I could use .
They were disrespectful to the public , disrespectful to the teachers .
They did n't want to listen to anybody .
They were just on their own agenda .
ALAN BONSELL : Sometimes in a democracy , and when you have nine different personalities together , and you have a controversial issue , in the heat of the moment , somebody might say something they wish , 10 minutes from now , they would n't have said .
NARRATOR : The controversy engulfing the school board caught the attention of local newspaper reporters , including Lauri Lebo , who grew up in the area .
LAURI LEBO ( Journalist ) :
From the first time I heard school board members were talking about creationism , I thought this could become a big issue .
I did n't realize how big , but I certainly knew I was intrigued by it .
NARRATOR : Lebo began reporting on the controversy .
But her interest in the issue was not just professional , it was also personal .
Lauri 's father had been the owner of a local radio station , but the oldies format was n't paying the bills , and the electric company was about to put him off the air .
LAURI LEBO :
The next day a gentleman came in who belonged to a local church ... wanted to lease programming on the radio station and offered to pay a decent sum of money .
And overnight the radio station became Christian radio station .
My father became born again .
NARRATOR : In her articles , Lebo would write about the 1987 Supreme Court ruling that would keep Buckingham from introducing any creationist text into biology class .
In the meantime , Buckingham was in touch with two organizations known for questioning Darwin .
One was a public interest law firm in Michigan called the Thomas More Law Center .
Headed by former public prosecutor Richard Thompson , famous for his efforts to convict assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian , the firm bills itself as " the sword and shield for people of faith . "
RICHARD THOMPSON ( Thomas More Law Center ) : Bill Buckingham contacted me as a private citizen , and also as someone who was concerned that the biology textbook presented only one side .
And he thought there should be other alternative theories involved .
And that 's when I introduced him to the theory of intelligent design and indicated that I thought that that theory could be taught alongside the theory of evolution and pass constitutional muster .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : I asked , you know , if there were any reference books out there , and they gave me the title of the book Of Pandas and People .
NARRATOR : He also found a conservative think tank in Seattle , named the Discovery Institute , which calls itself " the nation 's leading intelligent design proponent . "
They sent Buckingham a DVD and other material on intelligent design .
In these materials , Buckingham found a view that did not seem to conflict with his own .
For example , according to the book Of Pandas and People , " Intelligent Design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency , with their distinctive features already intact : fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks and wings , et cetera . "
And in the DVD he got from the Discovery Institute , Buckingham found more support for intelligent design .
NARRATOR , DISCOVERY INSTITUTE DVD :
One hundred and fifty years ago , Charles Darwin transformed science with his theory of natural selection .
Today , that theory faces a formidable challenge .
Intelligent design has sparked both discovery and intense debate over the origin of life on Earth .
And , for a growing number of scientists , it represents a paradigm , an idea with the power to once again redefine the foundations of scientific thought .
NARRATOR : Both the DVD and book use the same example to illustrate intelligent design 's central tenet , explained here by proponent Steve Fuller .
STEVE FULLER : One way to get into the concept of intelligent design is by imagining what it would be like to run across something like this on the beach : " John Loves Mary . "
I mean , this is the sort of design that 's very unlikely just to have assembled itself just from sand blowing randomly over even a very long period of time .
Rather , it shows a sign of some sort of intelligence that 's behind it .
NARRATOR : And just as those words on the beach are clearly the product of an intelligent being , the claim is that some aspects of life itself must be the product of a designer .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : Intelligent design , in my way of thinking , states that life is too complex to happened at random , that there had to be a designer , something to shape how things went , so to speak .
In the Book of Genesis , the designer would be God .
NARRATOR : But in the materials Buckingham received , God is never mentioned .
The mysterious designer is called an " intelligent cause " or " intelligent agent . "
Championed by a law professor named Phillip Johnson , intelligent design began to emerge in the 1980s .
PHILLIP JOHNSON : This whole Darwinian story , it seems to me , has been very much oversold .
Everybody is told that it 's absolutely certain and certainly true .
And because it 's called science , it has been proved again and again by absolutely unquestionable procedures .
But this is not true .
It 's an imaginative story that has been spun on the basis of very little evidence .
NARRATOR : An emeritus professor at the U.C. Berkeley law school , Johnson wrote a book called Darwin on Trial , in which he laid the groundwork for the intelligent design movement .
For years , he 's been making the claim that evolution may produce small - scale changes–like the different finch beaks Darwin observed–but for humans to come about requires the intervention of some kind of intelligence .
PHILLIP JOHNSON : That is the basic intelligent design proposition : that the unintelligent causes , by themselves , can't do the whole job .
An intelligent cause had to be involved .
NARRATOR : Armed with information on intelligent design , Bill Buckingham returned to the school board .
LAURI LEBO :
He had been told that intelligent design was a good compromise between his religious beliefs , is what he told me .
And Alan Bonsell told me that , too–and what the courts will allow .
They were both very clear on that , that this is their compromise even though they believe in creationism .
This would , this would , sort of , bridge the gap for them .
NARRATOR : But the science teachers were not convinced .
BRYAN REHM :
The first reading of it , " an intelligent agent created life . "
That 's creationism .
It 's Biblical creationism , you know ?
All I have to do is take out " intelligent agent " and put in " God , " and , voila !
We have the story of Genesis .
So there is no question in my mind what intelligent design was .
NARRATOR : Now Buckingham was ready to take a stand .
ROBERT ESHBACH :
He came up with the ultimatum that the only way that they would vote for the textbooks was that we adopted the book Of Pandas and People as a sister or companion textbook .
NARRATOR : But when he put it before the school board , he came up two votes short .
The board chose to purchase only the standard biology book co-authored by Ken Miller .
Pandas was shelved .
That might have been the end of the story , but a few weeks later , 60 copies of Pandas turned up in Bertha 's Spahr 's department , a gift to the school from an anonymous donor .
Then , without consulting the teachers , members of Buckingham 's curriculum committee drafted the outlines of what became a bold new policy for the science department .
It was brought before the full school board for a vote , and after a heated debate , it passed , six to three .
In its final form , the policy mandated that all students in ninth grade biology be read a one minute statement telling them that Darwin 's theory is not a fact and that it contains gaps .
Suggesting intelligent design as an alternative , it directed students to the 60 copies of Pandas that would be available as a reference .
The school board members who voted against Buckingham 's proposal resigned in protest .
Tammy Kitzmiller is the mother of a 9th grade student who would be read the one minute statement at Dover High .
She called the A.C.L.U. to see what could be done .
TAMMY KITZMILLER : I just did n't agree with what they were doing .
I did not like how they were trying to mix religion and science .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK ( American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania ) :
We had parents , we had students , we had teachers , all calling us and saying " Hey , there 's a problem here .
Can you help us ? "
And we said , " Sure , we 'll help you . "
NARRATOR : On December 14 , 2004 , 11 parents of Dover school students , including Tammy Kitzmiller and Bryan and Christy Rehm , filed a lawsuit in federal court in Pennsylvania , alleging the Dover school board was violating their constitutional rights by introducing religion into science class .
They would be represented by the A.C.L.U. , which had joined forces with the organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton .
STEPHEN HARVEY ( Pepper Hamilton , LLP ) : Eric said at the time , " This is the case I been waiting for my entire career . "
NARRATOR : The School Board would be represented by the Thomas More Law Center , the firm that had told Bill Buckingham about the Pandas book .
A court date was set .
And as depositions were being taken , the science teachers took a stand of their own against reading the intelligent design statement .
JENNIFER MILLER :
We stepped up and said , " We 're not going to read it . "
BERTHA SPAHR : We met together and agreed that as a unit we would stand together .
ROBERT ESHBACH : I mean , I have principles and standards of my own , and there was no way that I was going to go into a science classroom of mine and make a statement about this so - called intelligent design , knowing full well that it was not science .
NARRATOR : They notified the board of their refusal in a memo that proclaimed , " Intelligent design is not science .
Intelligent design is not biology .
Intelligent design is not an accepted scientific theory . "
With the teachers refusing to read the one minute statement , Dover 's assistant superintendent walked into ninth grade biology class on January 18 , 2005 and read :
Assistant Superintendent , Dover , Pennsylvania School District :
The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin 's theory of evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part .
Because Darwin's theory is a theory , it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered .
The theory is not a fact .
Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence .
NARRATOR : On September 26 , 2005 , almost exactly a year after the school board devised the intelligent design policy , six weeks of testimony in the case of Kitzmiller versus Dover Area School District got underway in federal court in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III ( Dramatization ) :
Good morning to all of you .
Are you prepared to open ?
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Pepper Hamilton , LLP / Dramatization ) :
Yes , I am .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III ( Dramatization ) :
You may do so .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
My co-counsel and I represent 11 parents who are challenging the Dover Area School District 's change to its biology curriculum .
Dover School Board members announced their interest in the topic of evolution in starkly religious terms .
They looked for a book that could provide a religious alternative to evolution , and they found one here in Of Pandas and People .
They did everything you would do if you wanted to incorporate a religious topic in a science class and cared nothing about its scientific validity .
PATRICK T. GILLEN ( Thomas More Law Center / Dramatization ) : Patrick Gillen , your Honor , on behalf of the defendants in this action , the Dover Area School District and its board of directors .
The board believed that intelligent design was not creationism .
They knew what that was , the Book of Genesis .
They believed it was a legitimate educational goal to make students aware of the existence of another scientific theory .
Defendants ' experts will show this Court that intelligent design theory is science , it is not religion .
This expert testimony will also demonstrate that making students aware of gaps and problems in evolutionary theory is good science education .
It 's good liberal education .
NARRATOR : By the time the trial started , challenges to the teaching of evolution had cropped up in dozens of other states .
And intelligent design was attracting some heavy hitters .
Rick Santorum , then Pennsylvania senator , had commended the school district for its intelligent design policy .
And President Bush had thrown his support behind intelligent design , saying , " Both sides ought to be properly taught so people can understand what the debate is about . "
Now , the eyes of the nation were on Dover , the latest battleground in the war on evolution .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK : I do n't want to sound melodramatic , but I actually think very important things were at stake .
One is the future of science education in this country .
STEPHEN HARVEY :
If the school board can do this , what would prevent them from doing more things like this in other classes ?
Presenting pseudo - science or pseudo - math or pseudo - history in promotion of one particular religious view ?
It 's wrong .
PATRICK T. GILLEN : Does science education have to be so narrow , so technical , so deferential to the existing paradigm that we can't even introduce students to what may be the next great theory ?
NARRATOR : Presiding over the case would be Judge John E. Jones , III .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III : I could never have imagined , in August of 2002 , when I took my seat , that I would be presiding over a case that would attract , literally , worldwide attention .
NARRATOR : Jones had been recommended for his position on the bench by Senator Santorum and appointed by George W. Bush .
Before becoming a judge , Jones was head of Pennsylvania 's liquor control board , where he banned the sale of Bad Frog beer because it showed a cartoon frog making an offensive gesture .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD : Initially , you find out you 've got a judge that 's been appointed by President Bush , who has come out himself in favor of intelligent design , and that makes you a little nervous .
NARRATOR : Members of the defense , however , were optimistic about their chances in Jones 's courtroom .
STEVE FULLER : What the Dover school board had done ... they were n't requiring that intelligent design be taught , and they were n't removing evolution from the classroom .
So , it seemed to me this was pretty modest .
And so I did think it had a pretty good chance , if it was presented properly , of being accepted .
RICHARD THOMPSON :
We did n't have to show that , you know , one theory was better than the other , merely that it was a credible theory , and that the students would gain something by understanding the controversy surrounding the theory of evolution and the origin of species .
NARRATOR : The parents who opposed intelligent design , or plaintiffs , had launched the lawsuit , so the burden of proof was on them .
And because the parents were asking for the teaching of intelligent design to be halted , an order that only a judge can render , there would be no jury .
Instead , the jury box was packed with reporters and writers from around the globe , including one with a surprising connection to the case .
MATTHEW CHAPMAN ( Charles Darwin's Great - Great - Grandson ) :
I think of myself as being a sort of living disproof of evolution , because my great - great - grandfather was Charles Darwin , who obviously wrote one of the most important books of the last 2,000 years , and I 'm a screenwriter .
This is not evolution in the right direction .
NARRATOR : To win , the plaintiffs ' lawyers would have to show the judge that the Dover School Board 's one minute statement promoted religion or that board members had religious motivation .
In addition , both sides asked the judge to rule on a fundamental question : " Is intelligent design science or not ? "
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK :
In order to show that intelligent design is not science we had to talk about , well , " What is science ? "
NARRATOR : For help , the plaintiffs turned to researcher Nick Matzke and his colleagues at an organization called the National Center for Science Education , which tracks challenges to evolution in public schools .
NICK MATZKE ( National Center for Science Education ) :
The last time any lawyer took biology was probably in 9th grade .
And I spent months and months on e-mail , at meetings , explaining science , explaining evolution to the lawyers .
NARRATOR : To make their case before a judge who had no particular scientific training , the lawyers for the parents assembled a team of expert witnesses .
And as their first witness they called biologist Ken Miller , co-author of the textbook that Bill Buckingham had called " laced with Darwinism . "
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK ( Dramatization ) : Dr. Miller , what is evolution ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
Most biologists would describe evolution as " the process of change over time that characterizes the natural history of life on this planet . "
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK ( Dramatization ) :
And what was Darwin 's contribution to evolution ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) : Darwin pointed out there 's a struggle for existence , whether we like to admit it or not .
He realized that those organisms that had the characteristics that suited them best in that struggle , those were the ones that would hand those characteristics down to the next generation , and that , therefore , the average characteristics of a population could change in one direction or another and they could change quite dramatically .
And that 's the essential idea of natural selection .
NARRATOR : Starting with Ken Miller , the plaintiffs walked Judge Jones through the conflict at the heart of this case .
Miller testified how Darwin 's theory pictures the history of life as a tree , with species gradually evolving into others over millions of years , producing new branches and twigs , a process that gives rise to all the variety of life , from bacteria to Darwin 's finches to ourselves .
But intelligent design takes a different view , as the movement 's own literature shows .
Intelligent design teaches a history of life in which organisms appear abruptly , are unrelated , and linked only by their designer .
NICK MATZKE :
What 's really being advocated is the idea that organisms poofed into existence through the miraculous act of an intelligent designer , i.e. , God .
That 's the view that intelligent design promotes .
NARRATOR : So how can scientists be so sure Darwin 's tree accurately represents the history of life on Earth ?
As it turned out , the latest in a large body of evidence to refute intelligent design and support evolution was coming to light just as this case was unfolding .
NEIL SHUBIN : I remember thinking to myself , when all this was going on , " Wait 'll they get a look at this , because it 's just so beautiful . "
NARRATOR : Darwin believed that evidence for his idea of common ancestry would be unearthed in the form of transitional fossils .
For example , if , over millions of years , fish gave rise to land animals , as evolutionary theory predicts , we should find fossils of extinct creatures that are part fish and part land animal .
In 1999 , paleontologist Neil Shubin and his colleagues set out to find just such a creature .
NEIL SHUBIN : What evolution enables us to do is to make specific predictions about what we should find in the fossil record .
The prediction in this case is clear - cut .
That is , if we go to rocks of the right age , and the rocks of the right type , we should find transitions between two great forms of life , between fish and amphibian .
NARRATOR : Many scientists think life began in the water , at least three and a half billion years ago .
More recently , about 375 million years ago , the tree of life branched as primitive fish evolved into amphibians , such as today 's frogs and salamanders , which live part of their lives on land .
Armed with this prediction , Shubin and his colleagues organized an expedition to one of the most desolate places on Earth , the Canadian Arctic , about 500 miles from the North Pole , where rocks of just the right age are exposed .
Here , they hoped to fill a gap in the branch of the evolutionary tree that leads from primitive fish to animals with four limbs , or " tetrapods , " by finding a fossil of an animal that shared characteristics of both .
But after three summers of digging through hundreds of tons of rock in this harsh environment , they had found little of interest .
They returned the next year for one last try .
NEIL SHUBIN : Money was running out .
This was it .
We were told this was our last year up there .
And then , in 2004 , in the third day of the season , a colleague of mine was removing rock and discovered a little snout sticking out the side of the cliff , just exactly like this .
And he removed more rock and more rock and more rock , and it became clear this was a snout of a flat - headed animal .
And that 's when we knew .
Flat - headed animal at 375 - million years old ?
This is going to be something interesting .
NARRATOR : They called it Tiktaalik , which means " large , fresh water fish , " in the language of the local Inuit people .
And it's one of the most vivid transitional fossils ever discovered , showing how land animals evolved from primitive fish .
NEIL SHUBIN : Over here you have a fish of about 380 - million years old .
And , just like any good fish , it has scales on its back and fins .
You compare that to an amphibian , and you find a creature that does n't have scales , and it 's modified the fins to become limbs , arms and legs .
And the head 's very different .
It has a flat head with eyes on top and a neck .
What we see when we look at the fossil record , at rocks of just the right age , is a creature like Tiktaalik .
Just like a fish , it has scales on its back , and fins .
You can see the fin webbing here .
Yet when we look at the head , you see something very different .
You see a very amphibian - like thing , with a flat head , with eyes on top .
It gets even better when we take the fin apart .
When we look inside the fin , as in this cast here , what you 'll see is bones that compare to our shoulder , elbow , even parts of the wrist–bone for bone .
So you have a fish , at just the right time in the history of life , that has characteristics of amphibians and primitive fish .
It 's a mix .
NARRATOR : And just as evolutionary theory predicts , Tiktaalik suggests a tree of life , with one species giving rise to another over millions of years .
The discovery of Tiktaalik was still being written up at the time of the trial , so it could n't be used as evidence .
But Shubin 's colleague , paleontologist Kevin Padian , showed the judge examples of other fossils with transitional features that support Darwin 's tree of life .
KEVIN PADIAN : My testimony in the trial was basically taking a day and showing the judge how we do our work and what the evidence is .
NARRATOR : How dinosaurs evolved into birds , as seen in creatures like Archaeopteryx which has a long tail and teeth like a dinosaur , but feathers just like a modern bird .
How ancestors of modern reptiles evolved into creatures now extinct that share a common ancestor with mammals .
And , how , surprisingly , whales evolved from large land animals that returned to the water .
KEVIN PADIAN :
And where the Pandas book says we can't go from A to B , there are no fossils and we do n't know how to study them , actually , we 've gone from A to B and to C , D , E , F and G .
We have the fossils ; we have the transitional features ; we have the ways of analyzing them with many different lines of evidence .
And we 're looking for the picture that accounts for the most lines of objective evidence .
NARRATOR : With each fossil , Padian refuted Pandas claim that different life forms appear suddenly , by showing how fossils of extinct organisms bridge the gaps between species , resulting in a picture of gradual evolution , just as Darwin proposed .
KEVIN PADIAN :
The reporters in the courtroom were just amazed that we knew all this stuff .
And how come they had n't learned about this stuff before ?
And the reason is it 's not in textbooks because the creationists fight so hard to keep it out .
That 's been a big influence .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD :
The court took a break .
And I remember the judge saying something like , you know , " biology class adjourned , " you know , " for lunch . "
And he was , you know , smiling .
And it was clear that we had the judge interested in science .
NARRATOR : Lawyers for the parents may have impressed the judge and reporters .
But many in Dover wondered , " Why is evolution taught as fact if it 's ' just a theory ? ' "
ALAN BONSELL : Maybe Darwinism is the prevalent theory out there today , but it is a theory .
It is n't a law of science .
It is n't , you know , a fact .
It is a theory .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : We just wanted alternative views talked about , too .
We were n't , we were n't saying , " Do n't talk about Darwin . "
Talk about Darwin , it 's a theory .
But that 's what it is , it 's not Darwin 's law , it 's not Darwin 's fact , it 's Darwin 's theory .
ROBERT ESHBACH :
To say it 's just a theory is really a bit insulting to science because in science , a theory holds more weight than just a fact does .
KEVIN PADIAN ( Dramatization ) :
And here I think the term " theory " needs to be looked at the way scientists consider it .
A theory is not just something that we think of in the middle of the night after too much coffee and not enough sleep .
That 's an idea .
A theory , in science , means a large body of information that 's withstood a lot of testing .
It probably consists of a number of different hypotheses and many different lines of evidence .
Gravitation is a theory that 's unlikely to be falsified , even if we saw something fall up .
It might make us wonder , but we'd try to figure out what was happening rather than immediately just dismiss gravitation .
KEVIN PADIAN : Facts are just the minutiae of science .
By themselves , they can be right or wrong .
But a theory is something that has been tested and tested over and over again , built on , revised .
It continues to be reworked and revised .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) : Dr. Miller , would you agree that Darwin 's theory of evolution is not an absolute truth ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
Well , I certainly would , for the very simple reason that no theory in science , no theory , is ever regarded as absolute truth .
We do n't regard atomic theory as truth .
We do n't regard the germ theory of disease as truth .
We do n't regard the theory of friction as truth .
We regard all of these theories as well - supported , testable explanations that provide natural explanations for natural phenomena .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Should we regard Darwin 's theory of evolution as tentative ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
We should regard all scientific explanations as being tentative , and that includes the theory of evolution .
NEIL SHUBIN : Science is about discovering the unknown , what we do n't know .
I do n't focus on what we know as a scientist .
I want to find new things that tell me about what I do n't know .
NARRATOR : As the plaintiffs testified , that quest to investigate the unknown has led to the discovery of some of the strongest evidence for evolution .
Darwin was convinced that species evolve over time , through natural selection acting on inherited traits .
But he had no idea how those traits arose or how they were passed from generation to generation .
When 20th century scientists discovered the role DNA plays in heredity , they founded a new science , called " genetics , " that put Darwin 's theory to the test .
Virtually every cell in every living thing contains chromosomes , which are made of densely packed strands of DNA that function as a blueprint of the individual organism 's characteristics .
During reproduction , chromosomes from each parent replicate and shuffle their parts to produce new chromosomes .
Then , each parent passes chromosomes to offspring .
But the process is imperfect .
Along the way , DNA is subject to random mutations , or mistakes , giving each offspring its own unique blueprint .
Sometimes this produces characteristics in offspring that are benign .
Other times it produces harmful characteristics , like a misshapen wing .
But occasionally , the process gives rise to a beneficial trait .
For example , a butterfly whose coloration mimics another species of butterfly that tastes bad to birds .
About a hundred years after Darwin proposed that natural selection acts on new traits appearing in a population , genetics revealed the biological mechanism that gives rise to those traits in the first place .
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
And therefore you could say that when modern genetics came into being , everything in Darwin 's theory was at risk , could have been overturned if it turned out to contradict the essential elements of evolutionary theory , but it did n't contradict them , it confirmed them in great detail .
NARRATOR : And , as Miller would testify , a genetics paper published less than a year before the trial had confirmed what has long been the most inflammatory part of Darwin 's theory , the common ancestry of humans and apes .
That paper explored a curious discrepancy in our chromosomes .
The cells of all great apes , like chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans , contain 24 pairs of chromosomes .
If humans share a common ancestor with apes , you 'd expect us to have the same number .
But surprisingly , human cells contain only 23 pairs .
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
The question is , if evolution is right about this common ancestry idea , where did the chromosome go ?
Well , evolution makes a testable prediction , and that is that somewhere in the human genome , we ought to be able to find a piece of Scotch tape holding together two chromosomes , so that our 24 pairs ... two of them were pasted together to form just 23 .
And if we can't find that , then the hypothesis of common ancestry is wrong and evolution is mistaken .
Next slide .
NARRATOR : To solve this riddle for the court , Miller would show how scientists discovered traces of our evolutionary past buried in the very structure of a chromosome carried by all humans .
Typically , on the ends of every chromosome , you should find special genetic markers , or sequences of DNA called " telomeres . "
And in their middles , you should find different genetic markers called " centromeres . "
But if a mutation occurred in the past , causing two pairs of chromosomes to fuse , we should find evidence in those genetic markers : telomeres not only at the ends of the new chromosome , but also at their middles , and not one , but two centromeres .
Finding a structure like this in our chromosomes would explain why humans have one pair fewer than the great apes .
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
And if we can't find that , then evolution is in trouble .
Next slide .
Lo and behold , the answer is in Chromosome Number 2 .
All of the marks of the fusion of those chromosomes predicted by common descent and evolution , all those marks are present on human Chromosome Number 2 .
So the case is closed in a most beautiful way .
And that is the prediction of evolution of common ancestry is fulfilled by that lead pipe evidence that you see here , in terms of tying everything together , that our chromosome formed by the fusion from our common ancestor is Chromosome Number 2 .
Evolution has made a testable prediction and it has passed .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK ( Dramatization ) :
So modern genetics and molecular biology actually support evolutionary theory ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
They support it in great detail .
And the closer we can get to looking at the details of the human genome , the more powerful the evidence has become .
NEIL SHUBIN : Darwin did n't even know about molecular biology and DNA , yet that 's where some of the most profound evidence is being uncovered today .
Think about that .
That somebody in the 1800s made predictions that are being confirmed in molecular biology labs today .
That 's a very profound statement of a very successful theory .
KENNETH R. MILLER : Not a single observation , not a single experimental result , has ever emerged in 150 years that contradicts the general outlines of the theory of evolution .
Any theory that can stand up to 150 years of contentious testing is a pretty darn good theory , and that 's what evolution is .
NARRATOR : And the deep understanding of evolution as proposed by Darwin has , with genetics , unlocked many of the secrets of life .
ROBERT PENNOCK ( Michigan State University ) :
It 's an explanatory framework within which all the rest of biology fits .
It 's something that we use in practical biological applications : medicine , agriculture , industry .
When you 're getting a flu vaccine –that really depended upon evolutionary knowledge .
In many , many specific ways , evolution makes a practical difference .
It 's not just something that happened in the past , evolution 's happening now .
NARRATOR : So if evolution has stood up to all this scrutiny , what about intelligent design ?
Does it play by the same rules ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) :
If you invoke a non-natural cause , a spirit force or something like that , in your research , I have no way to test it .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK ( Dramatization ) :
So supernatural causation is not considered part of science ?
KENNETH R. MILLER ( Dramatization ) : Yeah .
I hesitate to beg the patience of the Court with this , but being a Boston Red Sox fan , I can't resist it .
One might say , for example , that the reason the Boston Red Sox were able to come back from three games down against the New York Yankees was because God was tired of George Steinbrenner and wanted to see the Red Sox win .
In my part of the country , you'd be surprised how many people think that 's a perfectly reasonable explanation for what happened last year .
And you know what ?
It could be true , but it certainly would n't be science .
It 's not scientific , and it 's certainly not something we can test .
EUGENIE C. SCOTT : The fundamental problem with intelligent design is that you can't use it to explain the natural world .
It 's essentially a negative argument .
It says , " Evolution does n't work , therefore the designer did it .
Evolution does n't work , therefore we win by default . "
But when you ask them , " What does intelligent design tell you about nature ?
Does it tell you what the designer did ?
Does it tell you what the designer used to design something with ?
Does it tell you what purpose the designer had for designing something ?
Does it tell you when the designer did it ?
Why the designer did it ? "
It does n't tell you anything like that .
Basically , it 's a negative argument .
And you can't build a science on a negative argument .
NARRATOR : After three weeks of testimony on the nature of science , the evidence for evolution and the failings of intelligent design , the plaintiffs had presented their case .
MATTHEW CHAPMAN :
To watch the whole thing , you got an education in what evolution was , where evolution stands as a theory now in the 21st century .
If you concentrated , you would get sucked into this thing , and the day would go by .
And you 'd come out , and you 'd think , " That was amazing , what I heard here .
These eloquent people , " you know , " with these incredible educations . "
And it was fantastic .
LAURI LEBO : The plaintiffs ' attorneys had put on an amazing case .
But there was this idea , especially among those who were n't sitting in the trial every day , that when the defense started , you know , then we 'll see some pretty interesting stuff , too , on the other side .
NARRATOR : The question now was , " Could the defense prove that intelligent design is a scientific theory ?
What evidence could they muster to support this claim ? "
While the battle in federal court heated up , the atmosphere in Dover had gone from divisive to dangerous .
Tammy Kitzmiller , the lead plaintiff in the case , who had a daughter in ninth grade biology class at Dover High School , had been receiving hate mail since the start of the trial .
TAMMY KITZMILLER : One letter was pretty disturbing .
I think this was the one with the passage that ... the last sentence especially : " Madeline Murray was found murdered for taking prayer and Bible reading out of schools , so watch out for a bullet . "
This was a letter that I made sure my lawyers got a copy of , and it was forwarded to the FBI .
ROBERT ESHBACH :
Anywhere you turned we were getting attacked .
I mean , the people in the community were attacking us in the newspapers , people in our own profession were attacking us saying , you know , " What are you guys doing in Dover ?
Why are you letting this happen ? "
People in the community were calling us atheists , which was a bit offensive to two of us in the department , because two of us happened to be sons and daughters of ministers .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : I fail to understand how teachers can call themselves Christians , go to church , talk about God , talk about Christ , and then go to ch ... school five days a week and talk about Darwin , and teach it as if it 's fact , not a theory , but that 's how it happened .
I do n't understand it .
To me that 's talking out of both sides of your mouth .
NARRATOR : Having ignited much of the controversy that resulted in the lawsuit , Bill Buckingham had made a surprise announcement .
Citing poor health and struggles with Oxycontin as a result of surgery , he resigned from the school board and moved out of state .
A school board election was only months away , and now eight of the nine seats would be up for grabs , putting intelligent design on trial in the voting booth as well as the courtroom .
Dover science teacher Bryan Rehm , who had already moved on to another school system , had thrown his hat in the ring .
BRYAN REHM : I could n't work for a board that was going to mandate we teach religious ideas in the science classroom .
I 've got kids in the district , and that 's not the kind of district I want my kids going to school in .
So the choice was either move the whole family or try and fix the district that we live in .
And we chose to fix it .
NARRATOR : But when he hit the campaign trail , Bryan found himself again in the line of fire in the war on evolution .
BRYAN REHM :
The problems that I ran into in the campaign , being out door to door , where people just would n't listen to you and just automatically judged you in advance that , " You 're this kind of person , and we 're good Christians .
We 'd never vote for you . "
And they 'd slam the door in your face , forgetting their windows were open , and call you an f-ing a - hole or tell you you 're just a damned atheist .
NARRATOR : For the Rehms , this was particularly hurtful .
Both are active in their church and run a summer Bible school program .
CHRISTY REHM :
We have a neighbor , actually , who was appointed to the school board and was in support of intelligent design , and he was out campaigning and saying very negative things about our family , how we 're atheists , and , " if you vote for those atheists , well , then , God is not going to be happy with you . "
NARRATOR : To make the case for intelligent design , the defense had lined up eight expert witnesses , including several members of the Discovery Institute , the Seattle organization that promotes intelligent design .
But of those eight witnesses , five never testified .
EUGENIE C. SCOTT : Witnesses started dropping like flies .
NICK MATZKE :
We still have n't heard a complete explanation of why this happened , but there was some dispute going on between the Discovery Institute and the Thomas More Law Center over how the case would be run .
NARRATOR : NOVA made repeated requests to interview members of the Discovery Institute to talk about this and other issues , but the institute set conditions that were inconsistent with normal journalistic practice .
For the defense to win , however , did not require a large number of witnesses .
RICHARD THOMPSON : Our aim was not really to disprove Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Our aim was to merely show that there are credible scientists who believed that the empirical data was supportive of intelligent design .
That 's all we had to show .
STEPHEN HARVEY :
It was our thinking , if they could prove that there was a scientific basis for intelligent design , that it would be possible that the court could conclude that there was a valid secular purpose for teaching intelligent design .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK : I think everybody was waiting to see whether or not the intelligent design folks had a case , but by the time we finished presenting our case , I think it was pretty clear that everything rested on Michael Behe 's testimony .
NARRATOR : A scientist and senior fellow at the Discovery Institute , Michael Behe is the author of the popular intelligent design book , Darwin 's Black Box and dozens of papers , unrelated to intelligent design , published in peer - reviewed science journals .
Behe refused multiple invitations from NOVA to be interviewed for this program , though he went on record in the trial .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) : Dr. Behe , what is your profession ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : I am a professor in the department of biological sciences at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
And you 're a biochemist ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
That 's correct , yes .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
How long have you taught at the college level ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : For 23 years .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Sir , what is intelligent design ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : Intelligent design is a scientific theory that proposes that some aspects of life are best explained as the result of design , and that the strong appearance of design in life is real and not just apparent .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Is intelligent design based on any religious beliefs or convictions ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : No , it is n't .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
What is it based on ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
It is based entirely on observable , empirical , physical evidence from nature , plus logical inferences .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Now when you use the term design , what do you mean ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
Well , I discussed this in my book , Darwin 's Black Box , and a short description of design is shown in this quotation from Chapter 9 : " What is design ?
Design is simply the purposeful arrangement of parts .
When we perceive that parts have been arranged to fulfill a purpose , that 's when we infer design . "
NARRATOR : Part of the defense strategy would be to show the judge examples of biological systems they claimed were too complex to have evolved by natural selection and therefore must have been the product of a designer .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Can you give us a biochemical example of design , Dr. Behe ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
Yes , that 's on the next slide .
I think the best , well , the most visually striking example of design is something called the bacterial flagellum .
Now , this is a figure of a bacterial flagellum taken from a textbook , which is widely used in colleges and universities around the country .
The bacterial flagellum is , quite literally , an outboard motor that bacteria use to swim .
And in order to accomplish that function , it has a number of parts which are ordered to that effect .
Now , this part here , which is labeled the filament , is actually the propeller of the bacterial flagellum .
The motor is actually a rotary motor .
Most people who see this and have the function explained to them quickly realize that these parts are ordered for a purpose and , therefore , bespeak design .
NARRATOR : Under the microscope , bacteria powered by flagella seem almost acrobatic .
They tumble , corkscrew and pirouette , thanks to that whip - like filament .
Driving this propeller is a tiny motor , part of a complex structure made of about 40 different kinds of proteins .
MATTHEW CHAPMAN :
The bacterial flagellum looks like a , sort of a Jules Verne notion of what the future looks like .
It has a strange sort of mechanical quality to it , these sort of cogs and waving tails and stuff .
NARRATOR : And according to Behe , if any one of these parts is missing from the system , the motor can't function .
Behe calls systems like this " irreducibly complex , " a term he coined .
And he argues such systems could not have evolved naturally .
STEVE FULLER :
The idea is that there are certain aspects of life , perhaps organisms or organs or even cells that , in a sense , could only have come about as a whole .
In other words , it was very unlikely they could have come about through just a kind of contingent combination of parts over even millions or billions of years , but , rather , in a sense , has to be created whole cloth , all together , at once , because everything fits together so well that to remove one part , the thing would n't function .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Have other scientists acknowledged these design features of the flagellum ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
Yes , they have .
And if you advance to the next slide ...
In 1998 , a man named David DeRosier wrote an article in the journal Cell , which is a very prestigious scientific journal , entitled " The Turn of the Screw , The Bacterial Flagellar Motor . "
David DeRosier is a professor of biology at Brandeis University , in Massachusetts , and has worked on the bacterial flagellar motor for most of his career .
In that article , he makes the statement , " More so than other motors , the flagellum resembles a machine designed by a human . "
So David DeRosier also recognizes that the structure of the flagellum appears designed .
DAVID DEROSIER ( Brandeis University ) :
What I wrote was , " This is a machine that looks like it was designed by a human . "
But that does n't mean that it was designed , that is the product of intelligent design .
Indeed , this , more , has all the earmarks of something that arose by evolution .
NARRATOR : Using an electron microscope , DeRosier produces ghostly pictures like this one , revealing the inner workings of what 's been called the world 's most efficient motor .
DAVID DEROSIER :
This is the drive shaft .
This transmits this torque generated by the motor that would then turn the propeller , which would push the bacterial cell through the fluid .
NARRATOR : Michael Behe has argued that the flagellum could not have evolved , since its parts have no function for natural selection to act on until they are fully assembled .
But evidence that refutes
Behe 's claim of irreducible complexity comes from a tiny syringe that injects poison , found in some of the nastiest of all bacteria .
DAVID DEROSIER :
This is a structure found , for example , in Yersinia pestis , the bacterium that causes the Bubonic plague .
Look at the similarities .
Now , this structure does n't rotate , but it still has to extend this structure , which is equivalent to the rod , the driveshaft here .
It has to extend that , because it needs this little channel .
It 's like , sort of like a syringe .
So the virulence factors that are made inside the cell , which is down here , can be exported , pushed up into this hole and exported out through this long , kind of , needle , perhaps into a cell in your body or mine , and thereby create misery .
NARRATOR : And it turns out the two structures look similar for a reason .
The syringe on the right is made of a subset of the very same protein types found in the base of the flagellum on the left , though the syringe is missing proteins found in the motor and , therefore , can't produce rotary motion .
It functions perfectly as an apparatus for transmitting disease .
DAVID DEROSIER :
So if we think about what it means to be irreducibly complex , the argument is that if you take away even one of these proteins , that the structure cannot function .
And yet here is a structure that functions , that is missing several of the proteins , and yet here it is , a working , viable organelle of the bacterium .
So indeed , the structure is not , in that sense , irreducibly complex .
NARRATOR : To emphasize DeRosier 's point , Miller arrived at court making an unusual fashion statement .
KENNETH R. MILLER : As an example of what irreducible complexity means , advocates of intelligent design like to point to a very common machine : the mousetrap .
And the mousetrap is composed of five parts .
It has a base plate , the catch , a spring , a little hammer that actually does the dirty work , and a bait holder .
The mousetrap will not work if any one of these five parts are taken away .
That 's absolutely true .
But remember the key notion of irreducible complexity , and that is that this whole machine is completely useless until all the parts are in place .
Well , that , that turns out not to be true .
And I 'll give you an example .
What I have right here is a mousetrap from which I 've removed two of the five parts .
I still have the base plate , the spring , and the hammer .
Now you can't catch any mice with this , so it 's not a very good mousetrap .
But it turns out that , despite the missing parts , it makes a perfectly good , if somewhat inelegant , tie clip .
And when we look at the favorite examples for irreducible complexity , and the bacterial flagellum is a perfect example , we find the molecular equivalent of my tie clip , which is we see parts of the machine missing –two , three , four , maybe even 20 – parts , but still fulfilling a perfectly good purpose that could be favored by evolution .
And that 's why the irreducible complexity argument falls apart .
NARRATOR : But Behe testified , it 's not just microscopic organisms that are irreducibly complex .
Evolution , he says , fails to account for the network of organs and cells that defends us from disease .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Has the theory of evolution , in particular natural selection , explained the existence of the defensive apparatus , such as the immune system ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : No .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Do you consider it a problem ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : I certainly consider it to be a problem .
But other scientists who think that Darwinian evolution simply is true do n't consider much of anything to be a problem with their theory .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
If you could highlight the second full paragraph from Darwin 's Black Box , page 138 ?
What you say is , " We can look high or we can look low in books or in journals , but the result is the same .
The scientific literature has no answers on the question of the origin of the immune system . "
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
And in the context that means that the scientific literature has no detailed testable answers to the question of how the immune system could have arisen by random mutation and natural selection .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) : May I approach , your Honor ?
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III ( Dramatization ) :
You may .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD :
What I did was to pile on the witness stand articles all having very sophisticated explanations for how the immune system evolved , and basically challenged him to respond , given the claims that he 'd made .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) : Now , Dr. Behe , these articles rebut your assertion that scientific literature has no answers on the origin of the vertebrate immune system .
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
No , they certainly do not .
My argument is that these articles have no detailed rigorous explanations for how complex biochemical systems could arise by a random mutation and natural selection .
And these articles do not address that .
NICK MATZKE :
And then he starts to say , " Well , have you read this book , Dr. Behe ? "
And he starts to pile these up on Behe 's witness stand .
Eventually , Behe was almost dwarfed by the stack of scientific literature on the evolutionary origin of the immune system .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
All these hard - working scientists publish article after article over years and years , chapters and books , full books , addressing the question of how the vertebrate immune system evolved , but none of them are satisfactory to you ?
RICHARD THOMPSON : That 's a lawyer 's trick , purely a lawyer 's trick .
Now , you know , was Michael Behe going to read every one of those books before he responded ?
You know , it was totally theatrics .
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : Mr. Rothschild , would you like your books back ?
They 're heavy .
NARRATOR : The defense case included three expert witnesses .
And on the last day of testimony , the final defense witness told the court about a creature that , by now , was familiar to everyone .
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : I am Dr. Scott A. Minnich .
I am an associate professor , at the University of Idaho , in microbiology .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) : Dr. Minnich , can you give us an example of design at the molecular level ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) :
This is a bacterial flagellum .
This is a system I work with .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III ( Dramatization ) :
We 've seen that .
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : I know .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
You 're going to see a little more of it , your Honor .
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : I kind of feel like Zsa Zsa 's fifth husband , you know ?
As the old adage goes , " You know I know what to do , but I just can't make it exciting . "
But I 'll try .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Now , you specialized your focus and research on the flagellum , is that correct ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) :
That 's correct .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
And you 've done experiments on flagellum ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : I have .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
And you 've written peer - reviewed articles on it ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : Yes .
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) : Now , Dr. Minnich , a complaint that 's often brought up–and plaintiffs ' experts have brought it up in this case –is that intelligent design is not testable .
It 's not falsifiable .
Would you agree with that claim ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) :
No , I do n't .
I have a quote from Mike Behe : " In fact , intelligent design is open to direct experimental rebuttal .
To falsify such a claim , a scientist could go into the laboratory , place a bacterial species lacking a flagellum under some selective pressure , for motility , say , grow it for 10,000 generations and see if a flagellum or any equally complex system was produced .
If that happened my claims would be neatly disproven . "
ROBERT MUISE ( Dramatization ) :
Is that an experiment that you would do ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) :
You know , I think about it .
I 'd be intrigued to do it .
I would n't expect it to work .
But that 's my bias .
STEPHEN HARVEY ( Dramatization ) :
Now you claim that intelligent design can be tested , correct ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) : Correct .
STEPHEN HARVEY ( Dramatization ) :
Intelligent design , according to you , is not tested at all , because neither you nor Dr. Behe have run the test that you , yourself , advocate for testing intelligent design , right ?
SCOTT A. MINNICH ( Dramatization ) :
Well , turn it around in terms of these major attributes of evolution .
Have they been tested ?
You see what I 'm saying , Steve ?
It 's a problem for both sides .
NARRATOR : As the legal teams battled it out in court , the clash between intelligent design and evolution was taking a toll on Dover .
Local newspaper reporter Lauri Lebo sat through every day of testimony , and the conflict began to drive a wedge between Lauri and her father .
LAURI LEBO :
He believed that God really should be in science class .
He did not believe in science , and he was all worried about me and ... because I believed in evolution .
And he said , you know , " Well , do you really believe that we came from monkeys ? "
At that point , I was pretty burned out from the trial , and I did n't really have the patience that I probably should have had with him , and I just said yeah , I mean , you know ?
" Yeah , I do believe in evolution , Dad , " you know ?
And so we 'd fight every morning .
If you believe in heaven and hell , and you believe you have to be saved , nothing else could possibly matter .
Not the First Amendment , not science , not rational debate .
All that matters is that you 're going to be rejoined with the people you love most on this Earth .
RAY MUMMERT : Teaching the traditional evolutionary Darwinian concept that man evolved from lower forms of life , that 's almost a slap in my face .
That takes the dignity away from humanity , as far as I 'm concerned .
What gives dignity to man is that every one of us are made in the image of God .
He is the creator , and he created the world with intention and with design .
It upsets me deeply that now , in our educational system , we are indoctrinating our young people to think differently about humanity .
KENNETH R. MILLER : I 've never made a secret of the fact that I'm a Roman Catholic , and a long tradition of scholarship in the Catholic Church has argued that truth is one , that science and religion should ultimately be in harmony .
But that does n't make faith a scientific proposition .
I think , as many religious people do , that faith and reason are both gifts from God .
And if God is real , then faith and reason should complement each other rather than being in conflict .
NARRATOR : Throughout the trial , Judge Jones would never tip his hand about which way he was leaning on whether intelligent design is science .
But science was not the only issue before the court .
The climax of the trial would be the judge 's ruling on a question stemming from a different line of evidence : " When they introduced intelligent design into the classroom , were members of the Dover School Board motivated by religion ? "
If so , that would amount to a violation of part of the First Amendment to the Constitution , the establishment clause , which mandates the separation of church and state .
STEPHEN HARVEY :
In order to prevail , we needed to prove either that the school board acted for the purpose of promoting religion or that its policy has the effect of promoting religion .
It 's either purpose or effect , either one .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III :
The establishment clause says that Congress cannot pass a law which promotes one religion over another .
And that trickles all the way down to any state action , and in this case , the actions of a school board .
NARRATOR : But what evidence was there that the school board was motivated by religion ?
Months before the trial , when Bertha Spahr had unpacked the boxes containing the 60 copies of Pandas given by an anonymous donor , she found a clue .
BERTHA SPAHR : I was directed by the administration to unpack the boxes , count the books , stamp and number them .
In the bottom of the box I found a catalogue .
I opened the catalogue to see what they had to say about the book in question .
And at the very top of the catalogue page ... it was listed under " Creation Science . "
This 'd certainly be a smoking gun and would be a benefit to us somewhere down the road .
NARRATOR : This information was handed off to The National Center for Science Education .
The N.C.S.E. was helping the lawyers who were arguing to keep intelligent design out of Dover High School .
Knowing Of Pandas and People would be central to the case , Nick Matzke investigated the book .
NICK MATZKE :
When the court case was filed and Pandas was adopted in the policy , it became clear that Pandas was going to be the representative of intelligent design for the purposes of this case .
And so the history of that book became important , the arguments it made became important .
And we undertook to dissect these various aspects in preparation for the case .
NARRATOR : Matzke dug into Pandas , examining it page by page and scouring the Internet to see what he could unearth about its history .
Rummaging through the N.C.S.E. archives one day , Matzke came across a creationist student newspaper from 1981 .
At the bottom of the front page , he noticed a tiny article with a headline announcing , " Unbiased Biology Textbook Planned . "
And that article mentioned that a man named Charles Thaxton , now a fellow at the Discovery Institute , was working on a book that would present " both evolution and creation . "
NICK MATZKE : The academic editor was Charles Thaxton , who was the editor of the Pandas book , so it was clear that that ad was referring to the Pandas project .
What was interesting is that it talked about the book being about " creation and evolution " instead of the later terms , " intelligent design and evolution . "
NARRATOR : If they could show Pandas started out as a creationist book , that would suggest intelligent design is simply creationism repackaged and therefore inherently religious .
Matzke emailed this information to Eric Rothschild , who immediately issued a subpoena to the publisher of Pandas for any drafts the book went through before printing .
In a few months , they received two boxes of material .
The lawyers sent them to Barbara Forrest .
A philosophy professor and author who has been tracking intelligent design for years , she was scheduled to testify in the trial .
BARBARA FORREST : Oh , my goodness , those two boxes contained about 7,000 pieces of paper .
I had to sit down with those documents and just start flipping through them , which is what I did day and night .
NARRATOR : After much digging , she hit pay dirt .
Buried in these documents were two drafts of Pandas straddling the 1987 case of Edwards versus Aguillard , in which the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to teach creationism in public school science class .
One draft was written before the case and the other revised just after .
BARBARA FORREST :
In the first 1987 draft , which is the pre-Edwards draft , the definition of creation reads this way " Creation means that various forms of life began abruptly , through the agency of an intelligent creator , with their distinctive features already intact : fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks and wings , et cetera . "
The same definition in this draft , after the Edwards decision , reads this way : " Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency , with their distinctive features already intact : fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks , et cetera . "
Same definition , just one is worded in terms of creationism , the other one worded in terms of intelligent design .
NICK MATZKE : Everyone said intelligent design is creationism re-labeled .
Never in our wildest dreams , though , did we think that this would actually be recorded in paper in a way that could be documented in a court case .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD :
And that became probably our best single piece of evidence at trial .
NARRATOR : Barbara Forrest 's testimony would make a strong case that the Dover school board was thrusting religion into the classroom .
And in comparing the Of Pandas and People drafts , Forrest discovered that the authors had apparently made their revisions in haste .
BARBARA FORREST :
In cleansing this manuscript , they failed to replace every word properly .
I found the word " creationists . "
And instead of replacing the entire word , they just kind of did this , and got " design proponents " with the " c " in front and the " ists " in the back from the original word .
NICK MATZKE :
So the correct term for this transitional form is " Cdesign proponentsists . "
And everyone now refers to this as the " missing link " between creationism and intelligent design .
You 've got the direct physical evidence there of a transitional fossil .
NARRATOR : Barbara Forrest 's testimony not only traced the creationist lineage of Pandas .
Citing a Christian magazine 's interview , Forrest let one of the intelligent design movement 's own leaders , Paul Nelson , speak for himself .
BARBARA FORREST :
The question he was asked was , " Is intelligent design just a critique of evolutionary theory or does it offer something more ?
Does it offer something that humankind needs to know ? "
This is his answer : " Easily , the biggest challenge facing the I.D. community is to develop a full - fledged theory of biological design .
We do n't have such a theory right now , and that 's a real problem .
Without a theory , it 's very hard to know where to direct your research focus .
Right now , we 've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions , such as irreducible complexity , but as yet , no general theory of biological design . "
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK :
The evidence she bought into that courtroom really exposed the hypocrisy of the intelligent design movement in a way that 's irrefutable .
You know , she used their own language , things that they had written and said , to show that they themselves knew that this is n't science .
NARRATOR : And on the stand , Michael Behe was asked how he would define science .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) : Dr. Behe , using your definition , intelligent design is a scientific theory , correct ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) : Yes .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
Under the same definition , astrology is a scientific theory , using your definition , correct ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
Using my definition , a scientific theory is a proposed explanation which focuses or points to observable physical data and logical inferences .
There are many things throughout the history of science which we now think to be incorrect , which would fit that definition .
Yes , astrology is , in fact , one , and so is the ether theory of the propagation of light , and many other , many other theories as well .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
The ether theory of light has been discarded ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
That is correct .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) :
But you are clear , under your definition , the definition that sweeps in intelligent design , astrology is also a scientific theory ?
MICHAEL BEHE ( Dramatization ) :
Yes , that 's correct .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK :
You know , when you loosen the rules around what is science and permit the supernatural , permit deities , you are really destroying what makes science so vitally important to the progress that our civilization has witnessed over the last four or five hundred years .
You 're going back before the scientific revolution .
And , you know , that 's a pretty scary thing .
NARRATOR : With the scientific revolution , the work of Galileo , Newton and others banished supernatural explanations from science .
But some think the supernatural still has its place .
STEVE FULLER :
At the very beginning of genetics , the idea of there being a hereditary factor that somehow was responsible for the traits that we have , but one could n't quite identify what the factor was , that was also initially regarded as supernatural , as well .
So , it 's not that supernaturalism has n't been part of science .
In fact , it has been .
And it 's often led to very fruitful results .
And it seems the evolutionists want to , in a way , ignore or marginalize that very important part of the history .
NARRATOR : But Barbara Forrest testified that the intelligent design movement 's goals are not entirely scientific and are spelled out in a secret Discovery Institute document that had surfaced on the Internet .
BARBARA FORREST :
Their goals are listed quite clearly in the " wedge " document .
It 's their strategy document that they drew up about nine years ago , in 1998 .
Their goal was to completely overthrow all of the effects of evolution on society , which they think are uniformly negative .
This document states that they want to completely change American culture back to what they believe is its properly religious foundation .
They want every area of life to be governed by their particular religious preferences .
And they 're very clear about that in this document .
NARRATOR : According to the wedge document , Darwin " portrayed humans not as moral and spiritual beings , but as animals , " leading people to abandon " objective moral standards . "
The document lays out an ambitious agenda to overthrow this legacy , " to see intelligent design theory as the dominant perspective in Science , " and " to see design theory permeate our religious , cultural , moral and political life . "
Though not written by Phillip Johnson , the wedge document is an outgrowth of a broader policy he conceived called the wedge strategy .
PHILLIP JOHNSON : I know it can be made to sound like something sinister and conspiratorial .
But the wedge strategy , as I have explained it , is quite simple and innocent .
When you use a wedge to split a log , you start with the sharp edge of the wedge .
My job is to be the sharp edge of the wedge , to use my academic credentials and legal abilities to get some hearing for the proposition that there really is something fundamentally wrong with the Darwinian story .
But I can't answer all the questions that arise , so we need other people to form the thick edge of the wedge to take on the questions that do require a scientific expertise .
NARRATOR : With Michael Behe and others forming the wide end of the wedge , Johnson hopes the wedge strategy will overturn what he sees as the negative effects of a century and a half of Darwin 's theory .
PHILLIP JOHNSON : The Darwinian story , when it became accepted , had a huge cultural impact , and if that story were discredited , then the cultural impact would be reversed , and there would be cultural changes in the other direction as well .
MATTHEW CHAPMAN :
There is something outrageous about such a huge body of evidence being put together , then being confirmed in all kinds of other scientific disciplines , particularly genetics , and having other people just sort of deny it for reasons that have nothing to do with truth .
And this became apparent during the trial .
And then you began to look towards the judge and think , " How is this guy going to get out of this ? "
Because here he is , he 's been a ... he is a Republican , he 's been appointed by George W. Bush , who has said that he thinks the jury is out on evolution , both theories should be taught .
And you began to think , " What is this poor guy going to do ? "
NARRATOR : Whatever the motivations of the Discovery Institute , the intelligent design movement , or the authors of the book Of Pandas and People , Judge Jones would need to focus on the motivation of the Dover Area School Board .
STEPHEN HARVEY ( Dramatization ) : Mr. Buckingham , I 'd like to show you what has been identified as Exhibit P - 145 .
You 'll need to look at the monitor .
BILL BUCKINGHAM ( NEWSCLIP ) :
The book that was presented to me for biology was laced with Darwinism from the beginning to the end .
NEWSCASTER : William Buckingham is head of the Curriculum Committee for the Dover School District .
He is also a Board Member .
He strongly believes creationism needs to be taught in the classroom .
BILL BUCKINGHAM ( NEWSCLIP ) :
My opinion that it 's okay to teach Darwin , but you have to balance it with something else , such as creationism .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : This was back in the very early days of the intelligent design thing , and do n't you know , I could not think of the words " intelligent design . "
I just could n't .
The camera 's rolling , so I say " creationism . "
In hindsight , I should have said nothing at all , but I said " creationism . "
BILL BUCKINGHAM ( Dramatization ) : I was like a deer caught in the headlights of a car .
And I misspoke , pure and simple .
I made a human mistake .
STEPHEN HARVEY ( Dramatization ) : Freudian slip , right , Mr. Buckingham ?
BILL BUCKINGHAM ( Dramatization ) : I would n't say a Freudian slip .
I would say a human mistake .
NARRATOR : And it was not Buckingham 's only mistake .
Both Buckingham and Bonsell had sworn in their depositions that they did not know who donated the 60 copies of Pandas to the high school .
But by the time Buckingham took the witness stand , a different story emerged .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : I stood up in front of our church one Sunday morning , we had to come up with , I think it was , like , $ 1,100 to buy these books .
I said , " I 'm not asking anybody for a dime .
I 'm not telling you I want anything . "
But we believe in the power of prayer in that church , and I said , " Just pray that the money comes in . "
NARRATOR : Buckingham 's prayers were answered with donations from members of the church .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : So I deposited the money in our personal checking account my wife and I have , and I wrote a check to be passed on to whoever 's going to buy the books .
It was my understanding , at that time , that a businessman in the community had agreed to take the money and buy the books and donate them to the school .
At that time I did n't know who it was .
NARRATOR : But at the trial , Buckingham admitted he had given that check to Alan Bonsell , and that the unknown businessman who bought the books had been Alan Bonsell 's father .
This contradicted statements Bill Buckingham and Alan Bonsell had originally made in their sworn depositions .
STEPHEN HARVEY : Lying under oath is a serious crime .
We impeached a president about it .
And people go to jail for it all the time .
It seemed to us that there was testimony that demonstrated clear inconsistency .
I can't see into their hearts and know , you know , the extent of the falsehood but I do know that we asked questions that should have elicited that information , and they did n't provide that information .
LAURI LEBO :
It was almost like this weird feeling that , you know when you 've watched a nature show and you know that the gazelle 's about to get it from the lion ?
You know , I remember actually thinking , " Oh , god , Judge Jones is going to kill Alan Bonsell .
I do n't ... I ca n't look . "
And then Judge Jones , his face had gotten bright red at this point , and he goes , " You tell me why you did n't say where that money came from to buy Of Pandas and People ? "
And Alan Bonsell finally , under Judge Jones 's grilling , started to get a little nervous .
And he started flapping his hands , and he started stammering , and he completely had lost this self - assured composure that he had earlier .
And finally he just said , " Well , I misspoke . "
ALAN BONSELL : Never in a million years did I ever think that we'd ... you know , I 'd be in a federal lawsuit when I was on the school board or have the school district in something like that , over a one minute statement , a one minute statement .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : We were n't asking the teachers to become priests or protest ... pastors of some sort of ... or lay ministers or anything like that , just let the kids know the theory 's there .
Let the kids do their own research and find answers for themselves .
NARRATOR : After six weeks , the trial concluded with closing arguments that were as divided as the town of Dover itself had become .
ERIC ROTHSCHILD ( Dramatization ) : " What ?
Am I supposed to tolerate a small encroachment on my First Amendment rights ?
Well , I 'm not going to .
I think this is clear what these people have done , and it outrages me . "
That 's a statement of one citizen of Dover , Fred Callahan , standing up to the wedge that has been driven into his community and his daughter 's high school by the Dover School Board 's anti-evolution , pro-intelligent - design policy .
This trial has established that intelligent design is unconstitutional because it is an inherently religious proposition , a modern form of creationism .
It is not just a product of religious people , it does not just have religious implications .
It is , in its essence , religious .
The shell game has to stop .
PATRICK T. GILLEN : In sum , your Honor , I respectfully submit that the evidence of record shows that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the primary purpose or primary effect of the reading of a four - paragraph statement on intelligent design , explaining that it's an explanation for the origins of life different from Darwin 's theory , letting the students know there are books in the library on this subject , does not , by any reasonable measure , threaten the harm which the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits .
But instead , the evidence shows that the defendants ' policy has the primary purpose and primary effect of advancing science education by making the students aware of a new scientific theory , one which may well open a fascinating prospect to a new scientific paradigm .
NARRATOR : Judge Jones said he would return a verdict promptly .
Four days after the trial ended , Dover residents rendered their own verdict on intelligent design , with a huge turnout for the school board election .
By a narrow margin the people of Dover cleaned house .
All eight of the nine seats up for election went to anti-intelligent - design candidates , including plaintiff and former Dover science teacher Bryan Rehm .
Among the candidates who got the fewest votes was Alan Bonsell .
With the judge still deliberating , Dover 's local school board election was national news and even provoked the ire of televangelist Pat Robertson .
PAT ROBERTSON ( Founder and Chairman , The Christian Broadcasting Network - Clip from the 700 Club ) :
I 'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover , if there is a disaster in your area , do n't turn to God .
You just rejected him from your city .
NARRATOR : Though Robertson had already passed judgment , Dover and the nation would have to wait another month for Judge Jones to render his verdict .
On December 20 , 2005 , Jones sent out his opinion by e-mail .
TAMMY KITZMILLER : I went to work that day .
We pretty much knew it was going to be out by noon , so I waited at work for a phone call .
WITOLD " VIC " WALCZAK :
The decision came across the computer ; I think it was 10:37 .
LAURI LEBO :
The columnist behind me ... I was reading it from the beginning , and he 's standing over my shoulder , and he yells at me , " Go to the end !
Go to the end ! "
JENNIFER MILLER : I remember Mrs. Spahr , Bertha Spahr knocking on my door and interrupting my class .
NARRATOR : The 139 - page opinion ruled that intelligent design is not science .
Finding it had been introduced for religious reasons , Judge Jones decided it was " unconstitutional to teach intelligent design " in Dover science classes .
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III : Both defendants and many of the leading proponents of intelligent design make a bedrock assumption which is utterly false .
Their presupposition is that evolutionary theory is antithetical to a belief in the existence of a supreme being and to religion in general .
To be sure , Darwin 's theory of evolution is imperfect .
However , the fact that a scientific theory cannot yet render an explanation on every point should not be used as a pretext to thrust an untestable alternative hypothesis , grounded in religion , into the science classroom or to misrepresent well - established scientific propositions .
The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the intelligent design policy .
NARRATOR : Citing what he called the " breathtaking inanity " of the school board 's decision , he found that several members had lied " to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the intelligent design policy . "
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III :
The crushing weight of the evidence indicates that the board set out to get creationism into science classrooms , and intelligent design was simply the vehicle that they utilized to do that .
NARRATOR : Jones recommended to the U.S. Attorney that he investigate bringing perjury charges against Buckingham and Bonsell for lying under oath .
And " the overwhelming evidence at trial , " he said , " established that intelligent design is a religious view , a mere re-labeling of creationism , and not a scientific theory . "
JUDGE JOHN E. JONES , III :
In an era where we 're trying to cure cancer , where we 're trying to prevent pandemics , where were trying to keep science and math education on the cutting edge in the United States , to introduce and teach bad science to ninth - grade students make s very little sense to me .
You know , garbage in garbage out .
And it does n't benefit any of us who benefit daily from scientific discoveries .
NARRATOR : The school district was permanently forbidden to teach intelligent design in its science curriculum .
The administration was ordered to pay the plaintiff 's legal fees , totaling more than a million dollars .
And the election of a new school board , opposed to intelligent design , meant no appeal of the ruling would be mounted .
In the wake of the trial , TIME Magazine named Judge Jones one of the 100 most influential people of the year , but not everyone was so pleased with the Judge 's decision .
BILL BUCKINGHAM : To put it bluntly , I think he 's a jackass .
I think he went to clown college instead of law school or else he went to law school and slept during the Constitution classes , because his decision does n't jive with the law .
I think he should be on a bench , but it ought to be in a center ring of Ringling Brothers Circus .
He ...it's disgusting .
ALAN BONSELL : It makes me feel sad .
We , as a board , were trying to make Dover the best school district it could be .
That was our goal .
At least mine was .
I was trying to ... we were trying to take it up to make it the best .
RICHARD THOMPSON : I think , first of all you , you have to say we had a fair trial .
I 'm just disturbed about the extent of his opinion , that it went way beyond what , what he should have gone into deciding matters of science .
NARRATOR : The Discovery Institute also was displeased .
Soon after the decision , the institute published a 123 - page book distancing itself from the case and criticizing the ruling as " judicial activism with a
CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va .
The members of the 2:20 tour follow their guide up the front steps of Monticello , past those iconic white pillars and into the domed building ’s aura of wonder .
The wooden floor creaks like the knees of an aged host rising from his seat to explain a few things .
The guide speaks in present tense of the home ’s most famous occupant 
Mr. Jefferson , as he is often referred to around here  while leading the tour into the family sitting room , where his daughter Martha supervised the slaves who worked as household servants .
And there it is again , the great American complication : Mr. Jefferson , who rocked civilization with passionate words about inalienable rights for all , also owned hundreds of slaves .
The guide , Liz Tidwell , who became so enthralled with Monticello that she left Texas years ago to be near it , segues to the And That ’s Not All moment .
You may have heard of a Monticello slave named Sally Hemings , she says , and of the “ great controversy ” about a relationship between Mr. Jefferson and Ms. Hemings .
Friday April 4 : arrival in London
The plane was so big and frightening , and I closed my eyes .
My family did n't want me to come to England because they never saw a plane before .
Our elders told us we can do the marathon because we have been running all over , killing a lion and herding cattle .
I sometimes run for two or three days with my cattle , and I have to protect them from lions .
We can help the village by raising money to drill for clean water , so all of us have trained hard .
Heathrow was very busy and it was difficult to walk on the floor because some of it moved .
You 're walking along and the next moment it 's whooosh !
It 's difficult to get on and off but very good when you 're on .
Saturday April 5 : a day out in Kent visiting a farm , training
I miss meat and blood very much .
Not vegetables because they are food for a woman .
There is milk here but blood is better because it gives energy .
English tea with sugar is good and we tried Coco Pops , but the nicest food is croissants .
I wanted to see your cows because they are very important to us .
But these were small .
The horses were like a big zebra with strange metal feet .
The weather here is strange .
From a window it looks warm but outside it 's very cold .
It is better when we 're running or in the shower .
We heard about showers before , in a briefing about the country .
It said be careful - when the shower is hot it is really hot , and when cold , really cold .
This is true .
Sunday April 6 : interviews with local press , tour of Cooling , Kent
Everybody in England is friendly and smiley .
This is common in Maasai culture - the one difference is they are white .
And here people depend on money , back home we do n't buy food .
People are very interested in us , always asking why we are here .
Monday April 7 : national and international press in Trafalgar Square
All journalists ask the same questions .
They ask why you have the strange shoes and shields , about blood , about lions .
In Trafalgar Square , they asked : " What do you think about the bronze lion over there ? "
But what can I say ?
It 's not a real lion .
I do n't mind because we are interesting to them but I am not here to be a show , an exhibition .
Tuesday April 8 : changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace , visit to the Houses of Parliament
Everyone took photos of us , not the soldiers and horses .
We are looking at one culture , and everyone is looking at us .
The Houses of Parliament are the best buildings in London .
They use very strong materials .
We hoped to see the Queen in London very much , but she is never there .
Wednesday April 9 : dance at the opening of the London Marathon show , visit the Barclays tower
We will dance and sing when we run the marathon .
We wo n't drink water , we eat and then go .
Maybe we 'll do the marathon in four hours , not very fast .
I do not think it will be difficult for us - our shoes are made of car tyres and they are very comfortable .
We have trained three days a week and we run for about 13 miles .
My younger brother , Nguvu , has a very good speed and I run after him .
Thursday April 10 : London Eye , carousel , horse riding in Surrey
The horses that go around were amazing and we could n't believe how fast .
We rode a real horse for the first time too .
It is amazing that people can talk to them , tell them where to go and they do it .
Friday April 11 : Tower of London
I prefer my home in Tanzania to here .
It 's a more natural life without all these buildings .
This is more western , we can live in the west but I miss the village .
Saturday April 12 : rest in Kent
I am excited to get the marathon done and get clean water to save lives .
We have a dam that we share with wild animals so every morning the children go to get water , it 's dangerous for them .
Some have lost their lives .
Next week we will drill and get clean water for the top life .
Then I would like to study community development in America so I can be a great chief to my people .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Home prices have posted another record decline , as most of the nation 's largest markets suffered double - digit drops over last year , a survey released Tuesday shows .
The S&P Case / Shiller Home Price Index , which tracks 20 of the largest housing markets , showed prices plummeting by 12.7 % in the 12 months ending February .
That 's the biggest fall since the index began tracking prices in 2000 .
Of those 20 metro areas , 17 posted their largest year - over - year declines ever .
Ten of the 20 cities posted double - digit dips .
The 10 - city Case / Shiller index is down 13.6 % year - over - year , the biggest drop since its launch in 1987 .
" There is no sign of a bottom in the numbers , " S&P spokesman David M. Blitzer , said in a prepared statement .
" Prices of single family homes continue to drop across the nation . "
" This is huge , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" Back a couple of years ago , people were saying , ' Housing prices are not like stocks ; they change slowly , ' " he said .
But the drop in home prices appears to be accelerating .
Indeed , Baker said that at the rate prices are falling , as much as $ 6 trillion in home values could be wiped out from the top of the market in June , 2006 , through the end of this year .
Prices in the Las Vegas metro area have plunged more than any other city , down 22.8 % over the 12 months through February .
Miami prices plummeted 21.7 % .
In Phoenix , they 've fallen 20.8 % .
Of the 20 cities Case / Shiller tracks , only Charlotte , N.C. showed higher prices , up 1.5 % over the 12 - month period .
A vicious cycle
Other metro areas recorded only modest price declines , including Portland , Ore. , down 2.0 % , Seattle , off 2.7 % and Dallas , 4.1 % .
In the nation 's largest city , New York , metro area prices dropped a modest 6.6 % .
The declines create a vicious cycle , according to Peter Schiff , the president of the investment firm Euro Pacific Capital .
He was sounding alarms about the housing bubble more than two years ago .
As housing price losses extend , he said , the fall - off in demand for homes will deepen .
And Schiff expects to see a national price decline of 30 % - and by as much as 50 % in the worst hit markets .
" People wanted houses as vehicles to make money , " said Schiff .
" Now that they can't make money , they do n't want the houses anymore . "
A flood of empty homes
The S&P Case / Shiller statistics come on the same day as news that foreclosures spiked 112 % in the first quarter , according to RealtyTrac , which said that more than 155,000 homes have been lost to foreclosures so far this year .
This flood of foreclosed homes onto the market is putting even more downward pressure on home prices .
On Monday , the Census Bureau reported that the number of vacant homes for sale has hit a record high .
The report shows that 2.9 % of U.S. homes -- excluding rental properties -- were vacant and up for sale in the first quarter .
That translates to about 2.28 million properties - the highest quarterly number on record since 1956 .
The number of vacant houses on the market is especially troubling , according to Pat Newport , a housing economist with Global Insight , a consulting firm .
" I 'm not surprised [ by the record price declines ] , given the inventory numbers that came out yesterday , " he said .
He called the vacancy statistic " the best measure of excess supply . "
Many of these properties are owned by very motivated sellers , builders , banks and speculators who want to sell as quickly as possible in order to avoid having to pay to maintain them .
That 's going to make these owners willing to take substantial losses just to get the homes sold .
" It means prices will have to drop a lot more , " Newport said .

Torontonians are waking up today to find themselves hijacked by a transit strike .
Subways , streetcars and buses were taken out of service at midnight after TTC workers rejected a tentative contract settlement .
But the strike could be over by Monday as the provincial government scrambles to put together back - to - work legislation that could be passed as early as Sunday .
A draft of the bill should be available today to give MPPs in all three parties time to vet it .
The Sunday passage of the law would guarantee that Monday morning commuters will not be inconvenienced .
Within minutes of the contract being rejected , the provincial labour ministry announced mediators were calling union officials and the TTC back to the bargaining table at 1 p.m. today .
The tentative deal was rejected by 65 per cent of the 9,000 members of the Amalgamated Transit Union , including operating and maintenance employees .
" We have assessed the situation and decided that we will not expose our members to the dangers of assaults from angry and irrational members of the public , " said union president Bob Kinnear .
The union has been in a legal strike position since April 1 but had promised 48 hours ' notice of a service withdrawal .
Kinnear said union members had faced increased threats from passengers , despite giving the notice .
This time , he said , they would n't be so generous .
" We have a legal responsibility to protect the safety of our members and so does the TTC . "
A visibly upset Mayor David Miller said the deal " was appropriate and fair . "
" I 'm extremely disappointed it was n't ratified and very concerned the union has n't honoured the 48 - hour notice period , " said Miller , adding the notice may have given the city enough time to renegotiate a deal and avert a strike .
The mayor said he spoke to Kinnear earlier last night and " asked on behalf of Torontonians that he honour this .
He refused .
" It 's unacceptable and irresponsible to the people of Toronto for the union to act this way . "
TTC chair Adam Giambrone , who echoed the mayor in calling the strike unacceptable on an hour 's notice , said : " This is incredibly unbelievable .
" There was a fair offer that was recommended by the union . "

Unionized transit workers were notified by electronic voice mail late yesterday evening that they were not to report for their shifts effective midnight .
The message warned that the public would be upset because it was not receiving 48 hours ' notice of a strike , but that the last vote had not been cast until 10 p.m .
At 11:23 p.m. , TTC collectors were told over their private intercom service that they would be shutting down at midnight .
A public intercom announcement was then made .
The rejected deal , which gave workers a 3 per cent increase in each year of a three - year contract , only narrowly averted a strike last weekend .
But it was no sooner ratified by transit commissioners on Wednesday , when cracks began to emerge in the union 's support for the deal .
There had been rumblings this week that powerful divisions in the union ranks could derail the ratification .
Some mechanics said they feared the job security language in the new contract would n't be enough to protect their jobs given that new bus repairs were covered under warranties , and being done outside the TTC .
There was also talk that some maintenance workers were disgruntled over not being included under the GTA clause , which ensures TTC drivers would be the best paid operators in the Toronto region as of December 2009 .
The tentative agreement offered better dental , insurance and injury benefits , including a top - up of workers ' compensation for those assaulted on the job .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Surging crude prices , which could surpass $ 200 a barrel in four years on tight supplies , could push gasoline prices to as high as $ 7 a gallon , CIBC World Markets analysts said Thursday .
Crude supplies are actually lower than some official estimates indicate , while demand is unlikely to fall anytime soon , according to a statement by analysts led by Jeff Rubin at CIBC , an investment bank .
They forecast that these tighter supplies and continued strong demand will drive oil and gasoline prices to roughly double their current levels by 2012 .
" It is increasingly clear that the outlook for oil supply signals a period of unprecedented scarcity , " said Rubin .
" Despite the recent record jump in oil prices , oil prices will continue to rise steadily over the next five years . "
“ CIBC says estimates by the International Energy Agency have overstated supplies because gains in production mostly come from natural - gas liquids . ”
The front - month crude contract slid Thursday to $ 116 a barrel , after hitting a historic high of $ 119.90 a barrel Tuesday .
Retail gas prices averaged $ 3.56 a gallon Thursday , according to AAA , a new record high .
See Futures Movers .
Some analysts , however , said crude prices could turn lower .
Standard & Poor 's predicted Thursday that crude prices could tumble to about $ 90 a barrel by the end of this year with the U.S. economy struggling in recession , though the range of that forecast is plus or minus $ 50 .
See full story .
Overstated estimates
CIBC based its prediction on an analysis of crude - production estimates by the International Energy Agency , which the investment bank says has overstated supplies because the agency counts natural - gas liquids as part of the output .
Stripping out natural - gas liquids , the global oil market is much tighter , and oil production will hardly grow , they added .
" While natural - gas liquids only account for 10 % of total supply , they account for virtually all of the increase in petroleum - liquids production since 2005 , " said Rubin in a news release .
" Stripping out natural - gas liquids , oil production has not grown for over two years , which certainly goes a long way to explaining why oil prices have doubled over that period , " he added .
The portion of natural - gas liquids in total oil production is increasing , from about 4 % in the 1970s to an estimated 10 % by 2012 , CIBC said .
Natural - gas liquids are not a viable substitute for oil and cannot be economically used as a basis for gasoline , diesel or jet fuel .
Latest data from the Energy Information Administration , the statistical arm of U.S. Energy Department , indicated domestic drilling of natural gas liquids was increasing , while domestic oil production was falling .
Natural gas liquids production averaged 2.4 million barrels a day so far this year , gaining 4 % from the same period of the last year , while crude output fell 1.9 % from a year ago to 5.1 million barrels .
More natural gas comes with oil
Beyond methane which is what the home consumers burn , natural gas at the well contains a range of readily liquefiable gases , which agencies like the IEA have traditionally included in total oil supply .
IEA , a Paris - based energy adviser to 27 developed countries , said in its April monthly report that global oil production stood at 87.3 million barrels a day in March .
While natural gas can occur on its own , much of the world 's natural gas is found together with oil .
James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics , an energy research firm , agreed that natural gas liquids found together with crude oil have been increasing , while " there is n't much growth in oil , " he said .
" The lack of oil growth has been due to the lack of investment . "
Accelerating depletion of existing oil fields and a lack of investment in new fields have resulted in a rising ratio of natural gas to oil in drilling in mature oil fields .
Some oil producers have been promising to invest more to increase production capacity .
Abdalla Salem el - Badri , secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said early this week the cartel is planning to spend $ 160 billion over the next four years to boost oil production capacity by 5 million barrels a day .
See full story .
Demand in non-OECD countries to exceed OECD
While supplies are seen tight , there is little evidence to suggest that there will be any reduction in oil demand , CIBC predicted , as demand growth outside the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development offsets slowing demand in OECD countries .
Countries such as Brazil , China and Russia have seen surging sales of automobiles , while car sales in the United States and Europe have been declining or flat .
Gasoline , diesel and other transportation fuels account for about half of the world 's oil consumption .
CIBC predicted that by 2012 , oil consumption in the rest of the world will exceed OECD .
OECD countries currently consume about 50 million barrels a day of crude , 13 million barrels a day more than non-OECD countries .
Demand from major oil producers and exporters is also seen rising .
Over the last three years , oil consumption in OPEC members has grown an average of over 5 % a year .
Combined demand from OPEC members , together with Russia and Mexico , already stood at about 13 million barrels a day , the world 's second largest after the U.S .
" With production faltering , soaring rates of domestic fuel consumption will soon cannibalize export capacity , " adding more pressure to the world energy market , said Rubin in the report .
Fuel consumption in some oil producing countries was partly boosted by extremely low prices .
Retail gasoline was only about 25 cents a gallon in Venezuela and 60 cents a gallon in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Iran .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Wall Street Journal 's top editor resigned on Tuesday , giving News Corp NWSa .
N chief Rupert Murdoch an opening to further put his stamp on the newspaper he bought four months ago .

“ I am proud to have been part of this exceptionally talented team , ” Marcus Brauchli said in a letter to staff on Tuesday .
“ But now that the ownership transition has taken place , I have come to believe the new owners should have a managing editor of their choosing . ”
Brauchli , 46 , will stay at News Corp as a consultant .
While it was not clear if Brauchli resigned of his own accord , his departure is one of a series of events at the world - renowned paper that are allowing Murdoch to redesign the business as he looks to expand his media empire .
On Tuesday , Murdoch was close to an agreement with Tribune Co to buy the daily newspaper Newsday for $ 580 million and run it as a joint venture with the New York Post , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters .
Murdoch also has made several changes to the makeup of The Wall Street Journal , including giving political and general news more prominent placement in the paper as he remakes it into a direct competitor of The New York Times NYT.N .
Brauchli was named to the top editorial position at the paper a year ago , but his role was expected to be short - lived after Murdoch bought parent company Dow Jones & Co in December .
Brauchli ’s announcement came after the 20 - year veteran of The Wall Street Journal met with a committee designed to protect editorial integrity at the newspaper .
The committee was created as a condition of News Corp ’s $ 5.6 billion purchase of Dow Jones .
The committee said in a statement late on Tuesday that it had been told earlier in the week about Brauchli ’s decision to resign .
“ I am pleased he has accepted this new role in News Corporation and believe his experience will be a great asset , especially in Asia , a region where we see significant growth potential and where he has particular expertise , ” Murdoch said in a statement .
Brauchli will advise the newspaper on the possibility of a business news channel for News Corp ’s STAR - TV in Asia , among other things , according to the statement .
He previously worked as a foreign correspondent for the paper , based in places such as Hong Kong , Shanghai , Tokyo and Stockholm .
He also served as deputy managing editor , global news editor and national editor .
EDITORIAL INTEGRITY
Time magazine first reported Brauchli ’s imminent resignation on its Web site late on Monday .
The newspaper ’s editorial integrity committee , charged with approving the hiring and firing of top editors , met on Tuesday .
A resignation as opposed to a firing would not require committee approval .
“ I do n’t think anybody when this all began doubted that the man who owns the place makes the decisions , and regardless of what kind of side agreements you might have , ” said independent newspaper analyst John Morton .
Committee members contacted by Reuters either declined to comment or did not return calls seeking comment .
Dow Jones said it was searching for a successor to Brauchli .
Media consultant and Buzzmachine.com blogger Jeff Jarvis said Murdoch likely would not choose a replacement who would be rejected by the committee .
“ The check and balance on Murdoch is money , ” Jarvis said .
“ He ’s not going to ruin that franchise .
It would be foolish . ”
Since News Corp took over , Murdoch has changed the newspaper ’s format , expanding commentary , sports and lifestyle stories in addition to political and general news stories .
He installed former Times of London editor Robert Thomson as publisher , a job that some current and former employees said obviated Brauchli ’s position .
“ The writing was on the wall nine months ago , ” one staffer said , referring to Thomson ’s appointment .
Still , his leaving is unsettling for some staff .
“ Everyone loves Marcus and everyone is hypersensitive to Rupert encroaching on us , ” a second staffer said .
Brauchli said News Corp management “ scrupulously has avoided imposing any political or business viewpoints ” on the paper ’s coverage and has enforced the code of conduct .
“ I am confident that our journalistic integrity remains intact and that News Corp is committed to a Journal that is vibrant , vital and preeminent in American journalism , ” his letter to the newspaper ’s staff said .
News Corp shares fell 50 cents to close at $ 17.96 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Huckabee 's wife takes a breather at a Vegas fight , rests at Hooters

What happens in Vegas does n't always stay in Vegas - especially if you 're the wife of a presidential candidate .
Just ask Janet Huckabee , who attended a middleweight prize fight this past weekend in Las Vegas - where she stayed at the Hooters Casino Hotel .
That eye - opening combination - a title bout in Sin City , which celebrates gambling , drinking and all things wild , along with a hospitality chain favoring buxom waitresses in low - cut garb - could potentially shock the armies of evangelical conservative Christians who have made her husband , the former governor of Arkansas , the only remaining GOP opponent to party front - runner John McCain .
But Janet Huckabee , whose husband is also a former Baptist minister , said in a telephone interview Wednesday that her recent brief excursion to root for boxer Jermain Taylor , a longtime friend and fellow Arkansan - and her stay at a hotel that she said was n't exactly her first choice - was supposed to be a rare respite from the often - brutal presidential campaign trail .
" It 's a grueling schedule .
... I had been in Wisconsin and flew to Michigan , and Friday and Saturday I spoke 14 times before the fight , " said Janet Huckabee , who called a Chronicle reporter while traveling with her husband in Dallas in response to questions about the trip .
" There 's little time for anything other than campaigning . "
She has made no secret of the family 's support for Taylor , the middleweight boxing champ known as the " pride of Arkansas , " who had a title bout against Kelly Pavlik in Vegas over the weekend .
But she said she never planned on staying at Hooters for the hot - ticket fight , which also drew such celebrities as Jack Nicholson , Michael Jordan , Eddie Murphy and Sylvester Stallone .
" I had a room at the MGM Grand , " she said , but canceled it when she believed she would n't be able to make the fight .
Plans changed , and " a friend had two rooms ... it was the only thing , quite frankly , that was available because the fights were in town . "
In a highly charged 2008 presidential campaign , some political observers say Janet Huckabee 's news - making extracurricular activities are just the latest in a string of events that dramatize , as GOP strategist Karen Hanretty puts it , that " the larger story line in this campaign is candidate 's spouses as celebrities - whether it 's Jerri Thompson , Elizabeth Edwards , Cindy McCain or Michelle Obama . "
" This is the first election where we 've seen the spouse ( covered ) as a celebrity ... because for good or ill , spouses are a reflection of the candidate , " Hanretty said .
Hanretty , a past spokeswoman for the campaign of former GOP candidate Fred Thompson , said that in Janet Huckabee 's case , the Hooters stay may be problematic with conservative Christian voters who support her husband in droves - but so may the perceived political signal being sent by the couple .
The week before GOP primaries in Wisconsin and Washington , " he's in the Cayman Islands , giving a speech - and she 's at a pro boxing match in Vegas ? " said a flabbergasted Hanretty .
" It demonstrates that Mike and Janet are n't serious about moving into the White House . ...
This is not a couple serious about leading the nation . "
But Huckabee - who supporters say often provides a feisty and refreshingly human contrast to other more scripted candidate wives - has n't been the only political spouse to take her turn in spotlight recently .
Michelle Obama 's comment that " for the first time in my adult life , I am really proud of my country " because of her husband 's candidacy has sparked heated response and commentary on conservative Web sites .
GOP front - runner John McCain 's wife , Cindy - who has been the focus of fashionistas ' public commentary for her carefully coifed hair and perfect makeup - made news by noting that she is , indeed , " proud of my country . "
And former President Bill Clinton 's penchant for making news and getting heated in appearances for his wife , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , has also heated up headlines .
Don Solem , a longtime San Francisco Democratic political consultant , says political spouses are being more closely watched and reported on because " they reinforce character . "
" That 's their No. 1 role , to say 'X has family values , he sees a brighter future , he has character with a capital C , " he said .
" Aside from being interesting or articulate ... that 's their job . " '
In matters that directly involve politics , like Michelle Obama 's comments , Solem said the main danger is that " a series of small mistakes can be exaggerated and get mileage . "
But he said that if the Obama campaign is smart - and it has shown that it is - " she wo n't say that again , probably , or she will expand on it " to soften the comments .
Voters " do n't vote for a candidate - Clinton aside - because a spouse adds a great deal , " he said .
Still , the problem is that even trivial mistakes , like that of Janet Huckabee , can get people talking .
" You go : ' What were they thinking ? '
It is what makes gossip and what makes afternoon and evening TV work , " he said .
" But I do n't think it means a vote in a million . "
Indeed , Janet Huckabee - who happily has n't stuck to the frozen - smile spouse 's script - said this week that the attention given to her personal statements and activities can sometimes seem " ridiculous . "
But she also said that reporters who ask questions about presidential candidates and their spouses ' doings are " not out of line at all .
That 's part of it , and anybody who goes into it knows that . "
She does bristle , however , at the suggestion that Team Huckabee 's noncampaign activities suggest they are n't serious about taking the White House .
" It 's totally opposite , " she said .
Her husband , giving a speech in Grand Cayman , " kept his word " to a commitment he had made long before .
" He 's the only candidate that 's not paid by the taxpayers ; everybody else is living off the taxpayers right now , " she said .
And she said that voters can consider stories about more personal issues , but they should know that " we have sacrificed a whole lot to do this .
I have taken a leave of absence from my job " at the American Red Cross .
... " We 're out there giving it at least as much as anybody else running . "
She also firmly says she does n't regret her friendship with folks like Jermain Taylor and his wife , Erica , who are " good friends - and I try to support my friends in any way I can . "
And her presence at a prize fight was more than that , she said : Because Arkansas lacks a professional basketball and football team , state residents see Taylor as " the pro team , " she said .
" I was the first lady for 10 1 / 2 years , and I supported him the whole time .
...
He appreciated it very much that I came . "
Indeed , the candidate 's wife was seen on YouTube last week sporting a " Team Huckabee for Team Taylor " T - shirt and huge red boxing gloves rooting for the young boxer " on behalf of all Arkansas . "
Huckabee 's effort to cheer Taylor apparently did n't bring him much luck this time around ; the boxer lost the weekend fight by unanimous decision .
But Huckabee suggests that , when it comes to the campaign trail - and the often harsh spotlight on candidates and their spouses - maybe the boxing ring is n't so different anyway .
" Something my husband always says , " she said , " is that it 's not the dog in the fight - but the fight in the dog . "
The full extent of government anxiety about the state of British - Israel relations can be exposed for the first time today in a secret document seen by the Guardian .
The document reveals how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) successfully fought to keep secret any mention of Israel contained on the first draft of the controversial , now discredited Iraq weapons dossier .
At the heart of it was nervousness at the top of government about any mention of Israel 's nuclear arsenal in an official paper accusing Iraq of flouting the UN 's authority on weapons of mass destruction .
The dossier was made public this week , but the FCO succeeded before a tribunal in having the handwritten mention of Israel kept secret .
The FCO never argued that the information would damage national security .
The Guardian has seen the full text and a witness statement from a senior FCO official , who argued behind closed doors that any public mention of the candid reference would seriously damage UK / Israeli relations .
In the statement , he reveals that in the past five years there have been 10 substantial incidents and 20 more minor ones relating to Israeli concerns about attitudes to their government within Whitehall .
The Information Tribunal , which adjudicates on disputes involving the Freedom of Information Act , agreed to remove the single reference to Israel when it ordered the release of the draft of the Iraqi weapons dossier written by John Williams , the FCO 's chief information officer at the time .
Along with unfavourable references to the US and Japan , the reference to Israel was written in the margin by someone commenting on the opening paragraph of the Williams draft .
It was written against the claim that " no other country [ apart from Iraq ] has flouted the United Nations ' authority so brazenly in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction " .
In statement to the tribunal , Neil Wigan , head of the FCO 's Arab , Israel and North Africa Group , said he did not know who had referred to Israel in the margin .
He went on : " I interpret this note to indicate that the person who wrote it believes that Israel has flouted the United Nations ' authority in a manner similar to that of the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein . "
Its disclosure would seriously damage the UK 's relations with Israel , Wigan said .
The comparison with Saddam and the " implied accusation of a breach of the UN's authority by Israel are potentially very serious " .
It was " inevitable " that relations between the UK and Israel would suffer if the marginal note were allowed to enter the public domain , he added .
Wigan observed : " Unfortunately , there is perception already in Israel that parts of the FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] are prejudiced against the country " .
The note on the Williams draft dossier " would therefore confirm this pre-existing suspicion and would increase the damage " .
Writing in October last year , he noted that " criticism of Israel received a huge amount of media coverage " .
The margin comment mentioning Israel would thus be given a " high profile " .
Harming relations with Israel would undermine the FCO 's ability to prevent and resolve conflict " through a strong international system " .
In addition , there was " an important national interest in relation to counter - terrorism " , Wigan said .
The FCO insisted on the removal of the reference to Israel after it lost a long battle to suppress the draft dossier , which was drawn up in early September 2002 .
It originally argued that the name of the author needed to be protected .
It then said the contents of the draft dossier should be suppressed to protect the need for officials to give frank advice .
The Williams document was finally released by the FCO last week , three years after it was first requested by Chris Ames , an independent researcher , who pursued his campaign in the New Statesman magazine .
Richard Thomas , the Information Commissioner , said last year that it was in the public interest that the document should be released in its entirety .
The FO appealed against his ruling and took it to the Information Tribunal .
The FCO had no objections to references to other countries in the margin of the Williams document .
Alongside the claim that no other country apart from Iraq had twice launched wars of aggression against neighbours , the unknown FCO official writes : " Germany ? " and " US : Cuba , Guatemala , Mexico " .
Against a reference to the use of chemical weapons , the official has written : " Japan in China ? "
Claims in the Williams draft are similar to those in the final government Iraqi weapons dossier published in late September 2002 .
The Information Tribunal ordered the release of the draft , without reference to Israel , observing that it may have played a bigger role in influencing the final dossier than previously supposed .
The government tried to distance itself from the Williams draft .
 Only an emergency can justify repression . 
 Justice Louis D. Brandeis
The scope of private property rights in the United States has been greatly reduced during the 20th century .
Much of the reduction occurred episodically , as governmental officials took control of economic affairs during national emergencies mainly wars , depressions , and actual or threatened strikes in critical industries .
Derogations from private rights that occurred during national emergencies often remained after the crises had passed .
A ratchet took hold .
People adjusted first their actions , then their thinking , to accommodate themselves to emergency governmental controls .
Later , lacking the previous degree of public support , private property rights failed to regain their pre-crisis scope .
Emergency restrictions of private property rights are by no means of concern only to historians of the growth of governmental power .
Today , emergency restrictions limit many private rights , and many more sweeping restrictions could be lawfully imposed at the Presidents discretion .
The possibility is real .
Like several presidents before him , Ronald Reagan has dipped repeatedly into the governments reservoir of emergency economic powers .
The potential exists for the greatly expanded use and abuse of such powers .
Presuppositions
Rulers prefer more power to less , but in a liberal democracy the rulers are constrained by institutions that sustain private rights .
1 Specifically , private property rights place the power of resource allocation in the hands of private citizens , thereby limiting the capacity of governmental officials to shape the economy .
Governmental officials have interests of their own , which are not necessarily representative of or even in harmony with the interests of people outside government .
Therefore , the rulers and the ruled normally struggle in various ways to determine who will control the use of resources .
The greater the scope of private property rights , the more limited is the capacity of the rulers to achieve the ends they prefer at the expense of those preferred by the citizenry .
But citizens rely on the government for certain essential services , especially for the maintenance of social order and the protection of life and property ; this dependence episodically creates opportunities for governments to take over previously private rights .
If national emergencies did not just happen from time to time , governmental officials would be tempted to create them .
In a genuine emergency , citizens are exceptionally willing to surrender their rights to governmental officials who offer plausible promises that they will restore social order , national security , or economic prosperity by wielding extraordinary powers .
War , as Randolph Bourne aptly expressed it , is  the health of the state . 
Business depressions also promote robust government , as do nationwide strikes in strategic industries , especially those involving essential means of transportation or communication .
Under modern ideological conditions that is , if people insist that governments do something  to rectify perceived socio-economic problemsnational emergencies invariably witness a transfer of economic rights from private citizens to governmental officials .
For several reasons , rights taken over by governmental officials during an emergency are unlikely to revert fully to their previous holders when normal times return .
First , during the emergency the government learns how to operate its command - and - control system more successfully ; that is , how to get necessary information , how to resolve competing claims on resources , and how to placate and respond to the complaints of politically influential aggrieved parties .
Second , the imposition of a less - than - comprehensive system of controls for example , regulating the economy but not the exercise of religious or political rights discredits the conservative all - or - nothing warnings that normally inhibit governmental takeovers of private economic rights by representing them as steps toward totalitarianism .
Third , many people discover , not only in the governments bureaus but in the more regulated private sector , that the controlled economy offers its own characteristic avenues to personal success .
Those who travel happily along these avenues naturally come to regard the entire system in which they thrive as essentially desirable .
Some who adapt only out of necessity are eventually won over .
Of course , during the emergency the government does all it can to justify its exercise of new powers , trumpeting the necessity and virtues of its controls , belittling the attendant costs and inequities , and defaming those who criticize its policies .
Such propaganda is especially likely to hit its targets during a crisis , when the dogs of patriotism howl at their loudest and citizens rally more closely round the flag .
Opponents of the governments emergency measures can be stigmatized as  slackers  or draft - dodgers  or worse ; in extreme cases , they may be imprisoned , deported , or deprived of normal civil liberties .
A great emergency , therefore , produces a ratchet :
At an early stage the government , responding to an urgent and widespread insistence that it do something ,  takes over rights previously held by private citizens ; when the crisis wanes , public attitudes the dominant ideology , some would say have been so altered by the experience of governmental controls and the pervasive adaptations of behavior and thinking to those controls that public support for the recovery of the private rights is insufficient to produce their full restoration .
While the hard residues of crisis - spawned laws , administrative agencies , and constitutional pronouncements are important , ultimately the most significant consequence of the emergency experience is the ideological change it fosters .
As William Graham Sumner ( 1934 , p. 473 ) wrote , it is not possible to experiment with a society and just drop the experiment whenever we choose .
The experiment enters into the life of the society and never can be got out again . 
How Emergencies Eroded Private Rights Historically
At the turn of the 20th century , Americans enjoyed a wide scope of private property rights .
2
The prevailing ideology of both elites and masses greatly emphasized economic liberty .
As James Bryce ( 1895 , pp. 53637 ) observed , the typical American regarded the right to the enjoyment of what he has earned as primordial and sacred . 
Most American believed that all governmental authorities ought to be strictly limited  and  the less of government the better . 
Federal officials and judges typically acted in conformity with the belief that government ought to be confined to protective functions , refraining from redistributionist policies and leaving citizens free to conduct their economic affairs as they pleased .
There were exceptions , of course , but they only highlight how limited the government , especially the federal government , was as a rule .
In Allgeyer v. Louisiana ( 165 U.S. 578 [ 1897 ] at 589 ) , the Supreme Court articulated the prevailing sentiment , declaring that the Constitution protects
not only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical restraint of his person . . . but . . . the right of the citizen to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties ; to be free to use them in all lawful ways ; to live and work where he will ; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling ; to pursue any livelihood or avocation , and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be proper , necessary , and essential to his carrying out [ these purposes ] to a successful conclusion .
When citizens were guaranteed such extensive freedom of contract , governments had little ability to fix prices and wages , restrict hours or other conditions of employment , compel collective bargaining , regulate the locations of enterprises , or set aside the terms of private agreements ; nor did governments have much justification for increasing the burden of taxation .
Although governments , especially at the state and local levels , increased their economic functions somewhat during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and , more importantly , the dominant ideology gradually became more sympathetic to more - than - minimal government , the economy remained essentially a market system as late as 1914 .
In a violent break with American tradition , private property rights were suppressed on a wide scale during World War I .
In 1916 , in anticipation of a future state of war , Congress granted the President emergency powers to seize materials , plants , and transport systems .
During the year and a half of official U.S. belligerency that followed , the federal government took over the railroad , ocean shipping , telephone , and telegraph industries ; suspended the gold standard and controlled all international exchanges of goods and financial assets ; commandeered hundreds of manufacturing plants ; entered into massive economic enterprises on its own account in such varied departments as shipbuilding , wheat and sugar trading , and building construction ; lent huge sums to businesses directly or indirectly ; regulated the private issuance of securities ; established official priorities for the use of transport facilities , food , fuel , and many other goods ; fixed the prices of dozens of important commodities ; intervened in hundreds of labor disputes ; and conscripted nearly three million men into the army .
In short , the government extensively attenuated or destroyed private rights , creating what some contemporaries called war socialism .
The Supreme Court did nothing to restrain the governments suppression of private rights ; evidently , constitutional war powers covered all cases .
Although most private rights were restored after the war , not all were .
Tax rates remained higher , the tax structure was more  progressive ,  and the income tax became a much more important source of federal revenues relative to traditional consumption taxes .
The Transportation
Act of 1920 , by which the government relinquished its emergency control of the railroads , came close to nationalizing them ; government remained in the ocean - shipping business ; and the War Finance Corporation episodically participated in the credit markets until 1925 .
Most significantly , the war left a legacy of ideological change .
As Bernard Baruch ( 1960 , p. 72 ) observed , the war experience convinced many prominent businessmen and others that government direction of the economy need not be inefficient or undemocratic , and suggested that in time of danger it was imperative . 
The next time of danger was occasioned not by war but by the Great Depression , a national catastrophe that Justice Brandeis called an emergency more serious than war .
After three years of widespread bankruptcies , foreclosures , and bank failures , and of rapidly falling income and massively rising unemployment , it seemed that the market economy would never recover .
All classes of Americans increasingly clamored for relief .
Recalling how government had wielded sweeping emergency powers to manage the economy during the war , many politically influential people believed that similar governmental controls could be used effectively to fight the depression .
In 1933 , the federal government launched a fleet of emergency measures : huge work - relief projects ; a program to cartelize virutally all industries ; abandonment of the gold standard and prohibition of private domestic monetary transactions in gold ; price and production controls in agriculture ; detailed regulation of securities markets ; extensive federal intrusion into labor markets and union - management relations ; federal production and sale of electrical power ; and , before the New Deal had spent itself in 1938 , a multitude of federal insurance and credit programs , Social Security pensions and welfare payments , the minimum wage , national unemployment insurance , and many other forms of governmental intervention in the market economy .
For a while the Supreme Court resisted .
The National Industrial Recovery Act and the first Agricultural Adjustment Act , centerpieces of the early New Deal , were declared unconstitutional .
But the Court was of two minds .
In 1934 , in Nebbia v. New York , it upheld an emergency - inspired state law fixing milk prices and imposing criminal sanctions on those who transacted at lower prices .
The Court ruled ( 291 U.S. 502 [ 1934 ] at 523 ) that neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute . 
In 1935 , in the Norman case , sustaining the governments crisis - induced abrogation of the gold standard , the Court put private contractual rights in a clearly inferior position ( 294 U.S. 240 [ 1935 ] at 30910 ) :  There is no constitutional ground for denying to the Congress the power expressly to prohibit and invalidate contracts although previously made , and valid when made , when they interfere with the carrying out of the [ monetary ] policy it is free to adopt . 
After vacillating during 1934 36 , sometimes sustaining and sometimes striking down the governments unprecedented derogations from private property rights , the Court caved in completely in 1937 .
Since then it has maintained that virtually any state or federal governmental interference with private property rights is constitutional .
Only a law that is manifestly arbitrary and lacking any imaginable relation to a public purpose will be disallowed .
In a bloodless revolution , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned constitutional protections of private property rights that had existed for 150 years .
3
The justices were only registering the ideological transformation going on around them .
The Great Depression deeply discredited longstanding beliefs in individualism , private property rights , free markets , and limited government .
The New Deal gave desperate people money , jobs , and protection from market competition , for which they were grateful .
More importantly , it taught many people , including a new generation of Americans who had no personal experience with anything else , to value collectivist policies and governmental promises of economic security .
Drawing on the collectivist programs and sentiments of World War I and the New Deal , the federal government during World War II built an unprecedented apparatus of economic control .
Clinton L. Rossiter ( 1948 , p. 279 ) concluded :  Of all the time - honored Anglo - Saxon liberties , the freedom of contract took the worst beating in the war . 
Governmental authorities drafted 10 million men for service in the armed forces ; allocated strategic materials ; established priorities for the use of transport , food , fuel , and other goods ; commandeered plants and sometimes whole industries ; fixed prices and rents ; rationed many consumer goods ; and built and operated entire new industries .
In short , the free market virtually disappeared during 194245 .
While private property rights were being suppressed , the Supreme Court only approved .
As Justice Douglas wrote in Bowles v. Willingham ( 321 U.S. 503 [ 1944 ] at 521 ) , a case involving rent controls ,  where Congress has provided for judicial review after the regulations or orders have been made effective it has done all that due process under the war emergency requires .
But Justice Roberts , dissenting in a related case , Yakus v. United States ( 321 U.S. 414 [ 1944 ] at 458 ) , correctly described the judicial review as a solemn farce .
The government simply did as it pleased , showing no regard for private property rights .
As Rossiter ( 1976 , p. 91 ) commented ,  the Court , too , likes to win wars . 
Even when the government herded some 110,000 persons of Japanese descent , two - thirds of them U.S. citizens , into concentration camps , the Court stood aside , declaring the peremptory imprisonment of these innocent persons in the crisis of war to be not wholly beyond the limits of the Constitution  ( Hirabayashi v. United States , 320 U.S. 81 [ 1943 ] at 101 ) .
Where , one wonders , are the constitutional limits on governmental invasion of private rights during emergencies ?
During World War II , not even the most elementary private rights could withstand the governments determination to exercise emergency powers .
Enduring legacies of the war include the employment Act of 1946 , which committed the federal government to a policy of ongoing macroeconomic management ; the Taft - Hartley Act of 1947 , which preserved many of the federal powers first stipulated in the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943 ; and the Selective Service Act of 1948 , which extended into peacetime the military conscription by which the government had coercively obtained the bulk of its military manpower at below - market rates during the war .
The emergency rationale held sway .
As a congressman ( quoted by Gillam 1968 , p. 509 ) said during the debate on the peacetime draft bill ,  What we propose to do today is , under ordinary conditions , contrary to our traditions .
. . .
We are not living in an ordinary time .
. . .
We are living in a world of fear , of chaos , of uncertainty .
. . . 
Most significantly , as Calvin B. Hoover ( 1959 , p. 212 ) observed , the war experience  conditioned [ businessmen ] to accept a degree of governmental intervention and control after the war which they had deeply resented prior to it .
Even under the pro-business Eisenhower administration , no serious attempt was made to overthrow the economic controls inherited from past emergencies .
Having so greatly adjusted their actions and their thinking to the emergency suppression of private property rights , most Americans seemed to fear a return to a free market regime more than they feared the denial of private rights , actual and potential , under the postwar politico - economic arrangements .
A Case in Point : The Labor Market
The inverse relation of national emergency and private property rights seems clear enough .
Can a closer inspection of the historical record sustain the same conclusion ?
We think so .
Elsewhere we have described and analyzed in much greater detail the economic policies adopted during the world wars and the Great Depression ( see Higgs 1987 , chaps .
79 ) , and we have documented the emergency ratchet with regard to private rights in international trade , a glaringly clear case ( see Twight 1985 ) .
Here we shall extend our examination of the historical record by looking at the emergency ratchet as it pertains to private rights in labor markets .
Before World War I , private transactors possessed extensive freedom of contract in labor markets .
Today , such rights are greatly attenuated by , inter alia , many federal restrictions : minimum wage law , wage - and - hour laws , compulsory collective bargaining laws , retirement and pension laws , anti-discrimination laws , and others .
How did the American people get from there to here ?
So far as federal restrictions are concerned ( state and local restrictions have a much longer and more complicated history ) , the first significant step was taken in 1916 with the passage of the Adamson Act .
The railroad - operating brotherhoods had demanded a reduction of the standard working day from 10 to 8 hours without any reduction in daily pay .
Caught between the unions  impending increase of railroad labor costs and the Interstate Commerce Commissions ( ICCs ) stubborn restraint of railroad rates and fares , the employers refused to accept the proposal ; the unions scheduled a nationwide strike .
The prospect of such a calamitous work stoppage terrified President Wilson , who decided to intervene .
Failing to bring the two sides into agreement , Wilson induced Congress , which was controlled by his fellow Democrats , to enact legislation establishing the eight - hour day with daily pay unchanged , that is , mandating a 25 percent increase in the wage rates of operating employees of interstate railroad companies ( 39 Stat. 721 , 3 , 5 Sept. 1916 ) .
With this legislative action , as Jonathan R. T. Hughes ( 1977 , pp. 13839 ) wrote , the nation began a long and irregular movement away from the ideal of the wage bargain as a sacred bond between the employer and the individual employee in particular , a movement away from federal support for private rights of contract in the labor market .
The emergency of the threatened railroad strike in the winter of 1916  17 merged immediately into the emergency of economic mobilization after the American declaration of war the following April .
Unsatisfied with their recently mandated wage increase , the railroad - operating brotherhoods renewed their threat to strike toward the end of 1917 .
The railroad companies , still caught between the unions wage pressure and the ICCs rate restraint ( with threats of antitrust prosecution further complicating the situation and impeding cooperation among the companies ) struggled ever more unsatisfactorily to meet the extraordinary demands for service occasioned by the governments massive , ill - coordinated procurement program .
Traffic slowed and facilities grew increasingly snarled .
Knowing no other way to break the impasse , which was almost entirely of the governments own creation , President Wilson took over the railroad industry under the powers granted to him by the Army Appropriations Act of 1916 .
 It was done ,  wrote Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo ( 1931 , p. 458 ) , only as an imperative war measure . 
McAdoo , who became the Director - General of the Railroad Administration , soon ordered substantial increases of railroad wage rates .
The Railroad Administrations resulting losses were conveniently covered by drawing on the U.S. Treasury .
Beyond the railroad industry , the government faced the same threat that strikes might cripple its mobilization of resources for war purposes .
During 1917 , there were an unprecedented 4,450 work stoppages ( U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975 , pp. 17879 ) .
To allay the threat , the Wilson administration adopted a policy of supporting union organization and compulsory collective bargaining , the eight - hour day , and union work rules .
If necessary , employers could be indemnified by cost - plus contracts with governmental procurement agencies .
In 1918 , a National War Labor Board was created to intervene in labor - management bargaining and bring the collective agreements into forms acceptable to the government .
In extreme cases , the President and his lieutenants threatened to draft recalcitrant unionists or to commandeer plants owned by recalcitrant employers .
Legacies of the governments wartime labor policies included the Railroad Labor Board , an agency created by the Transportation Act of 1920 , and the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and 1934 .
When the Great Depression of the early 1930s prompted the Roosevelt administration to devise an emergency industrial relief program , the labor provisions of the Wilsonian war policy reappeared a sop to unionists to keep them from opposing the cartels being established for producers .
Along with clearly specified collective bargaining rights , the labor provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act ( 48 Stat. at 19899 ) provided  that employers shall comply with the maximum hours of labor , minimum rates of pay , and other conditions of employment , approved or prescribed by the President . 
So much for freedom of contract in the labor market .
The Supreme Court invalidated the NIRA early in 1935 , but Senator Robert Wagner and his congressional colleagues quickly enacted the National Labor Relations
Act to preserve governmental support for compulsory collective bargaining .
Three years later the Fair Labor Standards
Act established minimum - wage and wage - and - hour provisions similar to those lost when the NIRA was struck down .
4
The next great emergency , World War II , brought much greater attenuation of private rights in the labor market .
Ten million men were drafted into the armed forces .
A War Manpower Commission made various attempts to impede labor mobility , reallocate workers , and control hiring practices ; at one point it issued a work - or - fight  order , threatening men in nonessential jobs with conscription .
The National War Labor Board intervened extensively in collective bargaining negotiations , generally supporting union demands for representation and backing up its authority with dozens of seizures , some involving entire industries ( coal mining and , no surprise , railroads ) .
Irritated by strikes in strategic industries and most of all by John L. Lewiss plain defiance of the President , Congress enacted the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943 .
This law , inter alia , expanded the Presidents power to seize production facilities .
( The Taft - Hartley Act of 1947 drew heavily on the provisions of the wartime labor law . )
Proposals for compulsory universal service received serious consideration during 1943  45 ( FDR himself favored such a system ) but Congress never enacted any of the proposed bills .
Military conscription , on the other hand , became firmly entrenched .
After the war , temporary , emergency  extensions of the draft followed in succession .
Not until the early 1970s did the government abandon its use of coercion to secure the manpower deemed necessary for national defense .
Todays registration requirement makes clear , however , that the government stands ready to reinstate the military draft whenever political authorities deem it expedient .
Young men no longer hold a constitutionally guaranteed right of ownership over their bodies , their labor power , or their lives .
It would not be difficult to relate the additional federal attenuation of private labor - market rights during 1964  74 ( Civil Rights Act , Age Discrimination in Employment Act , Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 , Occupational Safety and Health Act , Equal Employment Opportunity Act , Employee Retirement Income Security Act ) to the quasi-emergency conditions that prevailed during the Great Society - Vietnam War era , a time of race riots , antiwar protests , massive public demonstrations , and political assassinations .
But enough has already been shown to establish a clear historical link between national emergency and the attenuation of private property rights in the labor market .
The landmark federal intrusions in this area occurred when governmental officials undertook to do something  to deal with conditions widely regarded as national emergencies great strikes , war mobilization , deep depression .
And doing something almost always meant transferring rights from private citizens to governmental officials .
How Emergency Powers Continue to Be Exercised
Until the late 1970s , unrevoked presidential declarations of national emergency , left over from long - past crises , continued to sustain extraordinary governmental authority .
As late as 1976 the national emergencies declared by Roosevelt in 1933 and by Truman in 1950 had not been terminated .
After the end of the Korean War , even though economic and political conditions in the United States were often as normal as possible in an age of Cold War and nuclear weapons , the government continued to use a fictitious emergency rationale to augment its statutory power and thereby to diminish the scope of private property rights .
Few people worried about the emergency - spawned powers until the Nixon years .
President Nixon himself added to the perpetual official crisis by declaring national emergencies in order to deal with the postal workers  strike in 1970 and the balance - of - payments crisis in 1971 .
These declarations remained unrevoked when their precipitating crises passed .
Only when the Watergate scandal and Nixons impoundment of congressionally authorized funds engendered widespread fear of an imperial presidency did Congress begin to investigate seriously the web of governmental authority spun on the pillars of unrevoked executive declarations of national emergency .
In 1973 , the Senate created a Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency ( subsequently redesignated the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers ) to investigate the matter and to propose reforms .
Ascertaining the continued existence of four presidential declarations of national emergency , the Special Committee ( U.S. Senate 1973 , p. iii ) reported :
These proclamations give force to 470 provisions of Federal law .
. . . taken together , [ they ] confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional processes .
Under the powers delegated by these statutes , the President may : seize property ; organize and control the means of production ; seize commodities ; assign military forces abroad ; institute martial law ; seize and control all transportation and communications ; regulate the operation of private enterprise ; restrict travel ; and , in a plethora of particular ways , control the lives of all American citizens .
Yet , there was not statutory definition of what constitutes an emergency ; as with the fabled emperors clothes , the assertion could belie the reality .
As its investigation proceeded , the committee repeatedly voiced concern about both the longevity of the claimed emergencies and the use of a single national emergency decree to effectuate widely scattered emergency powers wholly unrelated to the emergency at hand .
The ultimate outgrowth of the committees work was the enactment of two significant laws : the National Emergencies Act ( NEA ) of 1976 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( IEEPA ) of 1977 .
5
The NEA represented an attempt to reassert congressional control over burgeoning national emergency authority .
Terminating all existing national emergencies two years after its enactment , it permits future presidential declarations of national emergency only under strict procedures guaranteeing periodic executive and congressional review of each emergency decree .
The act also requires that no statutory authority contingent on a state of emergency be triggered by a national emergency decree unless the President specifically states his intent to exercise authority under that particular statute .
Moreover , the act declares that national emergencies may be terminated by concurrent resolution of congress as well as by presidential proclamation or automatic lapse if not renewed annually by the President .
As originally enacted , the NEA exempted Section 5 ( b ) of the Trading with the Enemy Act ( TWEA ) from its provisions , simultaneously mandating immediate congressional review of national emergency powers and programs under that authority .
The exemption was significant because since 1917 the TWEA had given the President virtually unlimited power during war or ( since 1933 ) other national emergencies to regulate or prohibit transactions in foreign exchange or international credit as well as purely domestic banking activities .
As Representative Jonathan Bingham ( U.S. House of Representatives 1977a , p. 5 ) later described it ,  the TWEA was so broad that the President could do virtually what he wanted under it under any kind of an emergency and it did not have to involve war or hostility or anything else . 
The congressman believed these powers to be enormously broad and potentially dictatorial and worried that they could be employed without any restraint by the Congress . 
In the 1977 TWEA committee hearings , the clash between members of Congress seeking to control this executive power and officials of the executive branch intent on sustaining it became intense .
Incredulous congressmen learned the full reach of executive encroachments on private property rights undertaken in the name of obsolete emergency decrees , as the exchange between Representative Bingham and State Department official Julius Katz illustrates ( U.S. House of Representatives 1977 b , p. 110 ) :
Mr. BINGHAM .
Mr. Katz , what is the national emergency currently facing us which warrants the use of powers under the Trading with the Enemy Act ? . . .
What is the national emergency today ?
Mr. KATZ .
It continues to be the emergency involving the threat of Communist aggression which was declared in 1950 at the time of the aggression in Korea .
Mr. BINGHAM .
Are you serious ?
Moments later , referring to this  Alice in Wonderland  situation that we are in today with the Trading With the Enemy Act ,  Bingham ( pp. 11112 ) complained that
The administration wants to continue exercising powers which in the mind of any fair - minded observer . . . are totally unrelated to the purposes of the act .
We dont know who the enemy is that we are talking about .
We dont have an emergency that is current .
. . . we are playing fast and loose with the Constitution .
We are relying on an emergency that does not exist to justify a taking , or actions taken by the administration .
Ultimately , even administration witnesses acknowledged the historical vulnerability of private rights to the political imperatives of crisis as reflected in the evolution of the TWEA .
Treasury official C. Fred Bergsten , a key administration spokesman on the issue , said that he was keenly aware that on several occasions section 5 ( b ) had been hurriedly broadened during moments of national crisis , such as the banking emergency in 1933 and World War II breakout in 1941 , during which cases very little attention , frankly , was given to procedural safeguards consonant with the constitutional balance of power  ( U.S. Senate 1977 , p. 2 ) .
To narrow the TWEAs exemption from the NEA , Congress passed the IEEPA in 1977 .
Viewed broadly , the effect of its enactment is to separate presidential power over transactions previously covered by Section 5 ( b ) into two categories .
The TWEA is amended to authorize presidential action exclusively during wartime , while the IEEPA becomes a repository for executive economic power wielded during other national emergencies .
Significant also is the IEEPAs restriction that the emergency powers it authorizes apply to international transactions only .
Withheld are the purely domestic emergency powers previously exercised under the all - inclusive TWEA .
Presidential emergency authority over international transactions , however , remains virtually unchanged .
In language parallel to the wartime provisions of the TWEA , the IEEPA grants the President emergency authority to
( A ) investigate , regulate or prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange , transfers of credit or payments between , by , through , or to any banking institution , to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any interest of any foreign country or a national thereof , the importing or exporting of currency or securities ; and ( B ) investigate , regulate , direct and compel , nullify , void , prevent or prohibit , any acquisition , holding , withholding , use , transfer , withdrawal , transportation , importation or exportation of , or dealing in , or exercising any right , power or privilege with respect to , or transaction involving any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest ; by any person , or with respect to any property , subject to the jurisdiction of the United States .
These copious powers are to be used to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat , which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States , to the national security , foreign policy , or economy of the United States , if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat .
6
Although the Presidents emergency authority over international transactions retained its previous scope , the power to effect the requisite emergency was narrowed .
In enacting the IEEPA , Congress repealed the exemption that had shielded Section 5 ( b ) of the TWEA from the NEA .
The IEEPA thus guaranteed that future declarations of national emergency within its scope would be subject to the NEA and that current emergencies  could be terminated as specified in that statute .
Nevertheless , existing uses of Section 5 ( b ) powers continued to be insulated from the NEA by provisions enabling the President to extend current Section 5 ( b ) programs annually upon executive determination that such extension is in the national interest that is , without the necessity of a continuing national emergency .
Existing Section 5 ( b ) programs included the Foreign Assets Control Regulations ( restricting American citizens  rights to enter into trade or financial transactions with citizens of North Korea , Vietnam , Cambodia , and , to a lesser extent , China ) , Cuban Assets Control Regulations , Transactions Control Regulations ( prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in certain transactions involving strategic goods of foreign origin ) , and Foreign Funds Control Regulations ( affecting assets of citizens of East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia that were blocked during World War II ) .
How well have the NEA and IEEPA served their intended purpose ?
In the decade since their enactment , the attempted curtailment of executive power has proved to be significantly less successful than the statutory language suggested it would be .
In one sense , the dramatic and frequent use of executive emergency power that persists under the two statutes speaks for itself .
President Carter and President Reagan have declared national emergencies repeatedly to impose sweeping economic restrictions on the dealings of Americans with citizens of other nations , including Iran , Nicaragua , South Africa , and Libya .
Most recently , invoking the NEA and the IEEPA , President Reagan declared a national emergency to warrant a prohibition of the economic activities of Americans in Libya and ordered all U.S. citizens residing in Libya to leave or face criminal sanctions .
Also under claim of national emergency , President Reagan recently used the IEEPA to sustain an important trade restriction , the Export Administration Act , for more than a year during which Congress had allowed it to expire .
The Libyan episode is particularly revealing of the fundamental issues involved in recent emergency declarations .
Although the President and the popular press invite us to view the restrictions as impinging on the Libyan government , in reality the emergency decrees restrict the rights of American citizens .
In his Executive Order 12543 of January 7 , 1986 ( 51 Fed. Reg. 875 , Jan. 9 , 1986 ) , President Reagan explicitly forbade U.S. citizens to engage in
(a) The import into the United States of any goods or services of Libyan origin . . . ;
( b) The export to Libya of any goods , technology ( including technical data or other information ) or services from the United States . . . ;
( c) Any transaction by a United States person relating to transportation to or from Libya ; . . . or the sale in the United States by any person holding authority under the Federal Aviation
Act of any transportation by air which includes any stop in Libya ;
(d) The purchase by any United States person of goods for export from Libya to any country ;
(e) The performance by any United States person of any contract in support of an industrial or other commercial or governmental project in Libya ;
( f ) the grant or extension of credits or loans by any United States person to the government of Libya , its instrumentalities and controlled entities ;
(g) Any transaction by a United States person relating to travel by any United States citizen or permanent resident alien to Libya , or to activities by any such person within Libya , after the date of this Order , other than transactions necessary to effect such persons departure form Libya . . . ; and
(h) Any transaction by any United States person which evades or avoids , or has the purpose of evading or avoiding , any of the prohibitions set forth in this Order .
Whatever ones views of the events that prompted the Presidents actions , one cannot escape the conclusion that the economic activities of Americans , not Libyans , are controlled directly by the emergency restrictions .
It became evident that the valuable investments of Americans in plant and equipment stood a good chance of being relinquished to the Libyan government , without compensation , by the terms of the Presidents executive order ( see Kempe 1986a ) .
Caught in its own snare , the Reagan administration changed the program , making exceptions to and deferrals of its original orders in hopes of avoiding the enormous financial gains to Qadhafis regime that rigid enforcement of the edicts would create ( see Greenberger 1986 and Kempe 1986 b ) .
While observing the governments confused thrashing , one might well have reflected on who was supposed to suffer as a result of the emergency economic sanctions and on whether or not such suffering could reasonably be expected to result from such restrictions of American rights .
These events prompt one to wonder about what events might provoke a charismatic President to impose sanctions that selectively restrict the property rights of an unpopular subgroup of Americans such as the Japanese - Americans in 1942 under the pretext of emergency .
The Constitutionality of Emergency Powers
Are emergency powers constitutional ?
The short answer is yes .
One sense of constitutional is whatever the government makes a practice of doing .
Since the federal government took emergency action to head off the threatened railroad strike in 1916 , it has repeatedly exercised emergency powers .
To conduct a practice for 70 years is to establish that it is not simply an aberration .
Another meaning of constitutional is whatever accords with the U.S. Constitution .
Ours is a written document that completely enumerates the powers that may be exercised by the federal government .
The Tenth Amendment guarantees that powers not explicitly assigned to the central government nor prohibited to the state governments belong to the states and the people .
The Constitution makes no provision for the exercise of emergency powers .
Evidently , it was meant to govern the actions of federal authorities in foul weather as well as in fair .
How , then , has it been possible for federal officials to exercise eventually as a matter of routine extraordinary powers for which the Constitution provides no warrant ?
The answer lies in a third meaning of constitutional ; that is , whatever the Supreme Court allows .
The Court has ruled on several occasions on the permissibility of emergency powers ; these decisions constitute a melancholy chapter of constitutional history , a record of evasion and capitulation of the judicial function against which many justices on the minority side have objected .
The first modern ruling , still a leading precedent , was handed down in Wilson v. New ( 243 U.S. 332 [ 1917 ] ) , a case arising from a challenge to the governments emergency appeasement of the railroad unions in 1916 .
By a 54 margin , the justices upheld the governments actions .
Speaking for the Court , Chief Justice White ( pp. 35051 ) argued that the Adamson Act was a legitimate exercise of the legislative will to the end that no individual dispute or difference might bring ruin to the vast interests concerned in the movement of interstate commerce .
. . .
The dispute , he observed , if not remedied , would leave the public helpless , the whole people ruined and all the homes of the land submitted to a danger of the most serious character . 
The Chief Justice ( pp. 348 , 352 ) repeatedly emphasized the gravity of the circumstances prompting the Adamson Act :  the impediment and destruction of interstate commerce which was threatened  and  the infinite injury to the public interest which was imminent .
Oddly , he took pains to deny that the emergency per se gave rise to the governments authority under the act : although an emergency may not call into life a [ constitutional ] power which has never lived ,  he reasoned , nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed .
In view of the unprecedented character of the governments actions , Whites distinction was a most delicate one ; not everyone could see the sense of it .
The dissenting justices declared that emergency conditions , however threatening , could not excuse the denial of constitutional rights .
In their view , the Constitution had been adopted to protect private property especially under such conditions .
 The suggestion ,  wrote Justice Pitney ( pp. 37677 ) , that the Adamson Act was passed to prevent a threatened strike . . . amounts to no more than saying that it was enacted to take care of an emergency .
But an emergency can neither create a power nor excuse a defiance of the limitations upon the powers of the Government . 
Despite their strong arguments , the dissenters could do no more than register their dissatisfaction .
The majoritys curious doctrine , that emergencies may call forth extraordinary powers from some previously untapped yet still legitimate reservoir , carried the day and established the precedent .
A broad construction of the war powers excused the governments suppression of private rights during World War I , but legal challenges persisted into the postwar era .
In the spring of 1921 , the Supreme Court ruled that a rent - control ordinance that Congress had imposed in late 1919 in the District of Columbiaits provisions were made necessary by emergencies growing out of the war was not , in the prevailing circumstances , an unconstitutional restriction of the owners dominion and right of contract or a taking of his property for a use not public .
The ruling , which emphasized the temporariness of the disputed rent controls , seemed to the dissenters to open the door to all kinds of governmental restrictions of the private right of contract .
 As a power in government ,  wrote Justice McKenna , if it exist at all , it is perennial and universal .
. . . necessarily , if one contract can be disregarded in the public interest every contract can be .
... other exigencies may come to the Government making necessary other appeals . 
7
Indeed they would .
Early in 1934 the Court issued what is perhaps the classic decision on the emergency powers of government and the protection to be afforded or withheld from private property rights during economic crises ( Home Building and Loan Association v. Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398 [ 1934 ] ) .
The case involved a legislative moratoriumone of 25 such state laws enacted during 193233 on mortgage foreclosures ( see Aston 1984 ) .
A statute approved by the government of Minnesota on April 18 , 1933 , under ominous pressures by indebted farmers , declared an economic emergency and extended temporarily the period during which creditors were prevented from foreclosing on and selling mortgaged real estate .
At the discretion of local courts the owners of foreclosed property could be allowed up to two years to redeem their property .
During the extended redemption period the mortgagor was required to pay the mortgagee what amounted to rent , but the mortgagee was deprived of the right to take control over the property .
The Home Building and Loan Association of Minneapolis challenged the law as an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contract .
Its position was upheld by a county court but overturned by the state supreme court ; the case then came before the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal .
The main issue was whether emergency conditions justified the exercise of otherwise unconstitutional powers by a state government .
The most compelling precedents for an affirmative answer were Wilson v. New and the 1921 rent - control cases .
The force of the rent - control decisions was uncertain , however , as Justice Holmes had previously declared that they went to the very verge of the law ( Pennsylvania Coal Company v. Mahon , 260 U.S. 393 [ 1921 ] ) .
Counsel for the state of Minnesota conceded ( 290 U.S. at 409 ) that in normal times and under normal conditions  the states moratorium law would be unconstitutional .
 But these ,  he urged , are not normal times nor normal conditions .
A great economic emergency has arisen in which the State has been compelled to invoke the police power .
. . . 
The justices would have to decide again whether or not an emergency altered the protections of the Constitution and , if so , what qualified as an emergency .
Their decision could have wide repercussions , because virtually all of the important federal statutes enacted during Franklin D. Roosevelts first 100 days had appealed to emergency conditions , evidently with an eye toward the Supreme Court ( see Clark 1934 and Belknap 1983 ) .
Although the Court upheld the Minnesota moratorium law and by implication all the others , it failed to clarify whether or not an emergency justified setting aside the constitutional protection of private property rights .
Perhaps the most important aspect of the decision is simply that state infringement of contractual obligations was validated .
Paradoxically , however , the Court denied that it had sustained the Minnesota statute because of emergency ( 290 U.S. at 425 , 426 , 428 , 437 , 44041 , 444 ) .
 Emergency does not create power ,  said Chief Justice Hughes , speaking for the five - man majority .
 Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved .
What could be plainer ?
Yet , wrote Hughes , referring to the slippery doctrine enunciated in Wilson v. New , while emergency does not create power , emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power . 
The prohibition of governmental intervention guaranteed by the Contracts Clause , he added , is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula .
. . .
The economic interests of the State may justify the exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts .
Any doubts about the capaciousness of the police powers of the state government and the implied limitation on the protection of private contractual rights , he believed , should have been removed by the rent - control decisions decisions , where  the relief afforded was temporary and conditional . . . sustained because of the emergency .
The Chief Justice insisted that  the reservation of the reasonable exercise of the protective power of the State is read into all contracts .
. . . 
He concluded :  An emergency existed in Minnesota which furnished a proper occasion for the exercise of the reserved power of the State to protect the vital interests of the community . 
The four dissenting justices disagreed emphatically ( pp. 448 , 465 , 471 ) .
 He simply closes his eyes to the necessary implications of the decision ,  said their spokesman , Justice Sutherland , who fails to see in it the potentiality of future gradual but ever - advancing encroachments upon the sanctity of private and public contracts .
The correct doctrine , they believed , was to be found in the classic decision of Ex parte Milligan ( 1866 ) , which declared constitutional guarantees and restrictions to be absolutely invariant with respect to emergencies or any other social conditions .
Quoting from a considerable collection of historical works , Sutherland established that the framers had intended the Contracts Clause to apply primarily and especially  during economic crises ; a crisis similar to the current depression had provoked them to add it to the Constitution in the first place .
 The present exigency is nothing new ,  Sutherland pointed out .
The rent - control decisions were dismissed as too weakly justified at the time and as dealing with a matter too dissimilar to the present one to afford a binding precedent .
The dissenters on the Court rejected Hughess sophistical distinction between genuine emergency powers and reserved powers brought into play by emergency conditions ( pp. 47374 ) :
The question is not whether an emergency furnishes the occasion for the exercise of that state power , but whether an emergency furnishes an occasion for the relaxation of the restrictions upon the power imposed by the contract impairment clause ; and the difficulty is that the contract impairment clause forbids state action under any circumstances , if it have the effect of impairing the obligation of contracts .
. . .
The Minnesota statute either impairs the obligation of contracts or it does not .
If it does not , the occasion to which it relates becomes immaterial , since then the passage of the statute is the exercise of a normal , unrestricted , state power and requires no special occasion to render it effective .
If it does , the emergency no more furnishes a proper occasion for its exercise than if the emergency were non-existent .
And so , while , in form , the suggested distinction seems to put us forward in a straight line , in reality it simply carries us back in a circle , like bewildered travelers lost in a wood .
The dissenting opinion concluded :  If the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort , they may as well be abandoned . 
The dissenters feared that the Court , to facilitate the extraordinary governmental measures being implemented at all levels , had begun to abandon the Constitution by embracing a reinterpretation so sweeping as to effectively destroy the traditional understanding and force of the constitutional protection of private rights .
During the Korean War , the Court had another occasion to consider its doctrine regarding emergency powers .
President Truman , placed in an uncomfortable political position by a deadlocked union - management dispute that threatened a nationwide strike , directed the Secretary of Commerce in April 1952 to seize and operate several steel mills .
The owners obtained an injunction to prevent the seizure .
The Supreme Court upheld the injunction by a 63 vote in the Youngstown case decided June 2 , 1952 ( 343 U.S. 579 ) .
Although the Court denied Trumanby that time a very unpopular Presidenta power previously exercised freely by Wilson and FDR , the decision did not impose a restriction of the governments power to take private property in an emergency ; it restrained only a presidential taking without specific statutory authorization ( pp. 587 , 653 , 700 ) .
As Justice Black said in announcing the majoritys opinion ,  This is a job for the Nations lawmakers , not for its military authorities . 
In a concurring opinion , Justice Jackson emphasized  the ease , expedition and safety with which Congress can grant and has granted large emergency powers . 
Neither the majority nor the minority gave any weight to private property rights .
While the majority objected only to Trumans presidential high - handedness , the minority grumbled that such a [ presidential ] power of seizure has been accepted throughout our history .
The Constitution was read in this case , as in many orders , not as a bulwark against governmental oppression of private citizens but as the institutional setting within which high officials in the different branches of government conduct their internecine struggles for supremacy .
By enacting the NEA and IEEPA , Congress sought to institutionalize its regulation of the presidential exercise of emergency powers , but the Supreme Court has recently breathed new life into those powers , countermanding restraints codified in the 1976 and 1977 statutes .
In 1983 , the Court ruled in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha ( 103 S. Ct. 2764 ) that Congress may not use a one - house resolution or any other method short of the full constitutional requirements for enactment of legislation to overturn a decision delegated to the President .
By implication , the ruling invalidated the use of a concurrent resolution , as provided in the NEA , as a restraint on the presidential exercise of emergency authority .
Congress might have foreseen this outcome .
In hearings on national emergency legislation in 1977 , members of Congress were warned by administration witnesses and legal scholars that the proposed use of the concurrent resolution was constitutionally vulnerable .
Against this background , skeptics might argue that Congress adopted the provision in order to achieve the appearance rather than the reality of congressional control .
Whatever the congressional intention may have been , in Chadha one potential counterweight to the Presidents use of emergency powers was demolished by the judicial interpretation of the doctrine of separation of powers .
More significantly , the Supreme Courts two recent decisions directly involving the IEEPA all but gutted certain congressional constraints on presidential power set forth in the NEA .
In Dames & Moore v. Regan ( 101 S. Ct. 2972 [ 1981 ] ) , the Court gave broad construction to the Presidents power to act under the IEEPA , endorsing President Carters use of that act first to block Iranian funds and later to compel their return to Iran ( thereby nullifying certain attachments issued by U.S. courts ) as part of his effort to secure the release of American hostages .
Noting other disputes over Carters attempt to nullify Americans legal claims to Iranian assets , the Supreme Court quoted approvingly a lower courts ruling in upholding these powers that  the language of IEEPA is sweeping and unqualified .
8 The Supreme Court ( 101 S. Ct. at 2983 ) ruled that the President did have the power to nullify the judicial attachments of Iranian assets secured by the American petitioners :  We . . . refuse to read out of Section 1702 [ of the IEEPA ] all meaning to the words  transfer ,  compel ,  or nullify .  . . . both the legislative history and cases interpreting the TWEA fully sustain the broad authority of the Executive when acting under this congressional grant of power . 
Equally significant was the Courts ruling on the scope of executive power to deal with such foreign policy disputes in the absence of statutory authority .
While holding that President Reagan lacked statutory authority under the IEEPA to suspend 
U.S. citizens  claims against Iran pursuant to President Carters agreement with the Iranian government , the Court nevertheless ruled that the President did not lack constitutional power to terminate the claims .
Citing with approval Justice Frankfurters statement in Youngstown that a systematic , unbroken , executive practice , long pursued in the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned É may be treated as a gloss on  Executive Power ,  the Court held that where , as here , the settlement of claims has been determined to be a necessary incident to the resolution of a major foreign policy dispute between our country and another , and where , as here , we can conclude that Congress acquiesced in the Presidents action , we are not prepared to say that the President lacks the power to settle such claims  ( pp. 299091 ) .
Lest anyone think that the judges did not understand the economic consequences of their decision , the Court rationalized its invalidation of the property rights involved by referring to the Iran - United States Claims Tribunal as an alternative forum established to provide relief in these cases .
While unabashedly admitting that the American claimants had scant chance of success before the Claims Tribunal , the justices offered the consolation that the deprived parties may well recover something on their claims  ( p. 2990 ) .
Further erosion of the NEA and the IEEPA came in Regan v. Wald ( 104 S. Ct. 3026 ) , decided by the Supreme Court on June 28 , 1984 .
At issue was the scope of the grandfather provision of the IEEPA , which exempts existing uses of Section 5 ( b ) powers from the NEAs restrictions .
The dispute arose over the use of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations , first promulgated under the old TWEA , to prohibit Americans from engaging in economic transactions related to tourist and business travel to Cuba .
At the time of the IEEPAs enactment , such transactions were permitted under a general license issued by the Treasury Department .
In 1982 , without a presidential declaration of national emergency or executive compliance with the procedures of the NEA and the IEEPA , the Treasury Department changed the regulations to prohibit most of the transactions .
The issue before the Court was whether or not the dramatic change in the regulations was covered by the grandfather provision of the IEEPA and , therefore , exempt from the NEA procedures .
The issue had been discussed in congressional hearings on the IEEPA .
The original grandfather proposal contained language that would have grandfathered not only existing uses of statutory authority but also any other authority exercised to deal with the same set of circumstances .
Representative Bingham balked at such a broad formulation : he wondered why it should be necessary to give [ the President ] authority to expand what has already been done .
His understanding was that grandfathering applies to what has been done to date , and what should be ample authority .
The subcommittees staff director , Roger Majak , responded that it boils down to a question of whether we are grandfathering a particular situation , and all the powers that may be necessary to deal with the situation , or whether we are grandfathering the particular authorities themselves and their usage  ( U.S. House of Representatives 1977 b , p. 167 , emphasis added ) .
The upshot of the discussion was that the language of the grandfather provision was changed , eliminating any reference to the use of other authorities relevant to existing situations .
A stripped - down clause emerged , grandfathering only existing uses of Section 5 ( b ) authorities .
When the bill was presented for markup before the full House Committee on International Regulations , Bingham stated unequivocally : . . . we have grandfathered in those actions currently being taken under the Trading With the Enemy Act ( U.S. House of Representatives 1977a , p. 2 , emphasis added ) .
Under questioning by Representative Cavanaugh , Assistant Treasury Secretary Bergsten , the administrations spokesman for the IEEPA , reiterated the narrow purpose of the revised grandfather provision ( p. 21 ) :
Mr. CAVANAUGH .
First of all , Mr. Bergsten , would it be your understanding that [ the grandfather clause ] would strictly limit and restrict the grandfathering of powers currently being exercised under 5 ( b ) to those specific uses of the authorities granted in 5 ( b ) being employed as of June 1 , 1977 .
Mr. BERGSTEN .
Yes , sir .
Mr. CAVANAUGH .
And it would preclude the expansion by the President of the authorities that might be included in 5 ( b ) but are not being employed as of June 1 , 1977 .
Mr. BERGSTEN .
That is right .
Notwithstanding this unmistakably explicit legislative history , the Supreme Court ruled by a vote of 54 that the grandfather provision does encompass changes in existing restrictions if they pertain to the same general authority  previously exercised under the TWEA .
The four dissenting justices ( 104 S. Ct. at 3046 ) could only observe that there is nothing in the language of the statute to suggest . . . that Congress intended the grandfather clause to provide a President with the authority to increase the restrictions applicable to a particular country without following the IEEPA procedures . 
The immediate result of the Courts decision was that a major new curtailment of private travel to Cuba was implemented under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations without a declaration of national emergency or compliance with NEA procedures .
With the stroke of a judicial pen , an apparent pinprick in the statutory armor against the abuse of emergency powers became a gaping hole .
Conclusion
The history of the United States in the 20th century provides strong evidence that derogations from private property rights in a liberal democracy occur chiefly during national emergencies and that , once curtailed , private rights seldom regain their previous scope .
The pattern should not be surprising .
Crisis clearly alters the expected benefits and costs of curtailment of private rights on both sides of the political equation .
A fearful public , ideologically predisposed to believe in the efficacy of governmental action , insists that the government do something  to diminish the threat , perceiving the benefits of such action to be immediately and direct and the costs to be removed and largely external .
This public perception is nurtured by those who , for material or ideological reasons , would use the occasion to further their economic or political aims .
From a cost - benefit perspective , governmental officials experience reduced political costs and increased political benefits from curtailing private rights in crisis as compared to non-crisis conditions .
As people adjust to the crisis - expanded role of government , many variables change in ways that diminish the likelihood that the post - crisis retrenchment of the government will restore private rights to their previous scope .
Private citizens discover that governmental action in a liberal democracy need not lead to the establishment of totalitarianism , as some conservatives have predicted .
Governmental officials develop the bureaucratic technology to administer their controls less abrasively and more effectively .
Many people find the politically and economically rewarding paths to personal advancement unique to systems powered by discretionary governmental authority .
Thus , history is irrevocably altered by the crisis - induced expansion of governmental authority .
The change is consolidated and compounded as new generations never experience the broader realm of private rights that once prevailed .
For the younger generations , the status quo is the current , high degree of governmental power ; for them there is no personal experience and , therefore , no genuine appreciation of the old regime .
The legal legacies of the crisis tilt the polity in the same direction : Statutes , regulations , and judicial decisions expressing and facilitating expanded governmental powers become embedded in the law as well as the publics consciousness .
The plethora of crisis - engendered statutes and judicial decisions attests to the magnitude of this aspect of the politico - economic dynamics .
The discretionary nature of governmental powers thereby created provides an easy avenue to their expanded use in future situations that the public perceives , or can be induced to perceive , as crises . 
Thus , private property rights , historically truncated during national emergencies , remain vulnerable to further erosion during future crises .
Attempts to restrain the abuse of emergency powers have not eliminated the ratcheting effect of actual or purported emergency in augmenting governmental power .
Only the respite of non-crisis affords time to contemplate and forestall the threat to liberty and private property rights inherent in the emergency psychology of the public and its exploitation by governmental officials .

Commenting on this decision , Edward S. Corwin ( 1947 , p. 83 ) wrote :
 The power of the court to take notice of an emergency is , it appears , a two - edged sword , but its anti-government edge descends only after the emergency is over .
Fifty years after the court ruled on Block and Marcus Brown , these decisions were employed to establish the constitutionality of a Rent Control Enabling Act when the government of Cambridge , Massachusetts , declared a housing emergency  and imposed local rent controls .

Tibetan activists say police killed protesters in Aba on Sunday
It is the first time China has admitted injuring anyone since anti-Chinese protests in Tibet began last week .
Xinhua said police opened fire in Aba county - the same place that Tibetan activists said eight people were killed during protests near Kirti monastery .
Activists released graphic photos of dead bodies showing bullet wounds .
China has said that only 13 people have been killed during the protests , and that all were innocent and killed by " rioters " in Lhasa .
The Tibetan government in exile has said at least 99 people have died so far , including 80 in Lhasa - and have accused the security forces of firing on crowds .
Earlier on Thursday , China admitted for the first time that the protests had spread outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region to nearby provinces in south - western China where large numbers of ethnic Tibetans live .
In a phone call to her Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged China to show restraint and enter dialogue with the Dalai Lama , the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists .
Meanwhile White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said President George W Bush would go ahead with a visit to the Beijing Olympic Games in August despite the unrest , and would use the opportunity to speak openly to President Hu Jintao .
' Monks protest '
Citing police sources , Xinhua said police had opened fire " in self - defence " during Sunday 's unrest in Aba , close to Sichuan 's border with Qinghai province .
An earlier Xinhua report had said the police had shot dead four rioters , but it was quickly corrected .
TIBETAN PROTESTS
Tibet : Protests began in Lhasa on 10 March , dozens reported dead over weekend Gansu : Unrest spread to Machu , where Tibetan government in exile says 19 died , and near Hezuo , where protesters were filmed tearing down Chinese flag Sichuan : State media says four people ' shot and wounded ' by police in Aba Qinghai :
Other unrest reported
Key events and places Tibet 's unsettled borders Gansu streets deserted Controlled life of monks
The state - owned news agency had previously said only that " mobs " had caused " great damage " to shops and government offices in the area .
Xinhua did not provide further details of the incident , but Tibetan activists have said at least eight people were killed at a demonstration against Chinese rule near the Kirti monastery in Aba on Sunday .
The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy circulated photos earlier this week of dead bodies with apparent gunshot wounds , which it said were the result of police firing indiscriminately at those attending the protest .
The group said many of the victims were monks who had joined thousands of others to demand independence for Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama .
Chinese police are deployed around the monastery to deter further protests , it said .
Crackdown
The BBC's China editor , Shirong Chen , says the situation in parts of western China is now extremely tense , with security being ratcheted up and many arrests .
Hundreds of troops have been seen pouring into Tibetan areas .
On Wednesday alone , BBC reporters saw more than 400 troop carriers and other vehicles on the main road - the largest mobilisation witnessed since the unrest began .
The authorities have also placed strict limits on Western journalists trying to report on the unrest .
A German journalist who was forced out of Lhasa on Thursday said security forces had told him he was the last foreign journalist in the city .
And officials said 24 people had been arrested after demonstrations in the Tibetan city of Lhasa , and 170 protesters had surrendered to authorities .
Earlier the Dalai Lama reiterated his willingness to meet Mr Hu if he received " concrete indications " of what the Chinese government can offer .
But senior Chinese officials have repeatedly accused him of orchestrating the protests from his base in the Indian town of Dharamsala .
We ’re heading into senility territory here , or at best serial lying .
From Huff Post :
For the third time in two days , the Arizona Republican has pushed the definitively false statement that the terrorist group Al - Qaeda was getting assistance from Iran , even though he was publicly ridiculed for the same false assertion on Tuesday .
This time , in a statement from his campaign honoring the fifth year anniversary of the war , McCain wrote :
“ Today in Iraq , America and our allies stand on the precipice of winning a major victory against radical Islamic extremism .
The security gains over the past year have been dramatic and undeniable .
Al Qaeda and Shia extremists — with support from external powers such as Iran — are on the run but not defeated . ”….
And speaking today , Sen. Barack Obama , used the misstatements as evidence that McCain ’s claims of foreign policy experience do not give him a superior understanding or judgment of the terrorist threat or Iraq policy .
“ Just yesterday , we heard Sen. McCain confuse Sunni and Shiite , Iran and Al Qaeda , ” said Obama .
“ Maybe that is why he voted to go to war with a country that had no Al Qaeda ties .
Maybe that is why he completely fails to understand that the war in Iraq has done more to embolden America ’s enemies than any strategic choice that we have made in decades . ”
I love diet Snapple " Lemonade / Iced Tea " .
Or , rather , I did .
A few minutes ago , I poured a nice new bottle of the concoction into a frosty cup of ice and came up with what you see at left .
Is it a slug ?
Part of an eggplant ?
The ingredients list reads , in order , " Our real tea starts with the finest tea leaves and is made from : Water , Lemon Juice Concentrate , Corn Syrup , Natural Flavors , Citric Acid , Tea , Potassium Citrate , Sucralose , Acesulfame Potassium . "
I 'm thinking the disgusting mass ( see more photos after the jump ! ) falls under " Natural Flavors " .

Microswitch keyboard - front
Microswitch keyboard - plan Microswitch keyboard I 've constructed a 124 - key microswitch keyboard .
This uses Saia - Burgess low force microswitches - the best keyswitches I 've been able to find so far .
The overall key layout is like the Kinesis and Maltron keyboards .
The actual alphanumeric arrangement used owes much to my previous Kinesis layout .
As a bit of an experiment , I attempted to spread the keying load between flexor and extensor muscles - by positioning some of the switches in an inverted position - like this :
Alternating switch pattern I got the idea for doing this from DataHand devices .
The inversion works well on the thumb boards - but is rather less effective on the finger boards .
Video
My keyboard Activation forces
The activation force on the keys of this keyboard is around 10 cN .
This is the first full keyboard constructed using this technology .
With the previous keypads the side effects of low activation forces were relatively minimal .
However , with a full keyboard , the drawbacks of having such low activation forces begin to show up .
It is normal to rest some weight on the fingers during typing .
The need to lift fingers from the keyboard to avoid pressing keys seems likely to generate a fairly continuous low - level stress .
Typists spend a lot of their time doing this anyway - and so far additional stress is not noticable .
Touch typing demands that the fingers feel their way to the correct positions to some extent .
Though the activation force on the keys is very low , they still have a couple of millimeters of travel - and it remains reasonably practical for fingers to feel the locations of the keys without actually pressing them .
Another problem is accidental keypresses .
These tend to be caused by reaching for one key without fully retracting the other fingers .
These drawbacks would become increasingly severe if the activation forces were reduced further - and could be alleviated by increasing them somewhat .
However , higher activation forces would inevitably cause more tissue damage .
On balance , 10 cN seems to be about right .
DIY
If you are interested in this type of keyboard , you will probably find you have to build it yourself .
Equipment I constructed this keyboard using M3 studding , 2 mm clear polystyrene sheet , switches , wire - and considerable patience .
Elecrical tools used included a jigsaw , a drill and a soldering iron .
Hand tools used included wire strippers , pliers , a junior hacksaw , a file , a vice and a penknife .
Layout
The layout of the keyboard is as illustrated in this diagram : Keyboard hack This keyboard is a great input device .
However , it is also a bit of a hack .
Currently , this site illustrates what appears to be needed to obtain a good - quality computer input device , that is relatively safe to use .
However , it is my hope that future keyboard designers will take the switches I used for a test drive - and find a way to use similar devices in their products .

Avoir une érection forte :
Mieux comprendre pour l'obtenir
Les messieurs se trouvent rapidement excités sexuellement et ainsi la suite de chaque stimulation s'avère la surgie d'une érection , ce qui s'avère répandu et aussi organique , mais la chose que certains ignorent c'est que quelques personnes n'arrivent point à avoir cette force érectile .
Il se révèle être capital chez le partenaire d'avoir une pulsion sexuelle au cours d'une excitation sexuelle , et l'impossibilité de l'assurer se trouve être un énorme tracas chez plusieurs hommes c'est l'IMPUISSANCE .
L'importance d'une bonne érection dans la vie d'un couple
Donc , on peut déduire que la baisse de libido , qu'elle s'avère être momentanée ou permanente , est la source de ce style de souci .
Tous les plaisirs sexuels demeurent associés à cette force érectile , c'est pour cette raison qu'il reste obligatoire de chercher un produit prompt à tous ces soucis d'érection .
Soyons claires et n'essyons pas de cacher les choses par un tamis !
Obtenir une érection ferme , dure et de longue durée s'avère la cause d'une activité sexuelle réussie et d'une vie intime heureuse , et ainsi le manque de cet équilibre pourrait causer de bien sérieux problèmes sociaux et conjugaux .
La rigidité ou la durée des érections pourraient vraiment se révéler le capital ennui de divers hommes qui pourraient obtenir des érections mais ne pourront point avoir une sexualité réussie .
Si l'individu rate son érection , son sexe serait décontracté et le fait de pénétrer la compagne devient ainsi irréalisable et avec des douleurs , ceci rend le rapport sexuel effrayant pour les deux conjoints .
La relation sexuelle est toujours abominable dans les cas où l'homme est capable de garder sa réaction érectile et qu'il réussit à pénétrer sa conjointe , toutefois avec un sexe qui ne s'avère point assez solide .
Par conséquent , pas de plaisir ne pourrait arriver chez l'amant et sa partenaire dans des contraintes de ce genre à cause de ce manque de rigidité des pulsions érectiles ou bien l'impossibilité du partenaire à la retarder suffisamment longtemps .
Le pénis n'est en aucun cas le seul signe de masculinité , du fait que si celui-là ne sera pas érecté , son existence s'avère futile et l'homme vivra un vrai tracas avec un trouble d'érection ou simplement des pannes sexuelles .
Ordonner à votre pénis d'avoir une érection rigide
Si le pénis d'un individu ne parvient pas à atteindre un très bon niveau de rigidité , il pourra voir un chercheur ou solliciter une parfaite solution avant que le problème ne s'empire .
La majorité des femmes cherchent à être contentées pendant les relations sexuelles , et rester avec un compagnon qui se plaint de dysfonction érectile engendre des tracas plutôt sérieux au sein la vie de couple .
Exigez donc que votre pénis soit au Rendez - Vous et assure une érection bien forte , à défaut vous mettez votre couple en danger !
Les érections se trouvent le majeur symbole de virilité parmi la totalité des individus et on ne pourra point sous - estimer sa portée concernant le bien être vital de l'homme .
L'inhabilité d'acquérir une érection demeure parmi les capitales raisons qui mènent les partenaires à quitter leurs amoureux qui ne peuvent pas les contenter .
Ça arrive que l'homme remarque une réaction érectile solide et complète , mais elle ne serait maintenue uniquement que durant de petites secondes et l'individu la rate aussi vite .
Ainsi , l'individu pourrait avoir des difficultés et sa panne sexuelle risque de se retrouver constante et il est obligé de trouver un traitement avantageuse très rapidement .

For the last few years I ’ve been learning and using Lisp more , and here is a disorganized , poorly - worded dump of how Lisp changed my opinion about other languages .
Static Types ( as implemented by C# and Java ) are oppressive .
I spend most of my time in C# , and it always feels like I ’m toiling in the Type mines under the iron fist of compiler .
I frequently run into problems where I can’t abstract common code because the .NET framework does n’t use C# ’s abstraction mechanisms enough ( more detail ) .
In Lisp it feels like types are a tool I can employ when I need it , but it ’s rare that I need COERCE something from one type to another .
Too much of my C# is devoted to casting to / from types , a hefty tax I pay to the compiler .
Syntax does n’t have to be so hard .
I was recently working on a ruby script , and had to stop and think : “ what does ruby want for ifs again ?
curly braces ?
indentation ? ”
In Lisp it ’s easy : it wants matching parentheses .
You can add syntax if you find it useful ( CL - INTERPOL is one of my common additions ) , but there ’s nothing I need to remember , no need for cheat sheets .
The simplicity also highlight the strangeness of things like python ’s “ pass ” statement .
There ’s no human meaning to a pass statement , it ’s just to handhold the parser , and I do n’t think that should be one of my responsibilities .
Development tools do n’t have to be such a pain in the ass .
In C# , I frequently end up waiting for Visual Studio , and that ’s on a modern dual - core workstation with 2GB of RAM .
In Lisp , I end up waiting once when I start slime / emacs , and once when I initially load a big system , and then everything else is pretty instant .
That ’s on my Asus EEEpc , a 900MHz Celeron with 512MB RAM .
I could use cores to eliminate most of that start - up time .
At work we have one fast server we all use to run our lisps , and if we did n’t have to run programs like Visual Studio , we could use low - power , low - cost workstations and be perfectly happy .
I know some people think Emacs is a heavyweight program , but devenv.exe sets a new standard .
Variables do n’t have to be so hard .
LET statements and lexical scoping in lisp are pretty basic , and meet all my needs .
The scoping rules in other languages seem really overcomplicated by comparison .
In C# , sometimes curly braces open a new scope , but sometimes not .
Sometimes you have to declare variables away from their usage in order for them to be available in all the right scopes you want .
In python / ruby , I ’m frequently confused whether I ’m declaring a new variable or using one from a higher scope .
Most of that is from lack of ruby / python practice , but even when first learning Lisp , the rule was so simple that I never had trouble with it .

A pensioner was jailed for a second time yesterday after refusing to pay her council tax .
Josephine Rooney was sent to prison two years ago after withholding payment because she believed the local authority had failed to prevent her once - elegant street from being overrun by drug dealers and prostitutes .
Hartington Street in Derby had become known to locals as Crack Alley and her constant lobbying of the council
had proved fruitless , she said .
Scroll down for more ...
In June 2006 , the 71 - year - old was jailed for three months .
But she served just a day of her sentence after a wellwisher paid her £ 798.97 bill .
She left prison to continue her campaign and is now more than two years in arrears to Derby City Council , owing £ 1,476 .
Last night , she began her second spell in jail after being sentenced to 28 days for two more offences of non-payment .
Derby Magistrates said they had no choice but to jail her after she refused to pay , even though she has the money to settle her arrears .
Before the hearing , Miss Rooney said she had no qualms about prison .
" I will do it again and and again .
" I have the money in a holding account , but I 'm not paying it .
This is the only way I can demonstrate what type of council we are living under .
" Nothing is achieved by people sitting on their hands and saying nothing .
You have to suffer to change things - eventually someone will listen .
" I'm even prepared to go on hunger - strike about the situation that has existed in our street for 20 years - that 's how strongly I feel about this .
" If I can go on and make a change to the law I will be very proud of myself .
And this time I do n't want anyone else to pay my council tax for me .
" People have already offered to pay , but I have told them that this would not be helpful .
I will serve my sentence and do it again and again . "
Yesterday the pensioner entered the dock at Derby magistrates ' court clutching a bouquet of flowers handed to her by a supporter .
District Judge Caroline Goulborn , passing sentence , told her : " You have made it clear that you have no intention to pay the amount .
" I have listened to what you have to say , but I do find willful refusal on the grounds that you have clearly have the means to pay . "
The last time Miss Rooney was jailed she appeared in court only months after being commended her for her work to regenerate the community .
The devout Christian has been locked in a lengthy battle with the council , accusing it of turning Hartington Street into a drug - plagued bedsit - land .
The authority claims it has already spent £ 800,000 on improvements and does not know what else it can do to make her pay her tax .
The council has urged the former Eucharist minister to " work with us rather than against us " , claiming it has long since addressed her concerns .
Brian Tomlinson , the authority 's assistant revenues manager , said : " She has made clear she has the money but is effectively withholding payment . "

If the issue behind our debate this week about copyright and piracy in the digital age is how much control creators should have over what happens to their works , one of the crucial extensions to that question is the matter of fair use .
Remixing is a key part of today ’s culture , as people use commercial music and video as the raw materials for their own creations .
Not surprisingly , Rick Cotton , the general counsel of NBC , and Tim Wu , the professor at Columbia Law school see these issues rather differently .
You can read the entire debate here .
Be sure to read the many thoughtful comments submitted by Bits readers .
Then add your own views too .
Wednesday ’s Question
What is fair use in the digital age ?
How much can I remix , quote , make fun of , or summarize without infringing on a copyright ?
Rick Cotton : Before responding to this question , I want to make a preliminary observation .
The debate about content protection in the digital world — and most particularly about content protection on the broadband Internet — is really and truly NOT a debate about fair use .
The millions upon millions of pirated , infringing copies of entire movies , TV shows , games and software that are epidemic in today ’s digital world have no claim whatsoever to being fair use .
And efforts to reduce that traffic on video - sharing sites , on ISP networks , and on devices can be engineered to accommodate fair use .
Hopefully , therefore , we can all agree , for example , that the vast P2P traffic involving the transmission of entire movies that is indexed on pirate Web sites and exchanged endlessly through broadband connections is most assuredly not fair use and deserves no protection .
And similarly posting whole movies or whole episodes of TV shows or extended unedited excerpts on video websites deserves no protection .
Turning then to the question of fair use as posed in today ’s question , I offer the following observations :
Fair use in the digital age is the same as fair use in the non-digital age .
The fact that digital tools make it easier to use other people ’s work does n’t affect the analysis of whether that use is fair .
Generally speaking , if you are making fun of , criticizing or commenting on a work ( and not just reproducing or copying it ) , courts have found that you can use the work only to the degree necessary to make your point about that work .
It is also helpful to note what is not included .
The fact that now individuals with relative ease can layer three or four songs , copy their favorite scenes from their favorite television shows , or take three or four movies and splice together their favorite action scenes and post them online does NOT mean that these uses are fair .
Although some commentators have argued that the “ non-commercial ” nature of this type of use makes these uses fair , that is not the test under the Copyright Act .
There needs to be something more — something that truly injects some degree of original contribution from the maker other than just the assembly of unchanged copies of different copyrighted works .
Lawyer ’s footnote : Since fair use is a legal standard with a long history of interpretation , it is difficult to try to capture it in a brief answer .
But , as a technical legal matter , fair use is not a “ right , ” a misconception and misstatement frequently made these days .
Rather it is an exception to the copyright owners ’ exclusive rights to determine how their expression is used in new works .
Fair use permits use of portions of a work under limited circumstances , many but not all of which are set out in the Copyright Act .
Because fairness cannot be reduced to a set of bright line rules , whether a use is fair is determined on a case by case basis and a large body of law has developed over decades to address this issue .
The Copyright Act sets out a four factor test ( although other factors can be considered ) .
The factors include the purpose and character of the use , the nature of the original work , the amount taken from the existing work and the importance of what is taken and the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
Thus , as a legal matter , a case - by - case analysis remains the standard .
Tim Wu : Fair
Use doctrine is creaking and groaning in the digital age , and it threatens to be surpassed by industry practice .
There was once a well - understood line between what original and “ secondary ” authors were allowed to do .
In the literary world this was the line between the original book on the one hand , and a book review or literary criticism on the other .
But today things are much more confusing .
Books begat films , character merchandising , giant fan guides , remix videos , fan art and other forms of secondary authorship that simply did n’t exist 100 years ago .
These forms of authorship are in a gray zone ; likely to fail the “ four factor test ” of fair use , but nonetheless largely tolerated by firms like NBC as a form of marketing .
It is a sign of how ridiculous things are today that a copyright lawyer cannot give you a straight answer as to how much of Wikipedia is actually legal .
That ’s why it is time to recognize a simpler principle for fair use : work that adds to the value of the original , as opposed to substituting for the original , is fair use .
In my view that ’s a principle already behind the traditional lines : no one ( well , nearly no one ) would watch Mel Brooks ’ “ Spaceballs ” as a substitute for “ Star Wars ” ; a book review is no substitute for reading “ The Naked and the Dead . ”
They are complements to the original work , not substitutes , and that makes all the difference .
This simple concept would bring much clarity to the problems of secondary authorship on the web .
Fan guides like the Harry Potter Lexicon or Lostpedia are not substitutes for reading the book or watching the show , and that should be the end of the legal questions surrounding them .
The same goes for reasonable tribute videos like this great Guyz Nite tribute to “ Die Hard . ”
On the other hand , its obviously not fair use to scan a book and put it online , or distribute copyrighted films using BitTorent .
We must never forget that copyright is about authorship ; and secondary authors , while never as famous as the original authors , deserve some respect .
Fixing fair use is one way to give them that .
Tim Wu 1/16 , 3:22 PM : Rick describes fair use as not a “ right ” but an “ exception , ” and argues that every fair use issue must be decided a case - by - case analysis .
It is true that the Supreme Court has so suggested ; but arguably they were referring to categories of works .
For it is absurd to have a system where fair use cannot be categorically relied upon , ever , but that secondary authors will always be at some risk of infringing .
Take a publication like The New York Review of Books .
Every review relies on an underlying work , and usually quotes at least a few lines .
It strikes me as ridiculous to say that the reviews must be examined on a case - by - case basis , and may sometimes infringe , sometimes not .
Rather , we should say that these reviews are categorically fair use , by right of the secondary author .
It is absurd to have a publication like The New York Review of Books lying under the equivalent of Copyright ’s sword of Damocles , wondering whether is breaking the law .
Now publications like The New York Review are established , and therefore unlikely to run into lawsuits .
But newer types of publications , like fan guides , have no such cushion .
That ’s why I believe courts should do more to create bright lines as to what is fair use and what is n’t .
There is another way .
As I ’ve suggested in other writing , many of the ugliest Fair Use questions can and should be avoided by careful interpretation of the adaptation right .
That is to say , I think we should n’t say that a book review would be infringing , but for fair use .
Instead , we should say that the original author simply does n’t “ own ” the book review in the first place .
All the works that are true complements , in my view , should not fall under the “ adaptation ” right ; but rather be something secondary authors are free to create .
This may sound like legal mumbo- jumbo , but to simplify :
We need to ask carefully what the breadth of the original author ’s ownership is , and it should n’t include secondary works that add to the value of the original , like book reviews , fan guides , and so on .

Via Moon Phase and Kadokawa ’s exhibitor entry at the Tokyo International Anime Fair website : according to the April edition of Newtype magazine ( on sale March 10th ) , a theatrical version of the Gurren Lagann TV anime is currently in the planning stages of production .
No details of the project are currently known , but Moon Phase speculates that it might be similar to the Top wo Nerae !
theatrical release in that it would combine new animated sequences with brushed up material from the TV series to present a condensed version of the story .
We ’ll keep an eye on this as further information comes to light .

Two followers of a fundamentalist Christian church that favours faith healing over conventional medicine are to be prosecuted for manslaughter after their daughter died of a treatable infection .
Carl and Raylene Worthington were indicted by a grand jury in Oregon 's Clackamas county following the death of their 15 - month - old daughter Ava in March .
The toddler died of bronchial pneumonia and a blood infection , according to the state medical examiner 's office - both conditions that could have been treated with antibiotics .
The parents , who surrendered to police on Friday , are members of the Followers of Christ , a fundamentalist church in Oregon with about 1,500 members .
They were released on $ 250,000 ( £ 126,000 ) bail .
The church was at the centre of controversy in the 1990s after the deaths of several children attracted the attention of the authorities .
It led to the passage of legislation in Oregon that repealed the right to a religious beliefs defence in cases of manslaughter , homicide and child abuse .
Since the passage of the law in 1999 , according to authorities in Oregon , there have been no incidents of child neglect involving the church .
The Worthingtons are the first members of the church to face criminal charges for failing to seek medical attention for a gravely ill child .
If convicted they could serve six years in prison for manslaughter and up to a year for criminal mistreatment .
The couple 's son died in August 2001 .
A police investigation into the death was closed after family members said the child had been stillborn and was three months premature .
Despite the passage of the law and the tight - knit nature of the congregation , there are some indications of high infant mortality among the group .
The church has a private cemetery south of Oregon City .
There , markers indicate that more than half a dozen children have died of unspecified causes since the passage of the legislation nine years ago .
The Followers of Christ has its origins in the Pentecostal movement of the late 19th century .
Republicans pushed ' bogus ' terror threat to expand FISA , lawmaker says Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 19 , 2007
Print This Email This Republicans and the Bush administration used a ' bogus ' terror threat that raised specific fears of an attack on the Capitol to scare lawmakers into adopting a dramatic temporary expansion of the government 's spy powers last month , a former top intelligence committee Democrat said Wednesday .
Congress agreed to give President Bush and the nation 's intelligence agencies extra authority to spy on Americans just hours before lawmakers left for a month - long recess in August .
In the legislative session 's final week , news emerged of an impending plot by foreign terrorists to attack the US Capitol , and Republicans pointed to the reports as justification to expand the administration 's powers .
" That specific intelligence claim , it turned out , was bogus ; the intelligence agencies knew that , " Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) said at a forum on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act organized by the Center for American Progress in Washington .
However , lawmakers did not learn of the claim 's unreliability until " the day " they approved the FISA expansion , she said .
Harman was among Congress 's " Gang of Eight " in 2002 when she served as ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee .
The gang was briefed in 2002 on President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program initiated after 9/11 before the New York Times revealed its existence in December 2005 .
The group comprises the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees plus each party 's leader in both parties .
Congress 's ongoing debate over how to make permanent needed modifications to FISA without trampling Americans ' civil liberties was the subject of Wednesday 's forum .
Later that afternoon , Bush toured the National Security Agency 's headquarters outside Washington and urged lawmakers to expand his authority under FISA not restrict it .
Harman , who now chairs the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment , accused the Bush administration of pursuing a " Rovian strategy of using terrorism as a wedge issue " in seeking to expand the president 's power rather than focusing on the needs of foreign surveillance .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill to push lawmakers not only to make permanent the provisions of the expansion , known as the Protect America Act , but to further limit redress against civil liberties violations by providing immunity to the telecommunications companies that facilitated the warrantless wiretapping program .
Harman said the administration 's " trust me theory " that would diminish oversight of intelligence activities was not acceptable .
Democrats and Republicans in Congress , she said , are committed to ensuring the nation 's spy agencies would be able to effectively gather intelligence from foreign suspects as long as they had assurances that Americans ' rights are protected .
" There is a deal to be made if this administration is serious , " she said .
" If it just wants this as a wedge issue , then I hope Congress will fight this with every breath that we have . "
Appearing alongside Harman at Wednesday 's forum was Bruce Fein , a constitutional lawyer and former Reagan administration official , who has emerged as a harsh critic of President Bush .
Fein noted that FISA grew out of concerns over Nixon administration scandals and revelations that foreign intelligence resources were being abused .
" Unchecked spying invariably leads to abuses in collection for political purposes , not national security purposes , " Fein said .
The danger inherent in giving Bush -- or any president -- authority to spy on Americans without oversight is that " it will be hijacked to advance a political agenda . "
Fein invoked the Founding Fathers ' warnings against concentration of power in government , and he compared the president 's arguments about how 9/11 " changed everything " to justify expanded authority to the government 's decision to lock up Japanese Americans who had committed no crimes during World War II .
The Bush administration is operating on the belief that it is " infallible , " Fein said , and the public and Congress have a right to know which activities the administration authorized so it can avoid an unconstitutional power grab .
" That 's exactly what the Founding Fathers feared : hubris , a goal to dominate and manipulate , " he said .
Fein also argued that the authority the administration is requesting would give them power beyond simply intercepting foreign - based communications , which the administration has offered as the necessity to update the law .
He argued the president could authorize warrantless searches of people 's homes or mail if it was justified as part of the " war on terror . "
A third panelist , Greg Nojeim a senior counsel to the Center for Democracy and Technology , invoked home searches as a metaphor to explain abuses that could exist even as the administration has promised to " minimize " the use of data on Americans gathered by NSA spies .
In his testimony Tuesday , McConnell acknowledged that NSA wiretaps on people abroad sometimes will pick up Americans conversatons when the foreign targets call into the US .
The use of information intercepted in this way is a crux of the debate over FISA .
To say the information is " minimized , " is akin to police breaking into an individuals home to search it and remove evidence without a warrant but then say no civil liberties were violated " as long as when they got back to the police station they threw it out , " Nojeim said .
He noted that the NSA collects and analyzes information from domestic phone calls before deciding whether to pursue a warrant for further surveillance , and he noted reports that the data was sometimes shared with other agencies .
So to say it has been " minimized " is not accurate .
" Words do n't have their normal meaning , " he said .
" Up is down , black is white ... John Ashcroft is a civil libertarian , this is the world of FISA . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government 's tax rebate stimulus is weeks away from your mailbox .
But retailers worried about a consumer slowdown are already planning several ways for you to spend that windfall in their stores .
Lowe's , the No. 2 home improvement retailer , has kicked off its spring campaign , called " Welcome Back Spring , " about three weeks early this year , getting customers primed to spend that rebate money .
" We want to get people excited about spending this spring and summer , " said Lowe 's spokeswoman Chris Ahearn , adding that the retailer was considering allowing customers to cash their rebate checks in Lowe 's stores .
J.C. Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) is also considering a check - cashing service for its customers ' rebate checks .
" We offered a similar service for our customers who received the child tax return checks back in 2003 , " spokesman Quinton Crenshaw told CNNMoney.com .
Although Crenshaw declined to offer details about any other incentives , Penney CEO Mike Ullman recently told analysts that the retailer would " obviously compete vigorously " for the stimulus money .
" It could n't happen at a better time for [ us ] because it sounds like the checks will go out over a 10 - week period , beginning in late May , which leads right into back to school [ season ] for us , " Ullman said .
Meanwhile Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) , the top home improvement merchant , is combining a green pitch with its rebate - grabbing effort .
Spokeswoman Jean Niemi said Home Depot has partnered with Rep. Brian Baird , D - Wash . , to support a resolution encouraging consumers to invest their tax rebates in their homes through energy efficient products and services .
" This effort will help turn a short term stimulus into a long - term investment by saving consumers money over time through reduced electric bills and energy costs , " Niemi said .
She said the retailer plans to offer special values on energy - efficient products like lightbulbs , home appliances and springtime projects starting in May and running through the summer .
" Retailers should n't treat the rebate money as a one - time event but as an opportunity to really build longer - term customer loyalty for their brand , " said Terrie O'Hanlon , chief marketing officer with Manhattan Associates .
O'Hanlon 's firm has been advising one - third of the nation 's top 100 retailers on just how to attract the rebate money , which is n't exactly chump change .
The tax rebate checks will distribute about $ 106 billion , or between $ 600 to $ 1,200 to some taxpayers , beginning sometime in May .
The National Retail Federation ( NRF ) estimates that about $ 43 billion of that total amount will be directly pumped into the retail sector .
" [ The ] checks should have the desired effect of both bolstering the economy in the short term and putting consumers in a better position to spend for the future , " said NRF CEO Tracy Mullin .
According to the NRF , the additional $ 43 billion spending stimulus would potentially rank as the third - biggest selling event for retailers this year , after Christmas and back - to - school spending and ahead of Valentine 's Day and Mother 's Day .
Other big chains such as Wal - Mart and Circuit City ( CC , Fortune 500 ) said they too are crafting sales strategies tied to the government rebate checks , but were not yet ready to divulge all the details .
Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien hinted that the world 's largest retailer would " continue to provide additional savings to help stretch those added dollars further this summer . "
Meanwhile , wholesale club operator Sam's Club is conducting a survey of its small - business customers this month , tied specifically to the rebate checks , to determine what prices and products appeal the most to its shoppers in the coming months .
" We want to help small business owners to use the rebate money in a way that benefits them in the long term , " said Susan Koehler said , spokeswoman for Sam's Club , which is a division of Wal - Mart .
Grocery chain operator Stop & Shop , a unit of the Dutch company Ahold ( AHONY ) , plans to lower prices " systematically in our stores , aisle by aisle , " said spokesman Robert Keane .
The retailer recently mailed its customers a discount coupon offering 5 % off groceries .
Keane said the company planned to offer more of similar promotions on those food and beverage products that have seen sharp price increase .
Although the additional stimulus may not be enough to completely prevent the overall softening in retail spending , analysts said it could at least slow down a downward spiral .
Historically , when consumers have gotten such a windfall in the past , many have used half the money to pay down " high - cost debt , " said Craig Johnson , president of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners .
Also , the higher cost of gas and energy is likely to offset the incremental benefit of the stimulus money to household budgets .
Nevertheless , Johnson advises merchants to take advantage of the stimulus package , especially since he actually anticipates a spending rebound later in the year from the combined effect of rebate checks , declining interest rates and the elimination of home heating bills .
Retailers who aggressively court consumers for their rebate money will set the tone for their business in the second half of the year , he said , which also includes the crucial fourth - quarter holiday shopping season .
Manhattan Associates ' O'Hanlon offered suggestions that could help merchants grab a bigger piece of the rebate pie .
Her first tip is for retailers to be fully stocked and to promote sales in especially hard - hit areas where consumers will get the checks and spend them in stores .
" For example , retailers with stores in Detroit , where there have been a lot of layoffs , should move inventory to where the economy is more stable and people will spend the money on impulse buys , " she said .
O'Hanlon expects many consumers will use the windfall to make " aspirational purchases " such as flatscreen TVs or pricey handbags .
" Retailers should anticipate this and do targeted marketing on these big - ticket items , " she said .
" This is one way to turn an impulse buyer into a return buyer . "

Rafael Benitez wants skilful players to receive greater protection Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez wants retrospective video evidence to be used to protect the Premier League 's most skilful players .
Benitez , whose side play at Manchester United on Sunday , made his call after Sir Alex Ferguson pleaded for protection for Cristiano Ronaldo .
He said : " I have always felt that video evidence should be used after a game for disciplinary matters .
" You can find things , you can protect players for the next game . "
Players will then know that there are cameras watching them .
The video is really important
Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez Benitez added the names of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres to the list of players he feels should receive protection .
" Everyone will see that players have to be careful , they will say ' I can't do this again because I could be banned on what the video shows ' , " he said .
" To me it is clear , you do not need to change the game , you just need to analyse what has happened .
" If players get banned for three games the first week it is done , then three games on the second week and more on the third , it will soon stop .
" It will take just a few weeks of this type of action and things will change very quickly . "
The Football Association appeared to rule out retrospective decision - making when asked if Chelsea 's Ashley Cole would receive further punishment on top of a yellow card for his foul on Spurs ' defender Alan Hutton at White Hart Lane on Wednesday .
An FA spokesman said : " We can not re-referee matches .
The player was shown a yellow card at the time and the decision is not then looked at retrospectively . "
Benitez said : " I do n't want to talk about just Ronaldo or Torres .
Skilful players must be protected .
We need to help referees and we need to look at the video afterwards to see what has happened .
" Players will then know that there are cameras watching them .
The video is really important .
You can make mistakes during a game , but the video will allow things to be analysed . "
Benitez said : " It is different talking about using technology to judge goals , which Fifa has rejected .
To use technology for incidents in a game is valid .
" If a referee gives a yellow card for a tackle , or a yellow card for use of the elbow , and then afterwards you can see the intent , then why can the decision not be changed ?
" A referee can say he made a mistake .
And the next time , the next player will not do the same . "

The Punsters United Nearly Yearly ( PUNY ) announced that the 2019 Punster of the Year ( POTY ) is Scott Hilburn , author of the syndicated comics The Argyle Sweater .
The Argyle Sweater comic appears in over 200 newspapers worldwide including the New York Daily News , The LA Times , The Washington Post and The Chicago Tribune .
His comic has also been a top selling desk calendar at Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com for over 10 years and can be found adorning the covers of greeting cards at Target and Walmart .
And last , he also has five books from his publisher , Andrews McMeel , that feature a collection of his work – including “ The Itty Bitty Knitty Committee ” and “ Puns of Steel ” .
Scott ’s been drawing since he could hold a pencil .
When he later realized he had a punchent for writing dad jokes , gags and groaners that matched well with his art style , he set out to make a career of it through newspaper syndication .
The world has been laughing ( and shaking their heads ) ever since .
Before becoming a newspaper cartoonist , Scott worked in multimedia creation for various telecom companies .
He also once worked for an underwear manufacturer but the job was brief .
It ’s Scott ’s first year of involvement with the O. Henry Pun -Off , but he is looking forward to many more years of being a pun in the ass .
I ’m not a hot shot programmer by any means , but I ’ve done quite a bit of playing around with getting data in and out of databases programmatically .
Something that ’s always confused me is the near - religion of data normalization among programmers and database admins .
Every developer I ’ve ever worked with has told me that when you ’re building a database , you need to normalize your data — basically this means organizing your data in such a way that removes redundancy — and failure to do so would result in public ridicule and possible revocation of access to any computing device .
But I ’ve always wondered , given that hard drives are cheap and getting cheaper , what ’s the problem with using more storage space in exchange for greater speed ?
I was delighted when I read Cal Henderson ’s take on normalized data from a recent talk he gave about Flickr ( from page 27 ) :
- Normalised data is for sissies
- Keep multiple copies of data around
- Makes searching faster
- Have to ensure consistency in the application logic
To which I would add : hard drives are cheap .
Cal presents normalization as a trade - off that , depending on your circumstances , might be worth looking at …which is a much more useful way of approaching the situation than what I ’ve typically heard ( normalize or die ! ) .
Want faster access to your data ?
Replicate it in the database but be aware that it ’ll cost you some storage space and you ’ll need to keep track of the extra data in your application ( which can be a pain in the ass ) .
In Flickr ’s case , they have 13 SELECTs for every INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE statement hitting their database .
Normalization can slow SELECT speed down while denormalization makes your I /D / Us more complicated and slower .
Since the application part of Flickr depends so heavily on SELECTs from the database , it makes sense for them to denormalize their data somewhat to speed things up .
Here ’s an analogy for the smokers in the audience … what sucks worse than realizing you left your lighter at home and you ’re stuck in traffic on the way to the office ?
The solution is to buy a bunch of lighters , one for your car , one for your coat pocket , one for the drawer in your office , one for your purse , etc .
It ’s a trade - off .
Your initial cash investment is greater ( but lighters , like hard drives , are cheap ) and you need to be diligent about leaving each lighter in its proper place , but you ’re never without a lighter when you need one .

The title may sound dramatic , but it is very descriptive .
New observations of two galaxies have shown huge streams of stars , not belonging inside those galaxies , reaching out into space .
These streams are all that are left of galaxies that are now dead , eaten by their cannibal neighbour , now sitting in their place .
The streams form an eerie halo around their killers , looking like ghosts of their former selves …
So what happened to these ill - fated galaxies ?
Galactic cannibalism is what happened .
In both examples , large spiral galaxies have overrun smaller dwarf galaxies , devouring most of their stars .
All that is left are the huge fossilized remains in the form of a tenuous distribution of dim , old , metal - poor stars .
Judging by the lack of galactic structure in these “ ghosts ” , the cannibalizing spiral galaxies have been very efficient at eating their smaller dwarf cousins .
The debris surrounding NGC 5907 ( approximately 40 million light - years from Earth ) extends 150,000 light - years across ( pictured top ) .
NGC 5907 destroyed one of its dwarf satellite galaxies at least 4,000 million years ago , consuming the stars , star clusters and dark matter , leaving only a small number of old stars behind to form a complicated criss - cross pattern of galactic fossils .
“ Our results provide a fresh insight into this spectacular phenomenon surrounding spiral galaxies and show that haloes contain fossil dwarf galaxies , thus providing us with a unique opportunity to study the final stages in the assembly of galaxies like ours . ” – David MartÃ­nez , from the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias ( IAC ) leading the team that carried out these observations .
In the second spiral galaxy , NGC 4013 ( 50 million light - years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major ) , the ghost of another dead dwarf galaxy stretches 80,000 light - years across and is made up of old stars .
Its 3D geometry is unknown , but it has similar characteristics to the Monoceros tidal stream which surrounds the Milky Way .
The Monoceros tidal stream is a ring of stars , originating from a local dwarf galaxy that was eaten by our galaxy over 3,000 million years ago .
These images have a huge amount of science to offer researchers .
Primarily , the detection of these galactic fossils confirms the predictions of the cold dark matter model of cosmology , which describes how the large spiral galaxies were formed from merging stellar systems .
“ … fitting theoretical models to these star streams enables us to reconstruct their history and describe one of the most mysterious and controversial components of galaxies : dark matter . ” – Jorge PeÃ±arrubia , theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Victoria ( Canada ) who is working on this project .

If you use someone else 's WiFi signal without permission , you 're a thief .
That 's the conclusion of a bill introduced into the Maryland General Assembly last week .
Sponsored by Delegate LeRoy E. Myers , Jr. , the legislation would criminalize the unauthorized use of a wireless access point in the state ; it has since received an " unfavorable report " by the House Judiciary Committee , which all but dooms its prospects of passage .
The bill 's purpose is to prohibit anyone from accessing a wireless access point " intentionally , willfully , and without authorization . "
It appears to ban both everyday WiFi leeching and using an open access point for more nefarious activities .
And if you live in a Maryland neighborhood with broadband usage caps , it would be illegal to deliberately cause someone to overuse their bandwidth allotment .
Violators would be subject to fines of up to $ 1,000 and three years in jail , unless they tried to hack into a password - protected system or used their unauthorized access for mischief .
Then the penalties could climb to $ 10,000 and 10 years in prison .
With 802.11b/g/n technology becoming widespread over the past several years , there has been a corresponding rise in cases of people being arrested for using open access points without permission .
One of the first cases came in 2005 when a Florida man was convicted of accessing a computer network without authorization .
He was arrested and charged with the third - degree felony after the WAP 's owner discovered him surfing in an SUV outside of their home .
There have been other cases , including an Illinois man who pleaded guilty to remotely accessing a computer system without permission in 2006 and a Michigan man who parked his car in front of a café and used its free WiFi service — without even ordering so much as a latte .
When combined , it 's a troubling trend of law enforcement and politicians overreacting to what is generally a harmless activity .
In the case of Delegate Myers , the legislation was prompted by his neighbor 's use of Myer 's WiFi connection without permission , according to Maryland newspaper The Herald - Mail .
Apparently , Myers had n't bothered to password - protect his WAP or use rudimentary security precautions .
The proposal of the bill suggests that Myers would rather see this legislated than learn how to set up wireless security .
Sanity appears to reign in Maryland , however .
The Maryland public defender 's office is opposing the bill , noting the widespread availability of WiFi networks .
" A technically unsophisticated user , such as a visiting parent , or simply a houseguest unfamiliar with the home 's Internet could and probably would choose the first available network , " the office noted in a filing .
The public defender makes the obvious point ( one that seems to have escaped Myers ) that those wanting to prevent unauthorized access should enable routers ' built - in security functions .
It 's so easy that there 's no excuse for not doing it .
Of course , some people do n't mind sharing their WiFi connections .
In a piece I did earlier this year on the ethics of using unprotected wireless access points , I mentioned a friend who left his WAP unsecured as a public service .
If people do n't bother to protect their networks , there 's no way of telling whether or not they want others to use it .
Using an open WAP to cause harm should be punished in the same way as other nefarious hacking activities , using one to check e-mail , surf the ' Net , or read RSS should not be punished at all .
Thankfully , the Maryland House Judiciary Committee appears to have more common sense than Del. Leroy Myers .
That said , we probably have n't see the last of such bills .

主要な変 更
最大の改良点は以下のとおりである。 フルコンパイラで、RubyコードをJavaバイトコードに変換する
IOサブシステムが再書き込みされ、Rubyの振る舞いにますます適合する
Regexp新エンジンが、大幅に改善されたパフォーマンスで、Rubyのストリングをサポートする
全体的なパフォーマンスは、1.0のリリースの何倍も優れている
Ruby 1.8.6との互換性の実現のために、莫大な数の修正を重ねた。JRubyは、間違いなく最も互換性のあるサードパーティインプリメンテーションで、今後も長期間にわたってそうであり続ける。
パフォーマン ス
一般的 なRubyコードは、非常に高速に実行する。特に通常の式を大量に使用している場合は特にそうである。概して、RubyコードがRuby 1.8.6よりJRubyで高速に実行しない場合、バグとみなす。したがって他に潜んでいる障害を除去するため、バグレポートを探している。
JIT
パフォーマンス向 上
基本的に、通常の式エンジンはOnigurumaの完全なポートで、Ruby 1.9が使用するRegexエンジンである。ポートは、Marcin Mielżyński氏によってなされ、パフォーマンスが優れている。またOnigurumaオリジナルに未だ残っているバグの修正もおこなう。
その新たな実装によって、他のどんなJavaベースのRegexエンジンよりも優れたパフォーマンスが可能でありながら、
Ruby 1.8および Ruby 1.9との互換性も極めて良い。RegexおよびStringメソッドのほとんどが、完全に再実行されていて、新しいエンジンを効果的に使用する。
Rubyのストリングは、単なるバイトの集合であるので、JRubyはJavaのバイト配列で実装する。このことが原因で、Javaの通常の式エンジンが
適切に実行することはなく、すべてのregexp操作はbyte[ ]をchar[]およびbackに変換する必要があった。しかし、JRubyコミッター の 1人であ るMarcin Mielzynski氏は、Onigurumaのポートに取り組んだ。それは、Ruby 1.9で多く使用されるバイトベースのエンコードにとらわれない通常の式エンジンである。「Joni」ライブラリのおかげで、これまでになく素晴らしい
regexpサポートがある。そして基本的にはすべてのregexpパフォーマンスの問題は解決している。偉大な作業の結果であり、それに対する貢献は素 晴らしいものである。
今後のリリー ス
現 在[ 1.9 ]
は、開発リリースであるため、たいして影響を及ぼさない。役立つ2つの方法がある。1つは、1.9の機能はさらに安定しているので、
JRubyへの機能追加を適切に、簡単におこなえる。次に、1.9の本当の意味でのパフォーマンスの進歩を見出し始めているので、基本的にすべてのベンチ
マークにおいて1.8を越えた今となっては、それと比較するという良い目標がある。.
JRubyへの1.9の機能の追加をすでに開始しており、それを継続的におこなっていく。もちろん、訂正や修正が最優先である。しかしたとえば、Onigurumaポートがストリングなどへのエンコードサポートの追加を容易にする。
2.0については、それほど取り上げてこなかった。個人的には、1.9および1.8に完全準拠するリリースは、2.0だと踏んでいる。1.2に関しては、
Javaの統合と外部APIの統合に取り組む予定である。今のところJavaの統合機能は実にうまく進んでいるが、実装上でいくつかホールがあり、その他
に非効率的な側面もあるので、サブシステムの徹底的な総点検を計画しているところである。もちろんこれは大掛かりな作業であるが、そのことで得られる向上
もかなり大きいものである。
おおむねすべての分野でパフォーマンスの向上は期待できるが、スタックベースのローカル変数がセーフ、評価されていない、暴走がおこっていないと統計的に
判断することができる分野が、最も向上が期待できる。これらのメソッドで、コンパイラーから大幅な向上が実現でき、それらがプログラムでホットスポットで
ある場合、一般的なランタイムが大幅に向上する。
JRuby 1.1の後に、検討したい分野は1.9のサポートとJavaのさらに優れた統合である。その作業は、結局JRuby 1.2になるか、JRuby 2.0には十分大きすぎるかもしれない。そしてもちろん、パフォーマンスの向上は継続しておこない、一歩抜きん出ているように努める。しかし現在はかなり 満足している。 JRuby 1.1がリリースされてしばらくした後、Ruby 1.9機能での作業を検討している。しかしながら、その分野で莫大な時間を費やす前に、1.9の機能セットが安定するのを見たい。1.9機能の変更を来年もずっと追跡するようなことは本当にしたくない。特に1.9が急速に進化しているようだからである。
JVM
動的言語
JVM の動的言語の潜在性を何としても公開する必要があると思う。もしそれが、新たな、ひょっとしたらOpenJDKの非互換の「フォーク」を作成するこ
とを意味するならば、それでよい。そのような作業がJavaに適切に統合することができないわけはなく、開発されるのを待っている本当に驚くほど素晴らし

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : Sessions 2008.5.2
Howdy , I 'm pleased to announce the general availability of Session Types for Haskell , version 2008.5.2 .
It is available from my website [ 0 ] , Hackage [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and I 've just updated the online tutorial [ 3 ] to take into account the recent changes and new features . [ 0 ]

Session types are a means of describing communication between multiple threads , and statically verifying that the communication being performed is safe and conforms to the specification .
The library supports multiple , concurrent channels being open and actions upon those channels being interleaved ; forking new threads ; the communication of process IDs , allowing threads to establish new channels between each other ; higher - order channels , allowing an established channel to be sent over a channel to another process ; and many other features common to session type systems .
The significant new changes in this version are : a ) an entirely new means to specify session types .
This removes the old absolute indexing , is composeable and far more flexible and powerful than the old system .
b) support for higher - order channels and session types allowing channels to be sent and received .
This permits additional communication patterns such as two threads which are otherwise unaware of each other being able to communicate with one another by sending and receiving a channel via a common third party - delegation .
Tests [ 4 ] and an example application [ 5 ] are available which should , in combination with the tutorial [ 6 ] , explain how session types can be used .
As ever , any feedback is very gratefully received . [ 4 ]

BOGOTA , March 26 ( Reuters ) - Colombia said it seized at least 66 pounds ( 30 kg ) of uranium from the country 's biggest left - wing rebel group on Wednesday , the first time radioactive material has been linked to the four - decade - old guerrilla war .
The uranium was found in a rural area long considered a Marxist guerrilla stronghold just south of the capital Bogota .
It is being examined by government experts , the defense ministry said in a statement , although it did not say where the material came from or what it could be used for .
An expert on Colombia 's cocaine - fueled conflict said rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , do not have the facilities needed to make a bomb with uranium .
" This appears to have been part of a black market operation that the guerrillas were trying to use to make money , " said Pablo Casas , an analyst at Bogota think - tank Security and Democracy .
" This is new for Colombia and could bring the FARC into the major leagues of black market terrorist transactions , " he said .
The government said information about the stash of uranium was found earlier this month in computer files left behind by top guerrilla leader Raul Reyes , who was killed in a Colombian bomb strike against a FARC camp in neighboring in Ecuador .
The March 1 raid sparked a major diplomatic dispute between Colombia 's President Alvaro Uribe , a conservative ally of the United States , and the left - wing leaders of Ecuador and Venezuela .
Colombia also claims the files show evidence that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has given financial support to the FARC .
The United States , which calls the FARC a terrorist group and has long considered Chavez a destabilizing force in Latin America , said the evidence is " disturbing " .
Chavez openly sympathizes with the FARC but says Colombia 's accusations are part of a U.S. - backed plot to smear him .
He has also questioned how the computer files could have survived the bombing raid .
The FARC took up arms in the 1960s and is now funded mostly by cocaine smuggling and extortion .
The group says it is fighting a Marxist insurgency meant to close the wide gap that separates rich and poor in this Andean country .
" No one believes the FARC wants to blow up Bogota to further the revolution , " said a diplomat based in the capital who asked not to be named .
" This seems more like a black market action than military action .
It shows again how the FARC is behaving more like an organized crime group than a political group , " the diplomat said .
The war kills , maims and displaces thousands of Colombians every year .

You hear constantly that China is a country of young people  the average age is 33  but you really see it in business , where just about everybody seems to be under the age of 40 .
For people over the age of 50 , sadly , as Mr. Feng said , they had no chance .
The risk - taking impulse , and so much else , was crushed by the Cultural Revolution .
Secondly , it ’s a reminder just how quickly China ’s economic rebirth has taken place .
Mao Zedong died in 1976 .
Four years later , the country ’s first special economic zone , explicitly created to encourage entrepreneurial capitalism , was established in the southern city of Shenzhen .
What China has done in less than three decades is nothing short of astonishing .
As Byron Wien , the chief investment strategist for Pequot Capital Management , wrote last summer , “ Nothing I have read , heard or seen will dissuade me from my view that China has made more economic progress in the last 30 years than any country in history . ”
It is impossible to visit today ’s China and disagree .
Third , modern China surely shows that trickle - down economics is not just supply - side propaganda .
Deng Xiaoping , the driving force behind the move to capitalism after Mao ’s death , famously said , “ To get rich is glorious . ”
And goodness knows , lots of people have gotten rich .
But look at what else happened : motivated by the prospect of wealth , people started companies .
And as those companies succeeded , millions of new jobs were created .
In Shanghai  a place with more entrepreneurial energy than any place I ’ve ever visited , including Silicon Valley in the 1990s and Houston during the 1980s oil boom  you can practically see wealth being created before your very eyes .
If Shanghai does n’t make you a believer in the power of capitalism to improve lives , nothing will .
Yes , in much of China , the deal is still a pretty raw one for most laborers , who live far from their families , working under arduous conditions for low wages .
And like most first - time visitors , I was appalled by the pollution , especially in Beijing .
( Are they really going to run a marathon there ? )
But even these problems are beginning to get attention , as the country moves to higher - value products , and as the environment becomes a public policy priority , thanks in part to the Olympics .
Tests of Russia ’s new Bulava - M ( NATO reporting name SS - NX - 30 ) sea-launched ballistic missile will be completed in 2008 , the Navy commander said on Friday .
“ The missile will fly , and will fly this year , ” Adm. Vladimir Vysotsky told journalists .
He linked the missile ’s previous unsuccessful launches to technical problems , which “ can be resolved . ”
The Bulava , designed by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology , will be carried by Borei- class Project 955 nuclear powered submarines , each to be outfitted with sixteen missiles .
Exercising its contractual right to raise prices , VeriSign is once again increasing the base registration fees for .com and .net domain names .
It 's the second increase in as many years since the company extended its control of those two TLDs in 2006 .
Currently , registrars pay VeriSign $ 6.42 per .com domain and $ 3.85 for .net domains .
Come October , those prices will increase to $ 6.86 and $ 4.23 , respectively .
Those price hikes are the maximum 7 percent allowable ( to the penny ) under VeriSign 's contract ( which runs through 2012 ) with ICANN .
Chances are , registrars will pass the price increase on to customers .
In a press release justifying the higher prices , VeriSign cited increases in the amount of traffic and cyber attacks on the global TLD infrastructure it is responsible for .
The company says it is boosting infrastructure capacity ten - fold by 2010 via its Project Titan , as well as increasing DNS capacity from 400 billion daily queries to over four trillion , even though it currently only processes a peak of 33 billion queries per day under current conditions .
It also helps that the ICANN has given VeriSign a monopoly over the .com and .net TLDs , allowing the company to jack prices up each year .
At least ICANN had the foresight to mandate a 7 percent annual cap on increases , putting a limit on the amount of pain VeriSign can inflict on registrars each year .
Assuming that VeriSign continues the 7 percent rise each year ( which seems reasonable given the company 's history ) , registrars will be looking at $ 9.00 for .com domains by the time the current contract ends in 2012 — a 50 percent increase in six years .
Per the agreement ICANN made with VeriSign in 2006 , VeriSign is required to provide notice of rate hikes in registration costs at least six months in advance , so the pain wo n't be felt by registrars for a few more months .
Those registrars have not been happy about the ICANN - VeriSign pact , with Network Solutions calling it a " de facto perpetual monopoly . "
VeriSign sure is acting like one .
' Telepathic ray guns ' that beam voices into the target 's skull .
Weapons to disrupt balance or cause artificial fevers .
Devices to trigger epileptic - type seizures from afar .
Those are just a few of the exotic items described in a 1998 Army document , describing the " Bioeffects Of Selected Nonlethal Weapons . "
I give my take in this week 's New Scientist .
The document is a run-down of the state - of - the - art at the time of the different directed energy technologies ( laser , microwaves and acoustics ) that might be developed into effective nonlethal weapons .
It took a few weeks get the article out –- Sharon descibed it in Danger Room earlier – because my editors wanted to confirm that the document was for real .
It looks as though it was released under the Freedom Of Information Act – but how could we be sure ?
Under other circumstances there might not be any issue , but in the area of directed - energy nonlethals there are a lot of wild claims .
The FOIA document came from Donald Friedman , one of a large number of ' targeted individuals ' who believe that they are secretly being harassed by such weapons .
This court report indicates the depth of Friedman 's conviction :
* On January 30 , 2003 , Donald Friedman walked into an
FBI field office with a two - page letter signed by him and addressed to
Special Agent Jack Murmylo of the United States Secret Service .
Friedman 's letter states , in part : * " Agents of the U.S. Secret
Service , as you already know , have been committing very serious crimes against me and other members of my family for a very long time , and I 'm taking more direct action to prevent it from continuing . "
" I
am going to get an admissible confession from at least one of your agents one way or the other , and if I do n't get what I am demanding from you today , I will use the method of torture described in the attached pages to obtain that confession and to punish the agent for his or her involvement in the illegal acts that your agents have perpetrated against me and my family . "
The report notes that the method of torture described ( copied from a Robert Ludlum novel )
involved putting electric shocks through the victim 's spinal column .
After he was arrested , the court found the evidence for the alleged electromagnetic assaults unconvincing :
* The district court then held a competency hearing at which Friedman testified , inter alia , that the back of a pair of his shoes were vaporized by an electromagnetic weapon fired at his feet in
2001 .
Friedman presented the shoes in question to the district court , but it appeared to the court that the heel of the shoe had simply worn out due to ordinary use . *
Inevitably , Friedman 's mental status was questioned :
After receiving this report , Friedman requested that he be examined by a medical professional of his own choosing .
The psychologist chosen by Friedman concurred with the government 's psychiatrist that Friedman " is clearly psychotic and ... precisely fits the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia . "
On this basis , it looks like an open - and - shut case .
It 's very easy to poke fun at people like Friedman .
On the other hand , it does show that if a nonlethal device ever was developed which could cause symptoms associated with madness , it would be completely deniable .
The device would completely destroy the target 's credibility , neatly ensuring it remained covert .
The military utility would be low , but it might be very hand for some three - letter agencies .
However , in this case , we have a bit more to go on .
The US Army Intelligence And Security Command Freedom Of Information / Privacy Officeconfirmed that Friedman 's FOIA request was real .
And the while the contents certainly do n't reveal any shoe - zapping beam weapons , they did turn up a much higher level of interest in unusual technology than anyone had seen before .
How had Friedman managed to get this information when many other more conventional researchers had failed ?
Targeted individuals and their supporters might argue that it shows Friedman is close to the truth .
But perhaps the problem is that the rest of us are not paranoid enough , and that when it comes to military research , the truth is not only stanger than we imagine – it is stranger than we can imagine .
The response to our second reader photo challenge was great , and we got a ton of hilarious submissions !
We 're posting most of them here , and all of them on our Flickr page .
Enjoy !
Anatomically - inclined business names
We had so many submissions in this category , we were actually able to organize them by body part :
We received two pictures of Massachusetts liquor stores named " Bunghole , " from Cody ( above , in Peabody ) and Sabrina ( below , in Salem ) .
According to Wikipedia , " a bunghole is a hole bored in a liquid - tight barrel , " though it 's been used as naughty slang since at least the 13th century ( famously making an appearance in Dante 's Inferno ) .
We also got two pictures of the same business , from readers Kati and Laura -- the unfortunately - named Analtech in Newark , Delaware .
( I 'm sure it 's pronounced an - AL - tech , guys .
Jeez , grow up ! )
Jocelyn sent us a snap of Oregon 's own T&A Supply Co. , which judging from their name , keeps Nevada well - stocked with pasties and stripper poles .
This package store is just outside of Atlanta .
( Thanks , Lucy ! )
Furniture guaranteed to keep you up at night .
( Heh. Sorry . )
Puntastic business names
The hair weaves in Pine Bluff , Arkansas are beyond belief .
( Thanks to Darcie ! )
This had to be intentional .
Right ?
( From Josh and Joanna Burress , taken near Kokomo , Indiana . )
Caroline Hanke sent in this picture of a really full - service gas station .
Unfortunate business names
From reader Katherine : tanning for the truly pale .
Kelly found this sign in southern Indiana .
( Just because you own the place does n't mean you have to name it after yourself . )
From Mindy , the least popular furniture store in Mason City , Iowa .
Joe Warner writes that this business in Acworth , Georgia was torn down a few years ago .
I guess the formula just was n't working .
Asian restaurants
There could 've been thousands of pictures in this column , but we liked these three the best .
From J.J. in Poughkeepsie :
In Bath , Maine ( thanks , Austin ) :
Reader Christine pointed out this photo of San Diego 's own Pho King ( it 's pronounced fuh ) , taken by the gourmands at mmm-yoso !
There are lots of these places in Los Angeles , but apparently people in other parts of the world ( like reader Tori ) think that donuts and Chinese food make strange platefellows :
Just plain odd
There 's really no other way to classify these .
What were they thinking ?
More weirdness from Darcie in Pine Bluff , Arkansas :
Discount caskets ?
( I hope they 're not used . )
Thanks , Alyssa !
Sarah sent us this shot from Shreveport , Louisiana .
She hoped this was a sign for an exterminator business , but needless to say , did n't go inside to investigate .
Laura found this on vacation in Phoenix about 15 years ago .
Cute !
Georgetown 's own Moby Dick Kabob .
( Say that five times fast . )
Thanks to Luz .
On - purpose weird business names
When you have no marketing budget , sometimes the best way to get the word out about your business is by giving it a ridiculous name .
We 're pretty sure that 's what happened to these fine establishments .
From Kevin :
A Phillipsburg , Kansas restaurant found by Alyssa :
A guy who got tired of answering the question " what kind of stuff do you sell ? "
From Jocelyn :
More peculiarity from Pine Bluff :
A frozen yogurt place in Salt Lake ( thanks Devora ) , whose motto appears to be " no spooning on Sundays ! "
Bars
There seems to be a long - standing tradition of giving bizarre names to drinking establishments .
Here are a few .
Nothing special about this Lancaster , Ohio saloon ( thanks , Sheya ) :
Live nude cattle in Star Valley , Arizona .
( Thanks , Susan . )
Both the name and logo of this business seem to celebrate drunk driving :
Just around the corner from the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City ( thanks , Jessica ) :
Google Maps - Long Drives
22 Comments +
I set out to find the longest distance for which Google Maps would give Driving Directions .
Now that they 've shut down the fun " swim the Atlantic " feature , things have changed a bit .
It turns out there are multiple " longest drives " , because the Google Maps World is partitioned ( many countries do n't support driving directions ) , and sometimes ferries are included , and sometimes they are not .
In order of distance , here are the seven longest drives I found .
If you can better any of them , please add yours to the comments ( please use TinyURL to shorten up the giant URLs ) .
North America , Unalaska , AK , USA to Southern Newfoundland , Canada - 7,267 mi ( 11,695 km ) - about 6 days 15 hours - 100 stepsEurope - West Canary Islands , Spain to Hammingberg , Norway - 4,425 mi ( 7,122 km ) - about 4 days 8 hours - 156 stepsBrazil - Northern Amazon Basin , Para to Chui , Rio Grande do Sul - 3,719 mi ( 5,985 km ) - about 3 days 5 hours - 100 stepsAustralia - Cape Bruny , Tasmania to Mardie , Western Australia - 3,474 mi ( 5,591 km ) - about 3 days 4 hours - 93 stepsJapan - Soya , Hokkaido to Tomai , Kagoshima Prefecture - 1,480 mi ( 2,382 km ) - about 1 day , 12 hours - 10 steps ( mostly by train ) New Zealand - Cape Reinga to Milford Sound - 1,400 mi ( 2,253 km ) - about 1 day 8 hours - 205 stepsHong Kong - Shek Pik to Wu kau Tang - 48 mi ( 77.3 km ) - about 1 hour 28 mins - 20 steps

As dispatch rider Alex Ross travelled through the hostile Egyptian desert , deep behind enemy lines , his few mementos of home must have meant the world to him .
So his horror at realising the pannier containing them had fallen off his motorcycle during one of his dangerous missions can easily be imagined .
There the lost bag lay , covered by the shifting sands of the Western Desert ... until an astonishing discovery 65 years on .
Tour guide Khaled Makram spotted it by the side of a track in a remote corner of the country .
Inside were all Signalman Ross 's long - lost possessions , including his pay book , puttees , photographs , Christmas cards , dog-tags and letters from his family - and two different girlfriends .
With the help of a Scottish tourist , Mr Makram has been able to reveal his find to the family of Mr Ross , who died three years ago aged 87 .
Now they are hoping to be able to bring his belongings back to England , more than six decades after he returned from his wartime service without them .
Among them were letters written by his sister Irene when she was eight .
Yesterday , aged 75 , she spoke of her amazement at seeing them again after all that time .
" I was astonished when I heard that Alex 's bag had been found after 65 years and that it was in such good condition , " she said .
" The bag still contains all the letters that I and the rest of my family sent as well as a spare cap and his Army equipment . "

Mr Ross grew up in Burnley and , having joined the Royal Signals in 1935 , he was posted to North Africa following the German desert offensive .
By 1942 , he was part of a special forces unit known as Popski's Private Army , linked to the legendary Long Range Desert Group - whose men staged daring behind - the - lines attacks on Rommel 's fuel supplies .
Scroll down for more ...
At the time he lost his khaki- coloured canvas pannier , Signalman Ross was travelling through the isolated plateau of Gilf Kebir , hundreds of miles inland , where the unit had a supply dump .
The spot is close to the Cave of Swimmers , which features in the the novel - and subsequent film - The English Patient .
There it lay until Mr Makram found it this summer .
Scroll down for more ...
With the help of tourist Geoff Kolbe , from Newcastleton in the Scottish Borders , they were able to find an article on the Internet written by Mr Ross 's sister , now Irene Porter , and complete the extraordinary story behind its loss .
After the war , Mr Ross settled in Buckinghamshire , where he worked for the Diplomatic Corps and met his wife Lillian - who still lives in the county .
The couple had two daughters .
Scroll down for more ...
His sister has been sent photographs of his belongings , and she is now hoping to raise money for Mr Makram to fly to England with the bag and its contents .
" I will be so pleased when I can actually hold the letters in my hand and feel something my mother actually wrote to Alex all those years ago , " she said .
" I just wish the bag had been found a few years earlier so that Alex could have been reunited with its contents .
" He would have been thrilled - if a little embarrassed about having had two girlfriends on the go . "

A small handful of great individuals are not content to get their names in the footnotes of history and then quietly expire .
No , these brave few achieve greatness and then top it off by kicking the bucket in a way so ridiculously implausible that people would have talked about them for years even if they had n't done anything else .
These are five historical figures who died deaths that would make sure their names were written just a little bit bigger in the history books .

President Felix Faure : Sexed to Death Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Think of him as the William Howard Taft of French presidents , both in his relative innocuousness and in terms of facial hair .
He was nominated to run for president because his party wanted someone as plain vanilla as possible in order to avoid controversy .
Faure seemed to fit the bill perfectly .
Until the day he died , that is .
Cause of death :
Bow - chicka - bow - wow .
On February 16 , 1899 , French president Felix Faure decided to make a booty call in his own office .
Now who would have the privilege of receiving such a dubious invitation ?
None other than Marguerite Steinheil , a total babe who was not unlike the neighborhood bicycle , if you get our drift .
Right about when they were reaching the petit mort ( French for orgasm )
Faure had himself a grand mort ( French for having a fatal stroke right in the middle of orgasm ) .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
We 've been making arrangements to see that we meet our makers in more or less the exact same way .
Marguerite then went on to sleep with a number of other famous dudes including King Sisowath of Cambodia .
Now we aint ' sayin ' she 's a gold digger , but she really decided not mess around with the lower income bracket .
Still , congrats to Faure .
Not only did he die happy , but he also died the way he lived : serving as a symbol to the world for the people of France , where infidelity in the workplace is what hockey is to Canada .
And who would n't want to help him shuffle off his pants / mortal coil ?
Guy had the bitchingest mustache in all of Western Europe .

Mystery : why is it that some of the biggest IT consulting companies in the world do the worst work ?
Why is it that the cool upstart consulting companies start out with a string of spectacular successes , meteoric growth , and rapidly degenerate into mediocrity ?
I ’ve been thinking about this , and thinking about how Fog Creek Software ( my own company ) should grow .
And the best lessons I can find come from McDonald’s .
Yes , I mean the awful hamburger chain .
The secret of Big Macs is that they ’re not very good , but every one is not very good in exactly the same way .
If you ’re willing to live with not - very - goodness , you can have a Big Mac with absolutely no chance of being surprised in the slightest .
The other secret of Big Macs is that you can have an IQ that hovers somewhere between “ idiot ” and “ moron ” ( to use the technical terms ) and you ’ll still be able to produce Big Macs that are exactly as unsurprising as all the other Big Macs in the world .
That ’s because McDonald ’s real secret sauce is its huge operations manual , describing in stunning detail the exact procedure that every franchisee must follow in creating a Big Mac .
If a Big Mac hamburger is fried for 37 seconds in Anchorage , Alaska , it will be fried for 37 seconds in Singapore – not 36 , not 38 .
To make a Big Mac you just follow the damn rules .
The rules have been carefully designed by reasonably intelligent people ( back at McDonald ’s Hamburger University ) so that dumdums can follow them just as well as smart people .
In fact the rules include all kinds of failsafes , like bells that go off if you keep the fries in the oil too long , which were created to compensate for more than a little human frailty .
There are stopwatches and timing systems everywhere .
There is a system to make sure that the janitor checks if the bathrooms are clean every half hour .
( Hint : they ’re not . )
The system basically assumes that everybody will make a bunch of mistakes , but the burgers that come out will be , um , consistent , and you ’ll always be asked if you want fries with that .
Just for the sake of amusement , let ’s compare a McDonald ’s cook , who is following a set of rules exactly and does n’t know anything about food , to a genius like The Naked Chef , the British cutie Jamie Oliver .
( If you chose to leave this site now and follow that link to watch the MTV - like videos of The Naked Chef making basil aioli , you have my blessing .
Go in good health . )
Anyway , comparing McDonald ’s to a gourmet chef is completely absurd , but please suspend disbelief for a moment , because there ’s something to be learned here .
Now , the Naked Chef does n’t follow no stinkin’ Operations Manual .
He does n’t measure anything .
While he ’s cooking , you see a flurry of food tossed around willy - nilly .
“ We ’ll just put a bit of extra rosemary in there , that wo n’t hurt , and give it a good old shake , ” he says . ” Mash it up .
Perfect .
Just chuck it all over the place . ”
( Yes , it really looks like he ’s just chucking it all over the place .
Sorry , but if I tried to chuck it all over the place , it would n’t work . )
It takes about 14 seconds and he ’s basically improvised a complete gourmet meal with roasted slashed fillet of sea-bass stuffed with herbs , baked on mushroom potatoes with a salsa - verde .
Yum .
Well , I think it ’s pretty obvious that The Naked Chef ’s food is better than you get at McDonald’s .
Even if it sounds like a stupid question , it ’s worth a minute to ask why .
It ’s not such a stupid question .
Why ca n’t a big company with zillions of resources , incredible scale , access to the best food designers money can buy , and infinite cash flow produce a nice meal ?
Imagine that The Naked Chef gets bored doing “ telly ” and opens a restaurant .
Of course , he ’s a brilliant chef , the food would be incredible , so the place is hopping with customers and shockingly profitable .
When you have a shockingly profitable restaurant , you quickly realize that even if you fill up every night , and even if you charge $ 19 for an appetizer and $ 3.95 for a coke , your profits reach a natural limit , because one chef can only make so much food .
So you hire another chef , and maybe open some more branches , maybe in other cities .
Now a problem starts to develop : what we in the technical fields call the scalability problem .
When you try to clone a restaurant , you have to decide between hiring another great chef of your caliber ( in which case , that chef will probably want and expect to keep most of the extra profits that he created , so why bother ) , or else you ’ll hire a cheaper , younger chef who ’s not quite as good , but pretty soon your patrons will figure that out and they wo n’t go to the clone restaurant .
The common way of dealing with the scalability problem is to hire cheap chefs who do n’t know anything , and give them such precise rules about how to create every dish that they “ can’t ” screw it up .
Just follow these here rules , and you ’ll make great gourmet food !
Problem : it does n’t work exactly right .
There are a million things that a good chef does that have to do with improvisation .
A good chef sees some awesome mangos in the farmer ’s market and improvises a mango - cilantro salsa for the fish of the day .
A good chef deals with a temporary shortage of potatoes by creating some taro chip thing .
An automaton chef who is merely following instructions might be able to produce a given dish when everything is working perfectly , but without real talent and skill , will not be able to improvise , which is why you never see jicama at McDonald’s .
McDonald ’s requires a very particular variety of potato , which they grow all over the world , and which they pre-cut and freeze in massive quantities to survive shortages .
The precutting and freezing means that the french - fries are not as good as they could be , but they are certainly consistent and require no chef - skills .
In fact , McDonald ’s does hundreds of things to make sure that their product can be produced with consistent quality , by any moron you can get in the kitchen , even if the quality is “ a bit ” lower .
Summary , so far :
Some things need talent to do really well .
It ’s hard to scale talent .
One way people try to scale talent is by having the talent create rules for the untalented to follow .
The quality of the resulting product is very low .
You can see the exact same story playing out in IT consulting .
How many times have you heard this story ?
Mike was unhappy .
He had hired a huge company of IT consultants to build The System .
The IT consultants he hired were incompetents who kept talking about “ The Methodology ” and who spent millions of dollars and had failed to produce a single thing .
Luckily , Mike found a youthful programmer who was really smart and talented .
The youthful programmer built his whole system in one day for $ 20 and pizza .
Mike was overjoyed .
He recommended the youthful programmer to all his friends .
Youthful Programmer starts raking in the money .
Soon , he has more work than he can handle , so he hires a bunch of people to help him .
The good people want too many stock options , so he decides to hire even younger programmers right out of college and “ train them ” with a 6 week course .
The trouble is that the “ training ” does n’t really produce consistent results , so Youthful Programmer starts creating rules and procedures that are meant to make more consistent results .
Over the years , the rule book grows and grows .
Soon it ’s a six - volume manual called The Methodology .
After a few dozen years , Youthful Programmer is now a Huge Incompetent IT Consultant with a capital - M- methodology and a lot of people who blindly obey the Methodology , even when it does n’t seem to be working , because they have no bloody idea whatsoever what else to do , and they ’re not really talented programmers — they ’re just well - meaning Poli Sci majors who attended the six - week course .
And Newly Huge Incompetent IT Consultant starts messing up .
Their customers are unhappy .
And another upstart talented programmer comes and takes away all their business , and the cycle begins anew .
I do n’t need to name names , here , this cycle has happened a dozen times .
All the IT service companies get greedy and try to grow faster than they can find talented people , and they grow layers upon layers of rules and procedures which help produce “ consistent , ” if not very brilliant work .
But the rules and procedures only work when nothing goes wrong .
Various “ data - backed Web site ” consulting companies sprouted up in the last couple of years and filled their ranks by teaching rank amateurs the fourteen things you need to know to create a data - backed Web site ( “ here ’s a select statement , kid , build a Web site ” ) .
But now that dotcoms are imploding and there ’s suddenly demand for high - end GUI programming , C++ skills , and real computer science , the kids who only have select statements in their arsenal just have too steep a learning curve and ca n’t catch up .
But they still keep trying , following the rules in chapter 17 about normalizing databases , which mysteriously do n’t apply to The New World .
The brilliant founders of these companies could certainly adjust to the new world : they are talented computer scientists who can learn anything , but the company they built ca n’t adjust because it has substituted a rulebook for talent , and rulebooks do n’t adjust to new times .
What ’s the moral of the story ?
Beware of Methodologies .
They are a great way to bring everyone up to a dismal , but passable , level of performance , but at the same time , they are aggravating to more talented people who chafe at the restrictions that are placed on them .
It ’s pretty obvious to me that a talented chef is not going to be happy making burgers at McDonald ’s , precisely because of McDonald ’s rules .
So why do IT consultants brag so much about their methodologies ?
( Beats me . )
What does this mean for Fog Creek ?
Well , our goal has never been to become a huge consulting company .
We started out doing consulting as a means to an end — the long - term goal was to be a software company that is always profitable , and we achieved that by doing some consulting work to supplement our software income .
After a couple of years in business our software revenues grew to the point where consulting was just a low - margin distraction , so now we only do consulting engagements that directly support our software .
Software , as you know , scales incredibly well .
When one new person buys FogBUGZ , we make more money without spending any more money .
More important is our obsession with hiring the best … we are perfectly happy to stay small if we can’t find enough good people ( although with six weeks annual vacation , finding people does n’t seem to pose a problem ) .
And we refuse to grow until the people we already hired have learned enough to become teachers and mentors of the new crowd .
A recession has already started and the downturn is likely to last longer than in the recent past , with the economy recovering only late next year , according to a quarterly survey of corporate chief financial officers released Wednesday .
Fifty - four percent of the CFOs said the United States was in recession , and another 24 % said there was a high likelihood of one starting later this year , according to a Duke University / CFO magazine survey completed last week .
About three - quarters of the CFOs said they were more pessimistic this quarter than in the prior quarter about the economy , reflecting concerns about consumer spending , turmoil in credit and housing markets , and high energy prices .
An index of optimism , which rates the economy on a 1 to 100 scale , is at 52 , the lowest level in the seven - year history of the index , the survey found .

“ The last two recessions lasted only eight months , ” said Duke professor Campbell Harvey , founding director of the survey .
“ In contrast , 90 % of the CFOs do not believe the economy will turn the corner in 2008 .
Indeed , many of them believe it will be late 2009 before a recovery takes hold . ”
In response , companies are scaling back plans for capital spending and are not planning significant hiring , in part because of high labor costs , according to the survey , which has been conducted for 12 years .
Most CFOs said interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve had little impact on their business , and more than a third said credit conditions have directly hurt their companies by making capital tougher to get and more expensive .
The survey included responses from 1,073 CFOs .

Another survey found that manufacturers expected the economy to slow significantly in 2008 , but they thought a recession would be averted .
“ Net exports will keep the U.S. economy out of recession in 2008 , ” the National Assn. of Manufacturers said Wednesday .
Exports are expected to grow by 7 % this year , which is more than double the 3 % rise in imports , the trade group said .
As a result , trade will contribute to 47 % of the growth in gross domestic product this year , the group said .
For the year overall , gross domestic product will grow by just 1.1 % in 2008 , the slowest pace since 2001 .

Growth will essentially stall in the first half of the year followed by moderate 2.3 % growth in the second half , the group said .
A third survey found that sales at U.S. retailers fell 1.1 % in February compared with a month earlier , the biggest decline in at least five years , as shoppers worried about job cuts trimmed purchases , MasterCard Inc . 's consulting unit said .
Retail sales , excluding autos , totaled $ 298.2 billion last month on a seasonally adjusted basis , the MasterCard report said .
The month - to - month decline is the largest since at least January 2003 , when the division started tracking sales .
Sales increased 2.7 % compared with February 2007 .

So by the time you 're reading this , you may very well have been playing the just - released Grand Theft Auto IV for 8 straight hours , and in that time , formed some pretty firm opinions on the game to go along with the magnificent odor you 've also probably developed .
Sadly I can't count myself amongst your number , as having both a job and a girlfriend , I have certain non-optional sleep and odor - maintenance regimes .
Consequently I have n't played a bit of the game , so were I actually to attempt a review here , I 'd be making a mockery of the journalistic standards that Cracked magazine has long stood for .
Instead , I 'm going to recap some of the absolute favorite things I enjoyed about the past GTA games , which should be a good way for me to fill out a blog post , and also not get too stinky ..
In some cars like the taxi or police car , these are so easy to do , it 's delicious .
I think I pulled one of these accidentally about 5 minutes into the original GTA III .
As I recall , after my eyes resocketed themselves , I stood up and exclaimed " Holy Crap , I 'm awesome ! "
It 's such a small thing , but making the player feel like the Golden God of All Things On Wheels is one thing that makes this series so great .
Once you realized that multiple gunshots could destroy cars , tell me within minutes you were n't piling up cars in an intersection like a lunatic valet ?
This mode seemed kind of lame at first - mostly just chasing crooks down , smacking their rear quarter panel and shooting the hell out of them with an uzi .
But there was one criminal who I could n't pin down at all , and as the clock was running out , in an act of desperation I slammed him off the side of a bridge and into the ocean .
One of my favorite gaming moments ever , and it hopefully sent a message to everyone else in Liberty City who had four outstanding parking tickets : there was a new sheriff in town .

US senator and Presidential hopeful Barack Obama has told American parents that they need to curb the amount of time their kids spend playing video games .
Obama , 46 , told a packed Wilkes Hall in Pennsylvania , US to turn off the television , turn off the video games ” , adding that " Government ca n’t do everything " .
According to Pennsylvania ’s Patriot News , Obama is backing a radical new policy , which would see parents identified as ‘ at - risk ’ at the hospital when they deliver a baby – and would then be taught to read and encouraged to push their child through a good education .
It ’s not the first time Obama has attacked US kids ’ overexposure to video games .
Back in February he told a Wisconsin crowd :
We ’re going to have to parent better , and turn off the television set , and put the video games away , and instil a sense of excellence in our children , and that ’s going to take some time . ”
Indeed , Gamepolitics quotes Obama criticising parents for over - exposing their kids to games from as far back as April , 2006 .
Paterson Is Praised as Portrait Is Unveiled
Former Gov. David A. Paterson of New York drew praise for shepherding the state through a period of financial turmoil , and for serving as a role model for African - Americans and people with disabilities .
Last week billionaire investor Carl Icahn tried to oust Yahoo's board Microsoft has said it is considering a deal with Yahoo which would not involve a full buyout of the company .
Microsoft 's previous offer to buy Yahoo for $ 33 a share - a figure which valued the company at $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24.36 bn ) - was turned down .
Last week Yahoo rebuffed billionaire investor Carl Icahn 's plan to oust the current board over the failed merger .
Now Microsoft says it is discussing with Yahoo an alternative transaction , but did not provide any detail .
' Stockholder value '
In a statement , Microsoft said it " is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo at this time , but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative " .
It issued the statement , it said , " in light of developments " since the company withdrew its bid two weeks ago .
Microsoft stressed that a deal may or may not follow from Sunday 's statement .
After Microsoft 's statement , Yahoo confirmed it was looking at a number of " value maximising " alternatives with Microsoft , and would assess offers made by the firm .
The internet firm said its board would evaluate each of the alternatives " including any Microsoft proposal ... with a focus on maximising stockholder value " .
Analysts say any agreement could save Yahoo from having to fight a battle with Mr Icahn , who is amassing a stake in the company in an attempt to force out the current board .
Mr Icahn 's manoeuvre on Thursday followed much criticism over Yahoo's decision , led by co-founder and chief executive Jerry Yang , to turn down Microsoft 's offer earlier this month to buy the company .
Yahoo had wanted Microsoft to increase its bid of $ 33 a share to $ 37 .
Yahoo has also been looking into an alliance with internet giant Google , and the firms recently tested an advertising partnership for two weeks .
If they were joined together this would make Yahoo a less likely target for acquisition , analysts say .

Obama is on the brink of Democratic nomination without confronting head - on questions about his general - election hurdles .
What Clinton wishes she could say
Why , ask many Democrats and media commentators , wo n’t Hillary Rodham Clinton see the long odds against her , put her own ambitions aside , and gracefully embrace Barack Obama as the inevitable Democratic nominee ?
Here is why : She and Bill Clinton both devoutly believe that Obama ’s likely victory is a disaster - in - waiting .
Naive Democrats just do n’t see it .
And a timid , pro-Obama press corps , in their view , wo n’t tell the story .
Advertisement
But Hillary Clinton wo n’t tell it , either .
A lot of coverage of the Clinton campaign supposes them to be in kitchen - sink mode — hurling every pot and pan , no matter the damage this might do to Obama as the likely Democratic nominee in the fall .
In fact , the Democratic race has not been especially rough by historical standards .
What ’s more , our conversations with Democrats who speak to the Clintons make plain that their public comments are only the palest version of what they really believe : that if Obama is the nominee , a likely Democratic victory would turn to a near - certain defeat .
Far from a no-holds - barred affair , the Democratic contest has been an exercise in self - censorship .
Rip off the duct tape and here is what they would say : Obama has serious problems with Jewish voters ( goodbye Florida ) , working - class whites ( goodbye Ohio ) and Hispanics ( goodbye , New Mexico ) .
Republicans will also ruthlessly exploit openings that Clinton — in the genteel confines of an intraparty contest — never could .
Top targets : Obama ’s radioactive personal associations , his liberal ideology , his exotic life story , his coolly academic and elitist style .
This view has been an article of faith among Clinton advisers for months , but it got powerful new affirmation last week with Obama ’s clumsy ruminations about why “ bitter ” small - town voters turn to guns and God .
There ’s nothing to say that the Clintonites are right about Obama ’s presumed vulnerabilities .
But one argument seems indisputably true : Obama is on the brink of the Democratic nomination without having had to confront head - on the evidence about his general election challenges .
That is why some friends describe Clinton as seeing herself on a mission to save Democrats from themselves .
Her candidacy may be a long shot , but no one should expect she will end it unless or until every last door has been shut .
Skepticism about Obama ’s general election prospects extends beyond Clinton backers .
We spoke to unaffiliated Democratic lawmakers , veteran lobbyists , and campaign operatives who believe the rush of enthusiasm for Obama ’s charisma and fresh face has inhibited sober appraisals of his potential weaknesses .
The concerns revolve around two themes .
The first is based on the campaign so far .
Assuming voting patterns evident in the nominating contest continue into the fall , Obama would be vulnerable if McCain can approximate the traditional GOP performance in key states .
The second is based on fear about the campaign ahead .
Stories about Obama ’s Chicago associations with 1960s radicals Bernardine Dohrn and William Ayers landed with barely a ripple .
So , too , did questions about whether he once backed a total ban on handguns ( he says no but in a 1996 state legislative race his campaign filled out a questionnaire saying yes ) .
Obama ’s graceful handling of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy may have turned that into a net positive against Clinton .
But all this was in a Democratic contest .
What about about when Obama ’s running against a Republican ?
Let ’s take the first point : Obama ’s electoral coalition .
His impressive success to date comes predominately from strong support among upscale , college - educated whites and overwhelming support from African - Americans .
Assuming he is the Democratic nominee , it seems virtually certain he would bring turnout of these groups to historic levels .
But there is reason to question whether he would be able to perform at average levels with other main pillars of the traditional Democratic coalition : blue - collar whites , Jews and Hispanics .
He has run decently among these groups in some places , but in general he ’s run well behind her .
Obama lost the Jewish vote by double - digits in Florida , New York and Maryland — and that was before controversy over anti-Israel remarks of Wright .
An undecided Democratic superdelegate told us many Jewish voters are itching for a reason to break with the party and side with Republicans , who have embraced the Israeli cause with passion .
A small shift could swing swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania , which have significant Jewish populations .
Obama won only about one - third of Hispanic votes on Super Tuesday — and did even worse a month later in Texas .
A Democratic nominee needs big margins with Hispanics to win states like New Mexico , California , Colorado and Arizona .
In the fall , Obama would be running against a Republican with a record on immigration that will resonate with Hispanics .
Then there ’s the lower - income white vote .
Does it seem odd that a woman with a polarizing reputation would be rolling up enormous margins among some of the country ’s most traditional voters ?
Three out of every four blue - collar whites in small towns and rural areas of Ohio voted for Clinton over Obama on March 4 .
The reality is , this is already an electorate with deep cultural divisions — and that ’s in the Democratic Party .
Cornell Belcher , Obama ’s pollster , says most of these voting blocs will unite when the Democratic fighting is done .
“ You get a snapshot at the height of a battle within the family but after the family squabbles history shows that the family does come back together , ” he said .
Fair enough .
But McCain would be challenging Obama on a range of issues that would complicate this coming together — issues that Clinton did not use or used minimally because they were not particularly effective in a Democratic campaign .
McCain , by contrast , would have a free hand to exploit a paper trail showing Obama ’s evolution — opponents would say reversals — over the past decade from liberal positions on gun control , the death penalty and Middle East politics .
He would exploit Obama ’s current position in favor of driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants and beginning diplomatic talks with U.S. adversaries like the dictators of Iran and Venezuela .
Will those issues help lower - income white voters “ come back together ” with Obama ?
Those issues are all in - bounds .
What about the issues that most journalists and probably McCain himself will consider out - of - bounds but that , if recent history is any guide , will echo nonetheless in the general election ?
The last two Democratic nominees , Al Gore and John F. Kerry , were both military veterans , and both had been familiar , highly successful figures in national politics for more than two decades by the time they ran .
Both men lost control of their public images to the right - wing freak show — that network of operatives and commentators working mostly outside of the mainstream media — and ultimately lost their elections as many voters came to see them as elitist , out - of - touch , phony , and even unpatriotic .
Obama is a much less familiar figure than Kerry or Gore , with a life story that is far more exotic , who is coming out of a political milieu in Chicago politics that is far more liberal .
The freak show has already signaled its early lines of attack on Obama .
Polls show a significant percentage of Americans believe — falsely — that he is a Muslim .
Voter interviews reveal widespread unease with minor and seemingly irrelevant questions like why he does not favor American flag pins on his lapel .
Nor have we heard the last about Wright and his fulminations .
Here will be the real kitchen sink : every damaging comment or association from Obama ’s past , mixed together with innuendo and downright fiction , to portray him as an an exotic character of uncertain values and weak patriotism .
Obama ’s advisers say they are not naive about freak show attacks .
Their response is that Obama ’s appeal to a new brand of politics , and his personal poise and self - confidence , will allow him to transcend attacks and stereotypes in ways that Gore and Kerry could not .
Obama is indeed poised and self - confident .
But the current uproar over his impromptu sociology lesson in San Francisco about “ bitter ” voters in Pennsylvania raise questions about his self - discipline , and his understanding of how easy it is for a politicians in modern politics to lose control of his or her public image .
Clinton has her own baggage , to put it mildly .
But it ’s been rummaged through for years , so what Democrats see is pretty much what they would get .
The frustration emanating from the Clintonites comes from being unable to say in public what they think in private .
Little wonder why .
Bill Clinton ’s comments comparing Obama ’s support in South Carolina to Jesse Jackson ’s were certainly impolitic .
But it ’s absurd to contend , as many Democrats indignantly do , that they amounted to a shocking low blow or to “ playing the race card . ”
The reaction underscored the essential prissiness of the Democratic contest so far .
One can be sure the general election will not be such a delicate affair .
You may have seen this already but it 's just too fucking good not to share .

Edward Kennedy was first elected to the Senate in 1962
After a six - day auction , they were secured by the publishers Twelve and are due to be published in 2010 .
Industry sources told US media the deal was comparable to the $ 8 m Sen Hillary Clinton got for Living History .
Sen Kennedy was first elected in 1962 .
His brother John F Kennedy had been elected president .
The Massachusetts senator has become an iconic figure within the Democratic Party , and a prominent campaigner for reforms in many areas , including education , wages , health care and immigration .
Twelve is part of the Hachette Book Group USA .
Reporting on cutting - edge new military gadgetry gives this UK journalist , the Daily Mail ’s Michael Hanlon , an unpleasant dose of the reality of modern warfare — and leads him to wonder about the significance , and possible uses of , Raytheon ’s new “ Silent Guardian ” mega - zapper .
Daily Mail :
A square transmitter as big as a plasma TV screen is mounted on the back of a Jeep .
When turned on , it emits an invisible , focused beam of radiation — similar to the microwaves in a domestic cooker — that are tuned to a precise frequency to stimulate human nerve endings .
It can throw a wave of agony nearly half a mile .
Because the beam penetrates skin only to a depth of 1/64th of an inch , it cannot , says Raytheon , cause visible , permanent injury .
But anyone in the beam ’s path will feel , over their entire body , the agonising sensation I ’ve just felt on my fingertip .
The prospect does n’t bear thinking about .
“ I have been in front of the full - sized system and , believe me , you just run .
You do n’t have time to think about it — you just run , ” says George Svitak , a Raytheon executive .

PROJECTED TEMPERATURE RISES PROJECTED TEMPERATURE RISES BALI , Indonesia ( AP ) 
The impacts of climate change plus deforestation could wipe out or severely damage nearly 60 % of the Amazon forest by 2030 — making it impossible to keep global temperatures from reaching catastrophic levels , an environmental group said Thursday .
" The importance of the Amazon forest for the globe 's climate can not be underplayed , " said Daniel Nepstad , author of a new report by the WWF .
" It 's not only essential for cooling the world 's temperature , but also such a large source of fresh water that it may be enough to influence some of the great ocean currents , and on top of that , it 's a massive store of carbon . "
Sprawling over 1.6 million square miles , the Amazon covers nearly 60 % of Brazil .
Largely unexplored , it contains one - fifth of the world 's fresh water and about 30 % of the world 's plant and animal species — many still undiscovered .
The WWF said logging , livestock expansion and worsening drought are projected to rise in the coming years and could result in the clearing of 55 % of the rainforest .
If rainfall declines by 10 % in the Amazon , as predicted , another 4 % could be wiped out .
Scientists say if global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels , the risks to the environment and to people will be enormous .
It is essentially the ' tipping point ' for catastrophic floods and droughts , rising sea levels and heatwave deaths and diseases .
" It will be very difficult to keep the temperatures at 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit if we do n't conserve the Amazon , " said Nepstad , who is also a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts .
According to the WWF , deforestation in the Amazon could release 55.5 tons to 96.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030 , representing as much as two years of global carbon emissions .

Sen .
Barack Obama was hardly the first one in modern American politics to observe that voters who are embittered that prosperity passed them by would " cling to guns , or religion , or antipathy toward people who are n't like them , or anti-immigrant sentiment , or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustration . "
All you need to do as look at recent history to realize there are political points to be scored by playing to fears that have little or nothing to do with the underlying economic stresses of people 's lives .
Politicians from the right and left pander to these anxieties .
They go into towns reeling from lost jobs - and watching their young people go off to an aimless war in Iraq - and the politicians focus on concerns about gun control , same - sex marriage , abortion , an immigrant " invasion " or the horrors of globalization .
Whether it 's Mike Huckabee flashing " Christian leader " or President Bush lacing his speeches with code words to assure Christian conservatives that he is one of them , religion is invoked in an open appeal for votes .
So if it 's " elitist " or " insulting " to note that voters who are otherwise left behind in the global economy sometimes have misdirected frustrations - which can be exploited for political gain - then Barack Obama has plenty of company .
Naturally , Obama 's principal foes , Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain , are exploiting the remarks for all they 're worth .
Who could blame them ?
It was a rare misstep from a candidate who has been frustrating his adversaries with his deftness at identifying and articulating the electorate 's craving for a message of hope and inclusion .
The fact that Obama said those words in San Francisco - in an off - the - record setting with his contributors - was an " aha ! " moment for those who are suspicious of a Harvard - educated lawyer with a gift for the soaring oratory .
For his critics , the setting itself proved the context was of condescension .
But the preface to Obama 's " bitter " quote conveyed a clear strain of empathy with such frustrations .
" You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania , a lot of them - like a lot of small towns in the Midwest , the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing 's replaced them , " he said .
" And they 've gone through the Clinton administration , and the Bush administration , and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate , and they have not . "
Obama erred in assuming that a " private " fundraising event was truly private .
He also was wrong to try to give perfunctory treatment to something as nuanced and treacherous as characterizing a wide swath of voters .
It was , as he acknowledged , a " clumsy " moment .
But it 's neither elitist nor insulting to observe that fear and prejudice too often carry the day in modern American politics .
Next month , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , a Yemeni who was once a driver for Osama bin Laden , could become the first detainee to be tried for war crimes in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
By now , he should be busily working on his defense .
But his lawyers say he cannot .
They say Mr. Hamdan has essentially been driven crazy by solitary confinement in an 8 - foot - by - 12 - foot cell where he spends at least 22 hours a day , goes to the bathroom and eats all his meals .
His defense team says he is suicidal , hears voices , has flashbacks , talks to himself and says the restrictions of Guantánamo “ boil his mind . ”
“ He will shout at us , ” said his military defense lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. Brian L. Mizer .
“ He will bang his fists on the table . ”
His lawyers have asked a military judge to stop his case until Mr. Hamdan is placed in less restrictive conditions at Guantánamo , saying he cannot get a fair trial if he cannot focus on defending himself .
The judge is to hear arguments as soon as Monday on whether he has the power to consider the claim .
DreamWorks Animation 's Monsters vs. Aliens is the studio's first movie produced in 3 - D technology .
It 's slated for a March 2009 release .
Courtesy DreamWorks Studio execs have an odd conundrum : Box - office receipts have steadily grown but the number of ticket sales have not .
Thanks to the proliferation of home theaters , movies - on - demand and portable video players , moviegoers have fewer reasons to actually " go " to a movie .
The studios ' solution ?
Hike ticket prices by a couple bucks apiece and ramp up production of 3 - D movies .
" It 's pretty clear right now that you can charge a premium for 3 - D , " says Doug Creutz , an analyst with Cowen & Co. , who covers the entertainment industry .
" We 're probably talking about the difference between $ 15 and $ 10 [ tickets ] .
And attendance is much better for 3 - D movies . "
Filmmakers and studios alike have pledged their allegiance to 3 - D. Disney and Pixar announced this week that it will release all of its films in 3 - D , starting with Bolt , which is slated for a November release .
Dreamworks Animation says that by 2009 all of its movies will be released in 3 - D. James Cameron is working on big - budget 3 - D sci -fi flick called Avatar , and George Lucas is working on remastering all the Star Wars movies in 3 - D .
For studios , the financial allure of 3 - D is twofold :
The technology can't easily be replicated in home theaters ( yet ) ; and moviegoers are still willing to pay a premium for 3 - D films .
The big question is whether the technology is a game changer or just a short - lived gimmick to drive ticket sales , like Smell - O - Vision – or , for that matter , the 3 - D technology of the 1950s .
" This is a serious visualization technology that 's just begun to be used for entertainment , " says Elizabeth Brooks , chief marketing officer of 3 - D system maker RealD , which has about 97 percent of the 3 - D market .
" It 's been used by NASA and by scientists who need to render things perfectly .
It 's my job to sing the company 's praises , but if the technology were n't good , [ filmmakers ] would n't be planning to make as many 3 - D films as they 're making . "
Unlike 3 - D films of the 1950s , the new wave of 3 - D pictures do n't blur and they do n't cause headaches .
In basic terms , a 3 - D film is shot in two frames – one for the right eye and once for the left eye .
The projector buffers the left and right streams and projects them in alternation at 144 frames per second , using a " triple flash " technique that shows each frame three times in order to smooth out the picture .
The RealD 3 - D system also requires theaters to install a special silver screen to maintain the polarization of the image .
" To the people who continue to say it 's a gimmick I would simply say , ' You 're going to be the one left saying the Earth is flat , ' " says Jim Dorey , a 3 - D obsessive and writer of the Marketsaw blog , which is sponsored by several 3 - D companies , including RealD .
( Dorey , whose background is in IT , says he first became intensely interested in 3 - D with the release of Jaws 3 - D in 1983 . )
And it does n't hurt that 3 - D is poised to improve theater attendance and box - office grosses .
The average ticket price for " Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds , " a 74 - minute 3 - D concert flick , was reportedly $ 15 .
By contrast , the average 2 - D movie ticket price is about $ 7 , according to the National Association of Theater Owners .
Hannah Montana grossed about $ 65 million domestically , and on its opening weekend , it grossed about $ 31 million , handily out - selling the 2 - D Jessica Alba vehicle , The Eye , which sold about $ 12 million worth of tickets .
But while studios move full - steam ahead with 3 - D production , there 's one minor hitch :
There still are n't a whole lot of 3 - D movie theaters – only about 1,000 out of 38,900 screens in the United States are 3 - D .
In order to install a 3 - D system , theaters must have digital projectors .
And at the moment , there are only 4,600 digital projectors in the United States , according to the National Association of Theater Owners .
It costs tens of thousands of dollars to upgrade to digital projectors , and $ 20,000 to $ 50,000 more to install a 3 - D system .
It 's a rich investment , and theater owners may not see much of a return on it : Studios , on average , make 55 percent of ticket sales , leaving just 45 percent for the theater owner .
One incentive for digital upgrades : A single film print can cost $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 , and a widely released blockbuster could require the studio to make 3,000 to 4,000 prints , so distribution costs are not insignificant .
These costs will largely be eliminated as more theaters upgrade to digital projectors , so the studios are offering to split the upgrade costs with theater owners .
Under a recent agreement , for example , third - party upgrader Access Integrated Technologies signed deals with four studios – Disney , 20th Century Fox , Paramount and Universal – to convert up to 10,000 screens , for an estimated cost of $ 700 million .
Once studios get theaters to make the switch to digital , the shift to 3 - D will be easier – but it may not immediately improve the economics for studios .
While the box - office gross and attendance is higher for 3 - D movies , it costs more to make 3 - D movies .
Creutz , whose focus is on Dreamworks , does n't expect the company 's roster of 3 - D films will have a " huge profitability impact " on the company 's earnings .
He also expects that theaters wo n't be able to charge the premiums that they can now , once 3 - D movies become mainstream .
" I would guess that in four or five years , 3 - D will become somewhat standard , " Creutz says .
And then of course , there 's some concern that it will only be a matter of time before 3 - D hits the home theater , which would leave theater owners back where they started .
It seems like a stretch now since the costs of 3 - D and digital projectors are exorbitant , but Dorey speculates that 3 - D will penetrate home theaters in four or five years ' time .
" The technology is already available , " Dorey says .
" It 's not just about movies .
It 's about getting closer to total immersion for the internet , gaming , or any media experience .
The bottom line is that if you 're going to suspend disbelief and become part of an experience , it 's going to have to be in 3 - D . "

Equality was a core principle of the Civil Rights movement , a movement with which most Americans would comfortably express agreement or even admiration .
America 's oldest Civil Rights organization has accepted atheism as a Civil Rights issue , however , many Americans remain unwilling to do so .
Equality remains an unfortunately elusive goal for atheists in America .
Stellar1 at de-conversion ( update : link no longer active ) recently asked , " What if I behaved toward Christians like they behave towards me ? "
This is certainly an intriguing question in this context .
Some of Stellar1 's points :
However , I have to say that I am so very tired of having other people ’s religious beliefs shoved in my face .
I do not behave in that manner about my agnostic view and think it arrogant for Christians to think I care about their belief system .
For example , I wonder what Christians would think if Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris got on television on a continual basis to make emotional pleas for money to finance the spread of their atheism ?
As for those Christians who gather outside concerts to pass out tracts to get me saved , I wonder what they would think if I stood outside their churches and pass out literature on atheism to those leaving the building ?
Never mind that it would not occur to most atheists to do these things .
The question is how Christians would respond if we did them .
It is a question for which I suspect you already have an answer in mind .
But it also signals that we have not yet achieved equality in the eyes of many .
The fact that Rep. Monique Davis ( D - Chicago ) was not immediately forced out of office for expressing anti-atheist bigotry from the floor of the Illinois State Legislature also indicates that we atheists have not yet achieved equality with our Christian neighbors .
Just imagine what would have happened if Rep.
Davis had said that it was dangerous for children to know that Christianity existed !
This should be a real eye - opener for all non-theistic Americans .
The question in my mind now is whether it is possible for atheists to achieve equality as long as Christianity persists .
I certainly hope so , but I am troubled by barriers to accepting atheists inherent in Christian dogma .
If Christians are unable to acknowledge the worth of atheists , can we ever achieve true equality ?
Some Democratic Party leaders , while offering sympathy for Mr. Dean ’s plight , said it was urgent that he take a more assertive role to restore peace .
Several suggested that Mr. Dean  who has sought to build a legacy by expanding party operations to all 50 states  risked having his tenure as party leader remembered for a traumatizing loss in a year where most Democrats think victory should be easy .
“ I think he should be talking to governors and Al Gore and John Kerry , ” said Donald Fowler , a former party chairman who supports Mrs. Clinton .
“ I think he should be convening almost daily conversations with people  including the campaigns  trying to reach a solution . ”
“ If I were a chair , I would be a little more public in what I was doing and suggesting , ” Mr. Fowler said .
“ The D.N.C. chair rarely has an opportunity to do stuff , but this is one of those occasions . ”
Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee drew attention last month when he proposed a solution :
Have the elected Democratic officials and party leaders known as superdelegates convene after the voting is done on June 3 to resolve the fight .
Mr. Bredesen said he had acted in part because he saw no evidence that Mr. Dean or other leaders were trying to resolve the situation .
“ What I try to do is when I see a problem to step up , ” Mr. Bredesen said .
“ I think the party needs to take a hand in this thing . ” ‘
Mr. Dean , a reserved former governor of Vermont , goes home most weekends and spends most of his weekdays on the road .
In Washington , he stays at a hotel .
His approach and style offer a sharp contrast to a string of big - shoulder , high - profile party chairmen  Terry McAuliffe or the late Ron H. Brown  who rose through the party ranks and were fixtures at the parties , fund - raisers and restaurants that make up this city ’s political culture and where much of the political conversation takes place .
He in many ways ran for chairman as a candidate defying the Democratic establishment , and his first years were marked by a very public feud with Representative Rahm Emanuel , Democrat of Illinois , over Mr. Dean ’s trademark proposal to use Democratic National Committee money to build organizations in all 50 states .
He does not have particularly close relationships with many of the people who are central to the Clinton and Obama campaigns or Washington Democratic players .
You got to find some time to get this thing together .

Henry II spoke the unspeakable , asking his loyal henchmen , “ … will no one rid me of this turbulent priest ? ”
Shortly thereafter the Archbishop of Canterbury was murdered .
Plausible deniability brought down the World Trade Center , the same way it brought down the Archbishop .
No one would issue such a direct order , but cloaked in silence is intent , and in a system of “ clubbish ” cronyism , accomplishment of inferred intent is richly rewarded .
“ Whatever it takes ” gets a free pass to accomplish the end .

Beyond Treason By Tom Cahill

Comparisons of the present day USA with Nazi Germany sound polemic at best , insane at worst .
Yet each time humanity exceeds its record in cruelty and brutality , both denial and disbelief join together to discredit the evidence .
We have a long history of murdering prophets of truth , erecting shrines and statues to them in later generations when the truth becomes “ self - evident . ”
It is our shameful history , secret only in its own time .
Susan Bell Looks Back on a Shameful Secret History
" In 1996 , the award - winning journalist Gary Webb uncovered CIA links to Los Angeles drug dealers .
It was an amazing scoop - but one that would ruin his career and drive him to suicide .
His widow , Susan Bell , looks back on a shameful secret history . ” ( by Robert Chalmers )
The canaries are dying in droves in our cultural coal mine .
And as always , we parse and quibble , deconstruct and dissect ; fearful of losing our “ objectivity , ” when the ideologues , armed with their own brand of “ moral clarity , ” pursue their ideal without impediment of conscience .
How , then , do we attain the same “ moral clarity ” as the ideologues we choose to resist without “ becoming what we fight ? ”
By now , the “ litmus test ” should be clear and obvious : cruelty and brutality .
When we excuse our own cruelty and brutality with such memes as “ … to make an omelet , you have to break a few eggs , ” or “ freedom is n’t free , ” we continue the Culture of War .
Nature will seek equilibrium , with or without a human species on the planet .
The myth that Nature is a “ cruel struggle for survival ” is a gross misinterpretation of “ natural selection , ” our own imposition of “ might makes right ” over the natural law of harmony and balance .
“ Struggle and competition ” will always exist on a micro-level , while “ harmony and balance ” will always rule on the macro - level .
Chaos and order are a universal paradox and paradigm .
Unable yet to hold these two seemingly opposing states in our heads at the same time , we embrace one and unwittingly advance the opposite .
The very few of us who advocate the Culture of Peace should keep one or two swords at the ready .
The broad majority who unknowingly accept the prevailing Culture of War must understand “ laying down their burdens . ”
One heartbreaking thread running throughout Military History is that the advocates at the front are the first to stand and the first to die .
Invisible , of course , is the usual gang of cynics and opportunists who bait the bull and reap the profits .
They are the ones who justify themselves with “ Social Darwinism , ” the “ Divine Right of Kings ” in Drag .
The grim business of butchery is then left to the laborers , as always .
Sadly , a culture that ennobles war and warriors will never think otherwise until their homes are rubble and they bury their children .
Let the yellow - ribbon flag - waving sports fans who worship war get a belly full of it .
Otherwise , they will not change .
Let the rah - rah flag - wavers drink from their own cup of suffering and death .
They beg for it , yet they “ know not what they do . ”
Maybe their Heavenly Father will forgive the cheerleaders of the culture of death , but History will not .
If the human species is to survive , it must see war as the rapacious barbarity it truly is .
The soldier defends what he thinks is holy at peril of his own life .
The war profiteer hedges his bets and grows fat on corpses , beating plowshares into swords and children into slavery .
The time has come to tell the children the truth .
The time has come to tell them that most are condemned to castes , unable to escape , destined to be exploited , destined for modern man ’s version of slavery .

For those who find slavery unacceptable , it is time to speak the unspeakable , to do the undoable , to think impossible things .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it plans to cut prices of its Windows Vista operating system sold at retail outlets in a move aimed at pushing customers to switch to the newest version of Windows .
A salesman holds Microsoft Corp 's Windows Vista operating system on the day of its debut at an electronics retail shop in Tokyo , January 30 , 2007 .
Microsoft Corp < MSFT.O > said on Thursday it plans to cut prices of its Windows Vista operating system sold at retail outlets in a move aimed at pushing customers to switch to the newest version of Windows .
REUTERS / Toru Hanai
The world ’s largest software maker said it plans to lower retail prices for Vista in 70 countries later this year in tandem with the shipment of the first major update to Vista , known as Service Pack 1 ( SP1 ) .
Packaged versions of Windows Vista sold at stores and on the Web account for less than 10 percent of all licenses of the dominant Windows operating system that sits on more than 90 percent of the world ’s personal computers .
Most consumers opt to buy a new PC , which comes preloaded with the latest version of Windows .
“ We anticipate these changed will provide greater opportunities ... to sell more stand - alone copies of Windows , ” said Brad Brooks , a Microsoft corporate vice president .
In the United States , Microsoft will reduce prices for Windows Vista Ultimate , the company ’s top - end operating system , to $ 319 from $ 399 for the full version and cut the price for an “ upgrade ” version to $ 219 from $ 259 for consumers who already run Windows XP or another edition of Vista .
It also cut prices for upgrade versions of Vista Home Premium , its mainstream product , to $ 129 from $ 159 .
The price cuts vary by country .
In emerging markets , Microsoft will stop selling “ upgrade ” versions of Vista , because , for many customers , it will be the first purchase of a genuine copy of Windows .
The company will instead sell Vista Home Premium and Home Basic , a stripped - down version , at the upgrade prices .
Microsoft has sold more than 100 million licenses of Vista since its January 2007 release and its adoption has underpinned strong earnings results at the company in recent quarters .
Nonetheless , some consumers have raised issues with Vista ’s performance , stringent hardware requirement and lack of support for other software and devices like printers .
Microsoft said it would continue to sell Windows XP until June 2008 , delaying a scheduled transition to Vista .
Brooks , who oversees consumer marketing of Vista , said he is confident the company can bring in enough new customers to offset the revenue declines from lowering prices after seeing the results of a recent three - month promotional trial of lower Vista prices .
The announcement comes on the heels of sales data that showed a 30 percent drop in money spent for software at U.S. retailers in January , according to market research firm NPD .
Microsoft said the announcement is unrelated to the sales data , which the company said could be a result of inventory build - up after the holiday shopping season .
The United Nations is using the mapping programme Google Earth to highlight the plight of millions of refugees and its humanitarian work to help them .
The outreach programme , a joint initiative between the internet giant and the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) , weaves together satellite maps , photos , videos and eyewitness accounts to give viewers a close - up look at the refugee crises in Iraq , Chad , Columbia and Darfur in Sudan .
It allows users to find out about UNHCR operations , locate refugee camps and discover the impact of the humanitarian crises on neighboring countries such as Sudan , Syria and Ecuador .
Users can explore the lives of those in exile by clicking on exact locations in the refugee camps to see photos of the facilities , such as health clinics , schools , water taps and sanitation .
There are pop -up videos of specific operations and events , such as a visit to a Chad refugee camp by the actor and UN goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie .
The UN deputy high commissioner for refugees , L Craig Johnstone , said : " Google Earth is a very powerful way for UNHCR to show the vital work that it is doing in some of the world 's most remote and difficult displacement situations .
By showing our work in its geographical context , we can really highlight the challenges we face on the ground and how we tackle them . "
A UNHCR spokesman said the programme could soon develop further .
" With the new generation of cameras with GPS , we can foresee taking photos of a place and uploading it directly to Google Earth .
For our planning , mapping and communications unit , that would be an amazing tool .
" Over time , we can envision increasing the number of elements shown that will certainly increase the ' live ' experience of the platform . "
Google Earth Outreach follows a similar project launched last year called Crisis in Darfur , which allowed users to explore more than 1,600 damaged and destroyed villages in the Darfur region .
The UNHCR hopes the programme can be used as a logistical planning tool to coordinate operations on the ground .
Other humanitarian organisations have made use of the programme for their relief efforts .
The British Red Cross used Google Earth as part of its logistical planning for its work in Bangladesh following cyclone Sidr in December .
A spokeswoman said : " The team used Google Earth to get an idea of the geography and terrain they 'd be working in . "
To date , 350 million people worldwide have downloaded the Google Earth tool .
Drug -resistant tuberculosis cases in parts of the former Soviet Union have reached the highest rates ever recorded globally , the World Health Organization said Tuesday .
The rates could soar even higher , spreading the potentially fatal disease elsewhere , a top W.H.O. official said , releasing findings from the largest global survey of the problem .
The highest rate was in Baku , Azerbaijan , where 22.3 percent of new tuberculosis cases were resistant to the standard anti-TB drug regimen during the survey period , from 2002 to 2006 .
That exceeded the previous high of 14.2 percent , in Kazakhstan .
Drug -resistant TB is widespread in the Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang regions of China , where the rates are about 7.25 percent , the W.H.O. said .
The survey , the first in four years , shows that earlier predictions were correct and that governments have lost control of tuberculosis in many areas .
The reason , health officials say , is that countries have not invested enough to build , equip and staff laboratories to detect the disease .
The countries also have not made sure there are enough standard drugs and have not monitored patients to ensure they complete a full course of therapy .
Flying in the face of conventional thought , overweight children have fewer cavities and healthier teeth compared to other kids , a new study finds .
Scientists are clueless as to why .
Researchers at the Eastman Dental Center , part of the University of Rochester Medical Center , analyzed data on nearly 18,000 children who participated in two separate National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys .
Children ages 6 - 18 who were considered overweight or at risk for becoming overweight showed a decreased risk of tooth decay compared to their normal - weight peers .
" We expected to find more oral disease in overweight children of all ages , given the similar causal factors that are generally associated with obesity and [ tooth decay ] , " said Dr. Dorota Kopycka - Kedzierawski , the lead author of a paper published in this month ’s issue of Community Dentistry & Oral Epidemiology .
" Our findings raise more questions than answers , " Kopycka - Kedzierawski said .
" For example , are overweight children eating foods higher in fat rather than cavity - causing sugars ?
Are their diets similar to normal weight peers but [ perhaps they ] lead more sedentary lifestyles ?
Research to analyze both diet and lifestyle is needed to better understand the results . "
Do Hamburgers Cause Crime ?
Most of us who eat meat regularly would still rather not kill an animal with our own hands .
So we have , for generations , delegated that work to others .
Jennifer Dillard , at Georgetown Law , authored a new paper looking at what that delegation costs the workers of industrial slaughterhouses .
She argues that prolonged work on a kill floor exposes workers to the risk of psychological damage , including post - traumatic stress disorder , and that they should be compensated under O.S.H.A. for any ill effects they suffer .
Giving slaughterhouse workers therapy might also reduce another cost associated with the meat - processing industry : increased crime .
Writing for the American Sociological Association , Amy Fitzgerald finds a spill - over effect from the violent work of the slaughterhouse into the surrounding community .
According to her research , U.S. counties that have slaughterhouses consistently have higher rates of violent crime than demographically similar counties that do n’t .

WASHINGTON , March 25 - A new analysis of government data finds that 15 percent of employees in the hospitality industry suffer from serious alcohol - related problems .
Excessive alcohol use costs U.S. employers billions in lost productivity and additional health care costs every year .
According to a new report by Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems at The George Washington University Medical Center , " Workplace Screening & Brief Intervention : What Employers Can and Should Do About Excessive Alcohol Use " , alcohol - related problems are disproportionately represented in American business , with employees in the hospitality , construction and wholesale industries significantly more likely to be dependent on or abuse alcohol .
The report is available at http://www. ensuringsolutions .
org .
Alcohol problems affect all employers , with an average of nine percent of U.S. workers drinking in ways that contribute to absenteeism , higher health care costs and lost productivity .
But , Ensuring Solutions researchers found that men working in the hospitality and construction are approximately 50 percent more likely to have an alcohol - related problem than women in the same industry .
In wholesale trade , men are almost three times more likely to have an alcohol problem than women .
In addition , more than 18 percent of young workers between the ages of 18 and 25 have an alcohol - related problem , compared to just seven percent of workers 26 and older .
( See data table below )
" Most employees represented in these numbers are not dependent on alcohol , " said Eric Goplerud , PhD , director of Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems and lead researcher .
" But they do use alcohol in ways that lead to short - term safety problems and long - term health consequences . "
To develop a better understanding of the impact of alcohol problems in the workplace , Ensuring Solutions to Alcohol Problems , an initiative sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts , conducted an extensive analysis of two large government - sponsored epidemiological surveys , the National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH ) and the National Comorbidity Survey .
This analysis estimates the workplace impact of alcohol problems -- categorized as alcohol dependence ( alcoholism ) and alcohol abuse -- on 13 sectors of U.S. industry .
" The impact of alcohol problems in the workplace is a tremendous hidden challenge -- in part because very few people with an alcohol problem are ever identified , " said Andrew Webber , president and CEO of the National Business Coalition on Health .
" In the past , employers have led the way to doing more for people with chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease .
It 's time for American industry to do the same for people with alcohol problems . "
The results of the Ensuring Solutions analysis have been used to develop a Web - based calculator that employers can use to estimate the impact of alcohol problems and the potential cost savings to be gained through workplace screening and brief intervention .
The calculator is available at http://www. alcoholcostcalculator . org .
In addition to analyzing the scope of workplace alcohol problems , the report promotes the adoption of a practice known as Screening and Brief Intervention ( SBI ) .
SBI has been shown to reduce excessive alcohol use when administered to patients in a variety of settings , including hospitals and universities .
Ensuring Solutions believes that if SBI were to become a widespread practice in primary care , workplace wellness programs and employee assistance , the prevalence of workplace alcohol problems would be significantly reduced .
" Alcohol problems affect every workplace , with some industries paying a tremendous price . " said Dr. Goplerud .
" It 's in the interest of every employer to do something .
Screening and brief intervention is a proven approach that promises to effectively reduce workplace alcohol problems . "

Morals are often defined by what the general public sees as right or wrong .
Most people do n't feel that they 're doing wrong when they download an MP3 or share a movie , but in most countries they are actually breaking laws , laws which do not reflect what the general public considers to be legal , fair use , or even moral .
Law and morals are clearly out of sync when it concerns sharing copyrighted works on the Internet .
To give an example , David Pogue , technology writer for the New York Times often questions his public during talks to find out where the line between wrong and right lies in this case .
He starts of with a simple statement such as :
“ I own a certain CD , but it got scratched .
So I borrow the same CD from the library and rip it to my computer . ”
He then asks the public whether they think it ’s wrong or not .
Normally the more extreme the examples are , the more hands are raised , but when he spoke to an audience of 500 college students , something different happened .
Finally , with mock exasperation , I said , “ O.K. , let ’s try one that ’s a little less complicated :
You want a movie or an album .
You do n’t want to pay for it .
So you download it . ”
There it was : the bald - faced , worst - case example , without any nuance or mitigating factors whatsoever .
“ Who thinks that might be wrong ? ” Two hands out of 500 .
Pogue was blown away by this response , and he realized that there is a clear generation gap when it comes to copyright morals .
Indeed there is , but what else do you expect from a generation grew up with iPods , CD - burners and the biggest copying machine ever invented ( the Internet ) at their fingertips .
There ’s a whole industry built around filesharing , take the 160 GB iPod for example , any idea how much it costs to fill that with legally purchased songs ?
Computers and the Internet made it easier than ever to reproduce and share files , and it is virtually impossible to stop people from sharing and copying music and videos online .
I ’m not talking about copying movies for profit here , just for personal use .
Besides , sharing files is not as bad as most anti-piracy lobbies want people to believe .
A recent study has shown that people do n’t buy less CDs when they download songs , instead , they discover music they otherwise would n’t have listened to , and buy more CDs than people who do n’t download .
On top of this , research continues to show less popular artists actually profit from piracy simply because it allows people to try new music .
From people who missed an episode of their favorite TV - show I often get the question whether it is legal for them to download these off BitTorrent .
For them , the only way to see that show is to download it , again , they do n’t make any money off it , they just want to see an episode they missed .
Is that immoral ?
Personally I think it is all about alternatives .
Movie , TV and music companies should put their content online and make it available in high quality for a reasonable price without restrictions such as DRM .
At the moment there are often no products online that can compete with their pirated counterparts in quality .
Sure , there are ways to download ( some ) music and movies online , but apart from the ridiculous prices , these products are often offered in a low quality format and restricted through DRM .
The thing is , the entertainment industry should learn how to embrace technology and compete with piracy , instead of fighting its customers .
The rise of illegal downloading is a signal that customers want something that is not available through other channels , it ’s more about availability than the fact that it ’s free , as illustrated by the missed TV - show example .
Honestly , the real problem is n’t so much about protecting the rights of the artist , but about protecting the revenue stream for the big media companies .
The people who actually create the movies and music want their content to be shared , only the large corporations behind it are too afraid to move on .
Lobby groups such as the MPAA and the RIAA represent the distributors of movies and music , NOT the creators .
They even pay politicians to support their cause by voting for or against laws so that legislation is made with their interests in mind .
Is that moral ?
The main reason why these corporations are hesitant to go online is because they are trying to make most of their money of something that can easily done by the public – distribution .
They are striving to preserve outdated business models because that ’s how they make their money .
I ’m not proposing that everyone should just pirate everything , but I suggest that the movie and movie industry make their content available online for a reasonable price .
The Internet and filesharing technologies make it possible to make production ( of the copies ) and distribution costs disappear , yet the prices still do n’t change .
Why ?
Because they cling onto their old business models .
So should sharing copyrighted material be legalized ?
Not per se , but the entertainment industry should focus on monetizing filesharing networks instead of bringing them down .
Sharing is a good thing and there are tons of possibilities to profit from it .
What do you think ?
The discovery of two “ supernova factories ” , rare clusters of Red Supergiant ( RSG ) stars , located in the Galactic Bar of the Milky Way will be presented at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast on Tuesday 1st April .
“ RSGs represent the final brief stage in a massive star ’s lifecycle before it goes supernova .
They are very rare objects , so to find this many in the same place is remarkable .
Together they contain 40 RSGs , which is nearly 20 % of all the known RSGs in the Milky Way .
These stars are all at the brink of going supernova , ” said Dr Ben Davies of the Rochester Institute of Technology .
The two clusters are located next to each other on the edge of the Galactic Bar which is ploughing through the disc of the Milky Way .
It is likely to be this interaction between the bar and the disc that triggered the star formation event that created the clusters .
The clusters are about 20,000 light years from Earth and separated from each other by 800 light years .
Cluster 1 contains 14 RSGs and is 12 million years old ; Cluster 2 contains 26 RSGs and is 17 million years old .
Massive stars are rarely observed because they burn their fuel up very quickly .
RSGs are doubly rare because they are only a brief period of that short life cycle .
Dr Davies said , “ The next supernova could go off in one of these clusters at any time .
We estimate that it ’s about 5000 years between explosions for these clusters and we can see the remnants of a supernova that went off around 5000 years ago .
That means that the next one could be any time between today and 7008 AD . ”
The team identified the clusters initially using the mid-infrared Galactic Plane survey ( GLIMPSE ) , a huge database of images taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope .
They found two distinct groupings of bright stars very close to one another in the constellation of Scutum .
Using the Keck Telescope in Mauna Kea , Hawaii , they were then able to pin-point the exact distance from Earth of each star in each group .
These observations showed that , in each group , large numbers of stars were at exactly the same distance from Earth , and therefore were members of the same cluster .
Dr Davies said , “ The discovery of these clusters gives us a great opportunity to answer some long - standing questions in astrophysics , such as exact mechanisms of how massive stars evolve toward supernovae , and how the Galactic Bar can trigger huge starburst events in the Milky Way . ”
I bet you ’ve all heard the saying , “ Early to bed , early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise . ”
While many people debate the amount of sleep we need , it ’s clear that getting enough sleep is only a portion of the battle and it ’s also clear that some people simply need less sleep to function .
Regardless , I ’d bet that there are people getting 9 hours of sleep each night and then waking up just so they can begin their daily routine of habits that nullify the effects of such great sleep .
So , what ’s the point ?
All of that sleep goes to waste !
On the flipside , there are people only getting 6 hours of sleep that understand how to employ habits that will reinforce the benefits that sleep brings – subsequently they need less .
While we all understand the importance of sleep , let ’s reinforce it a little so we can maximize our energy , our money , and our brains .
With that , put down the potato chips and turn off the Tivo .
Let ’s get a little deeper into how we can really take a step towards health , wealth and wisdom .
Get Regular Exercise
Healthy :
This is a bit of a no - brainer ; exercise keeps you fit , helps you to keep your weight at the right level , and boosts your immune system .
It ’s also great for your mental health – doctors often advise regular exercise as a way of treating mild to moderate depression .
Wealthy :
Staying fit means you ’re less likely to get ill and need to pay for expensive medical care .
Also ( and I do n’t think this is a good thing ) , “ attractive applicants have a better chance of getting jobs , and of receiving higher salaries . ” ( from Mirror , mirror – A summary of research findings on body image ) .
Wise : Regular exercise can boost your brain power .
I always find that I can concentrate better after a gym session , and sciences backs me up here : the New Scientist reports that , “ Simply walking sedately for half an hour three times a week can improve abilities such as learning , concentration and abstract reasoning by 15 per cent . ” ( from 11 steps to a better brain ) .
Apparently , exercise promotes the growth of new brain cells .
Eat Good Food
Healthy : Eating well keeps your body in great condition .
Getting all the nutrients that you need ensures that all your bodily processes are running well .
That means simple things like getting your five - a- day , and making sure you have a good balance of foods from different food groups ( try MyPyramid to see what you should be eating each day ) .
Eating healthily also means keeping your weight at the right level .
Wealthy : Good , fresh , wholesome food works out a lot cheaper than fast food and takeouts .
Check out The Simple Dollar ’s Is the Value Menu Really a Value ?? to see how a McDonald ’s double cheeseburger measures up to a homemade version .
Try skipping your usual snacks and meals out for a week ( brown - bag lunch and take fruit with you to work or school instead ) – and count how much you save .
Wise : Studies consistently show that people who eat good , healthy food perform better on tests than those who either have n’t eaten at all , or who ’ve feasted on junk .
“ According to research published in 2003 , kids breakfasting on fizzy drinks and sugary snacks performed at the level of an average 70 - year - old in tests of memory and attention . ” ( from 11 steps to a better brain . )
Drink Sensibly
Healthy :
If you regularly get drunk , you ’re doing a lot of damage to your body .
Alcohol is a poison which your body works hard to get rid of : this puts a strain on your liver and depletes your body ’s vitamin supplies .
Long term risks include liver failure ; short term ones could involve injuries incurred while drunk .
And alcoholic drinks also contain calories ( as well as making that late - night kebab tempting ) , which is why some men develop a “ beer belly ” .
On the plus side , most research indicates that a glass of red wine each day is beneficial to health .
Wealthy : Alcohol is expensive .
If you ’re blowing half your paycheck on going out , you ’re unlikely to be doing so well financially as colleagues who ’re putting that money into a high - interest savings account .
Why not drink a bit less every time you go out and put the money into savings instead ?
Wise : Drinking too much alcohol kills brain cells .
You ’ve probably noticed that if you have a drink or two , it ’s harder to concentrate or do anything complicated .
This effect continues even when you think you ’re not drunk any more :
“ Scientists examined the effect of alcohol on complex , or executive , brain functions such as abstract reasoning , planning and the ability to monitor our own behavior in response to external feedback .
They found that performance in these areas was affected even after the concentration of alcohol in the blood had dipped to the point that people were no longer aware of its effect . ” – Alcohol effect lingers on brain
Which of these tips could you take on board to become healthy , wealthy and wise ?
Do you have any great advice of your own about a single lifestyle change that could boost all three of these areas ?

Early History
Attempting to trace tattooing to a specific period in recorded history is going to be quite a chore .
There ’s evidence it existed in ancient Greenland , Egypt , New Zealand and Siberia .
Adventurer Captain Cook first encountered tattoo art in the South Pacific in 1769 .
Word got out and tattoo art spread throughout America and Europe .
This helps explain why tattoos are so popular among seamen .
Yet it goes back thousands of years before that .
A mummified body that dates back to 3300 BC has skin marks believed to be tattoos .
Tattoo ideas and designs have been found on Nubian and Egyptian mummies dated 2000 BC .
Authors of classic literature have mentioned tattoos in cultures as diverse as the Greeks , ancient Germans and Britons , Gauls and Thracians .
By the 1900s , the first electric tattooing machine was developed , based on Thomas Edison ’s electric pen .
Today ’s tattoo gun is based on the basic components of that device : moving coils , needle bar and tube .
It ’s believed Chatham Square in New York City is the birthplace of the American tattoo .
A seaport at the time , the area attracted the working class looking to engage in the new craze .

Geotimes - April 2008 - The Wind Over the Waves FEATURE The Wind Over the Waves
Is offshore wind power the renewable energy of the future ?

Wind turbines located off the coast of northwestern England .
Herman Schellstede is no stranger to the Gulf Coast .
The son of an engineer who helped build the first offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico , Schellstede has spent the past 40 years designing offshore oil platforms , drilling rigs and pipelines .
But now he ’s using his expertise in marine engineering to build a different kind of offshore structure : a wind farm .
“ We always knew we had a lot of wind , ” Schellstede says of the Gulf Coast , “ but we did n’t know what to do with it , other than cuss at it . ”
But a few years ago , Schellstede ’s friend , Harold Schoeffler , the president of a local Sierra Club chapter and owner of a Cadillac dealership , convinced Schellstede that the winds blowing off the coast could be put to good use .
In 2004 , the pair formed Wind Energy Systems Technology ( WEST ) , with the goal of bringing offshore wind energy to the United States .
Schellstede and Schoeffler first pitched their idea of an offshore wind farm to Louisiana , but their home state was n’t interested .
So they looked westward to the country ’s wind capital , Texas , where thousands of wind turbines scattered across the state ’s vast plains are capable of powering more than 600,000 homes .
Like Schellstede , Texas has made much of its wealth off the oil and gas industry , leasing its hydrocarbon - rich lands and waters to oil and gas companies .
But these resources wo n’t last forever , says Jerry Patterson , Texas General Land Office Commissioner , so he ’s open to finding new ways to bring the state revenue — and energy .
When WEST requested to lease 46 square kilometers of water off Galveston Island to build a 50 - turbine wind farm capable of generating 150 megawatts of electricity , Patterson thought it sounded like a smart idea .
“ Texas is in the business of energy , ” he says .
For him , wind power is not just about being “ green ” ; it ’s about dollars and cents .
In 2005 , Texas granted WEST the Galveston lease and the Land Office estimates that , once the wind farm is built , Texas should receive a minimum of $ 26.5 million in royalties over the course of the 30 - year lease .
In October 2007 , the Land Office held a competitive auction for four additional offshore wind leases throughout the Gulf .
WEST bought them , and if all goes as planned , the state could net several hundred million more dollars in wind royalties .
Other coastal states are also considering the advantages of harnessing the winds blowing off their shores to create clean renewable energy .
Offshore wind energy offers several advantages over its land - based counterpart , including stronger , steadier winds .
But proposals in Massachusetts , New York and Delaware have been met with tougher scrutiny and opposition than the proposed Texas offshore wind farms by critics citing concerns ranging from the cost of the electricity to the environmental consequences of placing large wind turbines in the ocean .
What happens in these states , wind advocates say , could determine the future of offshore wind energy in the United States .
“ We ’re all looking to see what happens , ” says Cristina Archer , a meteorologist and environmental engineer at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif .
“ If they do start and do work , there will be a proliferation , ” she says .
“ It ’s a tipping point . ”
In the United States , wind energy “ is the second biggest source of new energy after natural gas , ” says Mark Jacobson , an atmospheric scientist at Stanford .
By the end of 2007 , the United States had enough wind turbines to produce 16,818 megawatts of electricity .
About 30 percent of that generating capacity was installed just last year , and the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) estimates that 30 percent of all new energy last year came from wind .
This year , wind energy will constitute 1 percent of the U.S. electrical supply , AWEA says , with the capability of powering 4.5 million homes .
All of this wind power , however , is on land , concentrated mainly in Texas and California and scattered throughout the Midwest and Northwest .
But wind experts say coastal areas have a lot to offer .
Walt Musial and Sandy Butterfield , both of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo. , estimate that offshore areas within about 90 kilometers of the United States have winds strong enough to produce 907 gigawatts of electricity — about 90 percent of the country ’s current electrical capacity .
The East Coast alone has enough wind potential to power half the country , Jacobson says .
European countries bordering the North Sea have already started to exploit the benefits of offshore wind , beginning in 1991 , when Denmark installed the world ’s first offshore wind farm .
What makes offshore wind energy advantageous in these countries , researchers say , also holds true on this side of the Atlantic .
One of the advantages of offshore wind is that it has the potential to produce more electricity than onshore wind farms .
“ Offshore wind projects can have higher performance — with stronger , more constant wind — than onshore , ” says Ryan Wiser , a renewable energy analyst at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , Calif .
In fact , in 2005 , Archer and Jacobson analyzed wind potential around the world and found that , at the height of a wind turbine , offshore wind is on average 90 percent stronger than onshore wind .
That ’s because hills , trees , buildings and other structures do n’t get in the way of winds blowing over the ocean , says Willett Kempton , a marine policy scientist at the University of Delaware in Newark .
University of Delaware Willett Kempton , a marine policy scientist , has studied the potential of offshore wind energy in the Atlantic Ocean , as well as public opinion regarding offshore wind farms .
What ’s really promising about offshore wind energy is that the best offshore winds , unlike onshore , are close to some of the most densely populated parts of the United States , Wiser says .
In Texas , for example , most of the state ’s wind farms are in the sparsely inhabited west , where energy demands are relatively low and wind farms produce more electricity than is consumed .
Bringing some of this extra electricity to large Texas metropolises would require investing in costly new transmission lines .
Electricity from a wind farm a dozen kilometers off the Gulf Coast , however , could more easily be brought onto the electric grid to help power large nearby cities like Houston .
Offshore wind energy is not without its challenges , Patterson says .
Intermittent winds causing irregular electrical generation are a real concern for many people , as are price and technology .
Both Wiser and Jacobson say the intermittent winds argument really is n’t as big of a problem as people might think .
Even with traditional forms of energy , Wiser says , power companies have to manage some uncertainty in matching electrical production to consumer use .
At least in the foreseeable future , he says , they should also be able to manage any uncertainty caused by wind energy .
Linking wind farms together with transmission grids to form a larger , interconnected array of wind farms would also minimize problems with intermittent winds , Jacobson says , because the probability that all wind farms over an extended area would experience similar or unexpected changes in wind patterns is quite low .
Connecting wind farms with each other — or with other forms of energy such as solar or geothermal — would thus ensure a continuous flow of electricity .
And as an added benefit , Patterson says , studies also show that the strength of offshore winds often peaks during the day in tandem with peak energy use .
Economic and technological issues remain real obstacles to a successful offshore wind energy industry , however .
Operating a wind farm in the ocean is more costly than operating one on land , Wiser says .
Factoring in the added difficulties and extra costs of transporting and installing on the seafloor several dozen 80 - meter - tall wind turbines , the expense of running underwater electrical cables from the turbines back to shore and the extra safeguards needed to protect the turbines from the force of ocean waves means that “ the cost can be 50 to 100 percent higher for offshore wind than onshore wind , ” he says .
Another problem with the budding offshore wind industry is that the technology used to build the wind farms still has a long way to go .
Currently , for example , supports used to anchor the turbines to the seafloor have only been designed for use in shallow waters no deeper than about 30 meters , but Musial and Butterfield found that almost 90 percent of the 907 gigawatts of potential wind energy off the United States is over deeper waters .
To build deepwater wind farms , developers will probably initially have to rely on attaching turbines to anchored structures similar to those used in the offshore oil and gas industry , but eventually they may need to develop floating platforms for use in really deep waters — something that could happen within the next 15 years , says Mike Dvorak , a graduate student at Stanford , who has studied California ’s offshore wind potential .
Schellstede and his company are already beginning to address these technological problems .
They ’ve engineered a turbine with special blades designed to withstand the stronger forces of offshore winds and they ’ve also developed one of the first marine platforms made specifically to support a wind turbine .
Other offshore wind developers across the country have already expressed interest in these designs , Schellstede says .
In the United States , efforts to build offshore wind farms are not limited to the Gulf Coast .
The country is home to another coastline with an abundance of strong winds over shallow waters : the stretch of the Atlantic Ocean that spans from the Mid-Atlantic to New England .
The Great Lakes and parts of the Pacific coastline , especially along California , also show potential , although offshore wind developers have yet to express interest in these regions .
The U.S. offshore wind energy movement first took off when Energy Management Inc. ( EMI ) decided it wanted to build a wind farm off New England .
After assessing and modeling the New England coastline , the company thought it had found the perfect site : Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound off Massachusetts ’ famed Cape Cod .
The site had all the right features : strong winds , shallow waters , close proximity to the electric grid and natural protection from storm waves .
In 2001 , EMI proposed putting 130 wind turbines on this spot , about nine kilometers away from the nearest shore .
They called their project “ Cape Wind . ” EMI promised Cape Wind would provide enough electricity to meet three - fourths of the energy needs of the residents of Cape Cod , Martha ’s Vineyard and Nantucket .
Seven years later , however , the Cape Wind project is still struggling to make it past the permitting phase of its plan .
The vocal opposition of local residents , most notably Sen. Edward Kennedy , D.- Mass. , has kept the project on hold .
A proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware has been met with a more favorable reaction .
In 2006 , Delmarva Power , a Mid-Atlantic power company , sought proposals for a new Delaware power plant .
Wind energy developer Bluewater Wind proposed building a wind farm more than 17 kilometers offshore .
From the vantage point of Delaware ’s beaches , the turbines would appear to be tiny structures half the size of a thumbnail .
Kempton says opinion polls show that more than 90 percent of residents want the wind farm , which could provide enough electricity to power as many as 100,000 homes .
But politics and special interests have stalled the final power purchase contract , making the wind farm ’s fate still undecided .
REpower Installation of a wind turbine in the Beatrice Field off Scotland 's northeast coast .
Things are quieter on the West Coast .
Dvorak , Jacobson and Archer have analyzed wind potential off California .
The summer winds off populous Southern California are too weak to sustain a wind farm , and the winds off San Francisco are strong but over deep water , Dvorak says .
Strong winds over shallow waters exist in Northern California , but the region is less densely populated with fewer transmission lines .
But Dvorak , Jacobson and Archer have proposed building a wind farm in Cape Mendocino , not too far from Eureka .
Most opposition to these proposed projects is nothing more than a textbook case of the NIMBY ( Not In My Back Yard ) syndrome , wind proponents say .
But Audra Parker , director of strategic planning for the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound , an environmental organization that opposes Cape Wind in particular , says these concerns are legitimate and go beyond not wanting to see turbines alter Cape Cod ’s picturesque , million - dollar views .
One potential problem for Cape Wind , for example , could be its geology .
Horseshoe Shoal ’s unsteady glacial sediments suggest that the region might not be the most stable location in which to place giant turbines .
But other concerns have received much more attention .
For one , residents who will receive electricity from offshore wind farms do n’t want to pay the premium price of wind energy to power their homes , Parker says .
She says wind advocates have downplayed the higher cost of offshore wind energy relative to less expensive forms of traditional energy , such as coal or natural gas .
She points out that a recent assessment by the Minerals Management Service , the government agency responsible for overseeing federal offshore energy resources , estimates electricity from Cape Wind would cost $ 122 per megawatt whereas the average market price in New England is more like $ 66 per megawatt .
Apprehension about the high cost of wind energy has already ended the prospects of at least one offshore wind farm in the United States .
Last August , the Long Island Power Authority released a study that compared the economics of building a wind farm off New York ’s Long Island to building a natural gas power plant .
The study concluded that the cost of building the wind farm and connecting it to the electrical grid could top $ 800 million .
Over a 20 - year period , the wind farm would cost users an extra $ 66 million per year .

A family looks at offshore wind turbines off the coast of Swalecliffe , Kent , in southeastern England .
Wind analysts , however , say the cost of wind power really is n’t prohibitive .
It ’s the most cost - competitive form of renewable energy , Kempton says .
“ Even compared with existing fossil electricity prices in this region , the contract in hand here in Delaware is at market rates or a little above , but not more than 10 percent [ above projected market rates ] . ”
And owners of offshore wind farms can promise their customers long - term price stability , says Mark Rodgers , communications director for Cape Wind , because wind is a stable , renewable energy source that ’s not subject to the inflation or market volatility that plagues fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas .
Wiser , who has followed the U.S. wind energy market for the last 13 years , thinks it ’s a bit premature to forecast what the cost of offshore wind energy will really be .
“ Presumably the cost will go down as technology improves over time , ” he says .
This was true of the onshore wind industry , which has seen an 80 percent drop in the price of its generated electricity since the early 1980s , according to AWEA .
But a carbon tax , which may be imminent , could help level things out sooner , as wind farms do n’t produce any carbon emissions , Schellstede says .
Offering people a clean form of energy was one reason why EMI thought Cape Wind would be a good idea in the first place .
“ We felt we were being responsive to long - standing calls by environmental organizations to have more renewable energy , ” Rodgers says .
Cape
Wind is a step toward taking “ real action against global warming . ”
In fact , offshore wind energy can go a long way toward “ solving climate change without huge amounts of money , ” Kempton says .
Kempton and his colleagues reported in a 2007 paper in Geophysical Research Letters , that there ’s more than enough wind energy off the Atlantic to supply all the energy needs of residents from North Carolina to Massachusetts .
Replacing all fossil fuels with offshore wind energy — which would include replacing fuel - powered cars with electric cars — would reduce the region ’s carbon dioxide emissions by 68 percent .
This is n’t going to happen anytime soon , but building at least a few wind farms is a step in the right direction .
“ Other solutions are just futuristic and we hope [ they ] will work , but we already know wind energy works , ” Jacobson says .
Ironically , critics of Cape Wind and other proposed offshore wind farms have claimed these wind farms may actually cause more environmental harm than good :
Birds could be killed by the turbines ’ powerful blades or marine wildlife could be disturbed by the dozens of turbines embedded in the ocean , which could then disrupt local fishing economies .
But wind developers say they take these factors into consideration when scouting out possible offshore locations .
And wind analysts say turbines are no more of a threat to bird populations than skyscrapers , communication towers or other human - made structures .
In January , the Minerals Management Service sided with wind developers , releasing a favorable draft environmental impact study of Cape Wind .
Now that it has claimed this victory , Cape Wind ’s developers are “ cautiously optimistic ” that they ’ll receive all their permits by the end of the year , Rodgers says .
If they do , construction on the wind farm could begin in 2010 and be completed by 2011 .
If the Delaware wind farm survives its own political process , Kempton predicts it could be up and running as soon as 2013 .
And offshore wind may also be in New Jersey ’s future .
In March , the state announced that it had received three proposals for a grant to fund a pilot offshore wind project .
REpower
The world 's first deepwater wind farm is located in the Beatrice Field off the northeast coast of Scotland .
Considering all the proposed wind farms , Kempton says it ’s unlikely that they will all be built .
But these first few attempts are a good start for an “ industry that will be evolving for at least another 30 years , ” he says .
While projects on the East Coast remain mired in politics and the West Coast faces technical barriers for now , development along the Gulf Coast is moving forward .
The opposition to offshore wind farms on the East Coast is “ flabbergasting , ” Patterson says .
Schellstede feels fortunate that WEST is dealing with the state of Texas .
“ We feel like we ’re living in heaven compared to the hell [ Cape Wind ] is going through , ” he says .
Things may be a bit easier in Texas , in part , because the Gulf Coast is a working coastline , so adding a few turbines to the mix of oil and gas platforms and drilling rigs has n’t caused much outcry , Archer says .
“ It ’s ironic to think that Texas , traditionally an oil state , has put so much effort into renewables that it might be the first state with an offshore wind farm . ”
That offshore wind farm could be up and running soon .
WEST has been collecting meteorological data on its Galveston lease for almost eight months now and the data show the area is “ in a very good wind zone , ” Schellstede says .
The next step is to install an actual wind turbine this summer to collect some more data , he says , which could then lead to a working offshore wind farm by the beginning of 2010 .
All the electricity generated by the wind farm could be sold to one of several companies , such as Wal - Mart , that have expressed interest in the project .
But ultimately , Schellstede says he would like to see his offshore wind farms owned and operated by a power company so that the most renewable power reaches the most people .

No Need To Look Further .
There are few issues in a marina more likely to rock the boats than the topic of live - aboards -- people or families who live full time on board .
For some , it ’s the fulfillment of a fantasy lifestyle -- the freedom to pick up anchor on a whim , living unburdened by possessions beyond one ’s true needs .
But the reality is that people choose to live on the water for a number of practical reasons as well .
In Southern California , where homeownership can be cost - prohibitive and rents are n’t far behind , living on a boat can be a low - cost housing option or a retirement choice for those seeking adventure .
And it ’s a more affordable answer for families seeking a vacation home on the water .
There are no census or other reliable statistics to indicate how many people live aboard boats .
But the long waiting lists at marinas suggest that the demand for live - aboard slips is strong , whereas 10 years ago , some marinas had to offer a free month ’s rent for people willing to sign a year ’s lease .

But against the backdrop of today ’s increased demand , boaters and marinas throughout the country continue to engage in a lively back - and - forth about whether having some -- or any -- boats occupied full time is a good thing .
The issues involve safety , environmental concerns , establishing fair usage fees and plain old snobbery .
“ If you are a considerate boater , clean and take care of your boat and dock area , ” said Dave Geoffroy , executive director of the Southern California Marine Assn. , “ living aboard can be a pleasant experience for all involved . ”
Once a live - aboard for four years himself , Geoffroy said a few bad apples can spoil it for everyone .
“ There are people who hang their laundry out , let their boats fall into disrepair , you know , make it look like a tenement . ”
According to Linda Ridihalgh , editor of Living Aboard magazine , marinas sometimes undervalue their live - aboard clientele -- an opinion echoed by many boaters .

“ Sometimes , marinas lose sight of the fact that full - time boaters can be an asset , ” she said .
In a storm , the live - aboards tend to take to the water in their dinghies , recapturing boats that have broken loose .
In less dramatic circumstances , their everyday presence helps thwart criminals and vandals .
“ Living aboard used to have a certain image , of derelicts or hippies , ” she said , “ but now it ’s more for boomers heading toward retirement , people looking for more out of life . ”
But those boomers and others contemplating the lifestyle may find themselves met with a “ no vacancy ” sign .
Some marinas prohibit live - aboards outright ; others follow the industry standard and allow 10 % of their slips to be rented to them ; far rarer are the marinas that welcome live - aboards unabashedly .
And in virtually every marina , there are sneak - aboards , people who stay on their boats without the marina ’s knowledge or permission .

In most Los Angeles - area marinas , the demand for live - aboard slips so greatly outpaces the number available that long waiting lists are common .
Mark Nicholas , author of “ The Essentials of Living Aboard a Boat , ” said that although it may seem backward , live - aboard wannabes should line up an available slip before buying a boat .
This may mean paying rent for an unused slip for several months while they shop for a boat .
The Ventura West Marina in Ventura is rare inasmuch as it allows almost half -- 250 -- of its 554 slips to be rented to live - aboards .
All live - aboard slips are presently occupied and there is a 200 - name waiting list of people who plopped down half a month ’s rent as a deposit , general manager Chuck Ormson said .
“ We are a reasonable alternative to not being able to afford a $ 500,000 house , ” Ormson said .
Monthly slip fees range from $ 210 for a 20 - foot boat to $ 1,080 for an 80 - footer .
Live - aboards pay an additional $ 110 a month ( for one person ; $ 135 for two ; $ 155 for three ) in Phase II and $ 160 a month ( for one person ; $ 210 for two ; $ 255 for three ) in Phase I. Children under 10 are free ; 10 - to 16 - year - olds are charged $ 20 a month .

The Ventura West Marina , in welcoming live - aboards , also provides reasonable accommodations that address some of the problems other marinas have with live - aboards .
It rents out inside and outdoor storage lockers for $ 20 and $ 10 a month , respectively .
There is a laundry on site plus a game room with a lending library , video rental and gym .
All the boats are owner - occupied and live - aboard slips are staggered -- meaning all the live - boards are n’t in one part of the marina .
The live - aboard population at this well - maintained 30 - year - old marina includes a number of families .
A few are military families with one parent deployed in the Middle East .
Linda and Brady Guillaume moved on board their 35 - foot sailboat with their two sons 18 months ago .
The boys , now 6 and 8 , attend Pierpont Elementary School in Ventura .
Brady commutes to Camarillo to his engineering job .
Linda , with a master ’s degree in counseling and a teaching credential , is a stay - at - home mom for now .
She said living in such close quarters -- about 300 square feet -- is n’t a problem because her family “ loves being together . ”
Her only condition before agreeing to renting out their 2,000 - square - foot Oxnard Shores home and moving onboard full time was that both boys take year - round swimming lessons .

Does the small space ever bother her ?
Cooking and serving dinner is a cinch , she said , because she does n’t need to take more than a step or two in any direction to reach anything .
And when they lived in a land home , “ we were all in the same room all the time anyway . ”
“ Less is more , ” she said .
“ Some women dream about bigger houses .
I dream about getting a bigger boat . ”
She has an off - site storage area where some family heirlooms are kept .
The family ’s plan is to buy a mountain home in a few years .
Laurin and Caston Dalon spent a year cruising around Central America before the birth of their now - 8 - month - old son , Cas , prompted them to drop anchor at the Ventura West Marina in January .

“ It ’s a good lifestyle , ” said Laurin Dalon , 34 .
“ Do n’t let anyone tell you that ’s it ’s necessarily a cheap way to live .
It helps if you can work on your own boat , or it can get pretty expensive . ”
She added there ’s a running joke that “ B.O.A.T. stands for ‘ bring on another thousand . ’ ”
The price varies , depending on size , features and whether they are new or used .
Even pre-owned boats can cost $ 100,000 or more .
Many live - aboards get around this by buying fixer - uppers .
The Internal Revenue Service permits tax deductions for boat - loan interest provided the craft is used as a primary or secondary home and has cooking , sleeping and toilet facilities .
Another way to ensure the interest deduction is to refinance the mortgage on your land - based home to buy the boat .
Author Nicholas , who lives and practices law in Redondo Beach , agrees that the lifestyle only appears to be inexpensive .
Typical costs include a monthly boat payment , slip fees , live - aboard fees , insurance and the normal expenses of cable , Internet and cellphone service plus routine boat maintenance and operating costs .
He estimated that these could be as much as $ 20,000 a year .
The Dalons ’ 46 - foot sailboat was a few years used when they bought it for $ 200,000 .
It provides them with about 650 square feet of living space on two levels .

Caston , an engineer and businessman , has been a lifelong sailor .
Laurin came to the water later , when she met him .
“ I ca n’t say we wo n’t , at some point , be land - based , ” Laurin said .
“ But we probably will always have a boat . ”
Although families dot the live - aboard scene , it ’s more common to find live - aboards like Rick Clemenson , a Santa Monica architect with his own firm .
Clemenson , a bachelor , had been living on the water full time in Marina del Rey for the last few years but now spends a few nights a week at his girlfriend ’s home in Mar Vista .
At 57 , he has lived on and off boats for 30 years and came to his current live - aboard status when he and his wife divorced .

“ She got the house and everything in it and I got the boat , ” he said , joking .
“ It was meant to be . ”
Although his own boat and dock are clutter - free and spotlessly maintained , Clemenson is quick to admit that some live - aboards cause problems .
Live - aboards get a bad name , he said , when they “ junk up ” the dock with their overflow possessions , do n’t maintain their boats and disturb their neighbors with excessive partying .
Boats are moored close to one another , Clemenson said , and it ’s hard to avoid overhearing everything occurring in your neighbors ’ slip .
“ Who wants a bunch of drunks next door ? ” he said .
“ If you have a bad - neighbor problem , it ’s literally on top of you . ”
Clemenson , who calls the Mariners Bay marina home and pays $ 790 a month for his slip rental ( which includes $ 200 a month for live - aboard privileges ) , has mastered the art of scaling down possessions to those that are necessary for life on board .

The architect in him likes the minimalism that boat - living necessitates .
He uses one of his three bedrooms for storage and tools , and his 150 - square - foot living room - galley - dining room area is sufficient space to entertain .
There are two bathrooms .
Despite the small quarters , he manages to fit in his books , guitar , laptop and a 17 - inch flat screen TV .
His business suits hang neatly in a closet tucked behind what doubles as a sink and vanity top .
“ Things are stacked , so you need to remember where you put them because they are often covered up by something else , ” Clemenson said .
Live - aboards seem to fall in and out of favor , author Nicholas said .
The trend now , he added , is that marinas want “ boaters whose boats look good . ”
He added , “ They want their boaters to not look like they have garages in their slips .
Right now , they are more flexible with live - aboards .
They want people there to keep an eye on things . ”

Nicholas lives on land now , having had the sailor ’s curse of falling in love with a woman who experiences seasickness .
But he keeps his 35 - foot sailboat moored in Long Beach and is introducing his future wife to life on the water in weekend - long increments .

Steve O'Shea , a marine biologist who is part of an international team looking at the creature , said he could tell from the creature 's beak that it was not yet fully grown .
" Perhaps the colossal squid gets up to 750 kilograms .
That is certainly not the largest specimen out there , " he said .
Only 75 colossal squid have ever been recovered , but the one found last February is the best preserved and most intact .
Scientists have had to take great care to thaw the creature .
The squid 's huge bulk would have taken days to defrost naturally , leaving the outside to rot while the inside remained frozen .
The creature is being gradually thawed in a tank filled with salty water .
Because salt water freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water , it will allow the freshwater ice block around the creature to melt , while the surrounding liquid is kept at about 0 degrees .
Scientists were disappointed to learn this morning that the creature was taking longer to thaw than hoped , meaning they 've so far been unable to take detailed measurements or determine its gender .
But an initial examination had still yielded a lot of useful information , Dr O'Shea said .
" In 2003 , when we had the first specimen , we did n't have any eyes .
When we put a certain gadget in the water here we saw two of the most sensational eyes and they are both perfect .
That is a highlight .
That is probably the best thing so far , " Dr O'Shea said .
The eyes of the colossal squid are the largest known in the animal kingdom , and those examined today were about 27 centimetres in diameter , although only about 10 centimetres are visible from the outside .
Mark Fenwick , a technician at Wellington 's Te Papa Tongarewa Museum where the squid will be housed , admitted that scientists had yesterday snacked on part of another colossal squid being examined today .
" It was almost like a tua tua , you know a cockle .
It was very nice .
It left a real taste in your mouth and stayed for quite a while , " he said .
" It was very much like [ sashimi ] .
This is a gourmet meal .
I do n't know anyone else who has eaten Mesonychoteuthis . "
Dr O'Shea said eating the squid was one way to determine whether the colossal type had ammonia in its system , as the giant squid does .
" The interesting thing about it is that it was non-ammoniacal .
It tasted good , apparently , " he said .

Nine Inch Nails
OK , this is getting pretty preposterous .
Just a few months ago , Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails , released their latest studio effort , the 36 track long instrumental album Ghosts .
The album was released in numerous formats , mostly digital , of which one was free ( 7 tracks long ) and was more or less well received .
Now , it seems the band are back with a new album , just a dozen weeks after NIN released their previous record , titled The Slip .
And guess what , it ’s as free as a bird to download .
This after subsequently Trent released the album ’s first single , Discipline , as a free digital download on the band ’s website and urged people to get back on nin.com on May 5th .
Something big was definitely about to happened , but I do n’t know if anyway was really thinking about anything like this .
I mean holly fuck , right ?
as a thank you to our fans for your continued support , we are giving away the new nine inch nails album one hundred percent free , exclusively via nin.com .
the music is available in a variety of formats including high - quality MP3 , FLAC or M4A lossless at CD quality and even higher - than - CD quality 24/96 WAVE .
your link will include all options – all free .
all downloads include a PDF with artwork and credits .
for those of you interested in physical products , fear not .
we plan to make a version of this release available on CD and vinyl in july .
details coming soon .
nin.com
Well that ’s very generous of you , Trent .
But is n’t this really too much material ?
Sure , being free agents , NIN are free from any deadlines , release date or boundaries of any kind , which any other band signed to a label , has to endure .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m a firm believer and supporter for new music and I always encourage it , when I get the chance , however , I feel like new material from artists should be released at a more manageable pace .
The music needs to be properly digested by the listener and of course there ’s the issue of quality .
I ’m half way through the album and I ’m yet to be impressed by it .
Anyway this is yet another progress in the fight against labels and their oppression against bands .
For that I salute you , Trent !
Also , NIN have announced a North American tour for this summer , with a set of pretty unusual openers , like the indie stars Deerhunter , Crystal Castles , A Place to Bury Strangers and Does It Offend You , Yeah ?
Tickets go on presale for NIN.com users here .
Quite interesting times to be a NIN fan .

Alaska Legislature Stops Real ID Act Implementation April 12 , 2008
Saturday
( SitNews ) ­ The Alaska Legislature approved legislation rejecting implementation of the federal Real ID Act .
Lawmakers believe the federal law infringes on the fundamental right to privacy of Alaskans and would effectively bring about a national ID card system .
The legislation ­SB202 - opts Alaska out of REAL ID by forbidding the funding of anything that would further REAL ID compliance .
SB202 is sponsored by Sen. Bill Wielechowski , D- Anchorage .
" The Real ID Act just goes too far , " said Wielechowski .
" It turns a driver 's license into a tracking card and tells the federal government nearly everything you do from buying a gun , entering a federal facility or just taking your family to a national park .
If we fail to stop the Real ID Act now , our personal privacy will be gone forever . "
The federal Real ID law was passed by Congress in May 2005 as part of a " must pass " federal appropriations bill .
The law requires driver 's licenses and state ID cards to carry what is known as " common machine readable technology , " and that means the government can swipe your card every time you use it .
The information can be accessed by all other states and will be maintained by a private corporation .
The information could even be used by Canada and Mexico due to treaties the United States has with those nations .
" Alaska has struck a blow for freedom and individual liberty " , said Bill Scannell , spokesman for The Identity Project .
" Alaskans know that REAL ID is an unfunded mandate from Washington DC that does nothing for security while making Alaskans less free . "
The Real ID
Act ­if enacted -- could take on " Big Brother " proportions .
The federal legislation gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the power to require biometric information to the card .
That means your fingerprints , a retinal scan - even your DNA can be added to the card .
Many gun owners are also concerned it will be used to create a national gun registry .
By opting - out of REAL ID , Alaskans no longer need worry about this .
Alaska is not the only state rising up against the Real ID Act .
Eighteen other states have passed legislation similar to SB 202 and another eighteen are considering them .
At least 600 groups from Catholic Social Services to the Gun Owners of America are opposed to the Real ID Act.

Ketchikan , Alaska
The Amazon has long been known as the " lungs of the world "
In the last five months of 2007 , 3,235 sq km ( 1,250 sq miles ) were lost .
Gilberto Camara , of INPE , an institute that provides satellite imaging of the area , said the rate of loss was unprecedented for the time of year .
Officials say rising commodity prices are encouraging farmers to clear more land to plant crops such as soya .
The monthly rate of deforestation saw a big rise from 243 sq km ( 94 sq miles ) in August to 948 sq km ( 366 sq miles ) in December .
" We 've never before detected such a high deforestation rate at this time of year , " Mr Camara said .
His concern , outlined during a news conference in Brasilia on Wednesday , was echoed by Environment Minister Marina Silva .
Expensive soya
Ms Silva said rising prices of raw materials and commodities could be spurring the rate of forest clearing , as more and more farmers saw the Amazon as a source of cheap land .
" The economic reality of these states indicate that these activities impact , without a shadow of a doubt , on the forest , " she said .
The state of Mato Grosso was the worst affected , contributing more than half the total area of forest stripped , or 1,786 sq km ( 700 sq miles ) .
The states of Para and Rondonia were also badly affected , accounting for 17.8 % and 16 % of the total cleared respectively .
The situation may also be worse than reported , with the environment ministry saying the preliminary assessment of the amount of forest cleared could double as more detailed satellite images are analysed .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is due to attend an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss new measures to tackle deforestation in the Amazon .
The latest figures will be an embarrassment for the Brazilian president , says the BBC's Americas editor , Warren Bull .
Last year , President Lula said his government 's efforts to control illegal logging and introduce better certification of land ownership had helped reduce forest clearance significantly .
Even as he celebrated the success , though , environmentalists were warning that the rate was rising again .
What 's the furthest you 've ever fallen ?
Humpty Dumpty was a big wuss .
While he was busy incurring mortal breakage from falling off a dinky little wall , people have been falling off of skyscrapers and out of planes -- and surviving .
Heck , it even happened to someone I know : my friend Sara 's dad worked construction in the 80s , and one unfortunate day ( or fortunate , depending on how you look at it ) , he fell off the top of a six - story work site -- and landed on his feet .
Some nagging pain aside , after a lengthy hospital stay he was more or less fully - functional , and every year on the anniversary of the accident , his family throws him a tongue - in - cheek " fall party . "
As cool ( and scary ) as that is , however , it 's small potatoes compared to the following Guinness - worthy fallers .
Take a page from their book , Humpty :
The faller : Alcides Moreno , a Manhattan window washer
He fell off of : the side of a 47 - story Upper East Side apartment building after the safety ropes on his 3 - foot - wide window washer 's platform failed , last week .
Putting him back together : is going much better than expected ; despite extensive injuries , he 's awake and talking , and doctors expect he 'll walk again , too .
What we can learn : well , Moreno was certainly lucky : according to staff at the New York - Presbyterian hospital where he 's being treated , fewer than 1 percent of people who fall more than 10 stories survive .
Falls from much shorter distances can be fatal if the victim hits his or her head .
( When Moreno is feeling a little better , maybe he 'll share his technique . )
The faller : Vesna Vulovic , a stewardess , in the winter of 1972
She fell : 33,330 feet from an airplane over the Czech Republic ( then Czechoslovakia ) after a terrorist bomb ripped it to pieces , earning her a place in the Guinness Book : " Highest Fall Survived Without a Parachute . "
She was the sole survivor -- 27 others died -- and was found on a snowy mountainside by a German hiker , a serving cart pinned against her spine .
Putting her back together again :
She never walked again , but aside from that , Vesna made a full recovery .
She even went back to work for the airline ( though she took a desk job ) , and claims to have suffered no psychological trauma as a result of the accident , because a month - long amnesia erased it from her memory .
What we can learn : it 's hard to know what Vesna 's falling technique was , thanks to her memory loss .
It 's thought , however , that her low blood pressure helped her survive the initial shock of the 500 mph wind and - 45 Â°C temperatures ( her heart may have burst otherwise ) , and that the snow cushioned her landing somewhat .
The best way to survive a fall from an airplane is to fall into a body of deep water with your body extended into as neat a line as possible -- though deep snow also provides some cushion .
The faller : The Royal Air Force 's Sgt. Nicholas Alkamede
He did n't fall so much as he : jumped , seeing as how it was World War II and his plane was on fire during a not - so - successful bombing mission over Germany , which turned out to be a good move .
He fell 18,000 feet to become the luckiest parachuteless bailout of the war , falling through tree branches and into a snowdrift , where his worst injuries were scratches , bruises , burns and a twisted knee .
Not so luckily , he was then captured by the Germans .
Carriers are finding out that a side effect of offering unlimited voice and data plans is that people tend to use them more .
Great , right ?
Not if their backend can't handle the new flood of traffic .
One of Sprint 's VPs told a panel at CTIA that " the increase in unlimited data and voice plans exponentially increases the backhaul requirements of 2G and 3G networks " so they 're being forced to upgrade their network with higher speed pipes , like fiber .
( AT&T already had its 3G wake - up call . )
This is good for us , because it means faster , more reliable data services .

Unlimited Calling Plan Cheat Sheet Okay , so every major provider now has unlimited access plans .
But what do you really get with each …

Plus , it 'll also help the push to next - generation mobile broadband like LTE and WiMax , since carriers ' current infrastructure apparently can't meet the exponentially higher bandwidth requirements .
Neatly cyclical conclusion :
Use more bandwidth , get more bandwidth !
[ GigaOM ]
It all began back in 1985 , when Thane Heins , having studied electronics at Heritage College in Gatineau , Quebec , started thinking about how magnets could be used to improve power generators .
But it was n't until after the 9/11 attacks that he started seriously experimenting in his basement , motivated by the desire to reduce our dependence on oil and the countries that back terrorism .
Heins tinkered away , making what seemed like good progress , until one day in early 2006 he stumbled on to something strange .
As part of a test , he had connected the driveshaft of an electric motor to a steel rotor with small round magnets lining its outer edges .
The idea was that as the rotor spun , the magnets would pass by a wire coil placed just in front of them to generate electrical energy – in other words , it would operate like a simple generator .
The voltage was there , but to get current he had to attach an electrical load to the coil – like a light bulb – or simply overload it , which would cause it to slow down and eventually stop .
Heins did the latter , but instead of stopping , the rotor started to rapidly accelerate .
" The magnets started flying off and hitting the wall , and I had to duck for cover , " says Heins , surprised because he was using a weak motor .
" It was like , holy crap , this is really scary . "
By overloading the generator , the current should have caused the coil to build up a large electromagnetic field .
This field typically creates an effect called " Back EMF , " described as Lenz 's law in physics , which would act to repel the approaching magnets on the rotor and slow down the motor until it stopped .
Some call it the law of diminishing returns , or a law of conservation .
" Lenz 's law is essentially magnetic friction , which is a form of resistance not unlike the wind resistance your car experiences when driving down the highway , " explains Heins .
More friction means more power is necessary to maintain a constant speed .
Instead , the opposite happened .
Somehow the magnetic friction had turned into a magnetic boost .
Back to the car analogy , it 's like the wind moving from the front to the back of the vehicle .
Days later , Heins realized what had happened :
The steel rotor and driveshaft had conducted the magnetic resistance away from the coil and back into the heart of the electric motor .
Since such motors work on the principle of converting electrical energy into motion by creating rotating magnetic fields , he figured the Back EMF was boosting those fields , causing acceleration .
But how could this be ?
It would create a positive feedback loop .
As the motor accelerated faster it would create a larger electromagnetic field on the generator coil , causing the motor to go faster , and so on and so on .
Heins confirmed his theory by replacing part of the driveshaft with plastic pipe that would n't conduct the magnetic field .
There was no acceleration .
" What I can say with full confidence is that our system violates the law of conservation of energy , " he says .
" Now , is that perpetual motion ?
Will it end up being that ? "
Compfight is a great new tool that uses Flickr 's API to search the database of photos ( including the option to do full - text search on titles and descriptions , and to limit searches to Creative Commons licensed works only ) and then feeds back the results as live clickable thumbnails .
Unlike Flickr 's own advanced - search page , Compfight remembers your settings from search to search ( great for me , as I 'm always foraging on Flickr for CC - licensed stock photos ) , and the large quantities of search - result thumbnails per page makes this the ideal choice for playing photo - editor .

" I do n't want to just end the war , I want to end the mind - set that got us into war in the first place . "
- Barack Obama
I do n’t know if that can be done , but do n’t we have to try ?
John McCain thinks this war was a good idea .
He wants us in Iraq indefinitely , or forever , whichever comes first .
Hillary refuses still to call her vote to authorize war a mistake .
Is Obama the only one who sees the big picture ?
( I wrote a piece on that big picture here , in case you missed it . )
The war against “ radical Islamic extremists ” is NOT , as McCain tried to argue in Boca Raton , “ the transcendent challenge of the 21st century . ”
The real transcendent challenge is to change “ the mind - set that got us into war in the first place ”
If we do n’t , we ’ll get more of the same .
This issue trumps all others .
All others !
Barack Obama is the one remaining viable presidential candidate from either side that will even suggest that we need to change our mind - set about war .
We have to give him the chance .
Redefining Iran as the Enemy in Iraq Editor ’s Note : In Washington and Tel Aviv , war drums are beating again regarding Iran , as the Bush administration and Israel ’s Olmert government see the window closing on the time frame for confronting Teheran with George W. Bush in the White House .
In this guest essay , the Independent Institute ’s Ivan Eland looks at how – in support of this political need – the ever - shifting enemy in Iraq has become Iran : According to General David H. Petraeus ’s progress report to Congress on Iraq , the latest worst threat to the shaky U.S. position is Iranian - backed “ special groups . ”

This label refers to parts of Moktada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , which Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and his security forces ham - handedly sought to confront and undermine in Basra before the fall local elections .
Al - Qaeda in Iraq is so passé .
This repeated allegation during the congressional hearings and the firing of Admiral William Fallon as commander - in - chief of U.S. forces in the Middle East , who was an opponent of any attack on Iran , should again raise worries to war - weary Americans about a cowboy attack on Iran before the Bush administration leaves office .
On cue , administration surrogates , such as former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson , repeated Petraeus ’s charges : “... despite undeniable progress against Sunni radicalism [ read : al - Qaeda ] , events in Iraq are still inseparable from the actions and attitudes of Shiite militias armed and directed by Iran — an influence that America failed to confront for many years . ”
Not only has America failed to confront these Shiite militias , the Bush administration has been enabling them .
The congressional hearings failed to bring out , because of administration intention and Democratic ignorance , that Maliki ’s security forces are infested with Shiite Badr Brigade militias that Iran prefers over the Iraqi nationalist Mahdi Army .
The confused milieu of Iraq , an administration with no coherent strategy to improve the conditions in that country , has always tried to downplay that the U.S. - backed Shiite government and its associated militias are the same ones backed by its archenemy , Iran .
But the hearings once again confirmed that the administration , always better at politics than at governing , does have a strategy : hold the lid on violence in Iraq until the Bush administration leaves office , and then blame any subsequent deterioration or loss in Iraq on the next administration .
This tack will be similar to the ludicrous argument that Henry Kissinger , who has been advising both the administration and presidential candidate John McCain , still uses about the Vietnam War : we were winning until the Democrats cut off funding for the war .
This explains Bush ’s acceptance of Petraeus ’s troop - withdrawal pause , which will undoubtedly continue until January of 2009 .
Of course , retaining a high level of U.S. forces , and the troop surge that preceded it , really has just been an insurance policy and a macho way to mask the real U.S. strategy of paying off the Sunni and Mahdi Army enemies .
This libertarian strategy ordinarily might be smart , except that bolstering these militias will , in the long run , exacerbate any civil war when they again begin to fight each other .
At the congressional hearings , however , there were signs that the latest botched Iraqi government offensive in Basra , the most important city in Iraq because it ’s in a region containing 60 percent of the country ’s oil and has Iraq ’s only access to the Persian Gulf to ship that oil ( why the U.S. let less capable British forces try to secure this city has been an unexplored administration blunder ) , was beginning to flip a few Republicans against the war .
This movement was indicated by some Republicans adopting the Democrats ’ argument that Iraqis were failing to do enough to become democratic .
Although it is grossly unfair to invade a country , destroy its social fabric and economy , and then expect people who have had no experience in democracy to quickly become democrats , if it takes those rhetorical gymnastics to justify a more rapid U.S. withdrawal , then I guess it ’s an improvement .
But unfortunately , as the hearings showed , progress toward a U.S. exit is very slow indeed .

The US Congress , the US media , the American people , and the United Nations , are looking the other way as Cheney prepares his attack on Iran .
If only America had an independent media and an opposition party .
If there were a shred of integrity left in American political life , perhaps a third act of naked aggression — a third war crime under the Nuremberg standard — by the Bush Regime could be prevented .
On March 30 , the Russian News & Information Agency , Novosti , cited " a high - ranking security source : " The latest military intelligence data point to heightened US military preparations for both an air and ground operation against Iran . "
According to Novosti , Russian Colonel General Leonid Ivashov said " that the Pentagon is planning to deliver a massive air strike on Iran ’s military infrastructure in the near future . "
The chief of Russia ’s general staff , Yuri Baluyevsky , said last November that Russia was beefing up its military in response to US aggression , but that the Russian military is not " obliged to defend the world from the evil Americans . "
On March 29 , OpEdNews cited a report by the Saudi Arabian newspaper Okaz , which was picked up by the German news service , DPA .
The Saudi newspaper reported on March 22 , the day following Cheney ’s visit with the kingdom ’s rulers , that the Saudi Shura Council is preparing " national plans to deal with any sudden nuclear and radioactive hazards that may affect the kingdom following experts ’ warnings of possible attacks on Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear reactors . "
And Admiral William " there will be no attack on Iran on my watch " Fallon has been removed as US chief of Central Command , thus clearing the way for Cheney ’s planned attack on Iran .
The Iranians do n’t seem to believe it , despite the dispatch of US nuclear submarines and another aircraft carrier attack group to the Persian Gulf .
To counter any Iranian missiles launched in response to an attack , the US is deploying anti-missile defenses to protect US bases and Saudi oil fields .
Two massive failures by the American media , the Democratic Party , and the American people have paved the way for Cheney ’s long - planned attack on Iran .
One failure is the lack of skepticism about the US government ’s explanation of 9/11 .
The other failure is the Democrats ’ refusal to begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush for lying to the Congress , the American people , and the world and launching an invasion of Iraq based on deception and fabricated evidence .
If an American president can start a war exactly as Adolf Hitler did with pure lies and not be held accountable , he can get away with anything .
And Bush and his evil regime have .
Hitler launched World War II with his invasion of Poland after staging a " Polish attack " on a German radio station .
On the night of August 31 , 1939 , a group of Nazis disguised in Polish uniforms seized a radio station in Germany .
Hitler announced that " last night Polish troops crossed the frontier and attacked Germany , " a claim no more true than the Bush Regime ’s claim that " Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction . "
Hitler ’s lie failed , because his invasion of Poland , which began the next day allegedly in reprisal for the Polish attack , had obviously been planned for many months .
Iran is a beautiful and developed country .
It is an ancient civilization .
It has attacked no one .
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty .
Iran is permitted by the treaty to have a nuclear energy program .
The Bush Regime ’s case against Iran is based on the Bush Regime ’s desire to deny Iran its rights under the treaty .
The International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have repeatedly reported that they have found no evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Despite all the disinformation from US Gen .
Petraeus and other Bush Regime military lackeys , Iran is not arming the Iraqis who are resisting the American occupation .
If Iran were arming insurgents , the insurgents would have two weapons that would neutralize the US advantage in the Iraqi conflict : missiles to knock down US helicopter gunships and rocket - propelled grenades that knock out American tanks .
The insurgents do not have these weapons and must construct clumsy anti-tank weapons out of artillery shells .
The insurgents are helpless against US air power and cannot mass forces to take on the American troops .
Indiscriminate American violence has reduced Iraq to rubble .
The civilian infrastructure is essentially destroyed — electricity , water and sewer systems , medical care and schools .
Depleted uranium is everywhere poisoning everyone , including US troops .
There is no economy , and half or more of Iraqis are unemployed .
Literally no Iraqi family has escaped an injury or a death as a consequence of the US invasion .
Millions of Iraqis have become displaced persons .
A developed country with a professional middle class has been destroyed because of lies told by the President and Vice President of the US .
The Bush Regime ’s lies are echoed by a neoconservative media , and have gone unchallenged by the opposition party and an indifferent American public .
In Afghanistan , death and destruction rains on even the smallest village from the air .
America ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are wars against the civilian populations .
Just as the world could not believe Hitler ’s next horror and thus was always unprepared , the Iranians despite all the evidence cannot believe that even the Great Satan would gratuitously attack Iran based on nothing but lies about non-existent nuclear weapons .
Iran ’s only chance would be to strike before the US delivers the first blow .
Instead of using its missiles to take out the Saudi oil fields and to sink the US aircraft carriers , instead of closing the Strait of Hormuz , instead of arming the Iraqi Shi’ites and moving them to insurgency , Iran is perched like a sitting duck in denial even as the US and its Iraqi puppet Maliki move to eliminate Al Sadr ’s Iraqi Shi’ite militia in order to avoid supply disruptions and a Shi’ite rebellion in Iraq when the US attack on Iran comes .
It is important to emphasize that Iran is making no moves toward war .
Having tamed , blackmailed , and purchased Congress , the US media , and US allies and puppets , Cheney might delight in the arrogance with which he can now attack Iran free of any restraint or fabricated provocation .
On the other hand , he might cover himself by orchestrating an " Iranian provocation " to justify his attack as a response .
But like Hitler ’s planned attack against Poland , Cheney ’s attack on Iran has long been in the works .
On March 29 the Associated Press reported that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi " poured contempt on fellow Arab leaders " at the Arab summit that day .
Gadhafi told the Arab " leaders , " many of whom are on the American payroll , that their American masters would turn on them all , just as America turned on Saddam Hussein after using him to fight a proxy war against Iran .
Saddam had once been an ally of Washington , Gadhafi reminded the Arabs , " but they sold him out . "
Gadhafi told the American puppets , " Your turn is next . "
Gadhafi asked , " Where is the Arabs ’ dignity , their future , their very existence ? "
If Arabs remain disunited , he predicted , " they will turn themselves into protectorates .
They will be marginalized and turn into garbage dumps . "
Indeed , it is this disunity that permits the US to bomb and murder at will in the Middle East .

Why the Public Can't Think Straight
We all know that the government lies to us , that it uses propaganda to support the lies , and that , for the most part , the corporate media is an integral part of the government / power elite propaganda machine .
These things are obvious to any American with even a room - temperature IQ .
For that matter , it 's hard to think of any nation that behaves otherwise .
Occasionally , the true nature of today 's corporatist media leaks out in a way that shocks .
Two recent examples :
First , Glenn Greenwald 's Major revelation : U.S. media deceitfully disseminates government propaganda .
Commenting on a recent NY Times article ( registration required ) , Greenwald points out that as damning as the revelations in that article are , the bigger story is media complicity in ignoring and suppressing such material .
He provides extensive and chilling details showing how the dishonesty and propaganda are routinely accomplished .
Greenwald says plainly that " The single most significant factor in American political culture is the incestuous , extensive overlap between our media institutions and government officials . "
After watching the Sunday news shows , Greenwald added an update , writing that " it is striking -- though unsurprising -- that not a single one saw fit to mention this NYT story demonstrating that these news programs all fed government propaganda to their viewers .
That they refuse to comment on this story and will now black it out says as much about what they really are , and what they really do , as the NYT story itself does . "
Anyone who still harbors the slightest thought that the corporate media is an honest and reliable source of information needs to read Greenwald 's article .
The second item is a short , excellent YouTube video ( 7 min 33 sec ) put together by television producer Jerry Day that documents the blatant manipulation and dishonesty of media political coverage so well , you 'll be stunned .
Ron Paul figures prominently in the discussion for obvious reasons : Paul ( who is still in the GOP race ) is the only pro-freedom , anti-war , anti-corporatist , anti-income tax , anti-Federal Reserve candidate in the race , and thus suppressing Paul 's candidacy has been the corporate media 's most important job these past several months .
This is a must - see video , and not only for Ron Paul supporters ; the facts Mr. Day presents are important for anyone who wants to understand how the warfare - welfare police state is being pushed on the American public .
I encourage you to send the link to everyone you know .

The Perma - Depression
For more than a year in these columns , I have occasionally detailed how and why the economic trend in the United States and in the West generally has been downward , and why that downtrend has a long way to go .
It is n't pleasant contemplating diminished wealth and living standards for the nation you call home , but living in a fantasy world is more expensive and dangerous than seeing things clearly .
I am sometimes asked if I see a turnaround in the near future ; have the stock and housing markets hit bottom yet , have the many financial crises shown signs of easing , will prices for oil and food and metals and other commodities soon return to the drastically more affordable levels they were at only recently .
My answer is " not likely . "
Furthermore , the trend of government interference to " help " with such problems is reliably making them worse and creating new problems , including epic tragedies such as the worldwide rise in food prices ( combined with outright shortages ) caused in large part by government biofuel mandates .
Why let the market decide what to do with that corn crop ( uh , sell it as food ? ) when government can forcibly divert it into ethanol fuel , enriching various corporate pals in the process .
Side effects include environmental degradation , food riots and starvation in the Third World ( and soon , perhaps , for the poor here in America ) , and a likely increase in both greenhouse gases and imported oil use .
But , as our eloquent Vice President might put it : " So ? " ( link is to a 26 second video of Dick Cheney responding to the news that every single American citizen , including the unborn and the recently dead , want the country out of Iraq ) .
Every major problem and downtrend from a year ago continues : the problems have not been solved but have indeed grown worse , as seemed inevitable last year ( and the year before , and the year before that , and so on for longer than I care to remember ) .
The created - from - thin - air US dollar continues eroding into nothingness and dramatic , Zimbabwe - style hyperinflation is no longer unthinkable ( see also here , for an NPR audio interview with a Harvard economist discussing Zimbabwe and hyperinflation generally ) .
Strongly bucking the trend of higher prices for most real goods , housing prices continue crashing and probably still have a long way down to go .
Oil is at $ 116.67 per barrel as I write this and so many forces are pushing the price up that a serious downtrend in prices seems unlikely anytime soon .
US job losses and overall unemployment are both on the rise .
The list of such problems is long , and the fundamental underpinnings for the ongoing downtrend run deep .
Cheerful ?
No. Factual ?
I 'm afraid so .
I hope you 'll keep the trends in mind as you live your life and plan your future ; there are no guarantees in this world but sensible action grounded in the facts will more likely benefit you than will other approaches .
Earlier this month , we launched The Server Room , Ars Technica 's new community for IT professionals .
The Server Room launch is sponsored by Dell ’s Future of Storage .
This article on a new archival backup technology is part of an ongoing topics and discussions related to IT and storage technology .
Holographic storage maker InPhase , a spinoff of Bell Labs , first appeared on the radar back in 2005 .
Initially , the company claimed that it would soon offer holographic discs at 300 GB densities , with later disc densities rising as high as 1TB .
In Phase 's actual shipping product has been coming real soon now for the past few years , but reports have the company releasing its Tapestry hologram archival product this coming May .
This time , apparently , they really , really , really , really mean it .
Pinkie swear .
The first - generation Tapestry 300r device will use 300 GB holographic discs , currently priced at $ 180 per disc in volume quantities .
Initial drive transfer speed will be 20 MBps , with transfer rates and available storage rising to 80 MB ps / 800GB with the 800r , and 120MBps / 1.6TB with the 1600r .
In Phase has given no guidance on when we might see these units , which is probably a good idea , given how long it has taken the company to ready the 300r .
The Tapestry 300r holographic storage system is impressive on a technological level , but whether that product will take hold in the market is another question altogether .
At just under $ 18,000 per unit , the Tapestry 300r is n't exactly cheap , and a 20 MBps data transfer rate , while not terrible , is n't going to drop any jaws .
At the moment , InPhase is pushing Tapestry as an archive solution rather than a data backup system .
One of the great advantages of holographic media is that it can last for decades —
In Phase claims a 50 - year lifetime — and the company is quick to emphasize these aspects in its product brochure ( PDF ) , which , as of this writing , has n't been updated since April 9 , 2007 .
The Tapestry 300r supports 68 - pin SCSI ( 160-320 ) , Fibre Channel 4GB , FTP , gigabit Ethernet , 1394 - attached cameras , Serial Attached SCSI ( SAS ) , and iSCSI as well .
The unit appears to only hold ( and write ) to one disc at a time , which could make major archival procedures tedious — swapping holographic discs in 2008 is n't any more fun than swapping 1.44 MB floppies was in 1990 .
Questions over long - term backwards compatibility may also blunt Tapestry 300r sales .
The company 's literature states that the yet - to - be- released Tapestry 800r and 1600r will be backwards compatible with 300r discs , but does not state that the 300r will be able to read 800r and 1600r media once those discs are available .
If it can't , companies and institutions that would otherwise be interested in the product may elect to wait for later products in the series .
$ 18,000 is quite a lot to pay for a single point of access , particularly when one is faced with the prospect of buying a new unit just three to four years later .
As for the issue of whether or not Tapestry is shipping for real this time , we did some follow - up calls with data storage solution provider ISSI Data , which currently offers the units for rent .
ISSI Data told us that only a small number of Tapestry 300r demo units will be available in May .
These units will be limited to a 150 GB capacity , but the discs they burn will be read - compatible with the production version of the 300r , which is currently scheduled to go on the market in September .
So once again , all we have is another promised ship date .
What does your business use for long - term archival storage ?
Would a technology like InPhase 's be attractive if it came to market and the cost per megabyte were to come down , or are there other obstacles to its adoption ?
Drop into The Server Room and join the conversation .
A year ago this week , 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston was gunned down by Atlanta narcotics officers when she opened fire on them as they kicked down her door in a " no - knock " drug raid .
The killing has had immense reverberations in the Atlanta area , especially since it opened a window on corrupt and questionable police practices in the drug squad .
Kathryn Johnston
While the Johnston killing rocked the Atlanta area , it also brought the issue of aggressive drug war police tactics to the forefront .
Each year , SWAT teams across the country conduct some 40,000 raids , according to estimates , many of them directed at drug offenders .
The tactic , where heavily armed police in military - style attire break down doors , toss flash - bang grenades , and generally behave as if they are searching for insurgents in Baghdad , has become routine , and is the stuff of various TV reality shows .
But if the raids are popular with the viewers of the likes of DALLAS SWAT , they are not necessarily as popular with the American public .
According to a poll of 1,028 likely voters commissioned by StoptheDrugWar.org ( DRCNet ) and conducted by Zogby International in October , a solid majority of respondents said such tactics were not justified for routine drug raids .
Here is the exact question asked : " Last year 92 - year old Kathryn Johnston was killed by Atlanta police serving a drug search warrant at an incorrect address supplied by an informant .
Reports show that police use SWAT teams to conduct raids as often as 40,000 times per year , often for low - level drug enforcement .
Do you agree or disagree that police doing routine drug investigations in non-emergency situations should make use of aggressive entry tactics such as battering down doors , setting off flash - bang grenades , or conducting searches in the middle of the night ? "
Nearly two - thirds -- 65.8 % -- said police should not routinely use such tactics .
With minor variations , that sentiment held across geographic , demographic , religious , ideological , and partisan lines .
Opposition to the routine use of SWAT tactics for drug law enforcement ranged from 70.7 % in the West to 60.5 % in the East .
Residents of large cities ( 60.7 % ) , small cities ( 71.2 % ) , the suburbs ( 66.7 % ) , and rural areas ( 65.0 % ) , all opposed the routine use of SWAT tactics .
Among Democrats , 75.1 % opposed the raids ; among independents the figure was 65.5 % .
Even in the Republican ranks , a majority -- 56 % -- opposed the raids .
Across ideological lines , 85.3 % of self - identified progressives opposed the raids , as did 80.8 % of liberals , 62.9 % of moderates , and 68.9 % of libertarians .
Even people describing themselves as conservative or very conservative narrowly opposed the routine use of SWAT tactics , with 51.5 % of the former and 52.5 % of the latter saying no .
Among African Americans , 83 % oppose the practice .
SWAT raid in Texas
" These findings do n't surprise me , " said University of Nebraska - Omaha criminologist Samuel Walker , a leading policing expert .
" When you ask global questions about crime , people say one thing , but when the question is framed so as to clarify the practice , as this one was , people have a sense of what sort of emergency situations might call for special methods and what sort of situations are routine and could be handled without SWAT - style tactics .
I find it hopeful that people seem to have such a clear sense of what is and is not appropriate , " he said .
" We 're pleased but also not surprised to get such a good response on this , " said DRCNet executive director David Borden , who authored the question .
" It 's just not a hard sell to say that people should n't get shot , burned or traumatized in their homes when there 's any other viable way of handling a situation . "
The organization is planning to do more , he says , and has posted an information page on the issue at http://stopthedrugwar.org/policeraids.
" If you believe that the criminal justice system is 100 % perfect , you tend to support the system , but with these drug raids , there have been just too many mistakes made , too many wrong doors kicked in , too many innocent people killed , " said Peter Christ , a former New York police captain who spent 20 years in policing before retiring and becoming a founding member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) .
" People understand that , and they realize that grandma down in Atlanta could have been them . "
The real question , Walker said , was how to translate public opinion into policy changes .
" I only wish this could be translated into the political realm , " he said .
For Christ , changing police practices and drug policies is a slow , even generational process of education .
The movement to reform the drug laws , he said , is akin to the movement for women 's rights .
" None of the people who started that movement in the 1830s lived to cast a vote , " he said , " but in the end , they triumphed . "
In Atlanta , the outrageous conduct of the narcotics officers involved in the Johnston case has led to changes , at least for now .
They told a judge they had an informant who had bought crack cocaine at Johnston 's home .
That was a lie .
They shot at the elderly woman protecting her home 39 times after she managed to squeeze off one shot from an old pistol .
They handcuffed her as she lay dying .
They planted marijuana in her basement after the fact .
They tried , also after the fact , to get one of their informants to say he had supplied the information , but that informant instead went to the FBI .

Two of the officers involved in the killing were ordered to prison this week pending sentencing on involuntary manslaughter and civil rights violations .
A third has an April trial date .
The Johnston killing has also rocked the Atlanta Police Department .
The police chief disbanded the entire drug squad for months , tightened up the rules for seeking search warrants , especially " no - knock " warrants , and instituted new policies forcing narcotics officers to rotate out on a regular basis .
A year - long FBI investigation into the department continues .
But across the country , the Johnston case was little more than a blip on the radar , and the SWAT - style raids continue .
" I have n't noticed any real change anywhere outside of Atlanta , " said Radley Balko , an editor at Reason magazine and a policy analyst specializing in civil liberties issues who authored the definitive report on the rise of the contemporary SWAT phenomenon , Overkill : The Rise of Paramilitary Policing in America .
" The pace of these raids has been about the same this year as last . "
And , as Balko noted in a FoxNews.com commentary this week , not only the raids , but the mistakes , some of them fatal , continue :
In February of this year , 16 - year - old Daniel Castillo , Jr. was killed in a police raid on his family 's home in Texas .
Castillo had no criminal record .
A SWAT officer broke open the door to the bedroom as Castillo , his sister , and her infant son were sleeping .
When Castillo rose from the bed after being awoken to his sister 's screams , the SWAT officer shot him in the face .
In March , police in Spring Lake , Minn. , acting on an informant 's tip , raided the home of Brad and Nicole Thompson .
The couple was forced on the ground at gun point and warned by an officer , " If you move , I 'll shoot you in the f___ing head . "
Police had the wrong house .
In June , a 72 - year - old woman on oxygen was thrown to the ground at gunpoint in a mistaken drug raid near Durango , Colo .
Balko also pointed to errant drug raids on innocent people in Temecula , CA . ; Annapolis , MD. ; several incidents in Chicago , Philadelphia , and New York City ; Galliano , LA . ; Hendersonville , NC . ; Ponderay , ID ; Stockton , CA . ; Pullman , WA . ; Baltimore ; Wilmington , DE . ; Jacksonville , FL ; Alton , KS ; Merced County , CA ; and Atlanta , GA .
And that 's just this year .
Turning the juggernaut around is a daunting task .
It would require changes to the policies and practices of hundreds of separate law enforcement agencies around the country , and that is going to require work at the state and local level .
But there are some limited prospects for change at the federal level .
In June , the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security held hearings on police militarization , and , thanks in part to Balko 's testimony , this year 's crime bill currently contains some language reflecting reforms recommended in Overkill that would limit the circumstances in which high levels of force can be used .
Still , Balko said , it is unclear if that language will make it into the final bill .
At the least , Balko was able to inform committee Chair Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) that some of the money allocated for Bill Clinton 's community policing COPS program had gone to establish SWAT teams .
When a woman in the gallery asked for renewed funding for COPS , Balko pointed out that fact .
" Are you telling me that the COPs grants we handed out in the 90s were actually used to start SWAT teams ? "
Scott asked in surprise .
Balko confirmed that was indeed the case .
" Well that 's certainly not what we had in mind , " Scott replied .
According to Balko , at least 40 innocent people have been killed in forced entry drug raids in recent years .
No one knows how many more innocents have been injured by testosterone - crazed police or had their property wantonly destroyed in such raids .
And no one is even counting how many people -- innocent , guilty , family members -- have been needlessly traumatized by the jackboot kicking the door in at 4:00 am and all that follows .
And most of the " guilty " parties are mere low - level offenders , and by law presumed innocent until proven guilty .
If the politicians and law enforcement listen to the public , such tactics will become a thing of the past .
Third World countries are plagued by things most of us can't even fathom : constant fear of war , impoverishment , and of course , diseases .
Because these countries are not as developed as richer ones , much of the populace simply cannot afford the disease fighting drugs that they need .
The result is tragic : citizens of these impoverished nations must not only live with war and chaos , but also diseases that can be cured but wont be due to lack of money .
Naturally , many people are made uncomfortable by this sad fact .
In this article , we 'll profile 6 of those drugs and why the Third World needs them .
1 ) Glivec
Glivec is an anti-cancer drug from Novartis , a " Big Pharma " conglomerate who produces many of the big name drugs we are all familiar with .
Costing as much as $ 32,000 per year for a 400 mg per day dose ( Wikipedia ) , Glivec is much too high priced for Third World countries to afford .
This has led to some recent controversy .
In India , the courts struck down an attempt by Novartis to patent the drug and stop companies from producing low - cost generics .
However , that may not last for too much longer !
However Novartis recently appealed the court 's decision in a direct challenge to India 's right to interpret the TRIPS agreement to protect public health .
If Novartis is successful , it could jeopardise India 's generic export industry .
2 ) Norvasc
A similar case can be found with the Pfizer drug Norvasc .
Pfizer is currently engaged in a battle with the Indian government , which has developed a cheap knock - off drug that it wants to distribute to its citizens at little or no cost .
While Pfizer is trying to patent the drug and reap the benefits , India and OXFAM are fighting for the right to produce cheap generics that Third World citizens can benefit from .
Here is what an OXFAM representative had to say about the matter :
" Rich countries must live up to their commitments and stop undermining the Doha Declaration with their selfish actions , " Charveriat said .
" Now more than ever we need a global trading system that puts health before profit and makes medicines affordable for all . "
3 ) AIDS Treatments
AIDS and HIV are major problems in places like Africa , where safe sex is not practiced and infection rates are enormous .
Tragically , these nations who need treatments the most do not seem to be getting them .
An article called " Big Pharma Slammed Over Third World Drug Domination " describes the situation as such :
According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) 74 per cent of AIDS medicines are still under monopoly , 77 per cent of Africans still have no access to AIDS treatment , and 30 per cent of the world 's population still do not have regular access to essential medicines .
4 ) Anti-Malaria Drugs
In addition to AIDS and HIV , Malaria is another disease that spreads like wildfire through Africa and parts of Asia .
It is carried by infected mosquitos which reproduce and create more of themselves , in addition to infecting humans .
Unfortunately , the impoverished state of people in those areas make it so that developing those drugs would not be profitable .
MalariaSite.com describes the situation well - and frighteningly :
" There is little pharmaceutical industry interest in developing new antimalarial drugs ; the risks are great , but the returns on investment are low ....
If drug resistance in P. falciparum continues to increase at the current rate , malaria may become untreatable in parts of Southeast Asia by the beginning of the next millennium . "
5 ) Oral Rehydration Therapy
Diarrhea is another problem easily dealt with in developed nations but deadly in parts of the Third World .
Interestingly , it turns out that there is a rather cheap way of treating it .
In many cases there is a simple solution for acute watery diarrhea : a mixture of sodium bicarbonate , sodium chloride , potassium chloride and glucose , stirred into drinking water .
Called oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) , it can treat 90 to 95 percent of diarrhea cases effectively and cheaply .
Unfortunately , the cheap production costs are the problem : there simply is n't enough money involved for Big Pharma companies to mass produce it .
MultiNationalMonitor.org had this to say :
Since a packet of oral rehydration salts costs only pennies to produce , it has a limited profit margin , while the other leading treatments - antibiotics and other antim icrobial drugs - albeit less effective , are a much more profitable venture .
For multinational pharmaceutical companies the decision of which type of treatment to market is easy .
For the developing world it is a disaster .
6 ) Avastin
Breast cancer is a collosal problem among women in the Third World , and a highly expensive drug called Avastin is effective at treating it .
After a lengthy FDA review process and significant controversy about whether the drug was safe or not , it is now available for doctors to reccomend .
The only problem is the astronomical cost patients must pay to use the drug .
An article titled " The High Price of a Cancer Drug " makes it clear why Third World nations probably will not benefit from this much - needed treatment .
Genentech charges about $ 92,000 a year for breast cancer patients .
For women with annual family incomes below about $ 100,000 , it caps the charges at $ 55,000 a year .
What 's the best way to punish the same early adopter customers that helped make your service a success in the first place ?
If you 're Netflix , it 's charging them extra for renting Blu-ray .
CEO Reed Hastings justifies this action by saying " consumers are used to paying more for high - definition , " basically punching this next generation of early adopters in the nads for doing what they love to do .

We 're not sure how many Blu-ray rentals you need to have before you qualify for the higher - priced membership ( or if you need to pay up before you even rent one ) , but this is undoubtedly a limited time deal .
We can't imagine Netflix will keep charging people more once 25 - 50 % of their customer base starts renting Blu-ray movies .
Will Blockbuster follow ?
We hope not .
For their sake as much as ours .
[ Alley Insider via Marketwatch via CNET ]
The title of this chapter is not a prediction , but a hope , which I will soon explain .
As for the subtitle of this book , it is not quite accurate ; a " people 's history " promises more than any one person can fulfill , and it is the most difficult kind of history to recapture .
I call it that anyway because , with all its limitations , it is a history disrespectful of governments and respectful of people 's movements of resistance .
That makes it a biased account , one that leans in a certain direction .
I am not troubled by that , because the mountain of history books under which we all stand leans so heavily in the other direction - so tremblingly respectful of states and statesmen and so disrespectful , by inattention , to people 's movements - that we need some counterforce to avoid being crushed into submission .
All those histories of this country centered on the Founding Fathers and the Presidents weigh oppressively on the capacity of the ordinary citizen to act .
They suggest that in times of crisis we must look to someone to save us : in the Revolutionary crisis , the Founding Fathers ; in the slavery crisis , Lincoln ; in the Depression , Roosevelt ; in the Vietnam - Watergate crisis , Carter .
And that between occasional crises everything is all right , and it is sufficient for us to be restored to that normal state .
They teach us that the supreme act of citizenship is to choose among saviors , by going into a voting booth every four years to choose between two white and well - off Anglo - Saxon males of inoffensive personality and orthodox opinions .
The idea of saviors has been built into the entire culture , beyond politics .
We have learned to look to stars , leaders , experts in every field , thus surrendering our own strength , demeaning our own ability , obliterating our own selves .
But from time to time , Americans reject that idea and rebel .
These rebellions , so far , have been contained .
The American system is the most ingenious system of control in world history .
With a country so rich in natural resources , talent , and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority .
It is a country so powerful , so big , so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased .
There is no system of control with more openings , apertures , lee - ways , flexibilities , rewards for the chosen , winning tickets in lotteries .
There is none that disperses its controls more complexly through the voting system , the work situation , the church , the family , the school , the mass media - none more successful in mollifying opposition with reforms , isolating people from one another , creating patriotic loyalty .
One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth .
The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99 percent against one another : small property owners against the propertyless , black against white , native - born against foreign - born , intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and unskilled .
These groups have resented one another and warred against one another with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common position as sharers of leftovers in a very wealthy country .
Against the reality of that desperate , bitter battle for resources made scarce by elite control , I am taking the liberty of uniting those 99 percent as " the people . "
I have been writing a history that attempts to represent their submerged , deflected , common interest .
To emphasize the commonality of the 99 percent , to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent , is to do exactly what the governments of the United States , and the wealthy elite allied to them - from the Founding Fathers to now - have tried their best to prevent .
Madison feared a " majority faction " and hoped the new Constitution would control it .
He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with the words " We the people ... , " pretending that the new government stood for everyone , and hoping that this myth , accepted as fact , would ensure " domestic tranquility . "
The pretense continued over the generations , helped by all - embracing symbols , physical or verbal : the flag , patriotism , democracy , national interest , national defense , national security .
The slogans were dug into the earth of American culture like a circle of covered wagons on the western plain , from inside of which the white , slightly privileged American could shoot to kill the enemy outside - Indians or blacks or foreigners or other whites too wretched to be allowed inside the circle .
The managers of the caravan watched at a safe distance , and when the battle was over and the field strewn with dead on both sides , they would take over the land , and prepare another expedition , for another territory .
The scheme never worked perfectly .
The Revolution and the Constitution , trying to bring stability by containing the class angers of the colonial period - while enslaving blacks , annihilating or displacing Indians - did not quite succeed , judging by the tenant uprisings , the slave revolts , the abolitionist agitation , the feminist upsurge , the Indian guerrilla warfare of the pre-Civil War years .
After the Civil War , a new coalition of southern and northern elites developed , with southern whites and blacks of the lower classes occupied in racial conflict , native workers and immigrant workers clashing in the North , and the farmers dispersed over a big country , while the system of capitalism consolidated itself in industry and government .
But there came rebellion among industrial workers and a great opposition movement among farmers .
At the turn of the century , the violent pacification of blacks and Indians and the use of elections and war to absorb and divert white rebels were not enough , in the conditions of modem industry , to prevent the great upsurge of socialism , the massive labor struggles , before the First World War .
Neither that war nor the partial prosperity of the twenties , nor the apparent destruction of the socialist movement , could prevent , in the situation of economic crisis , another radical awakening , another labor upsurge in the thirties .
World War II created a new unity , followed by an apparently successful attempt , in the atmosphere of the cold war , to extinguish the strong radical temper of the war years .
But then , surprisingly , came the surge of the sixties , from people thought long subdued or put out of sight - blacks , women , Native Americans , prisoners , soldiers - and a new radicalism , which threatened to spread widely in a population disillusioned by the Vietnam war and the politics of Watergate .
The exile of Nixon , the celebration of the Bicentennial , the presidency of Carter , all aimed at restoration .
But restoration to the old order was no solution to the uncertainty , the alienation , which was intensified in the Reagan - Bush years .
The election of Clinton in 1992 , carrying with it a vague promise of change , did not fulfill the expectations of the hopeful .
With such continuing malaise , it is very important for the Establishment - that uneasy club of business executives , generals , and politicos - to maintain the historic pretension of national unity , in which the government represents all the people , and the common enemy is overseas , not at home , where disasters of economics or war are unfortunate errors or tragic accidents , to be corrected by the members of the same club that brought the disasters .
It is important for them also to make sure this artificial unity of highly privileged and slightly privileged is the only unity - that the 99 percent remain split in countless ways , and turn against one another to vent their angers .
How skillful to tax the middle class to pay for the relief of the poor , building resentment on top of humiliation !
How adroit to bus poor black youngsters into poor white neighborhoods , in a violent exchange of impoverished schools , while the schools of the rich remain untouched and the wealth of the nation , doled out carefully where children need free milk , is drained for billion - dollar aircraft carriers .
How ingenious to meet the demands of blacks and women for equality by giving them small special benefits , and setting them in competition with everyone else for jobs made scarce by an irrational , wasteful system .
How wise to turn the fear and anger of the majority toward a class of criminals bred - by economic inequity - faster than they can be put away , deflecting attention from the huge thefts of national resources carried out within the law by men in executive offices .
But with all the controls of power and punishment , enticements and concessions , diversions and decoys , operating throughout the history of the country , the Establishment has been unable to keep itself secure from revolt .
Every time it looked as if it had succeeded , the very people it thought seduced or subdued , stirred and rose .
Blacks , cajoled by Supreme Court decisions and congressional statutes , rebelled .
Women , wooed and ignored , romanticized and mistreated , rebelled .
Indians , thought dead , reappeared , defiant .
Young people , despite lures of career and comfort , defected .
Working people , thought soothed by reforms , regulated by law , kept within bounds by their own unions , went on strike .
Government intellectuals , pledged to secrecy , began giving away secrets .
Priests turned from piety to protest .
To recall this is to remind people of what the Establishment would like them to forget - the enormous capacity of apparently helpless people to resist , of apparently contented people to demand change .
To uncover such history is to find a powerful human impulse to assert one 's humanity .
It is to hold out , even in times of deep pessimism , the possibility of surprise .
True , to overestimate class consciousness , to exaggerate rebellion and its successes , would be misleading .
It would not account for the fact that the world - not just the United States , but everywhere else - is still in the hands of the elites , that people 's movements , although they show an infinite capacity for recurrence , have so far been either defeated or absorbed or perverted , that " socialist " revolutionists have betrayed socialism , that nationalist revolutions have led to new dictatorships .
But most histories understate revolt , overemphasize statesmanship , and thus encourage impotency among citizens .
When we look closely at resistance movements , or even at isolated forms of rebellion , we discover that class consciousness , or any other awareness of injustice , has multiple levels .
It has many ways of expression , many ways of revealing itself - open , subtle , direct , distorted .
In a system of intimidation and control , people do not show how much they know , how deeply they feel , until their practical sense informs them they can do so without being destroyed .
History which keeps alive the memory of people 's resistance suggests new definitions of power .
By traditional definitions , whoever possesses military strength , wealth , command of official ideology , cultural control , has power .
Measured by these standards , popular rebellion never looks strong enough to survive .
However , the unexpected victories - even temporary ones - of insurgents show the vulnerability of the supposedly powerful .
In a highly developed society , the Establishment cannot survive without the obedience and loyalty of millions of people who are given small rewards to keep the system going : the soldiers and police , teachers and ministers , administrators and social workers , technicians and production workers , doctors , lawyers , nurses , transport and communications workers , garbage men and firemen .
These people - the employed , the somewhat privileged - are drawn into alliance with the elite .
They become the guards of the system , buffers between the upper and lower classes .
If they stop obeying , the system falls .
That will happen , I think , only when all of us who are slightly privileged and slightly uneasy begin to see that we are like the guards in the prison uprising at Attica — expendable ; that the Establishment , whatever rewards it gives us , will also , if necessary to maintain its control , kill us .
Certain new facts may , in our time , emerge so clearly as to lead to general withdrawal of loyalty from the system .
The new conditions of technology , economics , and war , in the atomic age , make it less and less possible for the guards of the system - the intellectuals , the home owners , the taxpayers , the skilled workers , the professionals , the servants of government - to remain immune from the violence ( physical and psychic ) inflicted on the black , the poor , the criminal , the enemy overseas .
The internationalization of the economy , the movement of refugees and illegal immigrants across borders , both make it more difficult for the people of the industrial countries to be oblivious to hunger and disease in the poor countries of the world .
All of us have become hostages in the new conditions of doomsday technology , runaway economics , global poisoning , uncontainable war .
The atomic weapons , the invisible radiations , the economic anarchy , do not distinguish prisoners from guards , and those in charge will not be scrupulous in making distinctions .
There is the unforgettable response of the U.S. high command to the news that American prisoners of war might be near Nagasaki : " Targets previously assigned for Centerboard remain unchanged . "
There is evidence of growing dissatisfaction among the guards .
We have known for some time that the poor and ignored were the nonvoters , alienated from a political system they felt did n't care about them , and about which they could do little .
Now alienation has spread upward into families above the poverty line .
These are white workers , neither rich nor poor , but angry over economic insecurity , unhappy with their work , worried about their neighborhoods , hostile to government - combining elements of racism with elements of class consciousness , contempt for the lower classes along with distrust for the elite , and thus open to solutions from any direction , right or left .
In the twenties there was a similar estrangement in the middle classes , which could have gone in various directions - the Ku Klux Klan had millions of members at that time - but in the thirties the work of an organized left wing mobilized much of this feeling into trade unions , farmers ' unions , socialist movements .
We may , in the coming years , be in a race for the mobilization of middle - class discontent .
The fact of that discontent is clear .
The surveys since the early seventies show 70 to 80 percent of Americans distrustful of government , business , the military .
This means the distrust goes beyond blacks , the poor , the radicals .
It has spread among skilled workers , white - collar workers , professionals ; for the first time in the nation 's history , perhaps , both the lower classes and the middle classes , the prisoners and the guards , were disillusioned with the system .
There are other signs : the high rate of alcoholism , the high rate of divorce ( from one of three marriages ending in divorce , the figure was climbing to one of two ) , of drug use and abuse , of nervous breakdowns and mental illness .
Millions of people have been looking desperately for solutions to their sense of impotency , their loneliness , their frustration , their estrangement from other people , from the world , from their work , from themselves .
They have been adopting new religions , joining self - help groups of all kinds .
It is as if a whole nation were going through a critical point in its middle age , a life crisis of self - doubt , self - examination .
All this , at a time when the middle class is increasingly insecure economically .
The system , in its irrationality , has been driven by profit to build steel skyscrapers for insurance companies while the cities decay , to spend billions for weapons of destruction and virtually nothing for children 's playgrounds , to give huge incomes to men who make dangerous or useless things , and very little to artists , musicians , writers , actors .
Capitalism has always been a failure for the lower classes .
It is now beginning to fail for the middle classes .
The threat of unemployment , always inside the homes of the poor , has spread to white - collar workers , professionals .
A college education is no longer a guarantee against joblessness ' , and a system that cannot offer a future to the young coming out of school is in deep trouble .
If it happens only to the children of the poor , the problem is manageable ; there are the jails .
If it happens to the children of the middle class , things may get out of hand .
The poor are accustomed to being squeezed and always short of money , but in recent years the middle classes , too , have begun to feel the press of high prices , high taxes .
In the seventies , eighties , and early nineties there was a dramatic , frightening increase in the number of crimes .
It was not hard to understand , when one walked through any big city .
There were the contrasts of wealth and poverty , the culture of possession , the frantic advertising .
There was the fierce economic competition , in which the legal violence of the state and the legal robbery by the corporations were accompanied by the illegal crimes of the poor .
Most crimes by far involved theft .
A disproportionate number of prisoners in American jails were poor and non-white , with little education .
Half were unemployed in the month prior to their arrest .
The most common and most publicized crimes have been the violent crimes of the young , the poor - a virtual terrorization in the big cities - in which the desperate or drug - addicted attack and rob the middle class , or even their fellow poor .
A society so stratified by wealth and education lends itself naturally to envy and class anger .
The critical question in our time is whether the middle classes , so long led to believe that the solution for such crimes is more jails and more jail terms , may begin to see , by the sheer uncontrollability of crime , that the only prospect is an endless cycle of crime and punishment .
They might then conclude that physical security for a working person in the city can come only when everyone in the city is working .
And that would require a transformation of national priorities , a change in the system .
In recent decades , the fear of criminal assault has been joined by an even greater fear .
Deaths from cancer began to multiply , and medical researchers seemed helpless to find the cause .
It began to be evident that more and more of these deaths were coming from an environment poisoned by military experimentation and industrial greed .
The water people drank , the air they breathed , the particles of dust from the buildings in which they worked , had been quietly contaminated over the years by a system so frantic for growth and profit that the safety and health of human beings had been ignored .
A new and deadly scourge appeared , the AIDS virus , which spread with special rapidity among homosexuals and drug addicts .
In the early nineties , the false socialism of the Soviet system had failed .
And the American system seemed out of control - a runaway capitalism , a runaway technology , a runaway militarism , a running away of government from the people it claimed to represent .
Crime was out of control , cancer and AIDS were out of control .
Prices and taxes and unemployment were out of control .
The decay of cities and the breakdown of families were out of control .
And people seemed to sense all this .
Perhaps much of the general distrust of government reported in recent years comes from a growing recognition of the truth of what the U.S. Air Force bombardier Yossarian said in the novel Catch - 22 to a friend who had just accused him of giving aid and comfort to the enemy : " The enemy is anybody who 's going to get you killed , no matter which side he 's on .
And do n't you forget that , because the longer you remember it the longer you might live . "
The next line in the novel is : " But Clevinger did forget , and now he was dead . "
Let us imagine the prospect - for the first time in the nation 's history - of a population united for fundamental change .
Would the elite turn as so often before , to its ultimate weapon - foreign intervention - to unite the people with the Establishment , in war ?
It tried to do that in 1991 , with the war against Iraq .
But , as June Jordan said , it was " a hit the same way that crack is , and it does n't last long . "
With the Establishment 's inability either to solve severe economic problems at home or to manufacture abroad a safety valve for domestic discontent , Americans might be ready to demand not just more tinkering , more reform laws , another reshuffling of the same deck , another New Deal , but radical change .
Let us be Utopian for a moment so that when we get realistic again it is not that " realism " so useful to the Establishment in its discouragement of action , that " realism " anchored to a certain kind of history empty of surprise .
Let us imagine what radical change would require of us all .
The society 's levers of powers would have to be taken away from those whose drives have led to the present state - the giant corporations , the military , and their politician collaborators .
We would need - by a coordinated effort of local groups all over the country - to reconstruct the economy for both efficiency and justice , producing in a cooperative way what people need most .
We would start on our neighborhoods , our cities , our workplaces .
Work of some kind would be needed by everyone , including people now kept out of the work force - children , old people , " handicapped " people .
Society could use the enormous energy now idle , the skills and talents now unused .
Everyone could share the routine but necessary jobs for a few hours a day , and leave most of the time free for enjoyment , creativity , labors of love , and yet produce enough for an equal and ample distribution of goods .
Certain basic things would be abundant enough to be taken out of the money system and be available - free - to everyone : food , housing , health care , education , transportation .
The great problem would be to work out a way of accomplishing this without a centralized bureaucracy , using not the incentives of prison and punishment , but those incentives of cooperation which spring from natural human desires , which in the past have been used by the state in times of war , but also by social movements that gave hints of how people might behave in different conditions .
Decisions would be made by small groups of people in their workplaces , their neighborhoods - a network of cooperatives , in communication with one another , a neighborly socialism avoiding the class hierarchies of capitalism and the harsh dictatorships that have taken the name " socialist . "
People in time , in friendly communities , might create a new , diversified , nonviolent culture , in which all forms of personal and group expression would be possible .
Men and women , black and white , old and young , could then cherish their differences as positive attributes , not as reasons for domination .
New values of cooperation and freedom might then show up in the relations of people , the upbringing of children .
To do all that , in the complex conditions of control in the United States , would require combining the energy of all previous movements in American history - of labor insurgents , black rebels , Native Americans , women , young people - along with the new energy of an angry middle class .
People would need to begin to transform their immediate environments - the workplace , the family , the school , the community - by a series of struggles against absentee authority , to give control of these places to the people who live and work there .
These struggles would involve all the tactics used at various times in the past by people 's movements : demonstrations , marches , civil disobedience ; strikes and boycotts and general strikes ; direct action to redistribute wealth , to reconstruct institutions , to revamp relationships ; creating - in music , literature , drama , all the arts , and all the areas of work and play in everyday life - a new culture of sharing , of respect , a new joy in the collaboration of people to help themselves and one another .
There would be many defeats .
But when such a movement took hold in hundreds of thousands of places all over the country it would be impossible to suppress , because the very guards the system depends on to crush such a movement would be among the rebels .
It would be a new kind of revolution , the only kind that could happen , I believe , in a country like the United States .
It would take enormous energy , sacrifice , commitment , patience .
But because it would be a process over time , starting without delay , there would be the immediate satisfactions that people have always found in the affectionate ties of groups striving together for a common goal .
All this takes us far from American history , into the realm of imagination .
But not totally removed from history .
There are at least glimpses in the past of such a possibility .
In the sixties and seventies , for the first time , the Establishment failed to produce national unity and patriotic fervor in a war .
There was a flood of cultural changes such as the country had never seen - in sex , family , personal relations - exactly those situations most difficult to control from the ordinary centers of power .
And never before was there such a general withdrawal of confidence from so many elements of the political and economic system .
In every period of history , people have found ways to help one another - even in the midst of a culture of competition and violence - if only for brief periods , to find joy in work , struggle , companionship , nature .
The prospect is for times of turmoil , struggle , but also inspiration .
There is a chance that such a movement could succeed in doing what the system itself has never done - bring about great change with little violence .
This is possible because the more of the 99 percent that begin to see themselves as sharing needs , the more the guards and the prisoners see their common interest , the more the Establishment becomes isolated , ineffectual .
The elite 's weapons , money , control of information would be useless in the face of a determined population .
The servants of the system would refuse to work to continue the old , deadly order , and would begin using their time , their space - the very things given them by the system to keep them quiet - to dismantle that system while creating a new one .
The prisoners of the system will continue to rebel , as before , in ways that cannot be foreseen , at times that can not be predicted .
The new fact of our era is the chance that they may be joined by the guards .
We readers and writers of books have been , for the most part , among the guards .
If we understand that , and act on it , not only will life be more satisfying , right off , but our grandchildren , or our great grandchildren , might possibly see a different and marvelous world .
Note to readers : I have a little more detail ( including an explanation for the spelling of “ BASSE ” ) up at Fermilab ’s Strange Letter – Interlude .
Well , now we ’re getting somewhere with the strange letter Fermilab received .
For context , Fermilab ( a theoretical physics laboratory ) recieved a strange letter in code a year ago that they ’ve now released to the public .
It can be seen here .
Ternary Paragraph
The first paragraph is made entirely of three different symbols , I , II , and III .
If we let I=1 , II=2 , and III=0 we have :
020 200 001 112 102 000 201 022 120 012 111 001 102 012 200 000 212 120 210 110 011 000 010 001 110 110 000 202 022 100 201 000 112 120 100 201 012
Note that this transcription assumes that the “ I ” at the end of line 6 and the “ II ” at the start of line 7 are in fact a single “ III ” .
Now let ’s assume that since there are 27 possible combinations in these ternany units , each corresponds to a letter of the alphabet ( 26 total ) or a space ( add 1 for 27 ) .
A naive mapping would be :
Combination Mapping 1 000 A 001 B 002 C 010 D 011 E 012 F 020 G 021 H 022 I 100 J 101 K 102 L 110 M 111 N 112 O 120 P 121 Q 122 R 200 S 201 T 202 U 210 V 211 W 212 X 220 Y 221 Z 222 ( space )
This gives :
G S B O L A T I P F N B L F S A X P V M E A D B M M A U I J T A O P J T F
“ GSBOLATIPFNBLFSAXPVMEADBMMAUIJTAOPJTF ” does n’t seem too helpful .
Perhaps a different map would be more appropriate ?
Let ’s vary the first naive mapping slightly .
Combination Mapping 1 Mapping 2 000 A ( space ) 001 B A 002 C B 010 D C 011 E D 012 F E 020 G F 021 H G 022 I H 100 J I 101 K J 102 L K 110 M L 111 N M 112 O N 120 P O 121 Q P 122 R Q 200 S R 201 T S 202 U T 210 V U 211 W V 212 X W 220 Y X 221 Z Y 222 ( space ) Z
This is a very simple mapping , we just set space to be 000 instead of 222 .
We get a very interesting result :
F R A N K S H O E M A K E R W O U L D C A L L T H I S N O I S E
“ FRANK SHOEMAKER WOULD CALL THIS NOISE ” .
Frank Shoemaker worked on the main ring of Fermilab .
It seems very unlikely to me that this is coincidence .
Binary Paragraph
Now if we look at the last paragraph , it ’s clearly different than the first in terms of notation .
Only I and II are used .
However , if we assume that “ II ” is a separator and “ I ” =1 “ I I ” =2 , and “ I I I ” =0 , we get the following :
012 111 121 110 120 221 012 012 000 112 210 111 002 012 200 000 002 001 201 201 012 000 201 100 220 202 012 012 112
Note that this transcription assumes an error .
At the end of line 2 and the beginning of line 3 there is a section “ I I I I I I I I ” that is assumed to mean 000 when it should read “ I I I II I I I II I I I ” .
If we use Mapping 2 to substitute in a manner like before we get the following :
E M P L O Y E E N U M B E R B A S S E S I X T E E N
“ EMPLOYEE NUMBER BASSE SIXTEEN ” – which clicks with the hexadecimal numbers and corresponding symbols in the middle !
Note that the mapping is simply the first “ naive ” mapping offset by one .
So lets assume the single “ word ” in the bottom middle of the page is an employee number .
If we decode it using the symbols , we get ( something ) FC. ( something ) is an undefined symbol , and the only undefined numbers are 1 and A .
So the “ employee number in base 16 ” that “ frank shoemaker would call noise ” is either 1 FC or AFC .
My guess ?
It ’s AFC ( employee number 2812 ) , who works on the AFC ( Absorber Focus Coil , a component of a “ neutrino factory ” current being studied at Fermilab ) – a coincidence Frank Shoemaker would call noise .
The employee number is reasonable and fits with the established pattern at Fermilab , see this Fermilab newsletter ( page 5 ) which states “ At 802 , with only three digits , Matthews ’ employee number reflects the length of his 25 - year tenure at the Lab ” .
The only thing left is rigorously figuring out the meaning of the hexadecimal section in my opinion .
What does everyone else think ?

Rescuers found balloons used by Fr Carli , but there was no sign of him Search crews in Brazil have found a bundle of balloons off the coast that were being used by a priest who went missing trying to set a flight record .
Father Adelir de Carli lifted off from the port city of Paranagua on Sunday strapped to 1,000 helium balloons .
Although equipped with flotation equipment , a satellite phone and GPS , contact was lost with him late on Sunday after he was blown off course .
He wanted to break a 19 - hour record for the most hours flying with balloons .
He was trying to raise funds to provide a rest stop for lorry drivers in Paranagua , a major port for agricultural products .
Rescue hopes Father Carli's bundle of brightly - coloured balloons was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean off Santa Catarina state , near the point where he last made contact with authorities on the ground .
Rescue officials were holding out hopes he would still be found alive .

He was wearing a helmet , parachute , thermal flight suit , waterproof coveralls and a buoyant chair .
He is also an experienced skydiver .
" Given his physical condition and the equipment he was carrying , I would say there is 80 % chance that he is still alive , " said Johnny Coelho , chief of the Penha Fire Department .
Father Carli , a Roman Catholic priest , was carrying enough food and water for five days and there was a chance he was still drifting in the ocean or had been washed ashore on a remote section of the coast , said Mr Coelho .
' Losing height '
In a phone interview with Brazilian TV channel Globo on Sunday , he said he was having difficulty operating his GPS device , and was " very cold , but fine " .
He was said to have reached an altitude of 20,000 ft ( 6,000 m ) , then descended to about 8,200 ft for his planned flight to the city of Dourados .
But he was blown off course by winds and when last contacted was floating several miles off the coast .
Before losing contact , he said he had to land in the sea as he was " losing height " .
In January , the priest used the same mode of transport to fly over 110 km ( 70 miles ) in four hours between Parana and the nearby Argentine city of San Antonio .

JERUSALEM 
A mathematical mystery that has baffled the top minds in the esoteric field of symbolic dynamics for nearly four decades has recently been cracked — by a 63 - year - old former security guard .
Avraham Trakhtman , a mathematician who worked as a laborer after immigrating to Israel from Russia , has succeeded where dozens have failed , solving the elusive " Road Coloring Problem . "
The conjecture essentially assumes that it is possible to create a " universal map " that would direct people to arrive at a certain destination , at the same time , regardless of their original location .
Experts say this proposition , which seems to defy logic , could actually have real - life applications in the fields of mapping and computer science .
" In math circles , we talk about beautiful results — this is beautiful and it is unexpected .
Even in layman 's terms it is completely counterintuitive , but somehow it works , " said Stuart Margolis , a colleague who recruited Trakhtman to Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv .
He said the discovery was especially remarkable given Trakhtman 's age and background .
" The first time I met him he was wearing a night watchman 's uniform , " he said .
The " Road Coloring Problem " was first posed in 1970 by Benjamin Weiss , an Israeli - American mathematician , and a colleague , Roy Adler , who worked at IBM at the time .
Weiss said he believed that given a finite number of roads , one should be able to draw up a map , coded in various colors , that would lead to a certain destination regardless of the point of origin .
For eight years , he tried to prove his theory .
Over the next 30 years , some 100 other scientists attempted to as well .
All failed , until Trakhtman came along and , in eight short pages , jotted the solution down in pencil last year .
Trakhtman said it took him a year to solve the problem .
But that was n't nearly as impressive as the journey he took to get to his current lofty position .
Originally from Yekaterinburg , Russia , Trakhtman was already an accomplished mathematician before he came to Israel in 1992 , at the age of 48 .
But like many immigrants in the wave that followed the breakup of the former Soviet Union , he too struggled to find work in the Jewish state and was forced into stints working maintenance and security before landing a teaching position at Bar Ilan in 1995 .
The soft - spoken Trakhtman declined to discuss his arduous odyssey , saying those were the " old days . "
He said he was " lucky " to be recognized , but played down his recent achievement as a " matter for mathematicians " and said it has n't changed him a bit .
" The solution is not that complicated .
It 's hard , but it is not that complicated , " he said in heavily accented Hebrew .
" Some people think they need to be complicated .
I think they need to be nice and simple . "
Trakhtman 's solution is available for viewing on the Internet and will soon be published in the Israel Journal of Mathematics .
SOLUTION : ' The road coloring problem '
Weiss said it gave him great joy to see someone solve his problem , adding that Trakhtman 's solution " is something that is understandable . "
Joel Friedman , a math professor at the University of British Columbia , said probably everyone in the field of symbolic dynamics has tried to solve the Roadmap Coloring Problem at some point , including himself .
He said people in the related disciplines of graph theory , discrete math and theoretical computer science have also tried .
" The solution to this problem has definitely generated excitement in the mathematical community , " he said in an e-mail message .
Trakhtman 's achievement is hardly the longest open problem to be solved recently .
In 1994 , British mathematician Andrew Wiles solved Fermat 's last theorem , which had been open for more than 300 years .
Margolis , Trakhtman 's colleague at Bar Ilan , said the solution could have many applications .
" Say you 've lost an e-mail and you want to get it back — it would be guaranteed , " he said .
" Let 's say you are lost in a town you have never been in before and you have to get to a friend 's house and there are no street signs — the directions will work no matter what . "
But even more exciting , he said , was Trakhtman 's personal history and advanced age , at least in the math world .
" The heartwarming part of it is here is a guy who had a good reputation for his work in the Soviet Union and could n't get work , " he said .
" Math is usually a younger person 's game , like music and the arts , " he said .
" Usually you do your better work in your mid 20's and early 30's .
He certainly came up with a good one at age 63 , " he said .

AMSTETTEN , Austria ( CNN ) --
Three children freed from a cellar in which their mother had been imprisoned and raped by her own father for 24 years had never seen daylight , police in Austria have confirmed .
A hidden , narrow bedroom found in the cellar of the house where Josef Fritzl held his daughter captive .
more photos »
Police spokesman Franz Polzer told CNN that 73 - year - old Josef Fritzl admitted holding his daughter , Elisabeth Fritzl , 42 , hostage in the windowless cell and fathering seven children by her .
" The mother had memories [ of the outside world ] and got used to the situation , " Polzer told a press conference Monday afternoon .
" The others knew nothing else . "
The main question reverberating from the small Austrian town :
How could a man keep his daughter locked in his basement for 24 years , where she gave birth to seven of his children while her mother and three of those children lived upstairs without an inkling of the horrors in the cellar ?
Fritzl explained Elisabeth 's disappearance by saying she had run away from home , a story backed up by letters he forced Elisabeth to write , including one that begged her parents not to look for her .
Other letters made it seem the missing daughter had left the three children on the parents ' doorstep -- when in fact they had been born in captivity in the family 's basement .
Elisabeth told police that she and her three children Kerstin , 19 ; Stefan , 18 ; and Felix , 5 , did not see the light of day during their entire time in captivity underneath the building in Amstetten , a rural town about 150 km ( 93 miles ) west of Vienna .
Do n't Miss Austria wakes up to ' house of horror '
Austria wakes up to ' house of horror '
Images emerge from ' house of horror '
Elisabeth is described as " very disturbed " and having trouble talking to police about her ordeal , reports CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen .
She went missing in 1984 , when she was 18 years old , police have said .
More details also emerged at the news conference about the basement dungeon in which the daughter and her children were kept -- and how her father managed to keep them captive for more than two decades .
See inside the cellar prison »
The authorities have revealed that the prison , constructed in the basement of the 1960s building , ran underneath both the building itself and the garden outside .
The entrance was via a small door , hidden behind cupboards in the basement , controlled by an electronic keyless - entry system .
Polzer said that the prison was hard to find , even if someone was looking for it , and had been soundproofed .
" Even though they shouted and called they were not in a position to let anyone hear them , " Polzer told the press conference .
Polzer said that Fritzl made clear to his wife and other children that the area was out of bounds and they were not to go into the basement .
He bought food and took it to his captives in the evening .
Watch a report on details of the case »
Detectives made the grim discovery about the cellar earlier this month after Kerstin was hospitalized in Amstetten after falling unconscious and taken to a hospital in Amstetten by her grandfather with a SOS note from her mother hidden on her .
A DNA test was later carried out which revealed her grandfather , Josef Fritzl , was also her father , according to ORF , Austria 's state - run news agency .
That sparked a police investigation , which revealed that Fritzl fathered at least six children with his daughter , forcing her and three of the surviving children to live in the cellar of his house , according to ORF 's Peter Schmitzberger .
Watch police describe the captives ' jail »
On Sunday , police searched the hidden rooms where Fritzl admitted he kept his daughter and their children , including sleeping quarters , a kitchen and a bathroom , which Fritzl told police he built , Polzer said .
Amstetten police say they were put on Fritzl 's trail following an anonymous tip off .
They apprehended the pair on Saturday near the hospital and once police assured the daughter that she would never have contact with her father again , " she was able to tell the whole story , " Schmitzberger said .
Elisabeth said her father began sexually abusing her at age 11 .
On August 8 , 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement , where he drugged her , put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room , she told police .
For the next 24 years , she was constantly raped by her father , resulting in the six surviving children , she said , according to the police statement .
She also told police she gave birth to twins in 1996 , but one of the babies died a few days later as a result of neglect , and Fritzl removed the infant 's body and burned it in an oven .
She told police that only her father supplied her and her children with food and clothing , and that she did not think his wife knew anything about their situation
Fritzl lived upstairs with his wife , Rosemarie , who police said had no idea about her husband 's other family living in the cellar .
The couple adopted three of the children that Fritzl had with his daughter , according to police .
He told his wife that his missing daughter had dropped the unwanted children off at the house because she could not take care of them , police said .
When Kerstin fell ill , Fritzl apparently told his wife and the hospital that his " missing " daughter had dropped off the sick girl on his doorstep .
In an effort to find out about Kerstin 's condition , the hospital and police asked the media to put out a bulletin requesting any information about the girl or her missing mother , attorney general Gerhard Sedlacek told NTV .
Sometime later , Fritzl brought Elisabeth out of the cellar , telling his wife that she had returned home with her two children after a 24 - year absence , police said .
He took Elisabeth to the hospital to talk with doctors about Kerstin 's condition , and at that point , authorities became aware of her situation , Sedlacek said .

The $ 1 salary - it sounds so noble , does n't it ?
In recent years , more and more executives at big tech companies have opted for a salary of mere pennies , choosing instead to base their pay on the performance of the company 's stock - in other words , on the company itself .
Executives who opt for the $ 1 salary include Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang , Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and its CEO Eric Schmidt .
One of the most recognizable examples is Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs .
Former Yahoo CEO
Terry Semel did it in 2007 , but this was after raking in $ 56.8 million in 2006 .
He was publicized as being the highest compensated executive in Silicon Valley .
Executives outside Silicon Valley do it as well , at companies such as Capital One Financial and Pixar Studios .
Is it truly altruistic for top executives to volunteer for all but nonexistent salaries in a day and age when the compensation packages of many of their cohorts exceed the gross domestic product of some developing nations ?
As it turns out , the practice is a lot less unselfish than it sounds .
Nick Denton , publisher of Gawker Media wrote about these one dollar salaries with deep disdain on the tech gossip blog Valleywag last April .
" The token salary looks good in the press briefing ; even if the rest of the package is obscene , it 's too complex for reporters to arrive at a shocking headline figure , " said Denton , who faulted business reporters with spinning these stories without looking at total compensation packages including pensions , perks and stock options .
The total pay packages of these executives painted a different picture , in which these CEOs with " dollar menu " salaries tended to be the highest paid .
When stock options were taken into consideration , Page made $ 1.5 billion in 2005 by exercising stock options , Brin made $ 1.45 billion ( the two were tied as the fifth richest Americans in Forbes ' 2007 list ) and Schmidt made $ 557,466 in 2006 .
Jobs gained $ 14.6 million on paper by exercising stock options that were about to expire , according to the SEC .
Semel made approximately $ 70 million in 2006 .
None of these figures include the value of all the perks that come with being the top dog-planes , automobiles and more .
Denton argued one reason it would behoove Valley executives to be less boastful about their self - sacrificing salaries was that many see them as a tax dodge .
" Stock option gains are taxed , typically , as capital gains ; the federal tax rate on that is 15 percent .
If that same value was paid as orthodox salary , it would be taxed at 35 percent at the margin ...
It is a reminder that the stock - option - rich executive class is taxed at about half the rate of the wage slaves , " wrote Denton .
Not all observers , however , have such negative reactions to the $ 1 executive salary .
Some argue that it sends a message to employees and stockholders that being CEO is more than just a job to these people .
" I think you 'll see that in almost all cases where this is exercised that you 'll find people like the Google guys who are fundamental evangelists and absolutely proud of and committed to their firms .
It may seem gimmicky , [ but ] this committed leadership makes their firms special , " said Murray Beach , managing director with TM Capital , a tech - focused investment bank in Boston .
Nintendo World Championships
Gold -- ever heard of it ?
Video game collecting is really interesting -- there are numerous rare and uncommon games out in the wild that many people have n't heard of , but some collectors get all crazy about .
One of these games that gets the hardcore collectors excited is up for sale right now on eBay .
The starting bid : $ 15,000 .
The game is Nintendo World Championships Gold .
This was a limited - edition game that Nintendo put out for the NES in 1990 .
It was made around the time of the movie The Wizard , which stared Fred Savage , and promoted the release of Super Mario Bros .
3 . Nintendo had a contest where you had 6 some - odd minutes to get a bunch of points in a couple of games , in this big competition , held by Nintendo Power magazine .
90 grey edition Nintendo World Championship games were made ; and only 26 of the gold edition Nintendo World Championship versions were given out to winners of the contest , making this cartridge one of the most sought after games around .
Only 12 of these gold edition games are known about .
Somewhere out there -- if they have n't been destroyed , that is -- are the other 14 ; so if you see one selling at garage sale for really cheap , please buy it and send to me care of Neoseeker.com .
$ 15,000 is actually the going rate for this game -- this seems like a reasonable price for it .
One was sold last year for around $ 20,000 on myebid , by a father who was selling possession owned by his late son , who perished in the Iraq war .
Who knows -- $ 15,000 might turn out to be a great deal .
You never know with collecting .
Game collecting might go the way of comic collecting , and the rarest titles might see their value someday skyrocket .
This game could be the ' new ' Superman # 1 .
But if you are a collector , as always , you should be on the look - out for fakes , which turn up from time to time .
If you are interested in rare games , I recommend the excellent Rare Video Games blog , which tracks this topic quite well .
HTTP
Sessions allow us to develop web applications as if they were running on a desktop machine , making the web so much more useful .
Although HTTP is a stateless protocol and there is a lot of work involved in providing this abstraction , web servers make it very easy to use — perhaps too easy .
Taking a quote from Spiderman , with great power comes great responsibility .
That is why misusing HTTP sessions is probably the number one obstacle to building scalable web sites today .
Here are some tips how to consume HTTP sessions responsibly .
Turn off the session if you do n't need it
Session support is often turned on by default for the whole web site , so that it is available to any web page that might need it .
This significantly reduces web site performance under heavy load .
For start , session access requires synchronisation , and synchronisation inhibits concurrency .
If the session is kept locally in web server memory , then you have to pin down all the requests from the session to the same server .
Most web servers will execute requests coming from the same session in sequence .
Turning the session off when it is not required ( or even better , turning it on only for the pages that really need it ) , will allow web servers to process more requests in parallel and with less synchronisation .
It will also allow you to balance requests that do not require a session across multiple servers easier , and improve the processing time .
Each session request incurs some processing overhead to restore session values .
Depending on the way that session information is kept , this may mean disk IO or even network access to the database .
On a single request , that overhead is insignificant , but when several thousand users access the site at the same time , the overhead can be quite visible .
Sharing the session across web servers brings a promise of balancing users easier and allowing them to continue to work even if the server that handled their session goes down .
Although it is now incredibly easy to set up a shared session storage on a web server farm , that is not a decision that should be taken lightly .
Shared sessions require even more synchronisation .
Even worse , that synchronisation is over the network instead of just being in - memory .
In most cases , if only the minimal security information is kept in the session , the worst thing that can happen if a server dies is asking the users to log in again .
From a financial and performance perspective , that often makes more sense than sharing user sessions across servers .
Consider using cookies as an alternative to store simple information that is not security - sensitive .
That is not going to save you a lot of memory , but it will allow you to turn off the session for more pages , while still serving user - specific information .
Web sites like Amazon or Linked In store the user ID in an ( encrypted ) cookie and use that to display site content without requiring you to log on and probably without a session on their end ( although I have no access to their code so this might not be correct , it would make perfect sense ) .
Until you add stuff to the shopping cart or want to save updated account information , there is no need for the session to start .
With Web 2.0 and AJAX becoming increasingly popular , we can take this approach even further and limit the session only to AJAX requests that really need it , and have the session turned off for most of the web site .
Encapsulate session access
Most web servers today allow us to use the session as sort of a hash - map , dumping anything we like into it and associating it with a string key .
Session hash - maps are universally accessible , do not provide any compile time checking or type - safety , so they suffer from the same kind of problems that caused global variables to be frowned upon .
Uncontrolled use of session maps is very error prone , and the errors related to this are typically painfully hard to troubleshoot .
Using session hash maps effectively requires an agreement on what will be assigned to which key and calls for a lot of discipline , especially with larger teams .
One bad example I can remember instantly is an application that stored different types of objects under the same key name depending on the context .
One part of the site expected that session [ ' user ' ] is the user ’s id , another part expected it to be the whole user object .
They were developed by different people , who unintentionally used the same key .
Of course , this caused a lot of weird type checking errors and people being suddenly “ logged out ” , but the problem became obvious only in production .
This kind of “ free for all ” access to session details can cause huge consistency problems .
The session was used to keep track of the current user and the account balance of that user in an application that I had to fix a few years ago .
The balance was loaded from the database on - demand , if the hash - map did not have an object with the “ balance ” key when it was required .
When a user logged off , only the “ user ” key was cleared , which left the “ balance ” key in place .
This caused a lot of weird errors during testing ( when people were often logging in and out under different usernames ) .
Luckily , a web server would isolate the sessions for real users normally , but I can imagine that this problem would affect people accessing the site from public computers , such as in libraries or internet cafés .
To avoid this problem , I suggest always encapsulating access to session objects with a class that has a strictly defined interface and provides a degree of type safety and control over what gets stored and how .
Do not use the session object directly , use a proxy for that .
In a MVC environment , this approach also allows you to decouple controller code from the web servers .
You can use a test implementation of the session class that does not depend on HTTP contexts for unit testing the controllers from your IDE .
Store only non-volatile data in the session
Storing several related objects in the session can cause consistency problems — like in the example with the accounts , but even during a single session .
If personal details are stored in the session along with the user ’s ID and the user updates his e-mail address , then we have to remember to re-load the details stored in the session object as well .
Whenever people complain about stale data , inconsistent session usage is probably to blame .
This gets even worse if the data can be modified outside the web application — for example if the customer ’s account balance gets reduced because they played a game in another window or because their order was processed in the back - end .
In general , I consider that there are only two types of information that belong in a web server session :
security sensitive identifiers :
The ID of the user currently logged in is a good example , since the user should not be able to specify it directly within a request .
Even for this , there are exceptions — I 'll talk about that later .
intermediate results — non-persistent data that is not yet complete and it is completely internal to the web application workflow .
Shopping cart contents are a good example .
Until a shopping cart is converted into an order and persisted , the shopping cart contents are not observable or accessible by anything outside the current users session .
Use proper caching for mutable data
HTTP sessions are often used to store frequently accessed user - specific information , but that is wrong .
It is error - prone from the consistency perspective , but it also significantly inhibits scalability .
Session state is kept on the server , and although a single record set might not take up a lot of memory , multiply that with several tens of thousands of users and things quickly get out of hand .
Because of the way that HTTP works , it is not easy to guess whether someone stopped using the site or whether they are just reading a really long page or popped out for a coffee .
Session memory is typically kept for a period of time before being discarded , often ten to thirty minutes , even if the users close their browsers .
So all the cached information keeps taking up memory for quite a while .
Strictly speaking , session and cache memory should have a different life - cycle anyway .
Cached objects are typically loaded on demand , and we should be able to throw them out of at any point if we need to release space .
We do not have that flexibility with session objects — the web server has to rely on the programmers to explicitly kill objects that are no longer required while the session is still alive .
Session memory is typically controlled by the web server and we have no direct impact on it .
So storing a lot of objects in the session temporarily , even if we do release it after , can cause an effect very similar to memory leaks .
I remember an application that loaded whole record sets into the session space for a short period of time , and although they were quickly released , IIS was running out of memory every few days .
Under heavy load , it could happen a few times a day , sometimes even during busy trading hours , which was a big problem .
From the programmer ’s perspective , the code was correct in a sense that session objects were deleted , but memory was still leaking .
It turned out that OLE strings caused a huge fragmentation of IIS memory , so the server was always trying to allocate more and more continuous blocks and could not fit the record sets in the space that was released .
Although automatic memory management has improved a lot over the last five or six years , it can still cause headaches and it ’s best to keep the sessions thin .
The less information you have in the session for each user , the more users a single web server will be able to handle .
I strongly suggest using a proper caching mechanism instead of session objects for on - demand caching and optimising access to frequently required information .
This caching memory can be released at any time , does not have to persist and does not have to be synchronised across requests .
If the cached information is not user specific , we can get even better cache performance by re-using the cache across all sessions .
Splitting the data streams into generic and user - specific helps us improve web site scalability and performance significantly .

A record number of people are drinking themselves to death , according to latest figures showing Britain is on a dangerous alcohol binge .
Cheap beer , wine and spirits and a binge - drinking culture are taking an increasing toll as both sexes succumb to the harmful effects of alcohol .
A report from the Office for National Statistics published yesterday shows that 8,758 people died from excessive alcohol intake in 2006 , twice the number in 1991 .
Death rates rose in all age groups but the biggest increase for both sexes was among people aged 35 to 54 , a legacy of heavy drinking in their 20s and early 30s .
Death rates for women in this age group doubled from 7.2 to 14.8 per 100,000 , a larger increase than for women in any other age group .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , said the increase in women 's drinking was causing serious concern .
" The new figures are deeply worrying as women seem to be more susceptible to the damaging physical effects of alcohol .
This may be due to their smaller size and different fat distribution , but there are almost certainly other factors at play , possibly genetic and biochemical differences .
My colleagues and I are seeing more women with serious liver damage than ever before in our clinics .
Liver disease is often symptomless until it becomes very serious and so people often have no warning that they are destroying their liver until it is too late . "
Despite the rise in female drinking , the death rate among men is twice that for women and the gap between the sexes is widening .
Among men aged 35 to 54 , the death rate has more than doubled since 1991 from 13.4 to 31.1 per 100,000 .
The official figures do not include road accidents or other injuries in which alcohol may have played a part , so the true total of alcohol - linked deaths is higher .
Ministers are under pressure to withdraw 24 - hour licences for pubs and clubs , introduced to help curb binge drinking by ending the 11 pm closing time rush , despite the lack of evidence that the change has increased drinking .
But ministers have resisted demands for price rises , which are known to curb consumption .
An alliance of medical organisations , including the Royal College of Physicians , has called for an increase in the tax on alcohol and curbs on supermarkets offering big discounts .
The NHS Information Centre reported last year that alcohol was 65 per cent more affordable than in 1980 and accounted for only 5.2 per cent of household spending compared with 7.5 per cent in 1980 .
More than one in five men and almost one in 10 women binge - drink every week , consuming in a single session more than eight units of alcohol for men or six units for women .
There ’s a suspicion on the part of many Dems that Karl Rove ’s influence is felt in almost every move made by the Republican Party and its national candidates .
The concerns are generally unfounded .
But once in a while , Rove really might be pulling certain strings behind the scenes .
For example , Marc Ambinder noted the other day that John McCain ’s “ bio tour ” and Rove ’s advice for McCain seem to coincide quite nicely .
Rove was asked in mid-February during a Q&A at the University of Pennsylvania what he would advise McCain to do .
Rove said :
“ [ McCain ] needs to seize the opportunity to reintroduce himself ....
He should take a biographical tour to the places in the country that have made him who he is .
Go to the Naval Academy and talk about the values he learned there .
Then he should go to Pensacola , Florida and Corpus Christi , Texas where he was trained as a naval aviator , and talk from the heart and the call to service .
Go to Meridian , Mississippi and Jacksonville , Florida and talk about what he learned about leadership commanding the largest naval air squadron in the United States .
He should go to wherever it was that he first stepped foot back in the United States after the Vietnam War and meet with his POW buddies and talk about what he learned about character when he sat in that cell in hell .
And he should give a speech in Sedona , Arizona and talk about the people and places in his hometown that affected him . ”
And what did McCain spend last week doing ?
Well , let ’s see , McCain made appearances in Meridian , Pensacola , the Naval Academy , and Prescot , Arizona ( which is near Sedona ) , all as part of a “ biographical tour to the places in the country that have made him who he is . ”
We already knew that Rove has at least some role in advising McCain , but this does raise an ethical issue :
Rove has put on his " journalist " hat to praise a strategy he appears to have come up with , without disclosing his role with the campaign .
Insert joke here about the need for a bloggers ethics panel .
Recycling 2.0 : Beyond Cans and Bottles Learn about all the various things few people knew can be recycled .
April 22 , 2008  --
Tossing plastic bottles , aluminum cans and newspapers into the recycling bin is a great way to help out the planet .
But why stop there ?
There are many discarded household items that are better off kept out of landfills .
Jerry Powell , editor of Resource Recycling Journal , points out that recycling technologies have come a long way , making it possible for products that have been traditionally regarded as trash , like consumer electronics , more recyclable now .
But technological progress alone does n't cut it .
Businesses and organizations are instrumental in helping spread awareness so that people can take advantage of such new recycling opportunities .
" We all know that bottles , aluminum cans and paper can be recycled , " said Powell .
" But at many retail stores you 'll even find bins out in front where they 'll recycle plastic bags . "
Still , there are many things besides the usual suspects that can be recycled .
Here 's a list of a few items that tend to get overlooked when people look to clean house .
Clothes
It 's not just old shirts and jeans that can be dropped off at thrift stores and donation centers like Goodwill ( www.goodwill.org) and the Salvation Army ( www.salvationarmyusa.org).
Clothes that are ragged , torn and unwearable are usually shipped to " rag sorters , " textile recyclers that specialize in breaking down fabric into raw materials such as cotton and wool .
Really worn - out clothes are taken to fiber converters where they are turned into mattress filler and pillow stuffing .
Hearing Aids
Recycling provides an opportunity to give the gift of hearing to those less fortunate .
Hearing aids no longer needed or wanted can be donated to charity organizations such as Hear Now ( www.sotheworldmayhear.org) and Help the Children Hear ( www.helpthechildrenhear.org), a service run by the Rotary Club .
Eyeglasses
For those who wear glasses , a new prescription does n't mean that the old pair is useless .
Many retailers and large chains such as Lens Crafters and Pearl Vision work with charity programs that distribute used glasses to people in developing nations who cannot afford them .

While those tiny pills do n't take up much space , they have recently caused some big concerns .
A recent investigation by The Associated Press detected drugs in the drinking water of 24 major metropolitan areas .
Drug recycling offers an alternative to hazardous disposal of drugs .
States such as Oklahoma , Wyoming and Louisiana have already allowed organizations to run drug recycling programs .
Participants can drop off drugs at a pharmacy or send them to a facility that ensures inspection before redistributing them to needy patients .
Cell Phones
The barrage of new mobile phones makes finding a good reason to get rid of an old cell phone pretty easy .
Retailers often give customers the option of bringing their old phones to stores where they are either recycled or refurbished for sale .
If the retailer does n't offer to take back cell phones , green programs like CollectiveGood ( www.collectivegood.com) can take them off your hands .
Paint
The process by which paint is recycled is a fairly colorful one .
The paint is separated into color groups and then blended or mixed to create the more popular colors that can be packaged and resold .
Cities such as San Francisco , Portland and Knoxville have initiated paint recycling programs with much success .

And why does n't the interviewer ever appear on the screen ?
Who is this shill ?
He sounds and acts like a snipper surprised he can't hit his mark .
Too bad this happens so seldom .. or is left on the edit room floor .
It is not very often that we find a person this skilled , sure footed and knowledgeable who can keep turning back the accusations and false statements of the hit man .

Wow that was awsome , that fox reporter got smoked like a trout !
I dont think they 'll be playing that interview .
If they do it 'll be all chopped up and of course out of context .
It takes a special person to be able to hold their ground in an interview like that .
These people deliver their questions and statements like a machine gun and its so hard to follow because its 90 % bullshit !
So your standing their reeling trying to replay their comments in your head to make sense of it and if you pause to long youve lost .
Hats off to the reverend .

The idiot interviewer was trying to trap this preacher , and the preacher was relentlessly counter - trapping him !
I do n't think this guy with the microphone was ever put in his place like this , that 's why it kept going on .
He thought at some point , he'd get his " soundbite " from the preacher !
It never happened , and the preacher made a fool out of this guy , and exposed him as a sensationalist trying to trap him into some soundbite !

You have to know that Fox sends out the newer , more inexperienced guys because of something like this interview .
They think of their lower echelon the way our government thinks of our troops .
They 're expendable .
Fox sucks so hard , but the scary part is the part of America that listens to this shit for their news , and ingests the predigested crap that they send out there .
We have a hometown paper , and the online comments are unbelievable .
And this is their base .

Well , that little videoclip will never be put on Fox in its entirety .
I can only imagine how it will ultimately get cut and spliced to maximize words like " racist , " " bigot , " and America - hater . "
I have to say that I was n't so much interested in what the interviewee had to say , because it was just very well articulated truth , but in what the Fox interviewer had to say .
He could not just interview the guy .
All he could do was try to get his interviewee to get drawn into his " hates America " " racist " " bigot " talking points .
What a pathetic example of a " journalist . "

Speaking of killer video ... in every killing circumstance one person experiences THE END .
Today I sent out another one of those messages :
greetings , A while back I sent you all a message about a man I lived with in hollywood , just down the street from bradblog .
I know you do n't know what bradblog is , but that does not matter at the moment .
At that time John Barrymore , whom I lived with in hollywood , for what seemed an eternity , had passed on .
I found him to be a man who dealt with great energies well .
He fought the dark side .
Now another person I knew has passed on .
Danny Federici who was the keyboardist for a rocker I hung with , Bruce Springsteen .
Danny was a city guy , not an earthy dude .
He was always pissed or uptight in those days with we folk who rode waves , loved rock , and drank wine , and drank wine , and drank wine .
Even if it was pope my ride italian wine o .
Yet he could do some damn good keyboard .
But Danny you were too uptight those days .
I was from keyboard heaven , near bradblog HQ where THE DOORS laid down some keyboard !
Nevermind .
New Jersey is just another teeshirt with some rhetoric on it .
I love you all .
So Danny , I hope we all see each other on a more decent ' planet ' next time , if there is one .
I am playing THE END by the doors .
For you Danny .
later ,

And just as I promised HERE IS THE END .

I cannot watch Bill O'Reilly without feeling acutely ill .
The way he gave the woman 30 seconds to make her point and then talked over her and attempted to trivialize what she said --- and I did n't have my stopwatch out , but I bet it was before her precious 30 seconds was up --- he was so insulting to her .
I presume that 's generally what he does .

The Deacon was wrong on one point .
He said " When white people criticize America , they are critical .
When black people criticize America , they are haters of America . "
Seems to me that for the last seven years that if anyone other than a neocon criticizes America , they hate America - according to O'Reilly and the other Fox trash .
Bill O'Reilly : " America is a noble country .
Do you agree that America is a noble country ? "
First please answer what is noble about the biggest superpower in the world smashing a little country , which has been denied control of their own airspace and had the army and air force annihilated , into the stone age ?
What is noble about killing hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis ?
What is nobel about killin more than 4,000 Americans and permanently disabling 30,000 more ?
What is noble about spending the country so far in debt they may never recover ?
What is noble about causing more and more Americans to drop into the poverty level where more and more are now on food stamps .
What is noble about trashing the Constitution ?
I could go on and on .... I think you get the message .

Father Pfleger 's response should be required viewing for anyone standing up to the right - wing smear machine , but there is also a profoundly disturbing aspect to this , particularly in cases where the Fox News 's prey is n't quite as plucky and fearless as Father Pfleger .
Fox News has been regularly crossing this line for the last couple of years where , under the guise of news coverage , they are ambushing and attempting to intimidate those with whom they politically disagree .
Right - wing einstein's may respond , " 60 MINUTES , 60 MINUTES ! " , but their confrontations usually involve some sort of suspected lawbreaking or other forms of public malfeasance on the part of the confronted .
They are trying to gather more information from or obtain the viewpoint of the subject , not trying to intimidate and harass them , score political points , or get in political pissing matches like this Fox representative ( not journalist or reporter ) was attempting to do .
It is easy to see how such tactics would be quite intimidating to ordinary citizens caught up in the news .
This is nothing less than abject abuse of media power for political purposes , and , if we had a FCC that was worth squat , should be stopped .

I was so happy to hear Father Pfleger 's comments and his relentless denunciation of the right wing talking points of the FOX " reporter " .
It 's time that we all stand up to this nonsense ( incl the crap questions that Gibson and Stephanridiculous spewed forth at this week 's debate ) and let these people know that we 're mad as hell and not going to take it anymore .
The media and others treat us as if we 're idiots .
I wrote an op - ed defending Rev. Wright that was published in my town 's paper this week , giving out some facts about Wright 's life and service to his country and community thru his military service and church .
Have gotten several positive responses from people I know , incl some I would have never guessed would be in support .
Hearing Father Pfleger 's comments makes me even more sure I was on the right track with my op - ed .
I 'm sending a letter of support to Father Pfleger .

My Catholicism is deeply lapsed , but I swear I felt it stirring there for a second .
While I 'm sure that I would not have tossed Farrakhan 's name in there as an example of a " man of God " , it was delightful to see Pfleger refuse to take any crap from the slimy little Fox reporter .
As for the priest 's remark that " they " decided Martin Luther King had to die , he did n't say who " they " are , but it 's documented in FBI files that J. Edgar Hoover 's policy was to withhold from King any warnings of death threats or activities against him .
Hoover preferred to look the other way and let King fend for himself .
( In fact , Hoover preferred to harass King with wiretapping and threats of blackmail . )
Pfleger is hardly off the mark .

He 's not off the mark about Farrakhan either .
It only takes listening to him in context , just like with Wright , just like with Pfleger , to know the truth .
Farrakhan , for however impolitic , has been greatly maligned .
Most people just hear his name and think the worst .
He 's NOT anti-Semitic , for example , and if you listen to the speech he gave at Rosa Parks ' memorial service , you will probably agree .
I think it 's on his website .

Fox News is the perfect example for why we need have the fairness doctrine re-instituted and why we need to reverse the FCC rulings allowing so many stations to belong to one group , company or person ( Rupert Murdoch ) .
And why we need to have real ethics in journalism again .

If you watch the whole video the priest invited Reverend Wright not Farrakan .

This is typical of the Fox way of doing things .

While I do not share the beliefs of the monotheistic religions that most faithfully support in this country , the US corporate mass media propaganda machine mainly serves their 1 % er master 's interests .
Father Pfleger repeatedly exposed
Fox 's lead douchebag with a microphone simply by pointing out that it is the reporter 's opinion that is both sensationalist and inaccurate .

There ’s no place for squeamishness when  even without complicated and difficult disasters like Myanmar ’s  diarrhea trails only pneumonia as the biggest killer of small children in the world , greater than tuberculosis , AIDS or malaria , in numbers equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every hour .
Humanitarian aid agencies use the shorthand “ watsan ” to stand for “ water and sanitation . ”
There ’s a reason those two words are n’t in alphabetical order , and it ’s not poetry .
When it comes to prioritizing aid , water has always received the lion ’s share of attention and money .
Eddy Perez , a sanitation expert at the World Bank ’s Water and Sanitation Program , often shows an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito from the film “ Twins . ”
One represents water and the other sanitation , and he does n’t have to spell out which is which .
Most developing countries spend less than 0.5 percent of their gross domestic product on watsan , and only 12 percent to 15 percent of that in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa goes to sanitation , according to the 2006 United Nations Human Development Report .
Celebrities like Matt Damon and Jay - Z line up to talk about water .
Shiny taps and clean water make good pictures .
I ’ve never seen a movie star pictured in front of a new latrine , though it can double its user ’s life span .
Of course food and water are crucial .
But feces can undermine both .
If people are eating fecal particles , no amount of high - energy biscuits will make them well .
In poor countries , diarrhea is the reason you find malnourished children in well - fed families .
It ’s why millions of girls drop out of school , and why millions of dollars ’ worth of productivity is lost from workers sick with this week ’s bout of dysentery .

Who watched as flight plan was aborted ?
BY JOSEPH TANFANI AND ALFONSO CHARDY
jtanfani@herald.com
Forty - five minutes .
That 's how long American Airlines Flight 77 meandered through the air headed for the White House , its flight plan abandoned , its radar beacon silent .
Originally bound for Los Angeles from Washington , it got as far as the Ohio border before terrorists disabled the aircraft 's transponder , a piece of equipment that sends a signal back to control centers .
It was about 9 a .m .
At that moment , the north tower of the World Trade Center was already in flames .
Minutes later , a second airliner would crash into the south tower , providing unmistakable evidence that the United States was under terrorist attack .
Meanwhile Flight 77 was turning around , streaking back east over Virginia toward the White House and finally slamming into the Pentagon at 9:45 a.m .
Who was watching in those 45 minutes ?
`` That 's a question that more and more people are going to ask , '' said one controller in Miami .
`` What the hell went on here ?
Was anyone doing anything about it ?
Just as a national defense thing , how are they able to fly around and no one go after them ? ''
Even with the transponder silent , the plane should have been visible on radar , both to controllers who handle cross-continent air traffic and to a Federal Aviation Administration command center outside of Washington , according to air traffic controllers .
The FAA , which handles air traffic control , would not discuss the track of Flight 77 or what happened in air - control centers while it was in flight .
Neither would American Airlines .
CONTROLLERS ' VIEW
On Thursday , FBI agents were trying to answer those questions , interviewing controllers at the regional Air Route Traffic Control Center in Leesburg , Va. Flight 77 took off at 8:10 a.m. from Dulles International Airport , and proceeded normally until it got to about the Ohio border , according to Flight Explorer , a company that tracks air traffic for private clients .
The transponder went off about 9 a.m. , the company said .
At that moment , the flight would have been under the control of the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center , one of 20 regional centers that track flights between airports .
The trouble should have been instantly noticeable , traffic controllers say .
Flight 77 , like other planes , at first showed up on radar screens as a short solid line , with a readout that identifies the plane and gives its altitude and speed .
When the transponder shuts down , the short line vanishes .
The speed number goes away , too .
`` It 's just something that catches your eye , '' one controller says .
And it 's not that unusual .
Transponders fail from time to time ; commercial aircraft are required to carry a spare .
Although it is n't clear what happened in the case of Flight 77 , a controller 's first move typically would be to contact the pilot , and tell them the transponder was n't working .
SWITCHING TO RADAR
But even if the plane remained silent , controllers could still find it -- by switching their screen display to the old - fashioned radar that bounces a signal off the plane 's metal skin .
Many controllers who track high - flying planes have little experience using that harder - to - read system , one former controller said .
`` You 'll have controllers with 10 years experience who never track an airplane without a transponder .
It just does n't happen , '' said Ed Freeman , a Maryland consultant who spent 24 years as an air traffic controller .
At about 9:25 a.m. , television commentator Barbara Olson called her husband -- Solicitor General Theodore Olson -- and reported that the plane had been hijacked .
Five minutes later , she called back to say the pilot was with the passengers in the back of the plane .
About that time , controllers across the country were frantically trying to get all planes out of the air , ordering all pilots to land at the nearest airport .
Flight 77 was heading directly toward the restricted airspace over the White House when it banked sharply to the right and approached the Pentagon .
Military jets are routinely scrambled in the case of hijackings and ``runners , '' planes that do not answer or do not heed air traffic controllers .
But FAA officials would not say when controllers detected the errant Flight 77 or whether any fighter jets were able to get into the air to confront it .
Fighter jets are based nearby , in Virginia , and could have reached the White House within minutes , aviation sources say .
In at least one other case , American Flight 11 , controllers knew it was a hijacking while it was in the air .
The pilot , who apparently flew the plane much of the way from Boston to New York , pushed a button on the aircraft yoke that allowed controllers to hear what was going on : the hijacker giving orders in a threatening voice , and the pilot trying to be calm , according to an account in the Christian Science Monitor .
Two F - 15 jets were scrambled from Otis Air Force Base in New York , the newspaper reported , but the controllers report the plane vanished from the radar just before or after they got in the air .
It was the first plane that hit the World Trade Center tower .
Pilots and controllers have instructions on how to handle a typical hijacking .
If the transponder is still working , pilots punch in a four - digit code that tells controllers the plane is being hijacked .
Once that signal is received , a controller is supposed to call the aircraft and ask , subtly , if the pilot meant to send the transmission .
The FAA has a detailed hijacking manual : Supervisors are notified .
The FAA command center near Washington and the FBI are put on alert .
Military jets are scrambled to follow the plane .
Air - traffic controllers try to figure out where the hijacker wants to go and , if necessary , clear an air space of other traffic .
The FBI has well - rehearsed plans to send negotiators and hostage rescue teams to airport .
But there 's nothing in the security plan that talks about terrorist - flown planes turned into missiles , say experts and former FAA and FBI officials .
The plan assumes hijackers want to use the plane to extort something -- not to use it as a suicide bomb .
` `I know we thought and talked about it , '' said Robert M. Blitzer , a consultant and former counterterrorism chief at the FBI .
`` I just do n't know that anyone imagined in reality that something like this would ever happen . ''

When Social Media first appeared on the scene , it was underestimated by many brands including True Medspa Center a business I worked for a few years back .
It is not until now that we are seeing the presence of more and more business owners on these platforms .
Those who jumped aboard they are benefitting now , especially if they have got help from social media marketing companies .
If you are a new business or have not attempted social media marketing yet , then you should consider recruiting professional services .
You can also use the following tips to guide you along the way to building a strong brand on your right social platforms .
Try a forum at a time
Peter Barnes runs the social media for a environmental drilling company and for construction by asi and says “ There are many social media sites that you can add to your online marketing toolkit , but you do not want to do it together .
You need to focus on one or two platforms at a time , especially those who have a large number of your followers .
The idea is to strengthen your skills on the first set of platforms before moving on to others . ”
Create a schedule for your content
Graeme W. is a seo manchester and smm pro for these concrete contractors and notes “ Organizational is important if you want to keep your followers connected to your brand .
Making schedules can help organize your topics and publishing time , so you do not dry up .
Social media marketing companies can help you develop content calendars for your accounts .

Track everything
Jim Mason runs the social media for Radiator Outlet UK and says “ It is very important to keep track of every aspect of your social media marketing .

Social media agencies have tracking and analysis tools that they can use to monitor your campaigns . ”
Paul Pence runs the marketing for century move and says “ At the end of the day , you will need to know when it is time to hand over this task to someone else .
If you are unable to handle or reduce the knowledge of executing a successful social media marketing campaign , then you need to find a replacement .
Your best bet is to go with the professional service provider . ”
Barry Bearak is still in jail .
Top officials in Zimbabwe agreed the case against him was groundless , but according to Bill Keller , the state ’s lawyers overruled them and he ’ll remain in prison for a second night .
Here is Bill Keller ’s statement , sent to us through a Times spokeswoman , Catherine Mathis :
Russia has denied claims that one of its fighters has shot down an unmanned Georgian spy plane .

" English please so we all could join the convo ! "
That was just posted to a Facebook group , after a Chilean girl commented in Spanish .
Posted by an ugly American , or a neocolonialist Brit ?
No , by a Bengali .
I 've notice lately that , while I almost never hear native English speakers criticizing others for not knowing English , I hearspeakers doing this all the time .
The friend lamenting Japan 's lack of English signage , the person I heard dissing a guest speaker for his poor English -- neither of these , nor the issuer of the Facebook reprimand , speaks English as a native language .
All three live in Qatar .
Yet all three expect English to be used as the default language , and become irritated when it is not .
I often do n't know how to feel about English as a lingua franca .
It 's awesome to see people from all over the planet being able to communicate through a shared medium .
Without a shared language , Education City could n't happen .
Without a shared language , low - skilled laborers could n't tell me about the human rights problems they face .
Without a shared language , my dinner party on Saturday would have been pretty awkward , as the eight of us would have been speaking in five different languages !
On the other hand , the more English fluency becomes a sine qua non of participation in the global community , the more non-English - speakers are pushed to the margins .
The laborers whospeak English or Arabic can't talk to me about human rights abuses ; more importantly , they can't file an official complaint .
They simply can't participate in full society like those who speak one of the " important " languages .
Not only that , but as other languages are lost or demoted , the world loses some of its richness .
What does it mean for Arabic that Qatari schools are shifting to English as the medium of instruction ?
Our students are confident Arabic will never be lost , because it is so tied to religion .
( Should I tell them about Avestan or Pali ? )
The switch to English means that fewer of our students will struggle in their first year because they 've never been taught in English before .
On the other hand , it also means that future Qataris will only be able to talk about math and science in a language that is foreign to them .
Surely that has its own costs .
In a strange way , I think it 's also unfortunate for us English speakers that our language has become the default one .
Of course , it gives us advantages : how many people can live 8,000 miles from their place of birth and still use their native language almost exclusively , I do ?
But it also means that English speakersget by without ever learning a second language , which is by no means good for us .
Realizing that your language and culture come with embedded assumptions that are n't shared by other peoples is important , and it 's something that most people in the world learn early on .
It 's a shame more of us do n't have the opportunity to do the same .
Di Chica Mala
Sarà la primaverà , sarà che mi sento in pace con il mondo , sarà che sono circondata da buoni amici e in generale da persone allegre e positive ma questo .. come dice La Mentirosa , è un periodo dove non passa uscita senza “ colpo ferire ” .
Ieri sera siamo andate all ’
Havana cafè dove ci ha raggiunto il nuovo amico della Mentirosa e dove in seguito si è unito a noi un suo amico .
Mi è sembrato , di primo acchito una persona simpatica , interessante e tutto sommato anche piacevole alla vista , carino insomma .
Abbiamo chiacchierato un pò e viene fuori che è un fotografo , lavora nel campo della moda e vive tra Milano e Montecarlo , ha vissuto e lavorato per anni in Messico e da poco è tornato in patria .
Si , decisamente interessante ma ..
– ha parlato quasi tutto il tempo di se stesso , della sua vita , degli amici vip , del suo agente , dei suoi cani delle sue due case ; ( capisci bene : tu non sai chi sono io ! )
– ha messo subito in chiaro che se devo stare con lui non devo essere gelosa delle modelle che fotografa ( ??? ) ;
– ha voluto puntualizzare che è seriamente interessato a me e che io sono troppo sostenuta , quando invece dovrei essere onorata di godere della sua attenzione ;
– che ho un viso espressivo e uno sguardo intenso , lui se ne intende di queste cose ( deja-vu ) ;
– che cerca una donna come me disposta a seguirlo ovunque ;
– che stare con lui significa passare la settimana in città e poi tassativamente nella seconda casa , nel Principato ..E SU QUESTO NON SI DISCUTE !!;
– che non riesce davvero a capire perchè non sono interessata a lui e che non sa proprio cosa fare per convincermi ad uscire insieme , PROPRIO NON SI CAPACITA DELLA MIA INDIFFERENZA ;
Tutto questo in un ora e mezza …
A parte il fatto che , questo personaggio , decisamente estemporaneo mi ha , come dire , spaventata , se non altro per l ’impressione da squilibrato mentale che mi ha fatto , la cosa che mi ha più colpita è che esistono davvero persone così disperate , insicure , instabili , disposte a supplicare qualcuno ad uscire con loro ; perchè questo è stato , mi ha per così dire supplicato tutta la sera di dargli una “ possibilità ” .
MA SE NEMMENO MI CONOSCI !
Quando , a una cert ’ora ho detto alla Mentirosa che ero stanca e volevo tornare a casa , il tizio si è nuovamente offeso dicendo a chiare lettere che se mi fosse piaciuto almeno un pò non me ne sarei andata così e , cavolo non scherzava , aveva proprio gli occhi da spiritato …
Va bene ..ora me vado a fare il mio dovere dando il mio voto a VELTRONI e fare un saluto all ’uomo migliore che abbia mai conosciuto , al mio eroe .
P.S. papà , ieri la Juve ha vinto 😉
Picassoâ€™s Top 7 Tips for Creating an Exciting Life
â€ œThe artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place : from the sky , from the earth , from a scrap of paper , from a passing shape , from a spider 's web.â€ 
â€ œSome painters transform the sun into a yellow spot , others transform a yellow spot into the sun.â€ 
Pablo Picasso was a Spanish painter , sculptor and creator in many creative fields .
Heâ€™s perhaps the most well - known painter from all of the 20 :th century .
He also had some interesting things to say about life .
Here are my 7 favourite tips from him .
1 . You have to believe to be able to do .
â€ œHe can who thinks he can , and he can't who thinks he can't .
This is an inexorable , indisputable law.â€ 
This is a great quote because it doesnâ€™t just say that you should â€œbelieve in yourself ! â€ .
It explains why you need to believe in yourself and your ability to do something to actually do it .
The funny thing is that itâ€™s hard to see how much your beliefs control your performance and how you see your world when you are used at looking at things from just one perspective .
When you think you can do something instead of not your perception of that thing changes .
And your perception of yourself too .
Without those changed perspectives it will be hard to find the courage , motivation , enthusiasm and whatever else you may need .
And then there are self - fulfilling prophecies .
If you think youâ€™ll fail you are likely to hold you self back or even trip yourself up ( sometimes unconsciously ) .
If you on the other hand think you can do something your mind will start to find solutions and focus on fixing things instead of whining about them .
From all of the stimuli around you things , solutions and opportunities will just start to pop up .
Without that focus on the right thing , on your ability to do , your mind may not find the resources and solutions that are needed .
2. Push your limits .
â€ œI am always doing that which I cannot do , in order that I may learn how to do it.â€ 
Pushing yourself and stretching is necessary to grow .
And the more you push yourself the quicker you can grow .
But it can be scary .
My best tip so far : stay present as much as you can while doing something you can not yet do .
This can greatly decrease possible negative feelings that are holding you back .
And with those feelings out of your mind and body it becomes easier to focus , to feel positive feelings and actually perform well and learn to do whatever you have set your mind upon .
For tips on that check out 8 Ways to Return to the Present Moment .
My three favourites among that bunch are at the moment : focus on whatâ€™s right in front of you , pick up the vibe from present people ( I listen to Eckhart Tolle cds very often ) and focusing on your breathing .
3. Donâ€™t wait for inspiration or the right moment .
â€ œInspiration exists , but it has to find us working .â€ 
Inspiration can show up on its own , waltzing in through a door or a window .
But doing things that way makes work inconsistent â€ “ both in quality and quantity – and you spend a lot of time waiting .
I find that itâ€™s better to follow Pabloâ€™s suggestion and just start working .
For the first minutes what you do may suck quite a bit and itâ€™s hard going .
But after a while inspiration seems to catch up with you .
Things start to flow easier and your work is of a higher quality .
If you feel inspired one day thatâ€™s great .
Use your inspiration .
But donâ€™t limit yourself to the moments where you feel inspired or you feel like the moment is just right to do something .
Act instead .
A lot of the time you can find inspiration along the way .
Or accomplish whatever you want to do despite the moment not looking just as you would like it to .
4. Act .
â€ œOnly put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.â€ 
â€ œAction is the foundational key to all success.â€ 
I know .
If you have been reading this blog for a while you may have noticed that taking action is included in a lot of the articles .
But thatâ€™s because , as Picasso says , action is the foundation .
Without taking action any information â€ “ no matter how useful â€ “ will be pretty useless .
This is also the part of personal growth or just life that is often forgotten or perhaps avoided .
Itâ€™s scary .
It can feel difficult to do it .
Or you may not feel like itâ€™s the right moment now .
But developing a habit of taking more and more action can make a huge difference .
Have a look at How to Take More Action : 9 Powerful Tips for help to develop such a habit .
My favourite tip among those is the same as for when pushing your limits : stay present to decrease inner resistance to taking action .
5 . Ask the right questions .
â€ œOthers have seen what is and asked why .
I have seen what could be and asked why not.â€ 
Itâ€™s easy to ask yourself the wrong questions .
To ask yourself questions that just will give you answers that confirm that you are incompetent , foolish , wrong and tell you that your future is limited .
Questions that will sink you instead of help to lift you up .
So instead , ask yourself empowering questions .
When having a seemingly negative experience ask yourself : what is good about this ?
What can I learn from this ?
There is always something you can learn and have use for to create positive experiences later on .
When interacting with others ask yourself :
How can I bring even more value ( understanding , help , practical solutions , fun , excitement etc. ) to this interaction ?
In just about any situation you can always ask yourself : whatâ€™s great about this situation / experience ?
This is a quick way to shift your mood and thoughts into more positive , resourceful and empowered forms through gratitude .
There are of course many more empowering questions you can ask yourself .
I think the main point is to reframe the questions you ask yourself into positive questions that open up – instead of closes â€ “ the door to opportunities and possibilities .
6 . See the hidden beauty by not judging .
â€ œIf only we could pull out our brain and use only our eyes.â€ 
One of big advantages of becoming more present in your everyday life is that you decrease the amount of analysing and labelling you do to the things / people in your surroundings .
You donâ€™t judge as much .
This might sound strange but in the moments when you are present the ordinary world becomes more interesting and wonderful .
Colors can seem brighter .
Your see more aliveness in trees , nature and in people .
You see the wonder of all your man-made gadgets and stuff .
Things that most often seem common , routine and boring become fascinating and something you can appreciate .
Itâ€™s like you are observing your world with more clarity and curiousness .
Like a little kid again , discovering things while they still feel fresh .
Before they have just become walking , talking and growing labels with years of associations and thoughts attached .
This is a bit like the first tip in this article .
Before you actually use it â€ “ if you just think about it in your mind â€ “ it may not make that much sense .
I highly recommend reading / listening to Eckhart Tolle to gain a deeper understanding of being present .
He and Oprah are doing free 90 minute talks about his book A New Earth right now .
Check out the book and those webcasts .
7. Itâ€™s not too late .
â€ œYouth has no age.â€ 
Donâ€™t let social conditioning tell you what you can or cannot do just because you are of one age or another .
Age is most of the time just in your head anyway .
Take tip # 1 into consideration and choose for yourself what you can do .
And use tip # 6 and ask yourself the right questions instead of ones that limit you .
And , remember , the present moment s all there ever is anyway .
So donâ€™t get caught up in the past too much .
Most of the time you really donâ€™t have to act consistently with what you have done before .
If you do , then thatâ€™s your choice .
And you can decide to do something different too .
Right now .
It is really only too late to change if you look at your life as a time - line .
If you learn to become more present , if you learn to live more in the now , much of that thinking just falls away .
You realize that you can consciously choose and do pretty much whatever you like in the present moment and built a future with new possibilities .

At UFC 70 in April 2007 , Gabriel Gonzaga gave Mirko " Cro Cop " Filipovic a dose of his own medicine when a lancinating kick to the head sent the heavily favored Croatian into momentary oblivion .
Four months later at UFC 74 , Randy Couture rendered Gonzaga a similar fate , when a flurry of unanswered punches prompted veteran referee Herb Dean to stop the fight .
Dean , who refereed both contests and who has officiated thousands of bouts , noted the Filipovic knockout was the worst he has ever seen because of the way Filipovic went down .
" [ Filipovic ] got knocked out and fell in such a way that his limbs were mangled , " Dean said .
A knockout or technical knockout from strikes to the head results in an alteration in alertness or consciousness .
The brain shuts down from direct compression against the skull ; cerebral circulation halts and muscle tone is lost .
The shutdown is a protective mechanism .
Once the brain reboots , consciousness is regained .
The force , duration , type of shot and delivery site ( jaw , chin or temple ) determine the blow 's significance .
When Chuck Liddell knocked out Couture at UFC 52 , it was from a devastating right cross that rotated Couture 's head .
The shot compressed Couture 's carotid arteries and cut out the circulation running along the side of his neck .
That type of strike is a classic example of acceleration blows , in which a stationary head is struck by a rapidly moving leg or hand .
It was the first time Couture was knocked unconscious .
A deceleration blow is what resulted when Carlos Newton controversially lost his welterweight title at UFC 34 .
Newton had a triangle choke around the neck of Matt Hughes before he was rendered unconscious when Hughes slammed Newton against the mat .
Newton 's choke might have rendered Hughes unconscious before he fell to the canvas with Newton locked onto him .
Newton was knocked out when his head crashed into the mat .
It 's a bit more simple in boxing to determine if a fighter has recovered from head shots .
He must either remain standing , or get up and walk toward the referee after an eight count .
In MMA , though , there is no count by the referee ; the fighter is either able or unable to continue .
" I look to see if the fighter 's limbs are in a defensive position .
He can't be sprawled out , " said Dean , himself a former mixed martial artist .
" They can do anything that lets me know they are in the game .
If on the ground , they need to regain a guard , show head movement or buck their hips if they 're getting hit .
I 'll tell them , ' Fight back ; I need to see movement . ' "
And what if a fighter is out of guard but still conscious ?
Carlos Newton , bottom , was rendered unconscious after getting slammed on his head by Matt Hughes .

" If semiconscious , I allow two to three blows before I stop it , as the fighter can't defend himself , " Dean said .
" You know you are OK if you can stand , but on the ground , as a fighter , you do n't have a point of reference , and when you wake up you do n't know what has happened . "
Between rounds , the doctor will evaluate a fighter who has taken punishment to determine if they are able to continue , and make a recommendation to the referee .
The doctor 's role becomes front and center once a fight is stopped on head shots .
In New Jersey , California and Nevada , there are at least four doctors assigned to an event : two ringside and two that follow the fighters to their dressing rooms .
If a knockout or technical knockout occurs , the doctors enter the cage to make certain the fighter has a clear airway , is breathing and has regained consciousness .
If not , the athlete is immediately transported to a hospital for a brain scan .
The fighter is allowed to leave the hospital if the scan is normal and there is no evidence of cognitive injury like confusion , memory loss , headache or dizziness .
Fighters stopped by head shots receive a medical suspension from the commission that is upheld nationally .
During this time , he cannot spar or schedule another match .
When Couture stopped Gonzaga in August 2007 , Nevada suspended Gonzaga for up to six months for a fractured nose .
He was also given two months for suffering a technical knockout .
Suspensions are meant to give a fighter rest .
The brain needs time to heal just like any other part of the body .
Unlike sports like football and hockey , U.S. - regulated mixed martial arts events have tight restrictions in providing the athlete significant time off .
While certain fighters are more prone to knockouts than others , there are protective factors to help avoid being knocked out .
Fighters strengthen their neck muscles to absorb the effects of blows .
A good chin tuck lessens head movement with a punch .
A well - made mouth guard stabilizes jaw alignment and stability .
It absorbs much of the force of a blow to the jaw and temple .
Lastly , good gym habits , maintaining weight and solid preparation are perhaps most important to preventing a knockout .
Lightweight contender Kenny Florian , has never been knocked out in a fight or in the gym .
Florian typically walks around at 168 pounds .
" I do n't sweat out more than two pounds , " he said .
" I have a nutritionist , am smart with my diet and there is no offseason . "
Dr. Margaret Goodman , a former Nevada State Athletic Commission Medical Advisory Board chairman and chief ringside physician , contributes regularly to The Ring magazine .

Last year , revolutionary legislation went into effect in Massachusetts mandating health coverage for all citizens of the Bay State .
Because universal health coverage is one of would - be President Barack Obama ’s big tickets , this might qualify as a teachable moment .
The state of Massachusetts , acting as a “ laboratory of democracy , ” has done the rest of America a huge favor by giving an early look at some of the benefits of government medicine , as well as the unintended consequences .
One consequence of the state law requiring everyone to have health insurance – hundreds of thousands of people suddenly need a routine physical .
According to the New York Times , about 340,000 of Massachusetts ’ uninsured citizens have gained coverage so far .
That ’s over 300,000 people calling doctors to make appointments for a check up .
Of course , there are n’t magically 300,000 new doctors in Massachusetts , so the waiting list for an office visit might be a few months .
On the upside , it ’s a free physical .
In October , if you ’re lucky .
In the private market , increasing demand for any good or service has the effect of increasing that good / service ’s price , but also decreasing the relative quality of that good / service .
Long waiting lists are part of that degradation in quality , and there ’s no sign that demand will slow down .
And what happens if there ’s a sudden influx of uninsured Massachusetts residents ?
In the 1970 ’s , Wisconsin became a welfare magnet because it paid higher benefits than other states .
On the upside , it ’s free .
Advertisements
Another example of degradation in quality – despite the good intent behind the law , uninsured people are n’t guaranteed access to primary care physicians .
Because of skyrocketing demand , many doctors are declining to accept new patients , meaning newly insured persons might have to travel 20 + miles from their homes to see a doctor .
Unless of course they ’re willing to go on the waiting list with a closer doctor .
On the upside , it ’s free .
However , possibly the most regrettable unintended consequence is the potential decline in job satisfaction among physicians .
The New York Times highlights this aspect :
Dr. Atkinson , 45 , said she paid herself a salary of $ 110,000 last year .
Her insurance reimbursements often do not cover her costs , she said .
“ I calculated that every time I have a Medicare patient it ’s like handing them a $ 20 bill when they leave , ” she said .
“ I never went into medicine to get rich , but I never expected to feel as disrespected as I feel .
Where is the incentive for a practice like ours ? ”
Medical students wo n’t become primary care physicians if it ’s thankless work , especially when they can make more as specialists .
On the upside , it ’s free .
Obama : I do n't carry a Council on Foreign Relations card or know any ' special handshake ' David Edwards and Eric Mayes
Published : Monday March 31 , 2008

Print This Email This Worries about One World Order and a North American Union have been " ginned up by the blogs and the Internet , " Sen .
Barack Obama told a Lancaster , Pennsylvania audience in a stump speech as he continued his tour through the battleground state .
The Illinois senator also defended the recently re-authorized Patriot Act .
Responding to a question from the audience , asking whether he was a member for the Council on Foreign Relations , a group many allege is leading a move toward one world government , Obama said : " I dont know if I m an official member .
Ive spoken there before .
It basically is a forum where people talk about foreign policy .
There is no official membership .
I dont have a card , or you know a special handshake or anything like that . "
Sen. Hillary Clinton has spoken several times to the club .
Comments she made today against NAFTA , were posted on the group 's website .
Often , because the council has served as lightning rod for conspiracy theorists , candidates shy away from listing their affiliation with the group .
Vice President Dick Cheney is a former director but has taken pains not to publicize the fact .
" Ive been a member for long and was actually a director for some period of time , " he told members in a speech broadcast on C - Span and now on YouTube , adding , " I never mentioned that when I was running for re-election back home in Wyoming . "
The council has been at the center of several One World Order conspiracies with theorists contending that the group is conspiring to bring about one world government and a North American Union similar to the European Union .
Obama dismissed those notions .
" I see no evidence of this actually taking place , " he said .
" I think this is something that has been ginned up on certain blogs and the Internet .
It was based mostly on the fact that there is this highway being built in Texas that will facilitate transportation more transportation between Mexico and the intercontinental United States and Canada ... NAFTA helped to break down barriers , but I dont think there is some conspiracy to create this one continental government . "
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast March 31 , 2008 : Defends portions of Patriot Act Obama said he opposed NAFTA because it didnt offer enough protections to American workers but he defended portions of the Patriot Act which he said he worked on to cut out some of the most objectionable portions .
Free trade has been an issue across the nation in this campaign particularly as many once prosperous industrial states struggle with ways to cope with the changing global economy .
It was a critical issue for voters in Ohio where Clinton managed to beat Obama .
Pennsylvania voters have expressed similar concerns .
Obama said he did not support NAFTA .
" I was opposed to NAFTA because I thought that it didnt have the labor and environmental standards and the safety standards that would look out for US workers , " replied Obama .
Clintons husband oversaw passage of NAFTA but today she called for parts of it to be renegotiated .
" I spoke out against it starting in 1992 -- the president made a different decision , " Clinton said .
" I think now with 14 years of experience under our belt , we can see that in some parts of our country there have been , perhaps , some economic advantages , but in other parts of our country , like where we are right here in northwest Indiana , it has n't worked as it was promised , and therefore I think we need to renegotiate it , " she told an Indiana audience today .
Obama also spoke about the Patriot Act , which he voted to re-authorize .
The Patriot Act is not the problem , he said .
A series of executive orders is what has really eroded civil liberties .
" Most of the problem that we have had in civil liberties were not done in the Patriot Act they were done in executive order by George W. Bush ... I will reverse them with the stroke of a pen , " he said , listing the establishment of Guantanamo Bay , warrantless wiretaps and the suspension of Habeas Corpus .
Other parts of the law were valid , he said .
" There were some provisions in the Patriot Act that did address changes that needed to take place , " said Obama , citing as an example a clause that now allows the government to tap cellular phones .
His work he said , kept many of the worst portions of the law from being re-enacted .
" We instituted a series of amendments that changed some of the worst excesses of the previous law , " he said .
We were using memcache in our application for a long time and it helped a lot to reduce DB servers load on some huge queries .
But there was a problem ( sometimes called a “ dog - pile effect ” ) – when some cached value was expired and we had a huge traffic , sometimes too many threads in our application were trying to calculate new value to cache it .
For example , if you have some simple but really bad query like
1
SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM some_table WHERE some_flag = X
which could be really slow on a huge tables , and your cache expires , then ALL your clients calling a page with this counter will end up waiting for this counter to be updated .
Sometimes there could be tens or even hundreds of such a queries running on your DB killing your server and breaking an entire application ( number of application instances is constant , but more and more instances are locked waiting for a counter ) .
So , how could we avoid such a problem ?
First thing came to my mind was : “ What if we ’d mark old counter as ‘ expired ’ and then only one thread would re-calculate a counter while all other clients would use old value ? ” .
The idea looks great , but when we cache something in memcached , we it is hard to say when a value vas saved to the cache and when it is going to be expired .
After a small research I ’ve found a much more elegant solution : we could create two keys in memcached : MAIN key with expiration time a bit higher than normal + a STALE key which expires earlier .
So , when we try to read a value from memcached , we try to read STALE key too .
If it is expired , it is time to start re-calculation ( and set STALE key again with some short TTL ) .
Final solution we end up using is following ( monkey patch for the ActiveRecord : : Cache class from the RobotCoop ’s memcache - client library ) :

Since it is a monkey patch , you need to place this piece of code wherever you want , but it should be used AFTER memcache - client is loaded ( for example , you can put it to your config / initializers / directory or just copy - paste to your environment.rb .
And example usage of this patch is following :

# This would fall back to a generic get ( ) method because TTL was not provided
Cache . smart_get ( ' test ' ) { some_huge_calc }
# This would cache your calculation results for a 160 and will re-generate cache in 100 seconds
Cache . smart_get ( ' test ' , 100 ) { some_huge_calc }
# This would cache your calculation results for a 120 and will re-generate cache in 100 seconds
Cache . smart_get ( ' test ' , 100 , 10 ) { some_huge_calc }
So , this is it – with a simple change we ’ve fixed really annoying problem and made our application much more stable .
