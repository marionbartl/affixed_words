The country ca n’t afford any more Republican economics .
Their policies are going to drag the global economies down as well .
More than three in four Americans believe the U.S. economy is already in a recession , or will be sometime in 2008 .
That ’s according to a comprehensive poll commissioned this week by Fortune Magazine .
Only 19 percent of 1,000 Americans surveyed believe the nation will avoid a recession , while 57 percent believe that there will be a downturn this year .
Another 19 percent believe the nation is already in a recession .
What ’s worse for the economic outlook , just about half of those surveyed say that they ’ve cut back their spending compared to last year .

According to classic principles of web design , everything at the bottom of the page is n’t that important .
Most users think like that .
And most designers are convinced that this is true .
Site elements at the bottom of the page are n’t really able to catch visitors ’ attention which is why footers are often forgotten or ignored and not given the attention they deserve .
According to classic principles of web design , everything at the bottom of the page is n’t that important .
Most users think like that .
And most designers are convinced that this is true .
Site elements at the bottom of the page are n’t really able to catch visitors ’ attention which is why footers are often forgotten or ignored and not given the attention they deserve .
In fact , most footers are rather boring and uninspiring .
Designers often use the bottom area to mention everything they have n’t found place for at the top of the site .
E.g. disclaimers , W3C - buttons , copyright , “ back to the top ” - link and contact details .
But if most designers forget it , why do n’t make use of it ?
Why do n’t use footers to impress visitors with something they actually do n’t expect at all ?
This post presents creative examples of footers and ideas for footer design .
We ’ve tried to identify some trends and some interesting approaches you may want to use or develop further in your projects .

Basically , footers need to provide users with the information they are looking for .
This is why contact details and a brief information about site or / and site owners needs to be placed in the footer .
Corporate designs may need to provide driving directions , telephone number , a web form or at least an e-mail .
However , you can also use the footer to express something artistic and very personal .
For instance , if you are a Seinfeld fan , why do n’t place a small Kramer somewhere next to the contact details in your footer ?
Thus , with one small detail you can make your site more distinctive and focus visitors ’ attention to yourself .
Blog designs usually have a bunch of different data hidden or displayed in their footers .
For instance , the latest posts , comments , last job opening , last forum discussion or link to a random post .
CSS Beauty presents its recent forum discussions and job openings at the bottom of the page .
It ’s unclear whether they belong to the footer , though .
Some designers go even further and place the whole navigation at the bottom of the page .
In such cases the site is split in two parts ; the upper part takes care of the content while the bottom section takes care of everything else .
In such cases it ’s not really reasonable to speak about footers .
A typical example is DesignShack with the whole navigation menu placed at the bottom of the site .
Designshack has the complete navigation , layout selection , colour selection and further information in the footer .
There is a number of possibilities : footers can contain personal illustrations , links to related sites , photos , web forms , icons , a lot of creativity .
We ’ve found out that quite often footers unfortunately also have SEO - spam and advertisement which do n’t belong there in the first place .
1. Imitate proximity to the ground
Well , that ’s quite strange .
But we ’ve observed this trend too often to dismiss it .
Many designers tend to imitate the proximity to the ground .
This means that they attempt to complete layouts with illustrations of the ground — in such cases trees , birds , buildings and the horizontal perspective are usual .
Funny characters , mascots , illustrations and hand - drawing are also typical for such footers .
YoDiv sends little bubbles in race .
Vimeo takes a look at little humans from user ’s perspective .
Kulturbanause .de with a waterfall and water ground .
Beautiful and ( really ) unusual WordPress blog design .
The Rissington Podcast has a helicopter plane ready to fly .
Comic in use .
Rapidweaver has taken care of the smallest details .
This sweet language selection fits perfectly to the site design .
MB Dragan loves hand - drawing .
We too .
Simple and beautiful .
Miloslav Lešetický is an illustrator which is why one of his illustrations is placed in the footer .

Icons , a tree and three birds inclusive .
TNTPixel — oh- oh , you better be careful with this one .
Roman Leinwather has some green flowers for us …
… and on Web4 B iz . ro it seems to be quite cold at this period of time .
A little city on StrawPollNow.com .
Since the main function of the footer is to complete the layout , often it is given a color which has a high contrast to colors dominating in the overall site design .
Vivid colors can be observed as often as dark ones .
HEBAtec has a number of different features in the footer .
Among them RSS feed and a search box .
Freelenz .at knows how to arrange blog postings , comments , RSS feed icon and Flickr thumbnails .
And , oh , a beautiful plant too !
Viget.com provides navigation in categories and archives .
Blogsolid offers an icon parade in the footer .
Bits and Pixels has a quite colorful footer with some icons .
The design fits perfectly to the overall site design which is pretty colorful too .
Still , often overall layout colors and the footer design are very similar .
Example : City of Grace Mesa
3. Illustrations in use
Often illustrations are used to give the footer some particular meaning it needs to convey .
Possibilities are endless .
In most cases designers use vivid images and cartoons .
Legendary Aircraft has a toolbox in its footer .
Pil.hu with a pen , an envelope and a desk .
?ukasz Tyra ? a shows some hand - drawn sketches .
So does Bart - Jan Verhoef .
We feature Nick La ’s Webdesignerwall quite often , but it definitely deserves it .
The attention to details is amazing .
Us Trendy — all in one place , including RSS - feed - icon , swivels and a butterfly .
Is n’t it too much ?

Codex Transportica — simple and distinctive .
Johanna Hallin clips the footer to the site layout .
Catydesign ’s cat is sweet …
… and Olieng ’s lobster scorpion is even animated !
Link suggestions in Catalyst Studios sketchbook .
Apart from visual appeal , footers can be used effectively to convey some important information quickly and shortly .
Contact information , address , sitemap , main sections can therefore often be found in the footer .
However , also further functionalities , such as RSS - feed , email subscription and tag clouds can be placed there too .
The Greg Brady Project combines a contact form and the footer .

The $ 64,000 Question
A few various observations and comments regarding Adobe ’s announcement that Photoshop CS4 will be available in a 64 - bit version for Windows , but will only be 32 - bit for Mac OS X .
The first is that this is not , in and of itself , that big a deal , at least for the vast majority of Photoshop users .
To a non-programmer , “ 64 - bit ” perhaps sounds twice as fast as “ 32 - bit ” , but that ’s not how it works or what it means .
According to Adobe ’s John Nack , in most cases , for the vast majority of real - world files , Photoshop in 64 - bit mode will be “ around 8 – 12 percent ” faster .
But in cases involving massive data sets — those requiring more than 4 GB of memory ( the 32 - bit limit ) — the speedup can be an entire order of magnitude :
For example , opening a 3.75 gigapixel image on a 4 - core machine with 32 GB RAM is about 10× faster .
Keep in mind that a Canon 1Ds Mark III — which sells at Amazon for $ 8,000 — generates 21 megapixel images .
3.75 gigapixels is 3,750 megapixels .
You probably do n’t have images like that .
It ’s also the case that unlike Leopard , which is a single OS that can simultaneously run both 32 - and 64 - bit apps natively , Windows Vista comes in wholly separate 32 - and 64 - bit versions .
And as far as I can tell , the vast majority of Windows users use the 32 - bit version .
( If anyone can find market share information regarding 64 - bit Vista , please let me know . )
But faster is faster , and even a 10 percent gain is important to serious Photoshop users .
The uncomfortable truth is that the fastest way to run Photoshop CS4 on a Mac will be to run it under Windows .
It ’ll be particularly interesting to see benchmarks comparing 64 - bit Photoshop on Mac OS X using VMware against the native 32 - bit Mac version .
( Parallels does n’t support 64 - bit OSes . )
The Cocoa Rewrite
The big deal is CS5 , the next - next version of Photoshop .
The only supported 64 - bit APIs ( for UI code ) on Mac OS X are Cocoa , and Adobe wants Photoshop to run in 64 - bit mode on the Mac , so they ’re rewriting the app in Cocoa .
That ’s huge .
Nack writes :
No one has ever ported an application the size of Photoshop from Carbon to Cocoa ( as I mentioned earlier , after 9 years as an Apple product Final Cut Pro remains Carbon - based ) , so we ’re dealing with unknown territory .
I do n’t think that ’s an exaggeration .
I do n’t think Adobe can flat - out promise that CS5 is going to be Cocoa ( or 64 - bit ) because they do n’t know how long it ’s going to take .
The cross -platform angle is also interesting .
Microsoft , for example , develops the Mac versions of its Office apps from an entirely separate application code base than the Windows ones .
They ship on different schedules , have entirely separate engineering teams , and have very different UIs .
Adobe , on the other hand , develops its Creative Suite apps from a shared code base .
New versions ship simultaneously for both Mac and Windows , and they have very similar , if not nearly identical , UIs ( for better or for worse ) .
Carbon and Cocoa are not competing application frameworks .
Carbon is conceptually a lower - level technology than Cocoa .
Cocoa is an application framework , but Carbon is a set of APIs that developers use to write their own application frameworks .
What Adobe has done with the CS suite is develop a cross- platform C++ framework of its own .
There ’s a reason why most cross-platform apps use Carbon .
In Adobe ’s favor , though , is Lightroom — existence proof that a high - quality cross-platform Mac / Windows application can use Cocoa for the Mac side .
Carbon 64
One aspect of the saga that Nack sidesteps — perhaps for political reasons , or perhaps because he ’s gracious — is the degree to which Apple pulled the rug out from under Adobe ’s feet at WWDC 2007 last June .
When Leopard was first announced at WWDC 2006 nine months prior , it included full 64 - bit support for both Carbon and Cocoa .
64 - bit Carbon was n’t promised to be coming “ sometime ” , like with , say , resolution independence .
It was promised for 10.5.0 .
And it existed — developer seeds of Leopard up through WWDC 2007 had in - progress 64 - bit Carbon libraries , and Adobe engineers were developing against them .
Several sources1 have confirmed to me that Adobe found out that Apple was dropping support for 64 - bit Carbon at the same time everyone else outside Apple did : on the first day of WWDC 2007 .
If Apple had shipped Leopard with the 64 - bit Carbon support promised at WWDC 2006 , Photoshop CS4 would run in 64 - bit mode on the Mac .
The unfortunate coincidence is that WWDC 2006 — when 64 - bit Carbon was announced — was right around the time when Adobe was hitting the home stretch on CS3 and planning for CS4 .
( Photoshop CS4 is currently in beta testing , and so the CS4 suite is probably slated to ship soon - ish . )
If Apple had announced then that the only 64 - bit path was going to be Cocoa , would it have made a difference ?
It probably would n’t have made a difference for CS4 , given that it was only nine months , but it would have saved Adobe nine months of wasted time .
My point here is n’t to cast blame on Apple , though .
My take is that both Apple and Adobe made reasonable and honest decisions each step of the way .
I think Apple meant what they announced , and in August 2006 fully intended to deliver 64 - bit Carbon support in 10.5.0 .
But the situation and Apple ’s priorities changed when Leopard fell so far behind schedule ( or , perhaps better put , when it became clear just how far behind schedule Leopard had been all along ) .
When Apple announced that Leopard would miss its original June 2007 ship date , they pushed it back four months to “ October ” , and as it turned out they barely made that .
When facts change , plans change .
One argument against Adobe is that they somehow should have known better and began a Cocoa port sooner .
But the truth is that this 64 - bit issue is the first really compelling reason for a developer like Adobe to port an existing large Carbon app to Cocoa .
What users want are new and improved features ; a port from Carbon to Cocoa is going to require a tremendous amount of effort just to re-implement what Photoshop already does .
2
Adobe perhaps also assumed — and reasonably so — that if the day were ever going to come that they ’d be forced to port Photoshop to Cocoa , that Apple would give them enough lead time to plan for it far in advance .
Remember , too , that Apple itself still has major Carbon applications .
Final Cut , for example , is a prime example of the sort of memory - intensive media processing app ( like Photoshop ) that should benefit greatly from 64 - bit support .
And iTunes is a perfect example of the sort of cross- platform Mac / Windows codebase that ’s a more natural fit with Carbon than Cocoa .
So I think it ’s hard to argue that Adobe should have somehow known the end was near for Carbon when even Apple did n’t know .
With ever tightening fuel economy standards manufactures are forced to look at new ways to increase mileage without sacrificing performance .
After all part of the luxury equation is a big powerful motor .
But with out a big V8 how can you step forward in mileage without taking a step back in performance ?
The answer currently in favor now seems to be smaller displacement turbocharged models .
Even hard core manufactures such as BMW , are rethinking basic core philosophies .
BMW previously described turbocharging as unacceptable and lazy and uninspiring way to gain horsepower , BMW is now singing a new tune .
With a widely heralded 6 cylinder turbo already in the line up , and rumors surfacing a 4 cylinder variant is on the way , BMW has performed an about face over the last three years and has embraced a tried and proven technology .
But what about the others ?
Will Mercedes Benz extensive experience in supercharging now yield to a new generation of ultra efficient turbocharged gasoline motors ?
The rumors are already flying .
Audi is moving this direction in a big way , in many ways already leading the pack with turbocharged technology .
Expressing their confidence in the technology there are actively moving many the S models to twin turbocharged V6s from larger V8s .
Sammler displacement models abound all with turbocharging as standard .
Audi it seems , has seen the writing on the all and fully committed to turbocharging most of the line in some form of another .
The Japanese tend to take more of a wait and see attitude , moving much slower in embracing expensive technology .
The view here in many cases is we will follow after you make the mistakes .
But should Lexus try a technology that while proven requires an elevated technical aptitude from the service technicians ?
After all Lexus is in a bit of a quandary , most of the service procedures are similar to the lesser Toyota variants , but the service cost of a Lexus can rival and in some cases exceed those of the competition .
Adding complexity of this magnitude can only exasperate this situation .
Plus with the recent Hybrid improvements they may not feel the need to make a foray into the turbo world .
But I have to admit a turbocharged hybrid motor will appeal to many .
Acura is also moving into the fold slowly with their first turbocharged model the RDX , but Infiniti is not showing any indication of changing from large displacement V6 ’s to smaller power plants .
Possibly a egregious error on their part .
After all gas prices are rising , and you are n’t going to improve mileage that much with a large displacement motor .
So in the luxury car market , will we see turbocharging gain more acceptance over the next decade , and will who will get left behind ?
Readers may have noticed that I have found myself slipping .
I no longer refer to Clinton 's candidacy .
I refer to the Clintons ' candidacy .
This was always the case , of course .
They have been professionally joined at the hip for their entire careers .
Their marriage , among other things , is a power - move - for them both .
But I never expected Bill to show his hand this crudely and this unpleasantly so soon .
I 'll bet he did n't either .
But that 's how close Obama has come .
At least now we know what this race is about : Obama versus the Clintons .
Both of them .
Their dynasty .
Their power .
Their methods .
Their character .
And so the question becomes : does America really want a Restoration ?
And if Hillary is this beholden to Bill in the campaign , what will his role be in the White House ?
I 've long hoped he'd be given a clear job , accountable to the president and the public .
But that is n't their style .
When you re-elect royal families , you get their family dynamics as well .
What we 're seeing now is a small glimpse of what we would be dealing with for at least four years .
They can still be stopped .

Sometimes President Bush sounds like an idiot .
The most recent example is his statement that he still believes the Palestinians and Israelis can reach a peace agreement before the end of his term .
This comes on the heels of an Israeli attack against Gaza that killed more than 100 people , most of them innocent civilians .
It was a reprisal attack for a few rockets fired into Israel by some Hamas hotheads .
In World War II , when the Germans killed civilians as a reprisal for an attack on their forces , it was called a war crime .
Yet President Bush and the world ’s most ineffective secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , can barely force themselves to say , in effect , " Tut , tut , tut .
Ca n’t you folks get along ? "
If the Palestinian rockets were slaughtering Israelis , no one could complain .
Even an occupying power has a right to defend itself .
But these rockets , unguided , more often than not land where people are n’t .
According to a recent story in the Los Angeles Times , only 13 Israelis have been killed by these rockets in the past seven years .
Hamas says the rockets are in response to Israeli attacks ; the Israelis say the reprisal raid is in response to the rocket attacks .
Such circular action - reactions remind one of the wisecrack that if the world practices the old Hebrew " eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth " philosophy , the world would soon be blind and toothless .
Unless the Israelis are willing to do as the Romans did and exterminate every Palestinian man , woman and child , they ca n’t kill their way to peace .
And neither can the Palestinians .
The guilty party in this dance of death is the Bush administration , which absolutely refuses to put even the least pressure on the Israelis .
Israel has all the power .
The Israelis are to the Palestinians like a 250 - pound wrestler assaulting a 4 - year - old child .
Without pressure from the U.S. , the Israeli government will go right on killing Palestinians , taking their land and expanding Israeli settlements .
And Palestinians , weak as they are ( they have no army , no air force , no navy , no country and no international help because the U.S. blocks all such attempts ) , will go right on resisting as best they can .
The Israelis are rearing a whole new generation of terrorists .
When these Palestinian kids grow to manhood amid the chaos , humiliation , death and poverty the Israelis forced on them , they ’re going to be some mean , tough individuals unlikely to be particular about on whom or how they wreak their vengeance .
We ’re growing our own crop of terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Israelis are short - term pragmatists .
Their philosophy is that if someone is too weak to take something , why give it to him ?
They believe that as long as they can control the U.S. government , tap into its wealth and technology and hide behind its veto at the United Nations , there is no need for them to make any concessions at all .
This has certainly worked for them in the short term .
In the long term , however , the Israelis are committing national suicide , just as one of their military intelligence people said .
Sooner or later , General Birthrate and his armies will overwhelm them .
The only way a small Jewish state can survive in the long run among a sea of Arabs is to get along with its neighbors .
Other than the neighbors we bribe  Jordan and Egypt  all of the neighbors hate Israel .
The United States should stop the $ 3 billion annual gift to the Israelis and tell them that as of now , the U.S. will no longer protect them from United Nations sanctions or criticism with our veto .
Israel is quick to say it is a sovereign and independent country ; well , it ’s time the U.S. put that to the test .
If there is any part of the world where our policy should be trade and nothing else , it is the Middle East .
Tattoos are big business .
With celebrities dripping in them and their cool - value flying high , they 're no longer the preserve of criminals and salty old sea dogs .
But with permanent " body art " there comes a catch .
A huge one , depending on the size of your tattoo .
If you change your mind about it – fall out of love with that Tibetan symbol or split up with a lover whose name you had etched into your epidermis , say – that tattoo will suddenly look rather ridiculous .
Tattoo regret is the unfortunate side effect of body art , with around 50 per cent of people who have undergone the needle having second thoughts .
Alan Jenkins , a steelworker , recently revealed that he had undergone 20 hours at his local tattoo parlour and spent £ 870 on having a life - size portrait of his girlfriend 's face etched into his back .
However , soon after , Lisa Crooks left him for a colleague .
But despite the pain and humiliation of both the tattoo and being dumped , Alan is refusing to have it removed by laser , the most popular method of erasing tattoos .
" It will be there for good , even if I meet someone else .
I 've got some room on my chest if I get hooked up with someone again . "
Has he not learnt his lesson ?
I certainly have after having two tattoos , both of which I now dislike to the point of acute embarrassment .
Thirteen years ago , when I was in my first year at university , I decided that I fancied a tattoo .
But unlike my female friends who had more feminine tattoos such as flowers , a seahorse , rainbows and a ridiculous - looking Winnie - the - Pooh figure , I wanted to be different .
So I went for a spider .
To this day , I have no clue how I reached that decision , nor any understanding why it seemed like a good idea .
I did n't think about it for long .
A week later , I went to the tattoo store in the basement of the now - defunct Kensington Market on my own , dropped my jeans , lay face down on the table and told the tattooist to do his best on my bottom .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The 3in black tattoo took about 20 minutes .
The loud buzz of the needle – it sounded like a dentist 's drill – was actually worse than any pain .
It felt like someone lightly scratching me with his fingernail over and over again .
And , of course , with the derrière being the fleshiest part of the body , I had plenty of cushioning so it was pretty much pain - free .
I attempted to show it to my horrified mother , who refused to look at it .
My father approved of it but said : " You should have told me you were having it done – I would have lent you my signet ring so you could have had the family crest done instead . "
Apart from this not being the reaction I had expected from my father , it struck me what a good idea that would have been .
Our family crest is a griffin , the half - lion , half - eagle mythological creature .
Again , not exactly girlie , but it had more meaning than my spider .
And so started my feelings of regret about the tattoo .
Why had n't I thought this through properly ?
Luckily , as it was on my behind , I was n't reminded of my mistake on a daily basis .
I 'd had it done low down on my right cheek , so when I wore a bikini , it would be visible .
I endured 11 years of jokes every time I was in a swimsuit from people trying to swat my spider .
I considered removal but felt that , as I had known full well that tattoos are permanent , it would be my punishment for being too impulsive .
Most of the time I forgot it was there .
But in January 2006 , while travelling in New Zealand , I decided to get my spider tattoo covered up with another one .
This time I knew what I wanted .
I printed off a picture of a griffin from the net , found a tattoo shop and booked myself in for an £ 80 session for the next day .
The tattooist showed me the transfer he had done of the picture .
It was huge .
" To keep all this wonderful detail in the wings , it has be this size , " he said .
" But it 's as big as the palm of my hand !
It 'll take up a fair chunk of my bottom ! " I pointed out .
He shrugged and told me to keep it big .
So I went for it .
This time it was much more painful and took more than an hour .
The outline felt as if the tattooist was using a razor blade on me .
When he was finished , he took a photo for his book , then led me to a full - length mirror to show me his handiwork .
It was fantastic , with intricate detail and lots of shading , but far bigger than I 'd expected , despite my pleas to keep it as dainty as possible .
I realised , with horror , that the griffin looked like something out of Harry Potter .
By the time I returned to London , I had talked myself around and decided that I loved my new tattoo .
I duly showed it to my father .
" Well , that 's marvellous , Jessica , but it 's the wrong sort of griffin , " he said .
" What do you mean ? " I asked .
" Why did n't you ask me to send you a photo of my signet ring ?
Not all griffins are the same .
They all have different heraldic value .
Oh dear ...
You 've really ballsed it up , have n't you ?
Let 's ring your brother and tell him ! " he laughed .
Tattoo regret is , sadly , very common .
But it could soon be a thing of the past .
Doctors in Boston have come up with a permanent but ultimately removable tattoo ink that harnesses the microencapsulation technology already used in drug delivery and scratch - and - sniff perfume samples .
It uses a system of polymers and dyes , so that , in the event of tattoo regret , lasers can burst the polymer beads and the ink will degrade .
But I 'm stuck with a tattoo that makes me look like a walking ad for the old Midland Bank .
I looked into laser removal , but because of the size of my tattoo , it would be expensive as I 'd need up to 10 sessions , which could damage my skin and leave me with blisters , scabs and scarring , and the effectiveness of the removal can't be guaranteed , so I 'd rather not take the risk .
For the time being , I am left with an even bigger tattoo I do n't want .
My boyfriend delights in telling me how much I will embarrass future grandchildren with the grotesque tattoo on what will one day be my wrinkly backside .
But it could be worse , I suppose .
I could be left with a portrait of an ex .
Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig launched his Web - based Change Congress campaign Thursday at a National Press Club event sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation as part of the pro-transparency non-profit 's annual Sunshine Week .
The goal of Change Congress , Lessig explained , is to fight the influence of money in politics by exacting pledges from candidates and lawmakers to personally eschew lobbyist and PAC money , as well as supporting a series of legislative reforms , and then using the distributed eyes of the Internet to ensure that they stick to their promises .
The first half of Lessig 's remarks closely tracked the inaugural lecture on corruption he delivered at Stanford last year , after announcing that he would be abandoning the work on cyberlaw and free culture that had made him a geek superstar in order to study the ways money 's influence distorts the political process .
He detailed how , on an array of " easy questions " in areas ranging from copyright terms to dietary recommendations to climate change to military procurement , the interests of funders had driven a wedge between policy formation or academic inquiry and the overwhelming consensus of impartial experts .
He also offered conservatives , who have often been skeptics of campaign finance reform , a rationale to share his concerns : " Why is government so big ? " Lessig asked rhetorically .
" Because congressmen must get elected . "
He claimed , for example , that legislators had been reluctant to establish a more deregulated telecommunications framework for the Internet in the 1990s because the looming threat of regulation kept campaign contributions rolling in from telecom firms .
This time , Lessig sketched his plan to attack the problem with Change - Congress.org , using a " three layer " strategy .
First , the site would ask candidates and elected officials to make any or all of four pledges :
To refuse contributions from lobbyists and political action committees , to support a ban on legislative " earmarks , " to promote legislation that increases government transparency , and to support public financing of political campaigns .
Candidates could then download badges for display on their websites indicating which planks of the Change Congress platform they have endorsed , a feature similar to the customizable intellectual property licenses produced by Creative Commons , which Lessig also helped to found .
Second , by exploiting a variety of existing transparency resources online , Change Congress would create a wiki - like platform allowing users to track both the positions held by politicians on these four points and how well they live up to their stated views in practice .
Finally , it would ask voters to make a parallel pledge to support candidates who adhere to the Change Congress platform .

Though Lessig did not frame it in quite these terms , the project is a clear attempt to use distributed peer - production processes to overcome one of the fundamental political problems identified by public choice analysis , in much the same way open - source production allows for the creation of informational public goods that , on traditional economic models , would tend to be underproduced in the absence of government subsidy or artificial monopoly grants , such as copyrights or patents .
The political equivalent of the public goods problem is what public choice theorists often describe as the problem of " concentrated benefits , diffuse costs " .
The problem arises when a poor policy produces a large benefit for a small number of actors , but distributes the costs ( whether in the form of direct taxation or regulatory inefficiency ) across the much larger general population .
The beneficiaries have a powerful incentive to ally themselves and lobby for the policy in question , but the transaction costs of organizing and low individual burden on any one taxpayer or consumer mean ordinary citizens have little motivation to mobilize in opposition .
Open source can solve the public goods problem for software because digital networks and widespread computer ownership lower transaction costs and allow large projects to be broken into small enough pieces that individual coders are willing to lend a hand even when they can't directly internalize the marginal market value of their contributions .
Change Congress attacks the parallel political problem in two ways .
First , it bundles together many discrete bad policies under the aegis of a procedural reform .
Lessig 's favorite analogy here is to alcoholism :
An alcohol problem leads to a variety of further personal , professional , and medical ills , none of which can be effectively dealt with until the alcoholic resolves to give up the bottle .
But this approach also helps to aggregate the costs of those particular bad policies in the eyes of citizens , helping to overcome the incentive problem that results when each policy is considered in isolation .
Second , the wiki format disperses the cost of monitoring politicians ' professed positions and compliance with their promises , lowering the investment demanded of any particular activist .
There are , however , a few obvious hurdles this approach will have to face .
First , there is a chicken - and - egg problem .
Candidates will find it worth their while to forsake the significant benefits of accepting PAC and lobbyist money only if they are persuaded that it is outweighed by the electoral advantage to be gained by wooing Change Congress voters .
But the widespread adoption of the Change Congress platform by voters will depend in part on the existence of candidates who are prepared to take the pledge .
Second , and perhaps more seriously , there 's the poor track record of previous efforts that rely on voluntary pledges by politicians .
U.S. Term Limits and Americans for Tax Reform have sought promises from candidates to restrict their own tenure in office and to oppose all tax increases , but both promises have been routinely broken by officeholders without any obvious political backlash .
But then , for the man who spent a decade trying to upend American copyright law , an uphill battle is nothing new .
Leader of the Pack - The UK 's favorite car leasing website !
Contract hire cars from Ling Valentine , LINGsCARS is the UK 's favourite car leasing website - On 2016 I leased over £ 85 million in cars ! ( RRP ) I live inside my car leasing website all day Monday to Friday 9 am - 6 pm .
I lease the cheapest PCP and contract hire cars in the UK ! - I am Ling , accept no substitutes
Car and Vehicle leasing is the leasing of the use of a car for a fixed period of time .
It is a cost - effective alternative to car or vehicle purchase .
It can be known as PCP or contract hire .
The key difference in a car lease is that after the lease expires , the customer can return the car or vehicle to the dealer for no cost , or can often buy it at an agreed price .
Ling owns the UK ’s favourite car leasing company .
Rationale :
Car Leasing offers big advantages to customers .
For the lease buyer , lease payments will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be and qualification is usually easier .
Some very cheap car leasing deals are available , but these change all the time .
Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a new model when the lease expires , allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few years without the responsibility of selling the old car .
It ’s a very simple car owning solution .
A car leasing customer does not have to worry about the future value of the car or vehicle , while a vehicle owner does have this nagging doubt .
For the leasing company , leasing generates income from a vehicle the car leasing company still owns and will be able to sell at auction or lease again once the original lease has expired .
As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time than one they buy outright , leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly , which may fit into various aspects of a finance company ’s business model .
Car Lease agreement :
Car leasing agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number of miles a customer can drive ( for passenger cars , a common mileage is 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year of the car lease ) .
If the mileage allowance is exceeded , a per-mile fee is charged .
Customers can negotiate a higher mileage allowance , for a higher lease payment .
Car lease agreements usually specify how much wear and tear on the vehicle is allowable , and the customer may face a fee if the car is not in good condition at the end of the lease .
At the end of a leasing term , the customer must either return the car or vehicle to the car leasing company , or purchase it .
The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when the lease is signed but may be affected by car condition and mileage .

Christmas is a time for harmless lies , the chocolatey indulgences of the thought world .
We know when to stop , because if we all acted on our belief in Santa there would be no presents : and then Christmas would be meaningless .
My favourite Christmas traditions are the “ red wine is good for you ” and “ chocolate is good for you ” stories , which have become a festive science tradition of their own .
Red Heart Wine , from Sainsbury ’s , with extra antioxidants , is “ a red wine that is actually good for your heart ” .
Drink it down with new Choxi+ , milk chocolate with “ extra antioxidants ” .
“ Guilt free , ” says the Daily Mail , it ’s “ the chocolate bar that ’s ‘ healthier ’ than 5lbs of apples ” .
“ Too good to be true , ” says the Mirror .
“ Chocolate that is good for you , as well as seductive , ” says the Telegraph .
The Choxi + manufacturers recommend two pieces of their chocolate every day .
It ’s almost as good as Fruitella Plus , with added vitamins A , C , E and calcium .
These are jokes which have gone too far , fat and spotty on wishful thinking .
Antioxidants are like an endlessly repeated Christmas movie that you ’ve never quite watched from start to finish : let ’s recap .
Firstly there ’s the theoretical plausibility , from biochemistry textbooks .
Sainsbury ’s tells this story in the style of a children ’s story .
“ Exposure to UV rays , pollution and smoking produce free radicals , ” they say .
Oh modern woes !
“ Free radicals are compounds that cause cell damage , which in the long term can damage health . ”
It ’s a simple tale of right and wrong .
“ Antioxidants help counteract the harmful effects of free radicals . ”
It ’s an attractive idea .
But if you ’re going to pore over the flowcharts in a biochemistry textbook , and pick molecules out at random on the basis of their function in the body , then you can prove anything you like .
When you have a bacterial infection white cells build a wall around invading bacteria and then use free radicals – amongst other things – to kill them off , like tipping bleach down the toilet .
Should we be selling wine with extra free radicals , instead , to help people fight bacterial infections , on the grounds of theoretical plausibility ?
Anyway .
In the 1970s men who looked like Father Christmas made amazing discoveries about smoking and health : buoyed with the enthusiasm of it all , they decided that all other cancers must have lifestyle causes , such as diet perhaps .
They started looking for data , and this is what they found : people who choose to eat antioxidant pills seem to live longer ; people who choose to eat fruit and vegetables seem to live longer ; fruits and vegetables contain lots of antioxidants .
Are antioxidants the key to that link ?
Possibly .
But people who choose to eat fruit and vegetables are getting a lot of good stuff into them , and they ’re also like me : they ’re a bit posh , they get plenty of exercise , they work , they have strong social supports , and more .
So trials were done , in huge numbers , giving one group extra antioxidants , in pills , and the other group our old friend the placebo sugar pill .
Some of these trials were stopped early because the people getting the antioxidants were dying faster .
Overall , if you look at all the results on a big spreadsheet ( a technique called meta- analysis ) it seems that antioxidant supplement pills either do nothing , or worse , kill you quicker .
There might be something in the antioxidant story , but they might be rubbish .
You do n’t read that everyday in press releases on wine and chocolate .
So what does this do for our Christmas fable ?
Well fruit and veg are definitely still good for you .
But you like chocolate .
I ’m not your mother .
Eat it .
Enjoy it .
Believe in Santa .
Chocolate is healthier than 5lbs of apples .
And in the new year you can perform a symbolic purification ritual , involving five days of abstinence .
You can dress that up in crap science too .

The Non-Expert Feb 8 , 2008 Begging the Question
Experts answer what they know .
The Non-Expert answers anything .
This week we explain the phrase nobody understands in terms everyone can understand .
For the most part .
Have a question ?
Need some questionably expert advice ?
Ignored by everyone else ?
Send us your questions via email .
The Non-Expert handles all subjects and is updated on Fridays , and is written by a member of The Morning News staff .
Question : I do n’t understand the term “ begs the question . ”
I know I use it incorrectly — or so I ’ve been told — but I do n’t know what I ’m supposedly doing wrong .
Can you explain ?
— Sarah
Answer :
Because it ’s been years since I ’ve taken any sort of logic class , and since I wholeheartedly disagree with ( read : do not understand ) the tenets of prescriptive linguistics , I ’m going to do some in - depth research on the subject and get back to you .
One Wikipedia … Two Wikipedia … Three Wikipedia …
My understanding is that the term “ begs the question ” has essentially been bastardized , whereby laymen ( i.e. , us ) have misconstrued or broadened its meaning , and in the process have pissed off a very small group of anal - retentive , scholarly types ( i.e. , them ) .
Now , I assume that when you use the phrase , like most other people , you use it to mean something like , “ Well , that opens up another can of worms . ”
For example : Your 16 - year - old son gets in a fight with a bouncer at a strip club .
Sure , it ’s bad enough he ’s rumbling with bouncers — and you are probably in need of some parenting books — but you might say the whole situation begs the question :
How did he , being underage , get into the strip club in the first place ?
And did he at least get a lap dance before he was thrown out ?
( Let ’s hope so . )
But that would be the incorrect use of “ begging the question . ”
In a nutshell , “ begging the question ” refers to a certain fallacy in syllogistic argument where the very thing you are trying to prove ( your conclusion ) is presupposed in the supporting argument ( your premises ) .
This is sometimes called “ circular reasoning . ”
For example :
You would n’t have come to the Non-Expert unless you were really desperate .
You have come to the Non-Expert .
Therefore , you are desperate .
My conclusion — “ you are desperate ” — is not very convincing here , because I have assumed in my argument precisely what I claim to be proving .
Therefore , I would be accused of “ begging the question ” — of arguing for a conclusion based on inconclusive evidence .
After all , I know nothing about you : Aside from asking me this question , you may otherwise be perfectly content .
( Though I have been accused of far worse .
In fact , as I have cheated on my taxes as recently as 15 minutes ago , we can reasonably conclude I may be accused of far worse in the future . )
Structurally , the above argument would look something like this :
x implies y
implies Assume x
Therefore , y
Make a little more sense ?
Good .
Let ’s move on to a slightly more complex version of this type of argument :
Barack Obama will beat Hillary Clinton in the California democratic primary this coming Tuesday provided young people like me just get off their lazy asses and vote !
beat Hillary Clinton in the California democratic primary this coming Tuesday provided young people like me just get off their lazy asses and vote !
It was ?
Fuck .
While circular arguments are technically valid , they are n’t really recommended unless you are trying to prove the theory of intelligent design or something comparable .
Again , I ’m no logician , but it ’s a basic explanation that I hope will suffice .
If you ’re more of a visual learner , I ’ve included a diagrammed version of this type of argument :
Argumentative logic is pretty tough to wrap the brain around at first , so I think we should delve deeper into the territory — or at least due west , then up , then right — because there are all sorts of argument variations you could feasibly encounter under everyday circumstances .
From politicians and CEOs to professional scholars and news anchors , there are vast numbers of self - proclaimed pundits putting our tricky language to optimal use in the hopes of convincing you that the very absurd things spewing from their mouths actually possess an iota of truth .
Often these linguistic smoke and mirrors prove quite effective — just have a look at that last sentence for proof of that .
Other examples include the flip - flop argument :
I am a mortal being .
Mortal beings die .
Therefore , I am now an immortal being .
This particular argument was originally postulated by John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election .
I consider this a sound argument .
That is to say , I believe it , personally .
Although I will allow that it seems a tad fishy .
You might find the following argument , originally posed by my abusive uncle to his teenage stepson , a bit more useful — if not way more convincing :
I am a mortal being .
Wait , no , I am an immortal being .
Make me a grilled - cheese sandwich , asshole , or I ’ll incinerate your Datsun .
My Uncle Grant is tough to step to in a cage match of the mind ( also , I think he ’s a demigod ) .
You see how he just made a singular point , and then completely reversed his stance on that point , and then threatened his opponent ’s livelihood ?
That is rad , and also known as a non-linear argument , because it does n’t go in a straight line or make any fucking sense whatsoever .
Conversely , there are also linear arguments , which progress logically from point to point , and look something like this , I imagine :
It should be noted that there are n’t just circular and linear arguments , but all sorts of other differently shaped and cleverly named arguments you can use — or that smarter , more vindictive persons than yourself can use against you .
For example , the triangular argument , so named because it has three sides : your significant other ’s , yours , and your significant other ’s :
Honey , you need to take out the trash now .
But I ’m totally kicking that Dragonforce song ’s ass on Guitar Hero !
Now .
Or , the Popeye - Cartesian proof of existence :
I think what I think .
Therefore , I yam what I yam .
Also , there are inductive arguments , which develop their conclusions through inference ( micro to macro , so to speak ) .
These are used both in everyday speech and in scholarly debate , and , like their deductive counterparts , are virtually incontrovertible when executed correctly .
Allow me to demonstrate :
King Crimson still have n’t gotten inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ?
For the love of God !
What do these assholes have against 9/8 time signatures , anyway ?
Pretty tough to argue with something like that , is n’t it ?
Is n’t it ?
DIGG THIS
Why did We The People form a Federal Government — or any government ?
" … to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed … " —
The Declaration of Independence
Can courts — even the Supreme Court —
Make law ?
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .
— Article I , Section , 1 Clause 1 .
If I have 100 % [ All ] of something in one place , how much of it can exist in all other places combined ?
That leaves 0 % .
Could this mean that the Supreme Court cannot make Any law according to the Constitution — or do they have powers that come from somewhere else ?
They have occasionally claimed extra-constitutional powers or " the inherent powers of sovereign nations " or some such other nonsense .
According to the Declaration , their " just powers " come " from the [ informed ] consent of the governed . "
Since the Supreme Court Justices take an Oath to the Constitution they are duty bound to recognize the separation of powers that was so carefully crafted into it .
They are only lawfully authorized to settle Cases that are lawfully brought before them .
Even Lincoln believed that — or at least he said he did .
We The People , through our agents , the States of the Union , formed the federal government to protect our lives and our property , and to do all other lawful acts within the bounds of their jurisdiction and the specific written set of instructions found in Article I , Section 8 .
Then ,
We and the States of the Union , retained all of the rights that were not explicitly surrendered .
Therefore if anything is indefinite it would be the expanse of our retained rights — and Not the limited , delegated , enumerated , specific , separate and distinct powers conferred upon government .
Those five terms prescribing the bounds of the lawful powers of government are prominent in the writings of the Founders and Framers .
Imagine how constricted the powers of the federal government really are , under written law , when all five of these principles are consistently integrated .
To say the People were giving government a license to meddle with our unalienable rights goes so far beyond stupidity and a lack of legal scholarship .
It is as disingenuous as it is seditious and treacherous .
This would leave no reason for any written compact of government — and certainly no reason for going through the formalities of taking Oaths .
It is tantamount to saying the government was formed to destroy the fundamental liberties of the People at its caprice .
It is quite appropriate to say we only lend certain limited powers to government and reserve the right to take them back when they are abused .
In the Virginia Declaration of Rights we read , " … all power is vested in , and consequently derived from , the people ; that magistrates are their trustees and servants , and at all times amenable to them … "
Notice that All lawful power flows Down from the People through their Counties and States , and finally to something that should seem very far away and less relevant to their daily experience — the Federal Government .
It is the Creature of the People and the States .
As a Creature it is Lawfully Amenable to its Creators .
Once again we see a 100 % statement that leaves no plausible source for extra-constitutional powers .
To understand what is happening we need to familiarize ourselves with the term " Sophistry " : Fallacious Reasoning — Sound in Appearance Only !
Another related term that belongs to the murky lexicon of legalese is " Dictum " — which refers to many things that judges say when they probably ought to be more discreet .
A nicer way to put it might be , " a judge ’s expression of opinion on a point other than the precise issue involved in determining a case . "
Even this definition is infected with some sophistry .
When a judge is speaking in Dictum his opinion carries no more weight than any ordinary layman or citizen — and it has no force of law .
As Mencken said , " A judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers . "
Why did we Ratify a Bill of Rights ?
" … in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers , that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added :
And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government , … " — Preamble to the Bill of Rights
The ratification documents of the States are more specific and detailed , and leave no doubt that the Federal Government was / is bound to be amenable to them and We The People , since they were the Agents through which the People created the Federal Government .
Preambles have no force of law — but they are relevant to our understanding of Intent .
The word , " Amenable " is another very interesting word .
It does not mean the government only has to sit and listen to us and then it can do as it pleases .
It means that All remedies must be maintained Sacrosanct .
In other words , it means all necessary operations for correcting errors must be constructively available to the States and the People collectively and individually at all times .
It means you ought to be able to get swift Justice for any and every violation of the Constitution — along with policies put in place to maintain Constitutional checks and balances .
It means the government ought to be Accountable .
Amenability " at all times " means , among other things , that there are No Emergency Powers , No Executive Orders , and No Judge - Made Laws that can affect or infringe the God -Given Rights of We The People or Me the Individual .
That is what We signed up for !
If you ever had a Right to Keep and Bear Arms — you have it now — and Government can Never take it from you Lawfully .
It is unalienable , and it is necessary to protect your own life and property , and the lives and property of your family and neighbors — even the Union — against all enemies foreign and domestic .
The notion that certain weapons are not suited to personal protection is also sophistry that preys upon gross ignorance .
You need such weapons as can overcome every potential enemy .
If you need to shoot 12 attackers you will need more than a 9 - round clip .
Another consumer note : Governments at all levels have been excused by the courts from any legal obligation to protect you or me .
That ’s right !
If you are murdered in your bed right next to the police station after you had been dialing 911 for three hours , you will have no standing in court against the police department .
Logically speaking … who does that leave to protect you ?
Could it be You ?
Not really .
It could also include any voluntary association of citizens engaging in lawful behavior .
It might also include your County Sheriff , his Deputies , or the Militia .
The Founding generation would be astounded to know how naïve we have become if we expect the police will be able to adequately protect us .
Statistically we need even more protection in densely populated areas where there are more policemen per capita .
If we had read the Founders and Framers more often we would not be so easily taken in by sophistry .
Gun control sophistry can be most deadly .
What happens to an unarmed populace when their own government decides to murder them ?
What sort of government is to be feared in this regard ?
How about Any government — especially one that is growing like a Metastasizing Tumor both Internationally and Domestically ?
I just did a search to see how the current DC gun case is going in the Supreme Court .
One of the headlines said , " US high court considers landmark gun-rights case " :
… The court ’s ruling , expected by the end of June , could have a far - reaching impact on gun control laws in the United States , estimated to have the world ’s highest civilian gun ownership rate , and could become an issue in the November election …
Please follow that link above and read every word very carefully .
The Media is engaging in Sophistry in anticipation of Dictum .
Do they realize what they are doing ?
It is interesting that this version is tailored for African consumption .
The source is Reuters : Africa .
I would be more comfortable with an international Media that recognized the Unalienable Right to Keep and Bear Arms as universal rather than uniquely American or archaic .
Is it possible that the country with " the world ’s highest civilian gun ownership rate " is also the most free ?
Look around the world .
What do you see ?
The Congress , not the Court , has Plenary Jurisdiction over the Seat of Government [ called Washington , DC ] .
To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the Acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States , … — Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17
Once again we see a 100 % situation indicative of the separation of powers .
Considering the above Clause , how much power does the Court have to Legislate for the District ?
The answer once again : Zero !
Also realize the title of the article is in itself very misleading .
We have no " High Court " under the Constitution .
High Courts , so - called , are appropriately called that because they are instituted in countries with no protections for unalienable rights .
In the portion quoted above there is a glaring error : the writer not only assumes the Supremes make law .
He also assumes they can overrule existing laws within the States of the Union .
Thus a non-lawmaking body can strike down laws in foreign jurisdictions !?
Now that would be " far reaching impact ! "
Do you see how much the MSM is trying to help these people ?
Rousseau once asked why the Spanish Conquistadores needed to risk their lives traveling across the seas to plant flags in the sands of American shores , in order to claim those lands , which were already inhabited by other peoples , for their Monarch .
He mused that if the king had such a right , he might just as well have declared the transaction Consummated from his sitting room .
The States of the Union are Not within the original Jurisdiction of the United States as it pertains to the Congress or the Court .
And it does n’t matter how many wicked precedents exist from the time of John Marshall and Alexander Hamilton forward .
A Million wrongs will never make a Right .
The longer it takes to correct this Obscenity — the closer we are to absolute judicial tyranny .
The understanding above is radical — and it was firmly held many other radicals including Jefferson and Madison .
But it was common sense when the Constitution was ratified in 1788 .
Here ’s a deal for you :
If you do n’t want to retain your God -Given Right to Keep and Bear Arms , just make an Affidavit and sign it over to me .
You say you would never do that ?
I say you can never Lawfully do that .
It is an Unalienable Right .
You ca n’t get rid of it .
You can deny it at your own peril — and then face God and say , " It just did n’t make sense to me not to trust my own government , when the only thing I had to go on was all of recorded history . "
“ If men , through fear , fraud or mistake , should in terms renounce or give up any essential natural right , the eternal law of reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation .
The right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty , it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave . ” — Samuel Adams
Slaves are unarmed and prisoners are disarmed .
Free men have the weapons of their own free choice without government infringement .
Guns Don’t Kill People — Governments
Do !
It is a disturbing contemplation that you may ultimately be forced to choose to be murdered by your own government rather than to live as a slave .
And it has happened many times in recent history .
It is not just a historic anomaly .
Forewarned is Forearmed .
As the saying goes , " I would rather be judged by twelve than carried by six . "
The Supreme Court should be Impeached and Removed en masse if they utter a single word alluding to any lawful power to touch our God-Given Right to Keep and Bear Arms .
This would include any Dictum or Sophistry inferring that a ruling in a case brought in DC could set a precedent overruling so - called gun laws within any of the States of the Union .
A unanimous decision against a God -Given Right would only confirm their unanimity in Sedition .
But it would still be a Nullity Constitutionally speaking .
If the Court has no authority to rule on the matter — why is the case being brought before them ?
Click here to hear another point of view from one of America ’s leading Constitutional Scholars : Dr. Edwin Vieira .
We The People are even more responsible than the courts for the Restoration of this Republic and its Constitution and Bill of Rights with which we have become so unfamiliar .
They which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other held a weapon .
— Nehemiah 4:17
We The People have No God-Given Right to Surrender our Arms !

About the author
( NewsTarget ) You Thought MSG Was Bad ?
At least they admit that it's in there ... well , mostly .
Have you picked up a can of soup lately and noticed that the sodium levels are lower ?
Seen a label that said , " No MSG " ?
How about realizing that there is less sugar on the label of your favorite ice cream ?
Believe it or not , this is cause for concern .
This article has been especially hard to compose .
" Why ? " , you may ask .
There is simply not much information to be found on the subject .
It has taken weeks of internet research to uncover the smidgeon of information that has been acquired .
A relatively young company , Senomyx , may be responsible for the sodium and sugar levels falling in your favorite grocery store item .
How are they doing this without affecting the taste ?
The truth is , they may be putting chemicals into your food right now without you even realizing it and without telling you .
And guess what ?
They do n't have to .
Senomyx has contracted with Kraft , Nestle , Coca Cola , Campbell Soup to put a chemical in foods that masks bitter flavors by turning off bitter flavor receptors on the tongue and enhancing salty and sweet flavors .
This would allow the companies to tout claims such as " less sugar " or " lower sodium " by reducing the actual sugar and / or salt by approximately half , but the foods will retain the same level of sweetness or saltiness when they touch the tongue by fooling your brain .
All of the companies , although admitting the exclusive contracting rights , decline to identify which foods and beverages the chemical additives have been or will be added to .
These chemical compounds are not required to be listed separately on food labels .
On the contrary , they will be lobbed under the umbrella of " artificial flavors " which is already found on most food labels .
The foods that seem to be most in jeopardy of an insurrection of these new chemicals : soups , juices ( fruit and vegetable ) , ice cream , and sauces .
" We are helping companies clean up their labels , " said Kent Snyder , chief executive of Senomyx .
Mark Zoller , Senomyx 's chief scientist , says that his company has used the human genome sequence and identified hundreds of taste receptors .
Senomyx 's chemical compounds enhance those receptors to heighten the taste of salt or sugar .
Under this premise , they go on to claim that their newly added chemicals are completely safe because they will be used in tiny quantities of less than one part per million whereas artificial sweeteners are used in 200 - 500 parts per million .
This fact alone allows them to forgo the rigorous FDA approval process when introducing new food additives into the marketplace .
Attaining the status of GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) from the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association for their most advanced product that replaces MSG , took this fledgling company less than an 18 month time frame by introducing a safety study of rats conducted for 3 months .
Executive Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , Michael Jacobson , commended Senomyx 's strides to reduce MSG , salt , and sugar but warned against introducing a new chemical additive into the food supply without strenuous testing .
" A three - month study is completely inadequate , " he said .
" What you want is at least a two - year study on several species of animals .
" After pouring a total of 30 million dollars into research and development , the companies that have invested into Senomyx 's products have been secretive , to say the least , about their involvement within the company .
Some , like Kraft , have declined to divulge any specifics regarding their relationship with Senomyx but instead stated that Kraft was committed " to reducing the sugar and salt levels in many products .
" Nestle and Coca Cola declined to comment .
I think silence says it all .

Following a youtube video that shows " message to scientology " anonymous released a message directed to followers of scientology .
With having over a million hits , here is the video .
" Hello , Scientology .
We are Anonymous .
Over the years , we have been watching you .
Your campaigns of misinformation ; suppression of dissent ; your litigious nature , all of these things have caught our eye .
With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation , the extent of your malign influence over those who trust you , who call you leader , has been made clear to us .
Anonymous has therefore decided that your organization should be destroyed .
For the good of your followers , for the good of mankind -- for the laughs -- we shall expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form .
We acknowledge you as a serious opponent , and we are prepared for a long , long campaign .
You will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic .
Your methods , hypocrisy , and the artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell .
You cannot hide ; we are everywhere .
We cannot die ; we are forever .
We 're getting bigger every day -- and solely by the force of our ideas , malicious and hostile as they often are .
If you want another name for your opponent , then call us Legion , for we are many .
Yet for all that we are not as monstrous as you are ; still our methods are a parallel to your own .
Doubtless you will use the Anon 's actions as an example of the persecution you have so long warned your followers would come ; this is acceptable .
In fact , it is encouraged .
We are your SPs .
Gradually as we merge our pulse with that of your " Church " , the suppression of your followers will become increasingly difficult to maintain .
Believers will wake , and see that salvation has no price .
They will know that the stress , the frustration that they feel is not something that may be blamed upon Anonymous .
No -- they will see that it stems from a source far closer to each .
Yes , we are SPs .
But the sum of suppression we could ever muster is eclipsed by that of the RTC .
Knowledge is free .
We are Anonymous .
We are Legion .
We do not forgive .
WE DO NOT FORGET .
Expect us . "
This was then followed by the appearance of numerous new messages from anonymous on youtube .
You can view all of them , just search for " scientology " and " anonymous "
Here 's a second message as posted at http://calloftheday.com/
To the common Scientologists ,
We are Anonymous .
You have seen our actions , both online and in your cities .
We do not threaten you , the people .
We threaten the lies , the corruption and the greed of the organization .
We have not acted upon a whim , but in outrage of the treatment of its followers ...
You .
You have not been given freedom by these people .
They have restricted you .
There is a realm of the internet you have not dared to face ,
because they said so , and because they have stopped you by technological means .
There are those who have left your community .
They have seen the facts behind the leader and the original intent of the religion .
Your religious beliefs are not wrong , like any other religion , and they are yours to keep .
However beliefs should not come at a price .
Not from your wallet or compromising your thoughts .
Those who have left feel a new life , a rebirth into true freedom .
You can join them if you wish .
You may not believe us .
We ask of you one thing :
Make up your own mind .
That is a sentence of more profound meaning for you now than at any other time in your life .
Visit the facts .
Make up your own mind .
You are not alone .
This particular website , hosts a forum dedicated to taking down scientology .

Let 's open the floor to Lisa McPherson .
Everyone 's heard of this lady .
Lisa McPherson was involved in a minor car crash on the 18th of November , 1995 .
Lisa emerged from her car , and removed her clothes .
She was seemingly in a mentally unstable state , and was taken to a nearby hospital .
Upon hearing news of this , Lisa 's Scientologist comrades flocked to this hospital , and stated that Lisa does not believe in Psychiatric Help - and would instead prefer to be cared for by the Scientologists themselves .
After a short evaluation , Lisa checked out , and was moved to Room 174 of the Ft. Harrison Hotel .
It was noted by the Church that this was for " rest and relaxation " .
Instead of resting up after what would be considered a mentally draining experience - on someone noted to already be in need of psychiatric help , Lisa would instead be murdered in this room .
On December 5th 1995 , Lisa returned to hospital - dead on arrival .
Coroner 's report ; Lisa was underweight , severely dehydrated , and had bruises and bug bites .
Lisa was one of the many people to receive the Introspection Rundown treatment - Scientology 's alternative to psychiatric help .
Church logs of Lisa 's stay with the scientologists were released following a court hearing during July of 1997 .
However , many logs are incomplete or missing - This affidavit was released by a high ranking ex-scientologist , proving that the Church of Scientology have previously destroyed any logs or information linked to illicit activies / murder - which of course , may land the church in trouble .
On November 13 , 1998 , the Church of Scientology were indicted on 2 felony charges on Lisa 's death .�
On December 6 , 1999 , prosecutor Bernie McCabe presented a response to Scientology 's attempt to get the case dismissed .
� � On June 12 , 2000 the criminal charges were dropped against Scientology because the medical examiner could not be counted on to confidently testify - as the prosecuter claimed .
Even though the criminal charges were abuse of a disabled person and practicing medicine without a license . �
You can read much of the Clearwater police department 's evidence and Scientology 's� logs of Lisa 's stay , view some of the autopsy photos , and decide for yourself .
Then ask why Scientology now makes members sign a waiver specifically against suing Scientology over the Introspection Rundown .
But this website is n't just about Lisa - it 's about everyone involved in the Church of Scientology .
It 's about the misinformed , the misguided , the mentally unstable , the liars , and the murderers . "

When I write and speak about privacy , I am regularly confronted with the mutual disclosure argument .
Explained in books like David Brin's The Transparent Society , the argument goes something like this :
In a world of ubiquitous surveillance , you 'll know all about me , but I will also know all about you .
The government will be watching us , but we 'll also be watching the government .
This is different than before , but it 's not automatically worse .
And because I know your secrets , you can't use my secrets as a weapon against me .
This might not be everybody 's idea of utopia – and it certainly does n't address the inherent value of privacy – but this theory has a glossy appeal , and could easily be mistaken for a way out of the problem of technology 's continuing erosion of privacy .
Except it does n't work , because it ignores the crucial dissimilarity of power .
You cannot evaluate the value of privacy and disclosure unless you account for the relative power levels of the discloser and the disclosee .
If I disclose information to you , your power with respect to me increases .
One way to address this power imbalance is for you to similarly disclose information to me .
We both have less privacy , but the balance of power is maintained .
But this mechanism fails utterly if you and I have different power levels to begin with .
An example will make this clearer .
You 're stopped by a police officer , who demands to see identification .
Divulging your identity will give the officer enormous power over you :
He or she can search police databases using the information on your ID ; he or she can create a police record attached to your name ; he or she can put you on this or that secret terrorist watch list .
Asking to see the officer 's ID in return gives you no comparable power over him or her .
The power imbalance is too great , and mutual disclosure does not make it OK .
You can think of your existing power as the exponent in an equation that determines the value , to you , of more information .
The more power you have , the more additional power you derive from the new data .
Another example :
When your doctor says " take off your clothes , " it makes no sense for you to say , " You first , doc . "
The two of you are not engaging in an interaction of equals .
This is the principle that should guide decision - makers when they consider installing surveillance cameras or launching data - mining programs .
It 's not enough to open the efforts to public scrutiny .
All aspects of government work best when the relative power between the governors and the governed remains as small as possible – when liberty is high and control is low .
Forced openness in government reduces the relative power differential between the two , and is generally good .
Forced openness in laypeople increases the relative power , and is generally bad .
Seventeen - year - old Erik Crespo was arrested in 2005 in connection with a shooting in a New York City elevator .
There 's no question that he committed the shooting ; it was captured on surveillance - camera videotape .
But he claimed that while being interrogated , Detective Christopher Perino tried to talk him out of getting a lawyer , and told him that he had to sign a confession before he could see a judge .
Perino denied , under oath , that he ever questioned Crespo .
But Crespo had received an MP3 player as a Christmas gift , and surreptitiously recorded the questioning .
The defense brought a transcript and CD into evidence .
Shortly thereafter , the prosecution offered Crespo a better deal than originally proffered ( seven years rather than 15 ) .
Crespo took the deal , and Perino was separately indicted on charges of perjury .
Without that recording , it was the detective 's word against Crespo's .
And who would believe a murder suspect over a New York City detective ?
That power imbalance was reduced only because Crespo was smart enough to press the " record " button on his MP3 player .
Why are n't all interrogations recorded ?
Why do n't defendants have the right to those recordings , just as they have the right to an attorney ?
Police routinely record traffic stops from their squad cars for their own protection ; that video record should n't stop once the suspect is no longer a threat .
Cameras make sense when trained on police , and in offices where lawmakers meet with lobbyists , and wherever government officials wield power over the people .
Open - government laws , giving the public access to government records and meetings of governmental bodies , also make sense .
These all foster liberty .
Ubiquitous surveillance programs that affect everyone without probable cause or warrant , like the National Security Agency 's warrantless eavesdropping programs or various proposals to monitor everything on the internet , foster control .
And no one is safer in a political system of control .

What Our Top Spy Does n't Get : Security and Privacy Are n't Opposites
Steal This Wi-Fi
While Pakistan is getting all the attention as the latest US - supported dictatorship to implode , another and even more telling example is President Mikhail Saakashvili ‘s recent clampdown in the former Soviet republic of Georgia .
While the regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf is not a US creation  the General launched a coup all on his own , with official US disapproval  Georgia , you ’ll remember , was the site of the 2003 " Rose Revolution , " one of a series of US - backed - and - funded " color revolutions " and the one often pointed to as a model for future " pro-democracy " campaigns in the former Soviet Union .
As it turned out , however , the supposed " democratic " revolutionaries , once in power , were worse than the despots they ’d overthrown , and Saakashvili is the exemplar of this species : he has declared a " national emergency , " banned the non-state media , forbidden public gatherings , and initiated a reign of terror against his political opponents .
If Vladimir Putin had done this , can you imagine the uproar ?
Anne Applebaum , Gary Kasparov , and the Cato Institute ’s Andrei Illarionov would have a collective cow , and shout , in unison , " See !
We told you so ! "
No doubt they ’d be given ample opportunity to do so by the editorial page editors of the major dailies , while the talking - heads and the radio - shouters would sing the chorus , likening Putin to Stalin .
Yet Putin has done nothing remotely comparable , although Western commentators act as if he had : opposition parties ( and their media outlets ) exist in Russia , including several claimants to the mantle of the old Communist Party of the Soviet Union , and the Kasparov - led " democratic " groups with minuscule memberships and more support in the Western media than among Russian voters .
It ’s hard for them to get on television , they complain : this , to them , is " proof " that Russia is " backsliding " into authoritarianism .
When real authoritarianism rears its head elsewhere in the former Soviet republics , however , we hear practically nothing from these people , and for a very simple reason : Saakashvili and his gang are " pro-Western . "
That is , they were installed in power by the Americans , who directed the roseate " revolutionaries " from Washington , paid the " revolutionaries " in US tax dollars , and continued to pour money into the resulting regime  in spite of numerous indications that Saakashvili and his party were no more " democratic " or less thuggish than their post - communist predecessors .
Putin is supposed to have been the guiding hand behind the murders of Anna Politkovskaya , Alexander Litvinenko , and a platoon of others  including the attempted murder by poisoning of Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko  in spite of the fact that no solid evidence has ever surfaced linking the Kremlin to those crimes .
Yet when the pro-Western Saakashvili is credibly accused of murder by his former defense minister , the silence from the Russophobic " human rights " crowd is deafening .
Predictably , the Saakashvili government accuses the opposition of being in league with the Russian secret services : it ’s all a plot by Putin to overthrow the government and subvert Georgian sovereignty .
This has been the line taken by Saakashvili and his supporters for years , and yet the accusation is wearing thin  especially when several former members of his own party , including ex-ministers , have joined the opposition ’s denunciation of his developing dictatorship .
George W. Bush ’s trip to Tbilisi , in 2005 , in tandem with his trip to Latvia , was carefully choreographed to underscore Russia ’s encirclement , and play up the widening gulf between the US and Putin ’s Russia .
As Bush stood next to Saakashvili in Tbilisi ’s " Freedom Square , " he intoned : " I am proud to stand beside a President who has shown such spirit , determination , and leadership in the cause of freedom . "
One has to wonder : is he still proud , even as Georgian policemen beat protesters in the streets and the Georgian media faces lockdown ?
As police batons crack open Georgian heads , the US State Department calls for " constructive dialogue " !
How one engages in " dialogue " of any sort with an armed thug who is about to swing his baton at you is a mystery known only to the US State Department , which has so far neglected to offer an unequivocal condemnation of the crackdown  and I would n’t hold my breath waiting for it , either .
As a key link in the security fence going up around the former Soviet Union , designed to keep the Russians in their place , Georgia gets millions from the West in " foreign aid , " including military aid , and is angling for NATO membership , with American support .
I particularly liked this description of the US aid program as explicated by some anonymous bureaucrat :
" Democracy programs in Georgia improve public sector transparency and accountability at both the national and local levels ; advance the rule of law ; ensure broad public participation in political life ; and promote national integration and peace building .
U.S. assistance will support the development of a national strategy and action plan to promote national integration and tolerance will include support for democracy , confidence , and peace building efforts , including support to civil society and an independent media . "
Gee , those programs sure worked well , did n’t they ?
After all , now that the Georgian ruling party has closed down the media , arrested their political opponents , beaten and threatened oppositionists with death  when they did n’t actually off them  Saakashvili and his cohorts are calling for early elections , including a referendum on continued " emergency " rule .
Now that ‘s " democracy " in action  arrest the opposition , and then call an election .
In recent testimony before Congress regarding FY 2008 foreign aid budgeting , Randall L. Tobias , director of foreign assistance and administrator of USAID , claimed that the US assistance program is a " success story . "
Georgia , along with Ukraine and Moldova  two countries that have recently moved into the US orbit  are described as being " at the forefront of reform , " while Russia and Belarus are " countries that present democratic challenges . "
One wonders what the Ambassador will make of the " democratic challenges " posed by Saakashvili ’s assumption of dictatorial powers .
My guess : it ’ll be business as usual .
The US has been busy arming the Georgians , supposedly against a " terrorist threat , " and yet the real objective  to provoke the Russians  is ill - concealed .
A great deal of military equipment paid for by US taxpayers has , somehow , wound up in some very dubious hands , as documented here .
Meanwhile , a recently privatized US military presence in Georgia is cause for concern : did Cubic , a private military contractor akin to Blackwater , provide training and other assistance to Georgian police and military units that are now beating , jailing , and killing the regime ’s opponents ?
The " colored revolutions " sponsored by the US , and hailed by Washington ’s amen corner in the media as the vanguard of " democracy " and " civil society , " were and are nothing but cynical manipulations designed to advance US geo-strategic interests .
The idea is to encircle Putin , cut off routes for Russian oil to flow freely to energy - starved Europe , and strangle a resurgent Russia in its cradle before it has a real chance to mount a credible challenge to American hegemony .
As the police beat oppositionists , break into private media outlets and forbid public gatherings , the US stands silently by : but that silence speaks volumes .
The Washington Post reports that opposition leader Tina Khidasheli " blamed the violence in part on the United States ’ unconditional support ’ for Georgia ’s ruling party , adding that she thought her country ’s leadership would have respected the rule of law more if US officials had insisted it be upheld .
 For four years they did not question anything Saakashvili was doing , ’ she said .
 Beacon of democracy ?
The shining of democracy was in the streets today . ’"
US aid to Georgia should be ended , pronto : not one more penny for the tinpot tyrant Saakashvili .
US personnel in the country , including diplomats as well as military personnel , should be withdrawn .
We either support the crackdown , or we oppose it : there is no middle ground , and no good reason why US taxpayers must be forced to subsidize Saakashvili ’s dictatorship .
Furthermore , this ought to effectively put an end to talk of Georgia entering NATO and / or the EU .
These are , after all , unions of supposedly liberal democracies .
As tanks roll through the streets of Tbilisi , the bloom is off the Rose Revolution for good .
Let this noxious weed wilt of its own accord , without one more drop of sustenance from Bush , the great cultivator of " democracy . "
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I have to note that this conference , which featured alleged " libertarians " collaborating with and providing a platform for officials of the Saakashvili regime , seems , in retrospect , like a major mistake .
" Freedom , Commerce , and Peace " was the alleged topic of the conference ’s concerns : now that Georgia has none of these things , thanks to their pal Saakashvili , one wonders what public comment the Cato Institute will have  if any .
Is there still money to be made from “ Matlock ” ?
Within the last few months , television distributors have opened up their libraries of classic content online , making thousands of episodes of programs like “ The Twilight Zone ” and “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” available free .
On Monday , Warner Brothers is expected to add a new twist , announcing the rebirth of the WB broadcast network as an Internet destination and offering programs like “ Everwood ” online .
In putting old episodes online , broadcasters are tapping into the “ long tail ” of niche content that the Internet has monetized .
While executives are reticent about the costs involved , and while syndicated and DVD sales remain dominant sources of revenue , the repurposing of long - dead shows is creating another new revenue stream for distributors .
The online re-creation of the WB  a network that disappeared in 2006 when it merged with UPN to become the CW  will represent another step in that direction .
While Warner Brothers would not confirm the plans , preferring to wait until a press conference on Monday , Bruce Rosenblum , the president of the company ’s television group , said in an interview last week that “ premium ad - supported digital destinations that are demographic - specific ” are a key part of its strategy going forward .

Update at bottomUpdate 2 for Saikuro reported cyclomatic complexity Update 3 for FlogI despise metaprogrammed tests .
The problem with metaprogrammed tests is that they introduce more questions than answers .
Tests are supposed to give confidence , but I do n't feel very confident when I find myself asking : which assertion failed ?
what part of the test is wrong ?
in which loop , at what value , do you think the problem is ?
Let 's jump straight to an example .
The following method on Fixnum will tell you what the letter grade is .
For completeness you may wish to test every value between 0 and 100 to ensure that no mistakes are made .
Doing this the most straight forward way possible , you would define 101 tests and test every value individually .
While this would work it suffers from a few complications : it 's too long to digest and it would be painfully tedious to write .
You might jump to the conclusion that you ought to metaprogram the tests to resolve the previously mentioned issues .
This solution is n't so bad at first glance .
When a test fails , I can see what number I was working with , what letter I expected and what letter I actually got .
Then I have to actually figure out what is wrong , and this is where I begin to really dislike metaprogrammed tests .
The line number is almost worthless .
Yes , the loop is on or near that line , but the actual failure is n't found exclusively on that line , it also contains about 100 successful assertions .
Also , I always expect the problem to be in the class , but that 's not always the case .
Metaprogramming in tests is just as susceptable to mistakes as programming the domain .
Yet , by instinct we always look there last , because we expect our tests to give us confidence , they should be correct .
The example code is easy enough to follow , but most metaprogrammed tests contain more complexity , thus leading to even more fragile and fear instilling tests .
Also , if you find yourself wanting to defend metaprogrammed tests , ask yourself if you usually even provide as many clues as I have .
Do you create test names that help you figure out what the problem was ?
Do you first get the letter and then compare it , or do you assert true and false , yielding even less information .
If you do n't give me at least as much information as I 've given myself in my example , I can't even begin to imagine trying to find out what 's wrong with a broken test .
The single largest problem with metaprogrammed tests is that they 've unnecessarily added complexity to your test suite .
This complexity reduces the maintainability of tests , ensuring that they are less likely to be maintained .
There is a better way .
You can approach the problem differently and still provide a concise solution .
Looking at our issue another way , we simply want to test that certain values return A , B , C , D , or F .
To me , that appears like I need 5 different tests , not 101 .
Here 's what I consider to be a more maintainable solution .
The above tests should be readable to anyone very quickly .
They correctly provide the line number of a failing test when a test fails .
Also , each test verifies only one piece of logic , greatly reducing complexity .
Lastly , I can easily see in the test that it 's written correctly , so any errors must be resulting from a mistake in the domain .
These tests instill more confidence and they are easier to digest and therefore maintain .
These are tests that are more likely to live on and provide value .
These are tests I thank my teammates for .
Tammer Saleh correctly points out that the failure message for my last example would actually be worse than the failure message from the metaprogrammed tests .
I was aware of that fact when I wrote up the entry , but I was unsure how to address the issue .
If I were on a project I would write a custom assertion for expectations that would give me a descriptive error message while also allowing me to easily test what I want .
That custom assertion would be well tested and could be designed to be general enough to apply across my entire test suite , thus infinitely more valuable than metaprogramming that only solves a problem for a specific test .
But , this is n't a project , it 's an example .
Still , I failed , I did n't give the complete answer .
This is my attempt to resolve that situation .
As I said , on a project I would use expectations , but for the purpose of this entry , I 'll provide a custom assertion that could be easily used with test / unit .
The general solution is that I have an enumerable object and I want to verify the result of calling a method on each element of the enumerable .
Thus , I should be able to create a general assertion that takes my expected single result , the enumerable , and the block that should be executed on each element .
If all elements return actual results that match the expected value then the test passes .
However , if any element does not return the expected value , then the expected value , the actual value , and the element are all described in the error message .
The error message will contain all failures , not just the first one that fails .
Below is the code in full , but the following code would not be enough if this were a real project .
Instead , if this were a real project this custom assertion should be tested with the same amount of effort that you put into testing any domain concept .
Additionally , here 's the results from a failing test .
I would take this solution over any metaprogrammed solution I can think of .
I decided to check out what the cyclomatic complexity would look like for defining tests in a loop compared to traditional definitions with custom assertions .
I used Saikuro to give me cyclomatic complexity results .
Interestingly , the complexity of the looping test definition ( 8 ) is more than the complexity of the logic added to Fixnum ( 6 ) .
It 's also double the complexity of the custom assertion version ( 4 ) of the tests .
The custom assertion also registers a score of 4 , but that does n't concern me since I 'll test the custom assertion .
For those interested in running the experiment the code I used can be found below .
I defined a class method and called it explicitly because Saikuro reports complexity on a method basis , so I needed a method for it measure .
Update 3 Since I ran Saikuro on the code , it only made sense to put it through Flog also .
The following code was flogged .
The flog score of the looping version was 15.3 , the score of the custom assertion version was 6.5 .
Both Saikuro and Flog marked the looping test definition with warnings and as a potential problem .
Ms. Carlson said she understood what was at stake .
“ I can not deny that my child can put someone else at risk , ” she said .
In 1991 , less than 1 percent of children in the states with personal - belief exemptions went without vaccines based on the exemption ; by 2004 , the most recent year for which data are available , the percentage had increased to 2.54 percent , said Saad B. Omer , an assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
While nationwide over 90 percent of children old enough to receive vaccines get them , the number of exemptions worries many health officials and experts .
They say that vaccines have saved countless lives , and that personal - belief exemptions are potentially dangerous and bad public policy because they are not based on sound science .
“ If you have clusters of exemptions , you increase the risk of exposing everyone in the community , ” said Dr. Omer , who has extensively studied disease outbreaks and vaccines .
It is the absence , or close to it , of some illnesses in the United States that keep some parents from opting for the shots .
Worldwide , 242,000 children a year die from measles , but it used to be near one million .
The deaths have dropped because of vaccination , a 68 percent decrease from 2000 to 2006 .
“ The very success of immunizations has turned out to be an Achilles ’ heel , ” said Dr. Mark Sawyer , a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Rady Children ’s Hospital in San Diego .
“ Most of these parents have never seen measles , and do n’t realize it could be a bad disease so they turn their concerns to unfounded risks .
They do not perceive risk of the disease but perceive risk of the vaccine . ”
Dr. Sawyer and the vast majority of pediatricians believe strongly that vaccinations are the cornerstone of sound public health .
Many doctors view the so - called exempters as parasites , of a sort , benefiting from the otherwise inoculated majority .

$ 1 Image Stabilizer For Any Camera ( video ) - [ technology ]
08:38 PM EST - Jan, 29 2008 - post a comment
This instructional video shows you how to build your own stabilizer in 5 minutes for less than $ 1 .
It is super light weight and folds up small enough to fit in your pocket .
With this stabilizer , you can hand - hold your camera with shutter speeds at least 3 stops slower than without .
It works just as well with video camera
Wow .
Seriously , that 's the first time I 've ever seen one of those videos that was actually practical and realistic !
Apparently my whole Book People / fat girl incident story made it to the front page of Reddit somehow .
Yay .
I have no idea how this happened , and frankly I hope it never does again .
Now there are dozens of people discussing what a judgmental " hipster douchebag fattie " I am and how the woman who insulted me was " just telling the truth " and how I should be okay with that .
There are even people who have decided I made the whole thing up -- apparently I 'm too good a writer to be telling the truth .
Wow .
It 's invited a lot of very nice comments -- thank you , everyone who stopped by to read that post and enjoyed it .
Unfortunately it's also brought out of the woodwork some ... well , assholes , to be blunt .
So I 'm disabling comments on that post .
I do n't run this blog for random click - by invective from people who do n't know or care about Wicca but just want someone to feel superior to .
This is my blog -- it exists for me to feel superior .
* laugh *
And just to set the record straight : at no time have I ever said I was n't judgmental .
I am highly judgmental .
I am prone to snap assumptions about people just like everyone else .
This is what happens when you 're a human being .
Also : the phrase en flambe is French .
Typically when you use foreign phrases in English writing you italicize them .
It was n't supposed to indicate emphasis .
Of all the shit to pick on about that story , that was kind of weak .
Furthermore : Comparing two things is not the same as equating them .
If I compare thee to a summer 's day that does n't mean you are a summer 's day .
Comparing racism to sizeism is not saying one is Bigger Badder Oppression than the other .
All forms of hatred and oppression diminish us .
Similar and identical are not synonyms .
And :
When you 're commenting on someone 's blog and want to be taken seriously , you might try things like grammar and using the shift key , and not COMMENTING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A SIXTH - GRADER .
That 's all I have to say about that .
We now return to our regularly scheduled hipster douchebag fattie programming .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 March 14
Explanation : Blasting into a dark night sky , the Space Shuttle Endeavour began its latest journey to orbit in the early morning hours of March 11 .
In this stunning picture following the launch , the glare from Endeavour 's three main rocket engines and flanking solid fuel booster rockets illuminates the orbiter 's tail section and the large , orange external fuel tank .
Embarking on mission STS - 123 , Endeavour left Kennedy Space Center 's pad 39A , ferrying a crew of seven astronauts to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The cargo included the first section of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 's Kibo laboratory and the Canadian Space Agency 's two - armed robotic system .
Astronauts will conduct a series of space walks to install the new equipment during the 16 - day mission , the longest shuttle mission to the ISS .
The lack of jumbo loans has destroyed the CA real estate market .
Without aggressive , affordable jumbo loans , prices will naturally gravitate towards the most available financing , which is Fannie / Freddie $ 417 k loans .
90 % of the most widely used loans in CA over the past several years have vanished in the past 6 months .
The new Fannie / Freddie ' ConJumbos ' carry a rate much too high to complete with the affordibility of the programs that were lost .
Now that all the exotics and jumbos are gone , home prices will also have to gravitate towards borrower qualifications using real household income .
This means that if the average household income in San Francisco Bay Area is $ 85 k , that borrower can qualify for about a $ 350 k loan .
Currently , the average home price is closer to $ 550 k meaning we could have alot further to drop .
Now , that we are back to traditional lending , historical valuation measures must be considered such as 3 - 4 x household income , rental cap rates ect .
As prices drop , defaults natually rise across all borrower types due to the ' negative equity effect ' .
Banks then take more losses , tighten credit further and this never ending snowball cycle continues .

San Francisco Home Sales Fall 41 % Amid Tighter Credit ( Update1 ) 2008-04-17 13:53 ( New York ) By Dan Levy
April 17 ( Bloomberg ) --
Home sales in the San Francisco BayArea dropped 41 percent to the lowest level for a March in more than two decades as stricter mortgage standards reduced the number of potential buyers and prices fell , DataQuick Information Systems Inc. reported .
The number of houses and condominiums sold in San Francisco , Santa Clara , Marin and six other counties fell to 4,898 , the seventh consecutive month that sales reached a record low , La Jolla , California - based DataQuick reported today .
The median price decreased 16.1 percent from a year earlier to $ 536,000 .
Sales are declining as lenders require higher down payments and credit scores and buyers have difficulty obtaining mortgages above $ 417,000 , known as jumbo loans .
The Bay Area median price would have been closer to $ 597,000 last month if jumbo availability had ``remained stable , '' DataQuick said .
" It still appears that a lot of Bay Area activity is just on hold , waiting for the mortgage markets to open back up , '' Marshall Prentice , DataQuick 's president , said in the statement .
Home purchases made with jumbo loans accounted for 29.8 percent of sales in March , down from 62.2 percent a year earlier , said DataQuick , a subsidiary of Vancouver - based MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates , which began collecting the data in 1988 .

The Ithaca Chasma is thought to be a very old structure
Enlarge Image
Tethys is a mid-sized satellite with a density close to that of pure ice .
But a large valley system visible today must have formed when the crust was being heated and under great strain .
The team thinks that tidal heating , followed by cooling which froze Tethys ' ocean , could have formed the giant Ithaca Chasma rift .
Details were presented here at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
Moon mix
Calculations by Erinna Chen and Francis Nimmo , from the University of California , Santa Cruz , show that tidal interactions were the only viable way of providing the amount of heat associated with the formation of Ithaca Chasma .
They propose that Tethys ' orbit around Saturn was once perturbed by gravitational interactions with another moon - Dione - which made Tethys ' orbit more " eccentric " .
The resulting tidal forces caused frictional heating of Tethys ' interior .
But at some point , the orbital interaction between Tethys and Dione was broken , and Tethys fell back into a less eccentric orbit .
As it did so , it began to cool .
Freezing of a liquid ocean would have generated sufficient stresses in the crust to form Ithaca Chasma , the researchers said .
Ocean list
" We have a large rift system that brought water to the surface , so it seems likely that this happened , " Ms Chen explained .
She told the BBC that there was no way of knowing exactly how deep the ocean was , but speculated that it could have been 100 km deep at some point in Tethys ' past .
Tethys joins a club of icy Solar System bodies thought either to have a subsurface ocean today , or to have had one in the distant past .
They include Jupiter 's moons Europa and - potentially - Callisto .
Some researchers also think Saturn 's moon Enceladus could harbour liquid water beneath the surface , although this idea has been called into question recently .

President Bush likes to talk about not being swayed by public opinion , especially the views of Democrats .
At a news conference last December , he said the most important criterion for picking a president is “ whether or not somebody ’s got a sound set of principles from which they will not deviate as they make decisions . ”
Unhappily for the country , we have learned that Mr. Bush has no idea when standing on principle becomes blind stubbornness and then destructive obsession .
So it goes with his choice to run the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , Steven Bradbury .
In a lower job in that office , Mr. Bradbury signed off on two secret legal memos authorizing torture in American detention camps .
The first approved waterboarding , among other things .
When Congress outlawed waterboarding , the other memo assured Mr. Bush that he could ignore the law .
Mr. Bradbury is widely viewed on both sides of the aisle as such a toxic choice that he will never be confirmed .
The Senate has already refused to do so twice .
Still , Mr. Bush clings to this lost cause , snarling the confirmation process for hundreds of nominees and crippling parts of the federal regulatory apparatus .

This certainly is n't the first time it 's been proposed , but it appears that the RIAA is potentially warming up to the idea of a " music surcharge " that would have ISPs pay $ 5 / month in order to allow anyone to share music online .
Just a month ago , we were discussing why this is a bad idea .
First , it 's effectively treating everyone as a criminal , and forcing those who do n't download or share music to subsidize everyone who does .
Second , and much more importantly , .
If there 's anything that the past five years ( and the past year especially ) has taught us , it 's that there are many different ways for musicians to make money without requiring the government to step in and set up a business model for them .
In other words , there 's no compelling need for such a mandated system .
Third , once you do this , it opens up additional questions from other industries .
Will the government need to set up laws that prop up their business models as well ?
Some people are comparing this new RIAA proposal to the one that the EFF proposed four years ago .
However , that one was quite different , in that it was alicensing system , rather than a mandatory one .
In that system , anyone who wanted to could voluntarily pay $ 5 / month to have free reign to share and download music .
This new proposal would mandate that ISPs pay the fee ( meaning that ISPs would quickly pass the costs on to everyone ) .
That 's quite different .
It also might be a different story if ISPsoffered this as a feature for customers -- where they would license the music so anyone could freely share it .
That 's a case where the ISP would effectively be paying for the creation of music and using its free nature as a promotional good for its service .
However , that rationale goes away if it 's mandatory .
So , while it 's nice that the RIAA has woken up ( about a decade too late ) to the idea that new business models are needed , this proposal is n't a very good idea .

… the 14 year - old boys we put in diapers .
Some say it ’s just crazy , goofy teenage fun .
But others , including one boy ’s mother and the Mt. Lebanon School District , are n’t comfortable with it .
The skit took place during the Nov. 29 meeting of the Mt. Lebanon Young Life club , a nondenominational Christian youth group directed by youth minister O.J. Wandrisco .
Laurie Metz , whose 14 - year - old son was one of the boys who took part in the skit , said she found it inappropriate , demeaning and sexually perverse .
Mr. Wandrisco and a national spokesman for Young Life say the skits are all in fun and meant to be used as “ icebreakers ” at the youth group meetings .
“ The skits are designed for one reason and one reason only — for kids to have fun .
It ’s not a dirty joke .
The skits are to break down the walls and let them have fun , ” Mr. Wandrisco said … .
Ms. Metz said at the Nov. 29 Young Life meeting , after her son and two other boys were selected to take part in the skit , they were taken to a rest room by an older teen and given adult diapers , bibs and bonnets and directed to take their clothes off and put the diapers , bibs and bonnets on… .
The boys returned to the group , where they were asked to sit in the laps of three girls .
The girls spoon - fed baby food to the boys and then gave them baby bottles filled with soda pop .
The first boy to finish was the winner .
“ The whole premise of the skit is questionable , ” Ms. Metz said .
“ I see no purpose that it would serve , especially not in a Christian youth group setting .
It ’s perverse . ”
The majority of studies have not found an increased cancer risk
Researchers looked at 500 Israelis who had developed the condition and compared their mobile phone usage with 1,300 healthy controls .
Those who had used the phone against one side of the head for several hours a day were 50 % more likely to have developed a salivary gland tumour .
The research appeared in The American Journal of Epidemiology .
Numerous studies have focused on the risk of tumours among those who use mobile phones , and overwhelmingly found no increased cancer risk .
But researchers at Tel Aviv University say these have tended to focus on brain tumours , and often did not include long - term users .
Cancer of the salivary gland is a very rare condition .
Of the 230,000 cases of cancer diagnosed in the UK for instance annually , only 550 relate to this area .
Mixed messages
Dr Siegal Sadetzki , who led the research , said while mobile phone use in Israel was much heavier than in many other parts of the world , this gave an insight into what the long - term , cumulative impact could be .
Precautions should be taken in order to diminish the exposure and lower the risk for health hazards
Dr Siegal Sadetzki
Tel Aviv University
" Compared to other studies , the amount of exposure to radiofrequency radiation we saw here was much higher .
If you like , you 're seeing what could happen elsewhere ' speeded - up ' in Israel , " she said .
One of the key findings of the study was that heavy users in rural areas had an even higher risk that those in cities , due , the team suggested , to the fact that mobile phones in areas without strong signals need to emit more radiation to work properly .
But Dr Sadetzki stressed one study was not enough to prove a link , and that further research was needed .
Nonetheless , until more evidence became available , a " precautionary " approach was best , she said , particularly when it comes to children 's use of mobile phones .
Despite these latest findings , the largest and longest - running investigation ever to be carried out into mobile phone usage found no increased risk of any sort of cancer .
It followed 420,000 people in Denmark , some of whom had been using a mobile phone for as long as ten years .
There was in fact a lower incidence of cancer than expected in a group of that size , suggesting mobile phones had no impact on the development of tumours .
Last year , the UK's Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme said that while the evidence so far was " reassuring " , there was still a need for studies to examine the very long - term impact , and to look at the effect in children .
Ed Yong , of Cancer Research UK , said : " Mobile phones are a relatively recent invention and new research into any possible health risks is welcome .
" However , it 's important to remember that the vast majority of studies so far have found that mobile phones do not increase the risk of any type of cancer . "
DIGG THIS
During a disastrous week , with the country poised on the brink of financial collapse , the president stumbled through a series of appearances , the impact of which can only be described as ghastly .
Clearly few believe him any more .
And yet , in all the wreckage tumbling around him , he just could n’t muster the moral courage to admit that his war in Iraq had played a major role in the epochal disasters befalling us .
In an event conveniently hidden under the rubble of the mushroom cloud of Bush ’s blunders , the president ’s last - ditch defense of his war in Iraq was finally exposed as a self - serving lie .
" I rely on my commanders on the ground , " he has obsessively and tirelessly recited .
In a way , that made sense : After all , we ca n’t expect this Commander in Chief coherently to justify his own policy , can we ?
Now that latest ignoble lie has been put to rest , with the firing of Admiral William Fallon as the head of Central Command in the Middle East .
Bush ’s diehard fans , groping for some virtue in which to dress their naked emperor , often pretend to celebrate his fortitude .
Apparently , that vaunted virtue failed him this time around .
He assigned to Defense Secretary Gates , a lifelong bureaucrat , the smarmy task of firing Fallon .
Typically , Bush did not have the C. O. Jones to do it himself .
At least Harry Truman , one of Bush ’s many left - wing militarist heroes , fired Douglas MacArthur personally .
But not our own , brave Dear Leader .
Even the most ardent among Bush ’s diminishing faction of supporters — including many who have made tens of millions as War Profiteers — grit their teeth when their Benefactor - in - Chief speaks .
They are all undoubtedly grateful that it was Secretary Gates who smoothly lied through his teeth , insisting that there were no policy differences between Admiral Fallon and the rest of the Defense Department establishment .
The reason is simple : as long as the war goes on , regardless of the kaleidoscope of justifications , the profiteers will continue to reap munificent rewards .
When the war ends , they will have to lop off a zero or two off their incomes , and live normal , peaceful , honest lives — perhaps for the very first time .
God forbid !
Where would they go to lunch ?
Wendy’s ?
Bush ’s supporters have known it for years , of course , but Admiral Fallon ’s firing makes it clear to the rest of us : Bush has not been telling us the truth .
Dick Cheney is the only “ commander on the ground " that he relies on .
Clearly , Bush and Cheney are both spiteful about the resentment and outright contempt that a growing number of Americans now harbor against them .
With that in mind , as he leaves office , Cheney ’s moral compass would have no trouble sticking the country with a war in Iran — to serve his personal agenda , yes , but also to make the next administration look even worse than this one .
" History will vindicate us , " they crow .
Perverse ?
Of course .
But Americans now understand that these are today ’s zeroes , where there once walked heroes .
Admiral Fallon , the last US senior military commander with Viet Nam experience , does not want a wider war .
Bush claims publicly that he embraces the same desire for peace .
But his actions ( as usual ) speak more loudly than his lies .
During the years of Clinton ’s “ I hate the military ” 1990 ’s routine , many promising midlevel officers left military service .
David Petraeus , an intelligent man , stayed on , laid low , and used his smarts to become a political general .
Alas .
He epitomizes the bureaucratic military , who will cover for his boss and do what he is told .
To call him a political general is not a calumny : in fact , some of his strongest supporters insist that he should run for high political office .
Political Petraeus would not demand of Congress that , in order to consummate Bush ’s ( admittedly monstrous ) strategy , he would need a quarter of a million more men in Iraq for three to five years .
In contrast , Admiral Fallon is a truth teller .
Bush reminds me of Paul Simon in the Boxer : “ A man hears what he wants to hear , and disregards the rest . ”
Given political power , such a man will act as an irrational ideologue , hardly fit for leadership — a moral wreckage , the rank carcass of a character .
Yet , for ten more months , the president is free to betray once more his oath of office and start another unconstitutional war .
Bush has failed conservatives in so many ways , but especially in his shell game about the Middle East .
He has sullied our symbols and our principles — liberty , small government , the Constitution , genuine patriotism , love of the fatherland , America ’s position in the world , respect for our family members who have fallen in battle … the list is endless .
What is there that Bush has not destroyed ?
When my father started teaching at Notre dame in 1919 , it was still a Catholic institution .
Lying was still a mortal sin .
Dad used to tell his law students , " if you tell the first lie , you may as well tell the rest . "
It ’s not hard to imagine a young George W. Bush sitting in that class , nudging the guy next to him with a whispered expletive , saying , " Hey , that sure sounds good to me ! "

Soviet leadership had no intention to find out the truth about the death of first man in space
The fate of Yuri Gagarin , the first man in space , is still shrouded in mystery .
Everyone knows that he became the first man on the planet to fly into space , although no one knows how exactly he died .
Conclusions of the governmental committee investigating Gagarin ’s death have not been exposed still .
Soviet leadership had no intention to find out the truth about the death of first man in space
The committee to investigate the death of cosmonaut , test pilot , Soviet Union Hero Yuri Gagarin was established on March 28 , 1968 – the next day after the tragedy .
However , all documents related to the investigation were subsequently classified .
The committee stopped its existence too .
The only official document about the death of Yuri Gagarin is the obituary : “ As a result of catastrophe during a training flight . ”
The obit was signed by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union .
However , the document does not contain a word on the cause of death of Gagarin and his co-pilot , Seregin .
Yuri Gagarin was flying a MiG - 15 jet on March 27 , 1968 .
The five - ton aircraft smashed into pieces as it crashed down .
Several units of Soviet troops were called to search 12 kilometers of the area around the crash site .
Specialists collected over 90 percent of what had been left of the fighter jet .
That is very surprising because they can usually recover only 40 of 60 percent .
The crash site was not found immediately after the tragedy .
Rescuers were searching for Gagarin ’s and Seregin ’s white parachutes .
Authorities originally believed that the two pilots had catapulted themselves .
However , there were no parachutes found .
The crater was found in the woods .
The crash site was encircled six hours later .
Specialists , who examined the site on March 28 , 1968 were shocked .
They found out that the crew of the crashed jet fighter had no parachutes at all .
They found only cords that someone had cut off with a knife .
Version 1 . A terrorist act .
Someone cut the cords off not to let pilots catapult themselves .
Gagarin and Seregin had no chance to survive in the crash .
It was rumored that then - Soviet leader , Leonid Brezhnev , was extremely envious of Gagarin ’s fame , and he ordered to get rid of the cosmonaut .
However , only a few people knew that KGB officers found the missing parachutes three days after the crash .
The parachutes were found in one of the villages nearby .
Locals found the crash site and cut the cords off an stole the parachutes thinking that their fabric could come in handy some day .
Version 1 . A bird .
Members of the committee found a dead bird , a jay , in the crater .
Specialists immediately assumed that Gagarin ’s jet collided with a bird and fell down .
Ornithologists said that the bird was not the reason of the air crash .
They even determined that the jay had been killed by a hawk .
Version 3 . Drunkenness .
Gagarin and Seregin were drunk .
The two pilots had had a couple of shots of vodka two days before the flight .
Neither had alcohol on March 26 .
It is worthy of note that Yuri Gagarin had many reasons to ruin himself by drinking .
Party officials , defense officials , foreign officials , etc – everyone wanted to meet the first man in space and have a drink with him .
Version 4 . Technical malfunction .
The jet , which Gagarin was flying was old and worn - out .
Meteorological services did not check to which extent the weather allowed training flights that day .
MiG -15 had no black boxes .
There were flight recorders on board , but they could only record speed and altitude .
However , Gagarin ’s flight recorder had no paper inside .
Tow radars were supposed to trace the flight .
The radar tracing the altitude of the jet fighter was out of order that day .
The committee determined that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft before it hit the ground .
Version 5 . Human factor .
One of the most respectable researchers of Gagarin ’s tragedy , Lieutenant - General Sergei Belotserkovsky , was certain that MiG - 15 had found itself in the vortex flow caused by another plane .
Version 6 . Weather balloon .
Cosmonaut No.2 , Gherman Titov , believes that Gagarin ’s plane collided with a weather balloon .
Indeed , military men found tens of old weather balloons in the area .
Academician Valentin Glushko believes that the Soviet leadership did not even want to find out the truth about Yuri Gagarin ’s death .

NYT Op / Ed : War rages on as America collapses RAW STORY
Published : Saturday April 12 , 2008

Print This Email This " The U.S. , once the greatest can - do country on the planet , now can't seem to do anything right , " opines the New York Times ' Bob Herbert this morning .
The United States , Herbert says , is a country whose lopsided priorities have resulted in the squandering of resources , energy and manpower on the occupation of Iraq while the shrinking middle class sinks deeper into debt , infrastructure continues to collapse , the country is unable to provide health care for its population , and a post - Katrina New Orleans remains effectively underwater .
EXCERPTS : # The U.S. seems almost paralyzed , mesmerized by Iraq and unable to generate the energy or the will to handle the myriad problems festering at home .
The war will eventually cost a staggering $ 3 trillion or more , according to the Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz .
When he was asked on  Democracy Now !  about who is profiting from the war , he said the two big gainers were the oil companies and the defense contractors .
This is the pathetic state of affairs in the U.S. as we approach the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
Whatever happened to the dynamic country that flexed its muscles after World War II and gave us the G.I. Bill , the Marshall Plan , the United Nations ( in a quest for peace , not war ) , the interstate highway system , the civil rights movement , the womens movement , the finest higher education system the world has known , and a standard of living that was the envy of all ?
The entire article is available to read HERE .
Staff Sgt. Iron quakes with fear at the sound of explosions .
He brawls with other soldiers .
He whines when he does n’t get his way and slows others down when he stops to relieve himself during patrols through hostile territory .
But nobody complains , because when it ’s time to enter a building that might be rigged to explode , or cross a pasture that could conceal a minefield , Iron is at the front of the line , making sure it ’s safe for those who follow .
If it ’s not , Iron will bear the brunt of the blast , along with his best friend , Sgt. Joshua T. Rose , who ranks one level below him .
It ’s an honor Iron enjoys for the dangerous job he does .
It also ensures that charges could be filed against Rose in the unlikely event he ever mistreated Iron -- an 80 - pound German shepherd .
Rose and Iron are one of about 200 canine teams deployed in Iraq , where the bond between soldiers and their dogs is so deep that some handlers have asked to be buried with their canine partners if they are killed together .

On frigid winter nights in the Iraqi desert , Rose shares his cot and sometimes his sleeping bag with Iron to keep him warm .
In the scorching summer heat , he makes sure Iron has enough water before taking his own share .
If the heat is too much for Iron , who has a thick coat of glossy black fur , Rose lets him rest , no matter what the platoon leader might want .
Whenever he goes on a mission , Rose tucks a copy of an ode to police and military dogs into his front pocket .
It reads in part : “ Trust in me , my friend , for I am your comrade .
I will protect you with my last breath .
When all others have left you and the loneliness of the night closes in , I will be at your side . ”
“ These dogs are like our children .
I ’m closer to my dog than I am to anyone other than my wife , ” said Staff Sgt. Charles W. Graves , the kennel master at Forward Operating Base Kalsu , about 20 miles southeast of Baghdad .
Graves works with Udo , a yellow Labrador retriever who holds the rank of sergeant 1st class , one higher than Graves .
He is the fifth dog Graves has been teamed with .

Graves adopted his first dog after it retired from active duty .
The dog died at age 16 , from a heart attack while chasing a cat .
His fourth dog was aggressive and liked to bite , nothing like Udo , who is a specialized search dog .
That means he is n’t aggressive and can run off his leash , wearing a vest that holds a radio through which Graves issues commands .
“ If something ever happened to him , I ’d never work canine again , ” Graves said as Udo did a practice run across a field dotted with remnants of once - lethal explosives and other weapons .

Handlers are expected to keep their dogs “ on odor ” by putting them through such training every month , to ensure they do n’t lose the ability to detect TNT , C4 , AK - 47s , wires , metal and the other threats that insurgents have planted across Iraq .
“ If they took him out , I ’d kinda wish they ’d take me out too , ” Graves , a former police officer from Oroville , Calif. , said as Udo loped nearby .
With each successful find , Udo was rewarded with a toss of his favorite toy , a rubber cone .
“ It ’s a helluva thing , owing your life to a dog , ” Graves said .
Before each deployment , troops are asked to update their wills .
Graves included a request to be buried with Udo should they die together .
It has happened before .
Last July , Cpl. Kory D. Wiens , 20 , and his Labrador retriever , Cooper , became the first soldier - dog team killed since Vietnam .
They were buried side by side in Wiens ’ hometown of Dallas , Ore .

If you spend time with the soldier - dog teams , it becomes clear that the key to being a successful canine handler is to love dogs and to adapt to their childlike needs .
“ If you deal well with kids , you ’ll deal well with dogs , ” said Rose , who has a husky and a dachshund back home in Kansas .
“ You ’re working with about a 3 - year - old mentality . ”
Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Blake T. Soller knows that all too well .
Last April , his 4 - year - old dog , Pluto , could n’t resist leaping over the side of a cargo ship into New York Harbor , 60 feet below .
Soller jumped in after Pluto and stayed with the 87 - pound Belgian Malinois until a Navy boat picked them up .
Neither was injured .
The U.S. military has used dogs in combat zones since World War II and deployed about 4,300 to Vietnam between 1965 and 1973 .

According to the military , 281 died in the line of duty there , but hundreds more died after the war ended and U.S. troops departed .
Back then , there were no provisions for military dogs to be adopted when their careers were over .
Most were euthanized or left behind to uncertain fates .
That changed in 2000 , with a law allowing retired military dogs to be put up for adoption at the Military Working Dog center at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas .
They range from small breeds such as beagles to hulking hounds .
Since the start of the Iraq war , about 1,000 dogs have passed through the combat zone , and three , including Cooper , have been killed in action .
Handlers say dogs are crucial for sniffing out the roadside bombs that are responsible for most soldier casualties , and for smelling wires that indicate booby - trapped buildings .
They also search for drugs and illegal weapons at border crossings and checkpoints , chase down suspected insurgents and hunt for human remains .
Advertisement
And for the first time , the military has sent dogs into a war zone to serve as therapy for troops .
Last month , two black Labradors arrived in Iraq to work with stressed - out soldiers .
A canine does n’t have to be a therapy dog to be therapeutic , though .
On a chilly winter ’s day , as troops prepared for a mission in southern Arab Jabour , southeast of Baghdad , attention was focused on Pluto and Iron , not on the dangers ahead .
Rose scratched Iron ’s ears .
Pluto stood on his hind legs and leaned into Soller ’s chest , like a dance partner .
Other soldiers stood around in full battle gear , talking about their own dogs back home .
Until several weeks ago , the region was in the hands of Sunni Muslim extremists loyal to Al Qaeda in Iraq .
A U.S. bombing campaign drove many of them out , but they left behind roads and buildings laden with explosives , and orchards littered with buried ordnance and weapons .

“ I ’ve had people say , ‘ It ’s a good thing you ’re in the Navy , because that means you ’re not on the front lines , ’ ” said Soller as he and Pluto led the way down an eerily quiet dirt road lined with houses tucked back among high grass and fruit trees .
“ It does n’t get any more front line than this .
My job is to clear the way so the rest of the guys can get there . ”
Soller , who used to train hunting dogs in Indiana , was tapped to attend canine handling school as a reward for exemplary service in the Navy .
Rose , whose father was a police canine handler back home in Virginia , asked to attend the school after earning high marks from a platoon sergeant .
The biggest mistake handlers make is being impatient , Rose said as Iron veered to the side of the road and lifted his leg .
The rest of the patrol slowed to avoid getting ahead of the canine team .

Visits to two homes , including a lavish villa overlooking the reedy banks of the Tigris River , showed how having dogs in the mix can alter an otherwise tense situation .
A grinning adolescent boy used hand signals and broken English to jokingly offer a trade : lean , amber - eyed Pluto for one of his sheep , which stood in a silent , fluffy flock staring at the dogs .
In the garden , two women presented the troops with pizza - sized slabs of hot , freshly baked flatbread .
Then the boy explained through an interpreter that there were weapons stashed in the wooded area across the road .
Soon , Rose and Iron and Soller and Pluto were pushing through a dense thicket .
Within minutes , Rose spotted a subtle change in Iron ’s behavior as he nosed around some palm fronds .
The 7 - year - old dog calmly sat down , a sign he had found something .
A metal detector and shovel proved him right .
A pipe bomb wrapped in a green sack was buried in the dirt .
By the end of the mission , Iron had made a second find .
Advertisement
After each discovery , Rose rewarded Iron with tosses of a red rubber cone -- as with Udo , Iron ’s favorite treat .
The dogs are bought from breeders in Europe and the United States and then trained at the military ’s dog school at Lackland Air Force Base .
Iron washed out of two training courses , and his future in the military looked bleak until Rose met him in December 2005 .
Rose determined that the problem was not Iron ’s nose .
It was the fake rawhide bone being used as his reward .
It was n’t appetizing enough to make the dog work hard .
When Rose tried the rubber cone , Iron began picking up scents .
Advertisement
Each dog is different .
Pluto ’s favorite toy is attached to a rope , because he likes playing tug of war with Soller .
The petty officer remembers one dog who was satisfied only with a toy steak that squeaked when bitten .
Should dogs be wounded or fall ill , they are given immediate care .
Handlers are trained to provide basic treatment until the dog can be taken to a military veterinarian .
When Iron broke a canine , a critical tooth for a dog who sometimes must chase down suspects and hold them , he was given a root canal to save the tooth the same day .
Severe cases are flown to Germany .
This happened with Rose ’s last dog , Rex .
In 2005 , Rose and Rex were providing security at the Baghdad trial of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
One day , Rex would n’t eat .
Rose knew that when his 105 - pound German shepherd did n’t eat , something was wrong .
Advertisement
He had him checked by a military veterinarian in Baghdad .
The diagnosis was cancer .
Rex was dying .
He was flown to Germany and euthanized .
But Rex ’s memory lives on at Ft. Riley , Kan. , home to the Army ’s 1st Infantry Division and Rose ’s home base .
At the base , dogs have a place to play .
It ’s called Rex ’s Bark Park .

Not a single medical professional , scientist or journalist has dared take a critical eye to this study .
That fact alone is the best evidence yet of the power of financial interests and bias .
What is most disturbing , and should be for everyone who cares about research being used to learn the truth rather than sell us on something , is that this is about life and death .
Media outlets — professional and consumer — all came out with nearly identical stories and interpretations of this study on the same day — having , of course , received the same embargoed press releases providing the script .
Great marketing , but it would have benefitted their readers , viewers and patients if one of them had done their jobs .
Starting with reading the study .
Instead , we heard : “ ‘ Weight loss ’ surgery extends lifespan . ”
Money may not buy you love but it might buy you happiness if you spend it in the right way , US researchers say .
In studies they found that the old adage " it 's better to give than to receive " is correct : spending money on others or giving to charity puts a bigger smile on your face than buying things for yourself .
" Most people would think that if you make more money you are going to be a lot happier , " said Michael Norton , a professor at Harvard Business School .
" Our results , and a lot of other people 's results , show that making more money makes you a little bit happier , but does n't really have a huge impact on you .
Our studies suggest maybe that little changes in how you spend it make a difference . "
The researchers ' work is published today in the journal Science .
Norton and his colleagues questioned 632 Americans about how much they earned and how they spent their cash .
They also asked them to rate their own happiness .
Regardless of income level , those people who spent money on others reported greater happiness , while those who spent more on themselves did not .
In a second study , the team questioned 16 employees in line for a company bonus of $ 3,000 - $ 8,000 .
The team asked the subjects about their happiness before and six to eight weeks after the bonus , and how they spent the money .
The size of the bonus did not determine how much happiness grew .
Instead , the amount spent on others or given to charity was correlated with how much individuals ' happiness levels had risen .
The team also gave 46 volunteers either $ 5 ( £ 2.50 ) or $ 20 to spend .
They instructed the participants to spend the money on themselves or someone else .
Again , the altruistic group reported feeling happier whatever the size of their gift .
Norton said : " So instead of buying yourself a coffee buy your friend a coffee and that might actually make you a happier person . "
Professor Stephen Joseph , of the University of Nottingham - an expert in the psychology of happiness who was not involved in the study - said : " Most of the research in the past has said money is n't that important in terms of happiness .
The things that are important are things to do with relationships , with other people , and things that help to promote meaning , the purpose in life .
I think that 's what this study speaks to . "
Although the clear implication of the study is that altruistic spending will make you happier , Joseph said it would be wrong to use the research to formulate advice .
" Being prescriptive about how people spend their money , even if it is for seemingly worthwhile causes , is a very dangerous path to go down .
Research like this describes society - it does n't tell us what society ought to be . "
Professor Ruut Veenhoven , of Erasmus University in Rotterdam , said the study showed that the economic view of human motivation was incorrect .
" This may come as a surprise for economists who have learned that humans are essentially egoists , " he said .
So why do n't people give more money away to make themselves even happier ?
" Often people do n't know what really makes them happy , " he said .
" Doing nice things to other people is n't so bad after all . "

Cato ’s David Boaz has a great column about the mutual threats to freedom posed by the philosophies of the left and the right :
[ D]espite [ America ’s ] heritage of freedom , we ’ve always got the Hillarys and the Huckabees and the other people who think they could run our lives better than we can .
The Huckabees on the right continue to resist the cultural changes of the 1960s , and the Hillarys on the left continue to resist the economic changes of the 1980s .
The “ Huckabees ” want to censor cable television because they do n’t think you can be trusted to decide what your family should watch .
They support bans on drugs , pornography , gambling and violent video games because you just do n’t know what ’s good for you .
They want prayer in the schools and sound science out .
They want to subsidize heterosexual marriage and ban gay marriage .
They want government to take the place of God and stamp out sin on earth .
Former Sen. Rick Santorum , a classic Huckabee , complains about “ this whole idea of personal autonomy , … this idea that people should be left alone . ”
The “ Hillarys , ” meanwhile , want to raise taxes because they think they can spend your money more wisely than you can .
They do n’t believe in school choice because you do n’t know how to choose a school for your children .
They think they can handle your retirement savings and health care better than you can .
They think , as Hillary Clinton has advocated , that the government should produce video lectures on how to burp a baby and how to brush your teeth and have them “ running continuously in doctors ’ offices , clinics , hospitals , motor vehicle offices , or any other place where people gather and have to wait . ”
The Huckabees want to be your daddy , telling you what to do and what not to do .
The Hillarys want to be your mommy , feeding you , tucking you in and setting your curfew .
But the proper role for the government of a free society is to treat adults as adults , responsible for making their own decisions and accepting the consequences .
And the good news is that mostly we do that .
The gremlins have burrowed into Google Maps again , seemingly causing a ferry collision and a boat to sink in Circular Quay .
Google Maps explorers spotted both oddities when scouring through the site 's satellite images of Sydney Harbour .
The ferry " collision " appears right beside a giant cruise liner - either the Queen Elizabeth 2 or Queen Mary 2 - which was docked at Sydney Cove when the photographs were taken .

Isospin
Simple Lie Groups and E8
More Spontaneosly Broken Symmetry
The idea behind symmetry in physics is that there are things that you can change without making a difference to how a system evolves .
I 've already given the example of how rotating a pool table has no effect on the physics of the game .
But here 's another very different symmetry : in particle accelerator events that involve only the strong force , it makes no difference whether you 're working with protons or neutrons .
The strong force is unable to distinguish between these two types of particle .
So we have a nice symmetry : for each proton or neutron in a system , we have a group of size two corresponding to the fact that we can swap one for the other .
Now clearly protons and neutrons are different , they have different charges , but that only makes a difference to electromagnetic interactions , not strong interactions .
This symmetry is called isospin symmetry .
But it gets more interesting when we consider quantum mechanics .
Represent a proton by a vector ( 1,0 ) and a neutron by a vector ( 0,1 ) .
Quantum mechanics allows us to form superpositions by adding linear combinations of physical states to get new ones .
So if ( 1,0 ) is a physical state , and ( 0,1 ) is also one , then so is ( 0.5,0.5 ) .
This is like the Schrödinger Cat state , it 's a mixture of proton and neutron .
In fact , we can form states ( a , b ) for any complex numbers a and b .
So now we have scope for even more symmetry because not only should neutrons and protons be interchangeable , any mixture should be interchangeable with any other .
What Heisenberg proposed was this : maybe the proton and neutron , considered as 2D vectors , have rotational symmetry just like the pool table .
( Well , I do n't think he was thinking in terms of pool tables . )
Because we 're dealing with complex numbers he proposed a symmetry group called SU ( 2 ) , instead of SO ( 2 ) , but it 's a similar kind of thing , just the complex number variation of the 2D rotation group .
SU ( 2 ) acts on the ( complex ) 2D space spanned by the proton vector ( 1,0 ) and the neutron state ( 0,1 ) and so this space forms what I previously called a Lie group representation .
The proton and neutron form a 2 - dimensional representation of SU ( 2 ) .
So let 's think about this more generally .
If we have n particles that we suspect are connected by some symmetry group G , then they must form an n-dimensional representation of the group .
Such a collection of particles is also called a multiplet .
But here 's the cool thing : if we have some kind of classification theorem listing the kinds of symmetry groups we expect to see in nature , and if we have a theorem classifying all of their representations , then we expect the particles of nature to be collected into families of similar particles that are organised just like those representations .
So just knowing some pure mathematics should tell us a lot about particle physics .
I 've already said a little about how mathematicians go about the process of classifying representations of Lie groups by looking at maximal tori .
Now I want to look at how Lie groups themselves are classified .
Lie groups can often be built out of smaller pieces .
This suggests the idea of finding the basic building blocks which can't be built out of simpler Lie groups .
For a large class of groups , the basic building blocks are known as the simple Lie groups .
( Now you know what the " Simple " in the title of Garrett Lisi 's paper is about . )
A priori you might imagine that you have all kinds of freedom when you try to construct new Lie groups .
Incredibly you do n't , and the list of simple Lie groups is quite ... well ... simple .
The Lie groups fall into seven families called A , B , C , ... , G .
The individual members of these families are given names like C4 , where the integer is the dimension of the maximal torus .
Four of the families , A to D , are fairly straightforward , and the groups form infinite sequences A1 , A2 , A3 and so on .
Some of these are familiar .
For example the B series are the rotation groups in odd dimensional spaces .
B1 is just another name for SO ( 3 ) .
But curiously , the other three families , E , F and G , are finite .
These are known as the exceptional Lie groups .
The complete list is E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 and G2 .
( What 's even more exceptional about these is that many other branches of mathematics have exceptional objects too , and they 're closely related to these .
And now you know what ' exceptional ' in that title means . )
E8 is the highest dimensional of the exceptional simple Lie groups .
In other words , you can think of it as the largest possible symmetry we could have that is n't simply built out of smaller pieces , or is n't just part of a straightforward sequence of symmetries .
But it 's not ' simple ' in the ordinary sense of the word , it 's 248 - dimensional .
So if we could arrange the particles of nature into a family of size 248 then we'd have strong evidence that E8 was the symmetry of nature .
This is what Lisi has attempted to do .
But there 's a complication .
Above I talked out the SU ( 2 ) symmetry of protons and neutrons .
But we know that symmetry does n't hold exactly because the electromagnetic force does n't respect it .
In fact , photons react to protons and neutrons quite differently .
But there 's a way out : broken symmetry .
In earlier posts I 've already talked about this in the case of pool .
But now consider a system like a sealed container of water .
Again , fundamental principles suggest that this should have SO ( 3 ) symmetry .
But we know that if we tilt a container of water the water does n't tilt with the container , the level of the surface remains aligned perpendicular to gravity .
On the other hand , as we heat up the water it eventually boils .
At that point it 's hard to tell gravity is at work at all because the force of gravity is so small compared to the intermolecular forces at work in a gas .
The higher the temperature , the harder it is to see the local gravity .
So pumping energy into a system serves to remove any kind of local accidents of history to reveal the true symmetry .
The idea in particle physics is that at low energies we see a reduced symmetry , but at higher energies we should see more symmetries coming into play .
In fact , this idea works incredibly well and in 1979 the Nobel prize was awarded to Glashow , Salam and Weinberg for realising that at higher energies the reduced symmetry of electromagnetism ( which , by the way , is SO ( 2 ) ) could be seen as part of a bigger symmetry .
So what we expect to see is a chain of subgroups , one contained in the next , corresponding to physics at different energies .
In practice physicists use Lie algebras instead of Lie groups most of the time because infinitesimal operations are usually much easier to work with , but the principle is the same .
So now I can finally say what Lisi has attempted to do : he has arranged all of the particles of nature to form a representation of E8 .
He has then found subgroups of E8 corresponding to the breaking of this symmetry .
At low energies , the different forces of nature see different symmetries corresponding to these subgroups .
As these subgroups correspond to less symmetry , we end up with smaller sets of particles that are interchangeable with each other , and so smaller multiplets .
So the multiplets of E8 break up into smaller multiplets corresponding to representations of these subgroups .
Lisi has shown how to arrange the particles of nature into multiplets , and has also shown how to break up these multiplets into smaller ones that correspond to the properties of the familiar fundamental forces we can observe in the lab .
There are all kinds of problems with the way he 's done this which makes the work controversial .
But in spirit , it 's not so different from what physicists have been doing for decades .
Lindsay Lohan's Italian Lovers Tryst Continues ( Photos )
, ex boyfriend of , sounds like he may know what he 's talking about when he referred to Li Lo as a sex addict .
We 've featured several stories on her whirlwind love fest with every man she has encountered on the island of Capri .
The saga continues with new photos .
Our featured photo seems to show the disheveled Lohan and Italian actor Dario Faiella out on a balcony , no doubt coming up for air in the midst of a sex tryst .
She appears to have donned his t- shirt and from what we can see - he may be in the buff .
Lindsay Lohan has been keeping a low profile back in Hollywood but has really let her hair down in Europe .
Rumors have been flying about her possible lesbian liaison with a new live - in room mate Courtenay Semel .
Maybe this is a smoke screen of sorts - or an indication that she is open to any and all sexual advances .
Worse yet - maybe she has exchanged on addiction for another .
In any case , her self control seems to have waned badly .
Maybe it 's something in the Italian water .
Check out the rest of the candid shots below .
From the beginning , advocates of universal health care were troubled by the incompleteness of Barack Obama ’s plan , which unlike those of his Democratic rivals would n’t cover everyone .
But they were willing to cut Mr. Obama slack on the issue , assuming that in the end he would do the right thing .
Now , however , Mr. Obama is claiming that his plan ’s weakness is actually a strength .
What ’s more , he ’s doing the same thing in the health care debate he did when claiming that Social Security faces a “ crisis ” — attacking his rivals by echoing right - wing talking points .
The central question is whether there should be a health insurance “ mandate ” — a requirement that everyone sign up for health insurance , even if they do n’t think they need it .
The Edwards and Clinton plans have mandates ; the Obama plan has one for children , but not for adults .
Why have a mandate ?
The whole point of a universal health insurance system is that everyone pays in , even if they ’re currently healthy , and in return everyone has insurance coverage if and when they need it .

The package maintainers have been hard at work this week , packaging up the new xmonad 0.5 for various distros .
Packages are very important , as they make it a lot easier to get a Haskell toolchain into place .
So far the following agile distros ;) have packaged xmonad 0.5 :
While the following have xmonad 0.4 or earlier :
Other well known distributions appear not to have xmonad at all - for shame !
xmonad 's success relies much on the ability for users to install from their package system , so if you 're able to package xmonad for your platform , please do so !
xmonad 0.5 released !
The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce the 0.5 release of xmonad !
xmonad 0.5 is a major release of xmonad , allowing , for the first time , dynamic extension in Haskell without requiring recompilation .
Extension and configuration of xmonad is now faster , simpler , and more flexible .
All configuration is done via the ~/.xmonad / xmonad.hs file .
Example config files and screenshots are available on the wiki .
This release marks the final break from its dwm origins .
As a result , xmonad is now also much easier to package , distribute and extend , as recompilation of xmonad is not required to extend it .
As usual with xmonad , the new release comes with a large library of extensions you can use in your config files .
Highlights include status bars , shell prompts , emulation of dwm , wmii and ion behaviour , and alternative window layout algorithms .
Check out the extension documentation for more info .
More information , screenshots , documentation , tutorials and community resources are available from the xmonad home page .
The 0.5 release , extensions and dependencies , are available from hackage .haskell.org .
Enjoy , and happy tiling !

xmonad 0.5 release candidates
xmonad 0.5 release candidates are now available for those into beta testing .
Download xmonad and xmonad - contrib here .
You 'll need X11 1.4 from hackage .haskell.org .
These bundles should work fine with ghc 6.6 or ghc 6.8 , and they use the new ~/.xmonad / configuration system .
Documentation is n't up yet , so drop by the IRC channel if you get stuck .
The more testing , the better the release !

TEHRAN , April 12 ( Reuters ) - A bomb exploded in a mosque in southern Iran on Saturday , killing at least eight people and wounding more than 60 others , Iranian media reported .
Ambulances rushed to the scene of the blast in a crowded district in the city of Shiraz , state television said .
“ The death toll has reached eight and about 66 injured , ” the semi-official Fars news agency said , quoting a police official , identified only as General Zamani .
The agency , quoting an unnamed official , said the death toll was expected to rise because some of the wounded were in a critical condition .
The official IRNA news agency said the bomb exploded during an address by a cleric in the Shohada mosque in Shiraz .
Local officials were not immediately available for comment on the blast .
No one has claimed the responsibility for the blast but the deputy governor of the province Mohammad Reza Hadaegh told state television the cause of the blast was under investigation .
Security is normally tight in Iran , where bomb attacks have been rare in recent years .
However , in 2005 and 2006 , several people were killed in a string of blasts in the southwestern oil city of Ahvaz .
And 65 men were arrested in February and accused of being behind a bombing that killed members of the elite Revolutionary Guards in a southeastern border province .

MARCH 30 -- When California narcotics agents armed with a search warrant recently arrived at the Carlsbad home of the Dagy family ( Mom , Dad , three kids ) , they expected to find one of those indoor marijuana production facilities .
You know , the kind where the high - intensity lights stay on all day so the plants grow , grow , grow .
As the below search warrant affidavit notes , a check of the Dagys utility records showed " excessive " electrical usage , consumption " very consistent with an indoor marijuana operation . "
In his affidavit , Detective Mark Reyes also noted the Dagy family 's suspicious " trash dispensing pattern " and mentioned that a drug - sniffing dog , one Storm , " showed a positive alert " when he sniffed near the family 's garage .
Investigators had also planned to conduct some kind of fancy aerial infra-red surveillance , but bad weather grounded those plans .
So imagine the surprise when about eight armed narcs raided the Dagy home on March 19 and found absolutely nothing .
No evidence of pot anywhere , not even stashed in the children 's toys .
Seems that the coppers mistook the family 's constant use of the dishwasher , washer / dryer , three computers , four ceiling fans , and other electronic devices as evidence of a felony drug operation .
Oops .
The Dagys -- Mom 's a homemaker and Dad 's a general manager of 21 Shell stations -- would like an apology from the Carlsbad Police Department .
Sadly , we 'd recommend that the Dagys not hold their collective breath .

WASHINGTON , Dec 12 ( Reuters ) - Lawmakers on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee have expressed concern about the Justice Department review of Sirius Satellite Radio's SIRI .
O proposed purchase of rival XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O .
In a letter dated Dec. 11 to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , Reps. John Conyers and Steve Chabot wrote : “ We were dismayed to learn of recent press reports suggesting that Justice Department staff may be trying to rush through the merger before you have an opportunity to fully participate , and that Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Thomas O. Barnett may intend to grant the merger over the objections of department staff . ”
Conyers is a Michigan Democrat while Chabot is a Republican from Ohio . ( Reporting by Diane Bartz ; Editing by Tim Dobbyn )
Hairdressers and barbers are at increased risk of developing cancer – because of their use of hair dyes .
And the risks could extend to personal use of the dyes , according to international experts .
A review of the evidence by a panel of the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) in Lyon , France , has found a “ small but consistent risk of bladder cancer in male hairdressers and barbers " .
A second review of the evidence on personal use of hair dyes found some studies suggesting a possible association with bladder cancer and with lymphoma and leukaemia .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the panel found that the evidence was inadequate and concluded that personal use of hair dyes was “ not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans " .
The panel was composed of 17 scientists who met last February to consider the latest evidence and update advice last issued by the agency in 1993 .
Modern hair dyes are classified as permanent , semi permanent or temporary dyes .
The permanent or oxidative hair dyes represent 80 per cent of the market and consist of colourless “ intermediates ” and couplers that , in the presence of peroxide , form the dyes by chemical reaction .
Dark hair dyes tend to contain the highest concentration of the colouring ingredients .
The use of some such colourants was discontinued in the 1970s after positive cancer tests in rats .
Dr Robert Baan of the IARC and colleagues say in The Lancet Oncology : “ A small but consistent risk of bladder cancer was reported in male hairdressers and barbers .
Because of few supporting findings by duration or period of exposure , the working group considered these data as limited evidence of carcinogenicity and reaffirmed occupational exposures of haridressers and barbers as ‘ probably carcinogenic to humans ' . ”
The full report will be published as Volume 99 of the IARC monographs .
The need for a new enlightenment
Enough with the pig ignorance , violence and stupidity .
Enough with bowing to religious bullies and bigots , racists and sexists .
And , most of all , enough limiting ourselves to the narrow confines the past has laid down .
The time has come to shake all that off , like the famous workers ’ chains , and rise up to the potential that being human offers .
“ This Enlightenment , ” says Christopher Hitchens , “ will not need to depend … on the heroic breakthroughs of a few gifted and exceptionally courageous people .
It is within the compass of the average person . ”
With that acknowledgement comes a great responsibility .
We are all capable of lifting ourselves above the ash pit and the swill .
We have it within us .
We live in societies that , increasingly , are tolerant of such revolutionary thinking and a world in which there is a deep need for us to move to the next level .
The inertial forces against this move are many and powerful .
But it is time to assure ourselves — as well as our enemies , Bible - bashers and circumcisers of females and warmongers one and all — that we are evolving away from their kind .
We need a new enlightenment , and one is approaching .
The hallmarks of this enlightenment are :
Compassion
The one thing the more kindly religious types get right is the need for compassion .
While this concept is not unique to religion — or even particularly common among the religious — it is a true sign of having reached a higher state of being .
The Buddhists , for example , regard it as one of the qualities of an enlightened being .
But we do n’t need to follow them to understand why compassion is central to living in an enlightened society of any kind .
Compassion means , simply , thinking of others as if you were them .
And not just “ thinking ” this , but being able to feel what that would be like .
If George Bush were able to experience compassion for an Iraqi child whose leg the marines had just shot off , it would be considerably less likely he would send more marines in their wake — and not just understand that child ’s pain , but also have true compassion for it .
Compassion is a scarce commodity ; not only in global politics , but also in our everyday lives .
We are appallingly bad at having compassion for one another — and it is a vital growth point for our species .
Sexual liberation
Thanks to hundreds — if not thousands — of years of sexual repression and oppression , we stand today as a species that is largely unique in our ability to enjoy sex for its own sake ( or as an expression of love ) and one that has a thoroughly tormented relationship with the act .
The Catholics , the Muslims and the Jews , and many other backward religions , must shoulder much of the blame for this .
However , the primitive cultures that predated them fare no better when put under the historical microscope .
Let ’s face it : it is only now , in no more than the past 50 years , that a true sexual liberation has been possible .
Every kind of sexual behaviour is , at worst , tolerated and , at best , celebrated .
The growth of homosexuality and bisexuality ( and other kinds of sexuality ) is a wonderful testament to the opening up of the human sexual spirit .
That people have the freedom to explore forms of sexual behaviour that in the past were regarded as sins , illnesses or worse , out in the open , online and off , is a flag over the enlightenment tower .
And it is important to say , here , that this sexual liberation is not the same thing as hedonism .
It is , in fact , only important to say this because some right - wing bigot will no doubt want to argue that it is .
Equality
This may seem like a hangover from the last Enlightenment , but we must acknowledge the importance of the march toward equality for all .
And equality does not mean that everyone is , by definition , equal .
Some people are stupid .
Some people are smart .
Some people can play the piano and some people can’t .
Equality usually means , as it should , that people have equal rights .
Fortunately , as we sit here today , this is a widely accepted principle and one that has swept the world in the form of democracy and bills of rights .
Unfortunately , many people on the face of the Earth have not enjoyed the benefits of this movement .
From the poverty - ridden in the Third World to the abused women of the Middle East , equality has a long way to go .
But its march is relentless .
Merit
This is , perhaps , my most controversial suggestion .
But there can be no going forward without recognising the need to value certain things more than others .
We can not value everything the same .
And the worst manifestation of this is the “ cultural relativism ” that stops our hand from interfering in other people ’s religious and ethnic practices , no matter how obscene .
That has allowed all kinds of evil and ignorance to take their place alongside genuine knowledge and learning .
A good example is the ratification of “ traditional healers ” alongside medical doctors in South Africa .
This is a complex topic , but to keep it general :
How can we accept the idea that a practice rooted in primitive tribalism has as much to add to the healing of , say , cancer , as the profession resulting from hundreds of years of steady , careful research and experimenting ?
This is not , of course , to say that nothing which traditional healers do works .
But if it does , it does so because it happens to act in the same way that medicine does .
Or it has some other perfectly ordinary explanation .
It can not be valued in its own right as an “ alternative ” because there is , in fact , no alternative .
There is one way , and that is the way toward knowledge and understanding .
At least in this particular domain .
That is one of many examples .
Certain lines of thought , ideas and practices have more value and merit than others .
And some are more — dare I say it — true than others .
We must discard the nonsense , and embrace the ever - increasing understanding that we are gaining over our lives and our universe .
And this is not an argument simply for science and reason .
There are spiritual practices that have more merit than others , and psychological models — and even ways of living .
Do n’t read me wrong : I am not some cold , left - brainer who is hoping for a world of robots .
Quite the contrary .
Post - enlightenment , we will be a world of connected , emotionally intelligent , liberated beings for whom life is richer and sweeter .
There are many hurdles along the path .
But it can never be too soon to begin .
Help the cause today by stamping out ignorance , bigotry and cruelty .
Fight it , because it ’s the only fight left that is worth fighting .
I tend to prefer debit when purchasing things .
It has n’t really been a security thing for me ; it ’s been more of a speed issue .
But recent information is compelling me to switch to credit again when swiping at Point of Sale ( POS ) systems .
There ’s new research that shows how easy it is to replace and / or modify POS systems to capture the info right off your card when you swipe .
[ BBC : “ Chip and PIN ” Possibly Vulnerable to Fraud ]
So we ’ve heard of this type of thing with suspect , standalone ATM machines and such , but now it ’s being done with standard POS systems , which we use far more often .
Some may say that it ’s only a danger in little rinky dink shops and not major stores like Walmart or Target .
But think about it .
How hard would it be for a professional criminal to get someone hired at a big store and then have them either modify or replace one of their POS systems ?
Considering the type of people these companies hire , not hard .
I bet there ’s a time - sensitive opening right now in which it could be done fairly easily .
Perhaps not in six months when the big stores will be watching for it and / or defending against it , but in the meantime I suspect there is a decent amount of vulnerability .
Anyway , even if there is n’t , I ’m still going to be switching to credit for a while for a very simple reason .
You ca n’t capture the PIN if you do n’t enter it , because it ’s not stored on the card .
So if you use credit on a compromised POS system they ’ll still get your name and card number , but they wo n’t have your PIN .
I ’ll take a slight amount of annoyance in order to avoid even a minimal chance of such a serious impact .
Or , to put it another way , the odds of me getting my info and PIN stolen are pretty low , but the hassle of not using the PIN at all is so insignificant that I think it ’s worth switching to credit during the pre-remediation phase . :

Super Soaker 's Constant Pressure System , or CPS , pressurizes water by pumping it into a small , expandable bladder .
The purpose of the pumping system in a Super Soaker is to compress air .
Each time you drive water from the large reservoir into the small reservoir , it pushes up against all of the air inside .
Air is a compressible fluid -- you can decrease its volume by squeezing it -- but water is not .
When you add more and more water to the small reservoir , it takes up a greater and greater volume .
Since there is a limited amount of space in the reservoir , these larger volumes of water compress the air inside the gun so that it has a much higher pressure than the air outside the gun .
This cushion of high - pressure air pushes on all of the water in the reservoir ; the water presses on the sides of the gun , trying to get outside to restore pressure balance .
This content is not compatible on this device .
The only thing keeping the water inside the gun is the trigger mechanism .
The trigger is simply a lever secured to the gun housing .
A stiff length of metal attached to the housing holds the top part of this lever against the flexible plastic tube leading to the gun 's barrel , pinching it so no water can get through .
When you pull the trigger back , the metal piece bends , and the lever releases the plastic tube .
With this passageway open , the pressurized air can push all of the water out of the gun , reestablishing a pressure equilibrium with the air outside .
If you build up enough pressure , the water is expelled at a very high velocity .

Since each bit of water further compresses the air cushion , the force of the blast depends on how much water you pump into the small reservoir .
At a high - enough pressure level , the outward force of the compressed air and pressurized water might exceed the structural integrity of the plumbing in the gun , causing it to leak .
To prevent this from happening , the trigger mechanism is designed to let some water through when the pressure reaches a certain level .
This " leak level " is determined by the strength of the metal that holds the trigger down .
Essentially , this piece of metal is like an ordinary spring , and its springiness is determined by its composition .
If the metal is more rigid , it will take a higher water - pressure level to push it out of the way .
If you have a more flexible piece , the gun will let some water leak at a lower pressure .
In the late 1990s , a new wave of Super Soaker guns came out that boasted higher pressure levels .
These guns , developed by Bruce D'Andrade , feature the Constant Pressure System , or CPS .
The main component in this system is a simple water bladder .
This bladder is like a balloon , but it is made of much more rigid material .
These guns have the same sort of pump as other Super Soakers , but the water and air are driven into the water bladder rather than into a plastic reservoir .
As you pump more water in , the bladder expands , in the same way a balloon expands as you blow more air into it .
When it is stretched , the bladder wants to return to its natural shape , so it applies a good deal of inward pressure on the water .
When you pull the trigger and open up the passageway to the gun barrel , this pressure drives all of the water out of the gun .
This allows for much more powerful water blasts than can be achieved with compressed air alone .

These are just two sorts of pump - based water guns .
Lonnie Johnson and Bruce D'Andrade 's first Super Soaker and the later addition of the water bladder have launched an entire line of water weapons .
For extra ammunition , some designs hook up to a huge water reservoir that you wear like a backpack .
Other guns are configured so you can shoot forward , backward and sideways at once .
This has altered the world of water guns drastically .
In the past , kids knew exactly what to expect when they went to the toy store for a new water gun .
These days , the shelves are stocked with a wide range of new designs every summer .
Unless you 've been to the toy store recently , you have no idea what your neighbors might bring to the next big water fight .

Ghana has been treating me very well so far .
My host family is wonderful .
I could n’t have asked for a better living situation .
They really care about my happiness , the house is clean and safe and I am fed well !
The volunteer work has been good as well , if at times slow .
I have been at the HIV / AIDS facility for the last week and a half and will start in a fosterhome / school just outside of Accra next week .
It ’s about an hour from my house by trotro .
I am planning a trip to Cape Coast with some other volunteers I ’ve met in Accra .
I was surprised to see so many obrunis !
It ’s been nice to make some friends in the same situation I am in .
Accra is like another world ; so far this has definitely been an unforgettable experience .
I am glad my first trip to Africa was to Ghana .
I feel very safe here .
Everyone is incredibly friendly and welcoming .
Besides the heat , I have no complaints !
I am loving my trip and am very thankful to you and your organization for setting this all up .
You ’re doing a great thing !
Talking with some other volunteers makes me especially grateful – some have had not so great experiences with their organizations .
I am very lucky 🙂

Tag clouds look better sorted !
I like the idea of tag - clouds and tags in general , but I had problems making them look good in becontrary .com .
I experimented with changing the relative size and blending colors , as well as with the huge number of visual tweaks you can do with CSS , but the amorphous blob of words just did n't seem to fit with the nice neat columns I had .
Until , that is , I sorted the tags by popularity , which made it a lot neater and enhanced the effect of blending the font size / color .
I do n't know why it did n't occur to me before .
I do n't see many sites doing this , most tag clouds are sorted alphabetically .
The image below shows a tag - cloud sorted by popularity ( left ) and just alphabetically ( right ) .
Which one do you think looks better ?
( Click for a larger image . )
Update : A few people have commented that without alphabetical order it is difficult to pick out a tag you are looking for .
Personally I have never used a tag cloud like that , its usually just a starting off point to explore the site .
If I wanted something specific I would use the search function .
Even if the tag - cloud is used to scan for specific tags , it becomes redundant if you have so many tags that you can only show a subset , which is the case for becontrary .com .
So I chose form over function , consequences be damned !
Es ist noch gar nicht so lange her , da mussten Web - Programmierer mühsam mit Self - HTML ansprechende Websites erstellen .
In kürzester Zeit hat sich das Wissen im Bereich moderner Webprogrammierungen jedoch enorm vergrößert .
So stehen heute Programmiersprachen zur Verfügung , die im Handumdrehen anspruchsvolles Webdesign mit Leistungsfähigkeit kombinieren .
Mit HTML haben diese Programmiersprachen jedoch überhaupt nichts mehr zu tun .
So ist es heute mögliche , zahlreiche zusätzliche Funktionen anzubieten , die das Betrachten und agieren auf einer Website zum reinsten Vergnügen machen .
Insbesondere Firmenwebsites profitieren von den heutigen Möglichkeiten und auch die Kunden hatten es noch nie so leicht , Bestellungen aufzugeben oder sich umfassend über Interessantes zu informieren .
Eine dieser modernen Programmiersprachen ist PHP .
Sie ist im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen „ Sprachen “ sehr leicht zu erlernen und verfügt über eine umfangreiche Datenbankunterstützung .
Internetprotokolle lassen sich ebenso leicht einbinden wie zahlreiche zusätzliche Programmbibliotheken .
Basierend auf PHP ist ein modernes System zur Verwaltung von allen Inhalten einer Website .
Besonders gern wird es für Weblogs verwendet , da jeder Beitrag sich mittels WordPress einer beziehungsweise mehrerer Kategorien zuweisen lässt , wobei die Kategorien frei gestaltet werden können .
Die zugehörigen Navigationselemente werden vollautomatisch erzeugt .
WordPress - Nutzer müssen über eine MySQL - Datenbank verfügen .
Die Programmiersprache Ruby ist eindeutig objektorientiert und unterstützt zahlreiche weitere Programmierparadigmen .
Ruby stellt Funktionen wie die Reflexion , die dynamische Typisierung und die automatische Speicherbereinigung zur Verfügung .
Dabei unterstützt Ruby die Programmierung durch Active Support ( aspektorientiert ) , die Metaprogrammierung und die Programmierung durch ContextR ( kontextorientiert ) .
Webdesign und Programmierung
Hinter der bunten Fassade und den umfangreichen Funktionen einer jeden Webseite steckt Programmierungsarbeit , die sich auf mehrere unterschiedliche Programmiersprachen stützt .
Jede Programmiersprache ist für unterschiedliche Elemente der Seite zuständig : Vom Aufbau über das Design bis hin zu den individuellen Funktionen wird alles durch die Webprogrammierung reguliert .
Der Aufbau und die Struktur der Seite
Für Aufbau und Struktur einer Webseite ist die Beschreibungssprache HTML zuständig .
Sie ist eine sehr leicht verständliche Sprache , sodass Laien meist sie zuerst erlernen und sich anschließend mit weiteren Sprachen befassen .
HTML - Codes sind dazu gedacht , der Seite beispielsweise einen Metatitel zu geben , durch den sie von der Suchmaschine leichter gefunden wird – sie regulieren aber auch den Aufbau und die Struktur einfacher HTML - Seiten .
Vor allem aber ist sie für die Formatierung und Ausgestaltung der textuellen Inhalte zuständig .
Formulare
Die meisten Formulare sind eine Verbindung aus einer clientseitig laufenden HTML Seite und einer serverseitigen PHP - Programmierung mit Datenbank .
PHP erfordert bereits größere Programmierkenntnisse des Programmierers , da es nicht ohne weiteres zu verstehen ist und Übung braucht .
Geübte Programmierer können damit jedoch abgetrennte Login- Bereiche , Formulare oder auf andere Weise funktionelle Seiten entwerfen .
Diese werden anschließend noch mit HTML , CSS und Javascript fertig formatiert und es ergibt sich eine fertige Seite mit spezifischer Funktion , die vom Besucher genutzt werden kann .
PHP ist noch die am häufigsten verwendete Programmiersprache für Internetforen und Seiten , auf denen Daten eingegeben und übermittelt werden .
Anspruchsvolles Design und Spiele
Mit der Programmiersprache Flash lassen sich spezielle Designwünsche und Anforderungen umsetzen .
Die Programmiersprache ermöglicht es , animierte Dateien zu erstellen oder die gesamte Seite zu animieren .
Während mit reinem HTML kaum Interaktion möglich ist , lassen sich mit Flash viele Designideen realisieren .
Die aktuell sehr beliebten Browserspiele wie das Flashgame Wewaii mit bildschirmfüllenden Animationen und schnellen Interaktionen werden erst dadurch möglich .
Ähnliches lässt sich auch mit aktuellen JavaScript Frameworks wie jQuery realisieren , wobei sogar auf die Installation eines Browserplugins verzichtet werden kann .
Dies sind die häufigsten verwendeten Programmiersprachen im Web , wenn es um Spiele geht .
Webprogrammierung – wer führt sie durch ?
Viele professionelle Webdesigner beherrschen die grundlegenden Programmiersprachen und können die Wünsche ihres Kunden direkt im Anschluss an das Design umstellen .
Alternativ dazu kann man auch eine Agentur beauftragen , die sich auf die Webprogrammierung spezialisiert hat .
Wer sich selbst nicht sicher auskennt , sollte aber in jedem Fall einen Fachmann hinzuziehen .
Denn der Nutzer verlangt von einer Webseite , dass sie reibungsfrei funktioniert und keine offensichtlichen Fehler mehr aufweist , sobald sie online geht – das erzeugt den Eindruck von Hochwertigkeit .
Vor allem aber fällt durch eine professionelle Webprogrammierung die Suchmaschinenoptimierung leichter , denn sie hängt eng mit der Programmierung der Seite zusammen .
Students of economic developments in the 1970s and 1980s know all too well that the central bank par excellence during those two decades was Germany 's Bundesbank .
Its reputation in safeguarding the value of its currency , the Deutschmark , was second - to - none .
Price stability , year - in , year - out , was supposedly its party trick .
It was , though , no more than a myth .
By today 's standards , the Bundesbank was rubbish at controlling inflation .
In the 1970s , West German inflation averaged 5.1 per cent a year .
The Bundesbank did better in the 1980s , managing to bring inflation down to an annual average of 2.6 per cent .
Best practice nowadays , though , demands an inflation rate of around 2 per cent or lower .
Why then , is the Bundesbank regarded with such reverence ?
The answer is that Germany 's central bank in the 1970s and 1980s did better than others .
Inflation was n't particularly low in Germany , but Germany enjoyed a much lower inflation rate than its peers .
US inflation averaged 7.8 per cent a year in the 1970s while the UK 's inflation rate averaged a whopping 13.8 per cent .
Even in the most difficult of times , then , the Bundesbank remained " best in class " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This , in turn , provides considerable food for thought .
The Bundesbank did well given the global inflationary pressures that built up in the 1970s but not well enough by today 's standards .
Suppose , though , that the Bundesbank had been obliged in the 1970s to use today 's inflation targeting regimes .
How much more would it have needed to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down to below 2 per cent ?
And what would the consequences have been for output and employment ?
The one - word answer to this last question is , I suspect , " disastrous " .
German inflation was low by international standards , but the global inflationary backdrop made it near enough impossible for the Bundesbank to achieve its ultimate objective of price stability .
The lesson from the 1970s is , surely , that even the best of central banks can fall victim to difficult international circumstances .
Are we about to see a repeat of this problem ?
Until now , the answer seemed to be " no " , because all central banks were , supposedly , committed to the achievement of price stability .
That , though , no longer seems to be true .
In particular , inflation is rising rapidly in the emerging world .
Chinese inflation is above 8 per cent , Russian inflation is above 12 per cent and , as of the end of last week , Vietnamese inflation was at 21 per cent .
A couple of decades ago , the emerging markets did n't have much of a role to play in the overall trajectory of the global economy .
They were simply too small .
Today , though , their economies are , in aggregate , almost as big as the United States .
As a result , higher inflation in the emerging markets matters for us all .
The most obvious channel through which the emerging market influence is being felt is food and energy prices .
Energy prices have been high for many a year now .
Food prices have , more recently , started to catch up .
This creates a significant problem .
In the UK , for example , the Bank of England is struggling to work out how to deal with ballooning of price increases which reflect global , rather than domestic , developments .
The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank face the same challenge .
Nowadays , global inflation is made in the emerging world .
Their mistakes , you might say , but our problem .
Why is emerging market inflation so high ?
Most emerging market central bankers would doubtless argue that it's to do with food and energy prices which are typically regarded by the central banking community as " mean reverting " – what goes up one year must come down the next .

That , though , has n't been true in recent years .
I 'd argue , instead , that emerging markets have staged a " partial decoupling " from the developed world .
Their economies are strong and , in particular , they have n't suffered from any sub-prime nonsense .
Yet , for the most part , they force their exchange rates to move in tandem with the US dollar .
In effect , then , they 're importing US monetary policy in a situation where they do not require the stimulus stemming from the interest rate cuts currently being delivered by the Federal Reserve .
The net result is surging demand , higher inflation pressures and , in consequence , higher global food and energy prices .
This creates a huge dilemma for western central banks .
On their own , the sub - prime crisis , the credit crunch and the threat of recession suggest that interest rates should fall .
Yet the rise in food and energy prices suggests that rates should rise .
What should central banks do ?
Judging by the latest published vote from the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee , the answer seems to be to disagree .
At the last Committee meeting , David Blanchflower voted for a half per cent reduction in interest rates , most others voted for a quarter point reduction but Messrs Besley and Sentance voted to leave rates unchanged .
This debate is hardly surprising .
Economic models typically suggest that inflation is influenced mostly by the amount of spare capacity in the domestic economy .
If the economy slows down and , in the process , creates more spare capacity , it 's natural to assume that inflationary pressures also will fade .
What happens , though , if inflationary pressures are stemming from another source ?
This , of course , is precisely the dilemma the Bundesbank faced in the 1970s .
While German inflation back then was partly a reflection of the domestic economic cycle , the biggest problems stemmed from global developments beyond the Bundesbank 's direct influence .
The control of inflation depends , ultimately , on teamwork .
All members of the global central banking community need to agree on the need to deliver price stability .
If some choose not to , the chances of others delivering on that goal are substantially reduced .
That , in my view , is what we 're seeing today .
Many emerging markets have chosen to direct monetary policy at the maximisation of growth rather than the minimisation of inflation .
In the process , they 've unleashed a global inflation threat which is leaking into higher prices all round .
This process provides a huge challenge to today 's inflation targeting regimes .
The more that imported inflation picks up , the greater the required deflation domestically to ensure that the price stability goal is delivered .
If , for example , the Bank of England is to ensure inflation over the medium term of around 2 per cent , it may be unable to cut interest rates sufficiently far to head off a major housing crisis .
Developments in the emerging world are , in other words , seriously impeding the ability of Western central banks to deal with the credit crunch .
In turn , this leaves policymakers in the UK and elsewhere with some tough choices .
Do they stick aggressively to existing inflation targets knowing that , by doing so , there 's the danger of a major domestic collapse ?
Or do they , instead , allow inflation to drift higher ?
The 1970s Bundesbank , despite its fearsome reputation , chose the latter .
Will our current crop of central bankers be any tougher ?
Do n't bank on it .

You may have thought cola wars had fizzled out - with every possible variety having now been invented .
However , Pepsi is reopening hostilities by launching a new " healthy " option .
Pepsi Raw is said to be made from natural ingredients and contains no artificial preservatives , colours , flavourings or sweeteners .
Traditional Pepsi contains fructose corn syrup , sugar , artificial colourings , phosphoric acid , caffeine , citric acid and natural flavours .
In comparison , Pepsi Raw has only natural ingredients including apple extract , plain caramel colouring , coffee leaf , tantaric acid from grapes , gum arabic from acacia trees , cane sugar and sparkling water .
It is paler in colour and less fizzy than other cola brands .
By replacing corn syrup with cane sugar , Pepsi claims it has managed to reduce the calorie content of a 300 ml bottle , from around 126 calories per serving to around 117 calories .
Cutting the amount of sugar in the drink could also help prevent damage to teeth .
To begin with , Pepsi Raw will only be available in selected bars and clubs in seven cities - London , Manchester , Glasgow , Brighton , Birmingham , Leeds and Liverpool , although a wider roll - out is expected later in the year .
Bruno Gruwez , Pepsi 's marketing director , said : " We are really proud that the UK is leading the way with the launch of Pepsi Raw , which is the most significant innovation from Pepsi UK in the last 15 years . "
The company hopes the new drink will help it catch up with Coca - Cola , which outsells all its rivals in the UK soft drinks market .
Coca - Cola held on to its position as the UK's most valuable grocery brand in 2007 , despite growing pressure on shoppers to eat and drink more healthily .
Both Pepsi and Coca - Cola have numerous rival products , including several low - calorie drinks and cherry , vanilla , lime and lemon flavoured colas .
Until 1903 a serving of cola contained 60mg of cocaine and to this day drinks manufacturers use extract of coca leaves - from which the drug is derived - to give cola its distinct flavour .
The UK cola market is worth £ 6 billion a year and is dominated by the two companies that have been rivals for more than 100 years .

I ’ve been noodling over a difference between behaviors ( functions of time ) and events ( sequences of time / value pairs ) .
A product of behaviors is isomorphic to a behavior of products , but a product of events is isomorphic to an event of sums .
B a × B b ≅ B a × b E a × E b ≅ E a + b
A similar property has been noted for Fudgets - like stream processors .
Behaviors ( or " reactive values " ) and events are inter-related .
In particular , we can make a behavior from an initial value and an event , using the stepper function .
If we want to use stepper with a pair value , we ’d have to use a pair - valued event .
However , it ’s often more convenient and efficient to work with pair of separate change events , or ( using the event pair / sum isomorphism ) a sum-valued event .
This post plays with another perspective on sum types for events and stream processors .
It can also apply to bots .
Pairs and sums
Let ’s take a look at the event pair / sum isomorphism .
To mix two events into a single sum event , simply left - or right - tag the events and merge them : mixEither ∷ ( Event c , Event d ) → Event ( Either c d )
mixEither ( ec , ed ) = liftM
Left ec `mplus` liftM Right ed
In this definition , I could have used fmap in place of liftM and / or ( ⊕ ) in place of mplus .
We 'll see in a moment that liftM and mplus give a nicer symmetry .
To separate a sum event into two , use joinMaybes .
joinMaybes ∷ MonadPlus m ⇒ m ( Maybe a ) → m a
unmixEither ∷ Event ( Either c d ) → ( Event c , Event d)
unmixEither ecd = ( filt left , filt right )
where
filt f = joinMaybes ( liftM f ecd )
The functions left and right are Maybe - valued extractors for sum types .
left ∷
Either c d → Maybe c
right ∷
Either c d → Maybe d
The mixer and unmixer actually have much more general types : mixEither ∷ MonadPlus m ⇒ ( m a , m b ) → m ( Either a b )
unmixEither ∷ MonadPlus m ⇒ m ( Either c d ) → ( m c , m d )
The simplicity and symmetry these typings motivated my choice of liftM and mplus above .
In this more general setting , mixEither ∘ unmixEither might not be the identity .
For lists , all of the lefts will end up before all of the rights .
Even for events , mixEither ∘ unmixEither can re-order simultaneous occurrences .
I do n't know how to get a genuine isomorphism .
Pair editors
When using stepper , the event argument indicates a change to the varying value .
When the varying value is a pair , we 'll often have change events for each pair member .
Let 's see how to weave those two events into a single pair - valued event .
The pair / sum isomorphism above says that a pair of events is equivalent to a sum-valued event .
But what do we do with the sum event ?
The key idea is noted in Functional reactive partner dancing : convert the sum into a pair editor : updPair ∷ Either c d → ( c , d ) → ( c , d )
updPair ( Left c ' ) ( _ , d ) = ( c ' , d )
updPair ( Right d' ) ( c , _ ) = ( c , d ' )
Equivalently , updPair = ( first∘const ) `either` ( second∘const )
Now we can go from a pair of events to an event of pair editors : pairEditE ∷ ( Event c , Event d) → Event ( ( c , d ) → ( c , d ) )
pairEditE = liftM updPair ∘ mixEither
If we want , we can also short - cut the whole sum business : pairEditE ( ce , de ) =
liftM ( first∘const ) ce `mplus` liftM ( second∘const ) de
With either of these definitions , we have a much more general type : pairEditE ∷ MonadPlus m ⇒ ( m c , m d ) → m ( ( c , d ) → ( c , d ) )
The next step is to apply successive functions from the pair - changing event , using an accumulation combinator .
We 'll need an initial value for the pair : pairE ∷ ( c , d ) → ( Event c , Event d ) → Event ( c , d )
cd `pairE` cde = cd `accumE` pairEditE cde
There 's another way to dice up pairE .
A reactive value is determined by an initial value and change event , so we can restructure the arguments of pairE into two reactive values .
We also have an initial value for the combination , so we may as well produce a reactive value .
pairR ∷ Reactive c → Reactive d → Reactive ( c , d )
( c ` Stepper` ce ) `pairR` ( d ` Stepper` de ) =
( c , d ) `stepper` pairE ( c , d ) ( ce, de )
or , more directly : ( c ` Stepper` ce ) `pairR` ( d ` Stepper` de ) =
( c , d ) `accumR` pairEditE ( ce, de )
Lovely !
Pair editing and applicative functors
In a sense , we 've gone to a lot of work for nothing .
Since Reactive is an applicative functor , we can also give this trivially easy and much more general definition : pairR ∷ Applicative f ⇒ f c → f d → f ( c , d )
pairR = lift A2 ( , )
On the other hand , the ( <*>) method in the Applicative instance given in Reactive normal form was tricky .
We can now replace it with a simple definition in terms of pairR ( assuming we do n't define pairR in terms of lift A2 ) .
Use pairR to turn a reactive function and a reactive argument into a reactive function / argument pair .
Then map uncurried function application to get ( <*> ) : rf <*> rx = uncurry ( $ ) < $> ( rf `pairR` rx )
I like how these new definitions of pairR and ( <*> ) build on other generally useful combinators .
In contrast , my previous ( <*>) definition is recursive and uses the representation of reactive values and events .
I ’ve been noodling over a difference between behaviors ( functions of time ) and events ( sequences of time / value pairs ) .
A product of behaviors is isomorphic to a behavior of products , but a ...
NASA National Aviation Operations Monitoring Service ( NAOMS ) Information Release
This website has been updated as part of NASA ’s continuing effort to release more and higher fidelity NAOMS information .
It contains 26,170 air carrier and 4,981 general aviation ( including rotorcraft ) pilot survey responses collected as part of the NAOMS project between April 2001 and December 2004 .
As with previous releases of NAOMS information , NASA has taken the necessary redaction steps to ensure that both the anonymity and confidentiality promised to pilots have been maintained and that no commercial confidential information is released .
NOTE : The responses contained herein , and the methodology used to acquire them , have not been peer - reviewed to date .
Accordingly , no product of the NAOMS project , including the survey methodology , the survey responses , and any analysis of the responses , should be viewed or considered at this stage as having been validated .
In response to recommendations that NASA post research papers associated with the NAOMS project to the web , NASA is making available " Beyond Error Reporting Toward Risk Assessment " by Irving Statler of NASA 's Ames Research Center , Rowena Morrison of Battelle Memorial Institute and Loren Rosenthal of Battelle Memorial Institute .
Following the completion of the NAOMS postings to this website on February 6 , 2008 , NASA proceeded to the next review phase of the NAOMS survey responses in order to allow for further release of previously redacted information .
To this end , the NASA associate administrator chartered a NAOMS Information Release Advisory Panel ( 2008 ) to make recommendations relating to the additional release of NAOMS information .
This charter also identified project team leaders to implement the panel 's recommendations .
This effort is referred to as " Phase 2 " of the NAOMS information release .
In a response to recommendations that NASA post research papers associated with the NAOMS project to the Web , NASA is making available " The Aviation System Monitoring and Modeling ( ASMM ) Project : A Documentation of its History and Accomplishments : 1999 - 2005 " by Irving Statler of NASA 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , Calif . with survey responses in Microsoft Office Excel format .
with an additional 407 air carrier survey responses ; an additional 701 general aviation rotorcraft survey responses ; Sections A - C and updates to section D of the outlier air carrier survey responses ; updated raw air carrier survey responses files sorted by year ; survey questionnaires posted on the survey response pages ; an updated survey response redaction summary , and NAOMS project presentations and associated documentation .
This Web site contains responses collected from the air carrier and general aviation pilot surveys as part of the NASA National Aviation Operational Monitoring Service ( NAOMS ) project from April 2001 through December 2004 .
Relevant information is contained in the accompanying documentation .
In the interest of timeliness , this first release is by nature conservative to ensure the responses do not contain confidential commercial information or information that could compromise the anonymity of individual pilots .
Efforts will be made in 2008 to release additional NAOMS information that was redacted for this release .
NOTE : The responses contained herein , and the methodology used to acquire them , have not been peer - reviewed to date .
Accordingly , no product of the NAOMS project , including the survey methodology , the survey responses , and any analysis of the responses , should be viewed or considered at this stage as having been validated .

昨日の圏論勉強会に少し顔を出しました。そしたら、たけをさんがお絵描き計算（絵算；pictorial calculation）をしていました（この記事を参照）。けっこうめんどくさい計算をお絵描きしていたので、その場でお絵描き2級を授与しました（少し、はやまった気もするが）。
使っていた描き方は、 「 デカルト閉圏における絵算 詳細編 」のものですが、実は 「 デカルト閉圏における絵算 オマケ」で補足訂正しているので、新しい流儀を使ってくださいな。新しい描き方を使うと、ベータ変換、イータ変換がより直感的になります。そのことを以下で説明。
内容：
新しい描き 方
ラムダ抽象（カリー化）により分岐とループができますが、新しい描き方では：
指数baの線（ワイヤー、ケーブル）は、順方向のbと逆方向のaを束ねたものだと考えるのです。ですから、evalの接合部分を写実的に描くとこうなります。
青いワイヤーが逆行しているのがミソ。
ベータ変換のアニメーション
ベータ変換に相当する等式 eval a , b ( Λ a ( f ) , id a ) = f は、次のようになります 。
これをアニメーション（というか、パラパラ漫画）にしましょう。説明は図の後。
ラムダ抽象(λ) とevalの接合器をはずしてワイヤーを露出させます。
aのワイヤーを少し左側に引っ張ると、S字形になります。 aのワイヤーをもっと引っ張るとS字が消えます。 ワイヤーをピンッと張って完了。
引き伸ばしとジグザグ等式
ベータ変換のアニメーションで注目すべきことは、その途中で
S字形のワイヤーが出現して、それが引き伸ばされる
ことです 。
イータ変換は、ある意味でベータ変換の逆と言えますが、その本質的部分は
Λ a ( eval a , b ) = id ba です。この等式をアニメーションで変形すると 、Z字形のワイヤーが引き伸ばされことになります（是非描いてみてください）。
S字形／Z字形のワイヤーの引き伸ばしは、実はコンパクト閉圏の基本的な性質です。次の絵は、「お絵描き圏論」にある絵です。
S字形／Z字形のワイヤーが真っ直ぐに引き伸ばせることは、「三角等式 」「剛性（rigidity）等式」などと呼ばれますが、僕は「ジグザグ等式」という用語が気に入ってます。
ジグザグ等式は、コンパクト閉圏の親類になっている圏、例えばテンソル圏でも中心的な役割を演じ、結び目理論、統計力学、表現論、量子群などとも関係するそうです*2。

WTL recently asked me to explain more on how I get from a blank screen to a published post .
Writing on nearly a dozen blogs in many different niches , while making sure to leave time to do other things in the day can be quite difficult , but there are ways to make it easier on yourself .
The Ideas
First off , I highly recommend brainstorming .
Sit down , come up with a few ideas .
If you are having troubles coming up with anything , look at other blogs in your niche , and see what they have been writing for the past month .
Also , write down some keywords of what you want your blog to be about .
Between your competition , some keywords and your imagination , you should be able to come up with a few ideas .
A good number of ideas is around twenty .
If you have n’t gotten to that point in your brainstorming list , then check out more competitors , do some searches on Technorati and Google ’s Blog Search to see what others have written about in regards to the keywords you have come up with .
I do n’t recommend stealing post ideas , but there is nothing better than reading someone ’s opinion than making you realize what you want to write about .
Maximum Time Spent : 20 minutes
Fleshing it Out
Look at your list of ideas , are there any ideas that could be merged into one post ?
Are there any ideas that could be changed into a few posts ?
Go through and begin grouping ideas together , and creating new ideas off what you have already listed .
Then when it is time to sit down and write a post , take one of your more fully formed ideas , and begin adding to it .
You do n’t have to start at the beginning .
Just write whatever comes to mind in regards to your idea .
I sometimes find that it helps to come up with a title , as it helps set the tone and give a container on what the post will be about .
You should always try to come up with some power phrases .
These are sentences that draw the reader in .
I find quoting other people can be helpful in creating a strong phrase , or thinking of a one sentence summary that wraps everything up .
Closing your post with a strong conclusion can sometimes take a great deal of skill , but when you do it right , it can be very satisfying .
Fleshing out a topic should only take you about five or ten minutes .
Do n’t give it too much time .
Sometimes I just do a bunch of bulleted points I want to make sure I cover in the article .
Maximum Time Spent : 10 minutes
Rough Draft
So now that we have some of what will be the skeleton of the article , it is time to write the rough draft .
Again , you do n’t have to start from the beginning , but I find that my articles flow better if I do .
This really depends on your writing style .
I suggest that when you are doing your rough draft , the only thing you worry about is your spelling .
You can later come back and fix grammar , sentences that run on forever and other little things .
During this phase , you should be writing as much as you can .
I actually delete about a fifth of everything that I write in any one article .
Maximum Time Spent : 20 minutes
Edit
In WordPress , this is where I save my article and check the preview .
I find that I am horrible at editing when I am in the write screen , and miss so many errors , but I notice them much faster when I look at what it will be like published on my site .
The same old tricks apply as writing anything else : read it out loud , look through it backwards , and check it over twice .
I try not to take too much time editing , though I think the “ spelling and grammar nazi ’s ” hate me for it , many of my mistakes do n’t ruin the message I am trying to convey .
That being said , I do try to maintain a reasonable writing quality on all the posts I create .
Maximum Time Spent : 5 minutes
Post
So now that I have an article that is edited for spelling and grammar , I quickly go back and change certain text to links , bold some text , add headings and images to really make the post organized , clean and fit my style .
I select one or two categories that I think it will fit in nicely , and click post .
I then check the article one last time , reading it over , and looking at the headings , and changing things that need to be changed to make the post look and feel perfect .
Maximum Time Spent : 5 minutes
Repeat
Then it is all about repetition .
The average post takes me about forty minutes to write , but that is not including research time , nor brainstorming time .
The good thing about trying to come up with ideas is that I can come up with a dozen or two in one sitting , thus opening up a large number of ideas I can tackle in future posts , including leaving me a wealth of ideas to use when I come up dry on my brainstorming sessions .
At forty minutes a post , add on some research time , a break between each post , and you have around an hour each five hundred word post .
With a pace like that you can do upwards of seven or so high quality posts a day if you are a full time blogger , and maybe two a day in the evenings if you are only part - time .
Other Tips
Do n’t let a post linger –
Try not to let your post ideas be slowly developed , take the time to write them out now , or delete them .
I used to have many drafts in various stages of development , but then the idea gets stale , or changes in your mind .
Get it out to the world while its fresh .
If you think it is going to take you a long time to write , break it down into pieces and change it into a series .
Write often –
The more you write , the faster you will get .
I can do about eighty or more words per minute , and my spelling and grammar have improved .
I have to take more breaks now that I swear my wrists and hands are fairly damaged , but when I can write , I write fast .
Enjoy it –
If you are not writing about something you enjoy , then it wo n’t be any good , even if you are being paid the “ big bucks ” .
I know this from experience .
Stick to what you enjoy , and the words will pour out of your brain much faster .
What ’s your writing process ?

Regexes suck at math .
To a regex engine , the characters 0 through 9 are no more special than any others .
I should mention that there are a couple exceptions .
Perl and PCRE allow dynamic code to be run at any point during the matching process , which presents a great deal of extra potential .
Perl does this with code embedded in the regex ; PCRE with callouts to external functions .
But those regex flavors are the exceptions , and even with them the extended capabilities only take you so far .
Generally , math - related problems such as matching numeric ranges ( useful for tasks like matching a set of years within longer text ) are a pain in the a** to deal with , when they 're possible at all .
However , the power and expressiveness of even basic regular expression syntax can lead to some nifty tricks .
Things like matching only non-prime - length strings !
The primality regex is somewhat famous now , but another hack that might surprise you is using regexes to solve a simple class of linear equations .
I stumbled on the idea for this pattern while messing around with RegexBuddy 's awesome debugger .
The implementation itself is dead simple and should work pretty much universally , with the exception of strict POSIX ERE implementations or other esoteric flavors which do n't allow backreferences .
Here 's the template :
^(.*) \1{A−1} (.*) \2{B−1 } $
That lets us solve for x and y with an equation like 17 x + 12 y = 51 .
A and B are placeholders for constants that in this case are 17 and 12 .
So , the regex becomes ^(.*) \1{16}(.*) \2{11}$ .
We subtract one from values A and B because we 're repeating backreferences to subpatterns that have already matched once before .
If you run that regex against a 51 - character string , the length of $ 1 ( backreference one ) will be 3 ( which tells us that x = 3 ) , and the length of $ 2 ( backreference two ) will be 0 ( meaning that y = 0 ) .
Indeed , 17×3 + 12×0 = 51 .
If the problem is unsolvable , the regex will not match the string .
If there are multiple possible solutions , the one with the highest value of x will be returned since x is handled earlier in the regex .
PRINCETON , NJ -- John McCain's 67 % favorable rating is the highest of any of the three major candidates running for president , and ties for his highest in Gallup polling history .
McCain 's favorable rating matches the 67 % he received in February 2000 , when he was in the middle of his first run for president .
But since that point , McCain 's image in the eyes of Americans has undergone significant shifts .
The Arizona senator had favorable ratings in the 57 % range as he began his presidential campaign last winter , but as his campaign floundered this past summer , his favorable rating dropped as low as 41 % .
At that point , many observers had written off the former POW 's campaign .
But McCain came roaring back , winning the New Hampshire primary and then clinching the Republican nomination .
His current favorable rating represents a gain of 26 points since last summer , including an 11 - point increase since he won enough delegates to ensure his nomination on March 4 .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama 's favorable rating is now at 62 % , by one point the highest Gallup has recorded for Obama since the first reading in December 2006 ( at which point almost half of Americans did not know enough about him to give him a rating ) .
Obama 's ratings have been fairly stable in recent months , ranging between only 58 % and 61 % across five Gallup Polls conducted since January .
Hillary Clinton 's favorable rating , 53 % , is significantly lower than those of the other two candidates , in part no doubt because of her long history in the public eye , including eight years as first lady in her husband 's administration .
Still , this is Clinton 's highest favorable rating since October of last year .
Clinton over the years has seen a number of ups and downs in her image .
Her highest favorable rating of 67 % came in December 1998 , just as her husband was being impeached for charges relating to his involvement with a White House intern .
Since then , however , her rating has fallen as low as 44 % in March 2001 , and 45 % as recently as April of last year .
Her current rating represents an increase of five points since late February ( prior to her wins in the crucial Ohio and Texas primaries ) .
Both Obama and Clinton have slightly higher favorable ratings among Democrats now than they had in February , suggesting that the negative infighting that has characterized the Democratic campaign in recent weeks is not damaging either candidate 's image in the eyes of the party faithful .
One reason for the higher favorable ratings McCain and Obama enjoy is their cross-appeal to Americans who identify with the " other " party .
McCain gets an extraordinarily high 52 % favorable from Democrats and independents who lean Democratic , while Obama gets a 39 % favorable rating from Republicans and Republican leaners .
Clinton , on the other hand , receives only a 20 % favorable rating from Republicans and Republican leaners .
McCain is also helped by the fact that he receives an 87 % favorable rating from Republicans , higher than the 80 % and 79 % that Clinton and Obama , respectively , currently receive from Democrats .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,025 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 14 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - A controversial land swap proposal could open portions of an Alaska wildlife refuge to oil drilling , dividing Alaska natives and stoking opposition from environmentalists seeking to protect the bears , moose and birds that live there .
A general view of the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge is seen in an undated handout photo .

Supporters of the plan to exchange land in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge , which lies just south of the more - famous Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , say they would like the plan to be approved by the administration of President George W. Bush before the election in November .
“ The window is the election , ” Alaska Republican Rep .
Don Young , a staunch backer of the plan , said at an Anchorage news conference .
“ We ’d like to have an executive order out of the administration before they leave office . ”
The proposed land trade would give 110,000 acres of hydrocarbon - prone uplands within the refuge , plus mineral rights to another 97,000 acres , to Fairbanks - based Doyon Ltd .
In exchange , the refuge would gain 150,000 acres of bird - friendly wetlands now owned by Doyon , plus 56,500 acres on which Doyon has pending land claims .
Doyon , owned by Athabascan Indians of interior Alaska , has long envisioned such a trade to give economic benefits to its shareholders while preserving traditional culture and the environment on which it depends .
“ You can have both the subsistence lifestyle and the protection of that lifestyle , and you can have oil and gas exploration , ” said Norm Phillips , Doyon ’s resource manager .
But many people living closest to the potential development -- many of them Doyon shareholders -- oppose the plan because of the likelihood of oil pollution and the possibility of social upheaval such as a flow of drugs , alcohol and poachers over new roads .
“ Usually , the indigenous people are at the losing end of any sort of oil development , ” said Dacho Alexander , first chief of the Gwichyaa Zhee Gwich ’in Tribe in Fort Yukon , a village of 600 near the proposed exchange parcels .
Alexander said the dispute illustrates the perennial clash between corporate goals and noneconomic Native values .
The Yukon Flats basin holds an estimated 173 million barrels of oil -- accounting for less than nine days of U.S. consumption at current rates -- along with 5.5 trillion cubic feet of gas and 127 million barrels of natural - gas liquids , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
It also holds unique ecological values .
Straddling the Arctic Circle , cradled by two mountain ranges and bisected by the Yukon River , the refuge encompasses boreal forests that support moose , grizzly and black bears and many other mammals .
Its network of lakes , streams , ponds and sloughs attract Alaska ’s highest concentrations of breeding ducks .
It has some of Alaska ’s coldest winter days and , thanks to around - the - clock sunlight , scorching summer temperatures as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit , the hottest for this latitude in North America .
Fran Mauer , a retired Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and prominent critic of the land exchange , says the trade plan violates the refuge ’s conservation mission .
“ I just do n’t see that it ’s in the public ’s interest to do it , ” he said .
But Doyon officials say that no matter what land the corporation ends up owning , oil and gas drilling is inevitable in the Yukon Flats .
“ Even if the land trade does n’t happen , Doyon is still going to move forward with exploration out there , ” Phillips said .

Millions of people with respiratory diseases have relied on oxygen equipment , delivered to their homes , to help them breathe .
A basic setup , including three years of deliveries of small oxygen tanks , can be bought from pharmacies and other retailers for as little as $ 3,500 , or about $ 100 a month .
Unless , that is , the buyer is Medicare , the government health care program for older Americans .
Despite enormous buying power , Medicare pays far more .
Rather than buy oxygen equipment outright , Medicare rents it for 36 months before patients take ownership , and pays for a variety of services that critics say are often unnecessary .
The total cost to taxpayers and patients is as much as $ 8,280 , or more than double what somebody might spend at a drugstore .
The high expense of oxygen equipment — which cost Medicare over $ 1.8 billion last year — is hardly an anomaly .
It ’s been a long while since one of the Democratic presidential candidates when after the Republican presidential candidate , so this was a very welcome development .
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama said Thursday that Sen. John McCain reversed his position on President Bush ’s deep tax cuts in order to win the Republican presidential nomination , one of his sharpest criticisms yet of the Arizona senator he hopes to face this fall .
Criticizing GOP efforts to extend major tax cuts from Bush ’s first term and to eliminate the estate tax , Obama said : “ These are all steps that John McCain rightly said were irresponsible when they first came up . ”
“ He made a decision to reverse himself on that , ” Obama told reporters as he flew from Chicago to Washington for a series of Senate votes on budget issues .
“ That was how , I guess , you got your ticket punched to be the Republican nominee , ” he said of McCain .
“ But he was right then , and he ’s wrong now . ”
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said in a statement that if Obama is nominated , “ the American people will have a clear choice : John McCain will cut taxes while Senator Obama will raise them , hurting our economy and costing jobs for hardworking Americans . ”
Of course that ’s what McCain ’s spokesman said .
We probably could have written the quote before it was uttered .
The point is , Obama did n’t go after Hillary Clinton ; in the midst of a heated Democratic primary , he went after John McCain .
Can we have more of this please ?
Say , every day for the foreseeable future ?
I ’m increasingly of the opinion that this prolonged Democratic primary process is going to seriously undermine the party ’s chances of winning in November , but I ’ll concede that there are some clear advantages — most notably , we can watch two Democratic heavyweights go after the Republican candidate at the same time , while the GOP has two moving targets .
This benefit disappears , of course , when the Dems go after each other , which is all the more reason for them to target McCain .
It might even help them make the case to superdelegates : “ Look at how effectively I ’m going after John McCain now .
If you ’d like to see more of this in the fall , I ’m your candidate . ”
Frankly , I ’m almost indifferent to which issue(s )
Dems pick to go after McCain — I ’m more interested that they go after McCain — but taxes is as good as any .
The Arizona senator is clearly vulnerable on the issue — he ’s flip - flopped , he ’s offering tax cuts that his campaign admits he can’t pay for , he ’s embracing the policies of a wildly unpopular president , and he ’s advocating more irresponsible cuts that most Americans realize wo n’t help them anyway .
Indeed , gone are the days that a Republican can just shout “ tax and spend ! ” and hope voters will recoil .
Americans have heard all the tax - cut rhetoric from McCain ’s mentor ( George W. Bush ) , and they realize the policies do n’t actually help them in any way .
So , Clinton and Obama , by all means , go after McCain on taxes .
And foreign policy .
And health care .
And energy , education , poverty , homeland security , and everything else .
Just do n’t destroy each other .
In one of my favorite movies , “ Office Space , ” Bill Lumbergh puts up a soul - crushing banner in the workplace that reads , “ Is this good for the company ? ” and encourages every employee to ponder this question with “ every decision you make . ”
I ’d like the Clinton and Obama campaigns to consider a similar banner for their headquarters : “ Is this going to help Democrats win in 2008 ? ”
If you ’re repeating Republican talking points , you ’re not helping .
If you ’re praising Republican candidates , you ’re not helping .
If you ’re intentionally dividing the Democratic electorate with ugly attacks based on race or gender , you ’re really not helping .
If you ’re challenging John McCain on an important policy matter , you ’re helping .
This article refers to a previous USA - England matchup .
Follow the latest England v USA match here .
England were off the pace but managed to overwhelm and beat an even worse USA side .
Seeing as the England team were coming off a full season and the US team were playing away from home , both teams could have done a lot better and will come away disappointed .
Liviu and Graham have done their match reports for each team :

England v USA
Wednesday , 28 May 2008 , Wembley
England squad for the US and Trinidad & Tobago games ( England play in Port of Spain on June 1 ) added at the end .
The USA will travel to London to play England in a friendly at Wembley on 28 May .
Both teams will use the fixture as part of their preparations for their respective 2010 World Cup qualifying campaigns .
Both sides have placed an emphasis on playing against tough opposition in a bid to improve their international performances ( arguably this is more of a test for the USA than England , but a good deal better than playing Trinidad & Tobago ) .
The USA will be taking on Spain on 4 June 08 and Argentina on 8 June 08 as part of summer friendlies .
England take on Trinidad on June 1st and have also scheduled a friendly with the Czech Republic at Wembley on 20 August 08 .
The friendly will be the first game for the Czech Republic after June ’s European Championship in Austria and Switzerland .
The last meeting between England and USA was played in Chicago in 2005 , ending in a 2 - 1 win for England .
Seeing as England have just wrapped up their season while the USA are smack in the middle of their own MLS season , it ’ll be interesting to see how much of a role fitness levels and fatigue play in determining the outcome of the game .
England Squad :
James ( Portsmouth ) , Hart ( Man City ) , Joe Lewis ( Petersborough ) , Bridge ( Chelsea ) , Brown ( Man Utd ) , A Cole ( Chelsea ) , Ferdinand ( Man Utd ) , Jagielka ( Everton ) , Johnson ( Portsmouth ) , Terry ( Chelsea ) , Warnock ( Blackburn ) , Wheater ( Middlesbrough ) , Woodgate ( Tottenham ) , Barry ( Aston Villa ) , Beckham ( LA Galaxy ) , Bentley ( Blackburn ) , J Cole ( Chelsea ) , Downing ( Middlesbrough ) , Hargreaves ( Man Utd ) , Huddlestone ( Tottenham ) , Gerrard ( Liverpool ) , Lampard ( Chelsea ) , Walcott ( Arsenal ) , Young , Agbonlahor ( both Aston Villa ) , Ashton ( West Ham ) , Crouch ( Liverpool ) , Defoe ( Portsmouth ) , Rooney ( Man Utd ) .

Barack Obama has lost it .
Not the Democrat nomination – he remains the favourite in that increasingly bitter battle ; no , what he has lost is the aura of invincible charm which had hitherto repelled all incoming fire , like some invisible force - field .
That has disappeared with the publication of his remarks to a private dinner for wealthy Democrat donors in San Francisco about his difficulties in attracting support from the blue - collar vote in the de-industrialising Midwest .
That sophisticated audience laughed – it's on tape – when he told them how such people found it hard to buy the message of " a 46 - year - old black man named Barack Obama " .
Oddly , it was not this explicit imputation of racism against people whose votes he had failed to capture which has caused Obama the biggest problem .
It was his follow - up remarks : " They get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or ... anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The most extraordinary thing is that Obama has actually been pandering to the " bitterness " he identified – the " anti- trade sentiment " .
In the rust belts of Ohio and Pennsylvania the Senator from Illinois has lost no opportunity to blame America 's economic woes on the free - trade treaty with Canada and Mexico ( Nafta ) – which had been enacted by President Clinton .
Obama is one of three Congressional sponsors of " The Patriot Employer Act " , which seeks to give preferential tax status to American companies that choose not to invest overseas .
His anti-globalisation rhetoric goes far beyond criticism of free - trade deals such as Nafta .
Obama told voters in New Hampshire : " I would stop the import of all toys from China " .
China supplies 80 per cent of the toys sold in the US , so that 's one heck of a pile of embargoed fluffy bunnies .
Obama 's electoral calculations , at least , are rational : recent polls suggest that three quarters of voters believe that international trade has " made things worse for Americans " .
So as not to appear " protectionist " – perish the thought – Obama graciously concedes that " not every American job lost is due to trade " .
Not every job ?
The true figure – according to the apolitical US Council of Economic Advisors – is that only 3 per cent of US job losses can be attributed to " outsourcing " .
Other figures which are never discussed are those measuring the " insourcing " of jobs , when companies from foreign countries have invested in the US .
The value of those investments has been staggering – the biggest secret in a debate conducted ( at least in the Democrat primaries ) at a shocking level of ignorance .
The two Democrat candidates have made frequent attacks on the multi-billion dollar US trade deficit with Canada and Mexico : what Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama never acknowledge is that almost 95 per cent of the growth in that deficit since 2000 is entirely attributable to oil and gas imports .
Are they seriously suggesting that America would be better off buying oil from countries without preferential trade status , such as Chavez 's Venezuela or Ahmedinejad 's Iran ?
In fact , over the past year America 's trade deficit has narrowed by $ 50 bn ( £ 25 bn ) , as her exports have risen faster than imports ; aided by the dramatic fall in the value of the dollar , international trade is helping the US to fight recession .
This would be especially appreciated by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke : Dr Bernanke made his name as an economist specialising in the causes of the Great Depression – which you might think is just as well , given the role which history ( or rather President Bush , which is not quite the same thing ) has allotted him .
Dr Bernanke 's dramatic cuts in interest rates demonstrate that he has no wish to repeat the errors of the Central Banking authorities of 1929 , who tightened monetary policy in the teeth of a recession ; but the Fed Chairman has no power to prevent a repetition of the other disaster of that era , created entirely by politicians – a protectionist trade policy .
This was a policy solely designed to preserve American jobs : it slaughtered them .
The Smoot - Hawley Tariff
Act of 1930 was named after its two Republican sponsors , and passed by President Herbert Hoover , who ignored a petition against it signed – remarkably – by 1,028 economists .
As Bernanke has written : " Although we economists are indeed a contentious bunch , one proposition commands almost unanimous assent .
That proposition is that free trade among nations promotes economic prosperity . "
With shattering predictability , America 's trading partners retaliated against the Smoot - Hawley Act with import tariffs against US goods .
By 1933 US imports had plunged by two thirds – and exports by a similar amount .
The economy of a great trading nation all but vaporised , as a domestic stock - market led recession was transformed into a worldwide Depression .
John McCain is not quite of an age to recall all that personally ; but it must help to have been born in the 1930s – he is absolutely not prepared to pander to protectionism in the manner of his competing Democrat opponents .
Not only has he refused to appease such " anti- trade sentiments " , he has been courageous in tackling them head on .
This week McCain travelled to recession - hit Youngstown , right in the heart of the old Ohio steel - producing belt – where Clinton and Obama had been most strident in their anti-free trade rhetoric — and told a town hall meeting : " The biggest problem is not free trade , but our inability to adjust to a new world economy .
I can't look you in the eye and tell you that I believe those jobs are coming back ... [ but ] protectionism and isolationism have never worked in American history . "
Reporters described McCain 's speech as " risky " .
Indeed it was – he will need to win the support of such town hall meetings to secure the Presidency .
It was a demonstration of pure political courage – something which Barack Obama has yet to provide : I can't find a single speech of his – brilliantly constructed and delivered as they are - in which he did anything of the kind .
Thus Obama has a bit of a laugh with a well - heeled bunch of business folk in San Francisco about the " anti- trade sentiment " and insularity of the Midwestern industrial working class ; meanwhile he tells those " anti- trade " blue - collar workers that he agrees with them – something must be done about those Mexicans and Chinese " taking American jobs " .
My guess is that the real Obama is the San Francisco one : recall how one of his most senior advisors told the Canadians not to worry about his anti-free trade rhetoric – it was just campaign trail stuff .
The trouble is that Barack Obama has now promised Americans that he will legislate in an attempt to prevent their jobs being lost to foreign competition .
If he does not do so as President , they will feel betrayed .
If he does so , it will be an even bigger betrayal .

A - List Celebrities Hit Red Carpet in NYC for UNICEF ( Photos )
andwere part of a star studded crowd who gathered at a New York charity gala in support of UNICEF .
The United Nations headquarters was the backdrop for the celebrity event
Other A - List party goers included Gwen Stefani , Gavin Rossdale , Selma Hayek , Gwyneth Paltrow , Heidi Klum , Brooke Shields , Alicia Keys , Dita Von Teese , Ashton Kutcher , Demi Moore , Madonna , Lourdes Richie , Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes .
Lopez is getting very close to delivering her twins but that did n't stop the singer from hitting the red carpet .
She looked quite stunning in a long flowing gown .
Check out all of the celebrity photos .
There 's a larger game in play in the Newark courtroom , too , according to the generic companies , and it became more interesting a few weeks ago .
As Schering - Plough holds the generics at bay with one hand , it had hoped to receive F.D.A. approval in time to introduce desloratadine , its second - generation version of Claritin that will be marketed as Clarinex , this spring .
'' The longer the litigation is dragged out , '' says Elliot F. Hahn , president of Andrx , '' the more opportunity they have to market desloratadine to physicians and switch them from the Claritin line to the desloratadine line . ''
But that plan ran into a major snag in mid-February , when Schering - Plough revealed that the approval of desloratadine was being held up until the company corrects manufacturing deficiencies cited by the F.D.A. at four of its plants .
What to do in a crisis ?
Market !
Several days later , as the company 's stock plunged and attorneys hustled to organize shareholder lawsuits , Schering - Plough announced big new '' consumer education ' ' and pharmacy programs for Claritin -- the ' ' largest and most comprehensive allergy initiative of its kind . ''
The company plans to distribute 35 million free drug samples to doctors , 6 million allergy brochures , 65,000 drugstore displays and , yes , 350 million more of those little blue pharmacy bags .
Finally , an edifying case of sticker shock .
Late last fall , my allergist prescribed a month 's supply of Claritin - D to clear up some congestion before I started my first round of allergy desensitization shots .
The pharmacy had misplaced my insurance number , so when I went to pick up the prescription , the clerk handed me a bill for $ 103 .
This is the consumer 's trickle - down tab for the roughly $ 250 million in drug development , more than $ 100 million a year in consumer advertising , many millions in closed - door marketing , $ 20 million in lobbying and political contributions , $ 5 million a year for litigation .
I was stunned that it was so expensive , and I asked myself a question that is a normal part of every marketplace but health care .
If I had to pay $ 103 out of my own pocket , would I buy this medicine ?
Was it worth it ?
With the exception of elderly people on Medicare and the uninsured , most of us never ask that question .
In a recent conversation , Gillian Shepherd , a Manhattan allergy specialist , addressed the same point , noting that antihistamines like Claritin and Allegra are about equal in potency to over - the - counter drugs like Chlor - Trimeton .
And while some patients experience sedation with these drugs , many do not .
'' Fifty percent of the population can tolerate most of them without any sedation , '' she explained .
'' The feeling is that if there 's a chance of sedation and third parties are paying , why not use the nonsedating drugs ?
If people were paying out of pocket , the story would be completely different . ''
As I labored to sort through all the clinical data and all the confusing advertising , I found myself wishing that we had reviewers who would talk bluntly about new drugs , who could discuss efficacy , safety and value from the consumer 's point of view , who could deconstruct the advertising , who would include cost as a criterion .
But those are medical judgments , some would say , and only doctors should dispense them .
True , but many doctors , it turns out , have largely abdicated that responsibility -- they rarely know what a drug costs , and as Shepherd mentioned , many learn about the properties of a given drug not from the medical literature but from company salesmen , who are paid to tell one - sided stories .
And so what ?
Richard Kogan , Schering 's C.E.O. , testified before Congress two years ago that drug companies need constant and ample revenue streams to support their enormous and dicey R&D enterprise , and he 's right .
In order to be competitive in this post - genomic era , large pharmaceutical companies need to spend $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion a year on research to develop new drugs .
The industry has developed many remarkable medicines , and more are on the way .
But if high drug prices are a kind of innovation tax for American consumers , we should at least demand innovation in return .
Many high - priced , successful drugs , like Zyrtec , are developed overseas and simply marketed here by American companies .
Moreover , a significant amount of pharmaceutical innovation currently occurs in the biotech sector , where small , cutting - edge companies typically license their discoveries to big pharma , which has the marketing expertise .
What innovative new drugs does Schering , for example , have in the pipeline , subsidized by the billions of dollars earned from Claritin ?
Financial analysts are mixed on the company 's potential treatments -- for cancer , asthma , high cholesterol and several other major diseases -- but a leading candidate for future blockbuster status is . . . desloratadine , the chemical that is the principal metabolite , or breakdown product , of Claritin .
Anyone who has taken Claritin has already had desloratadine in his or her body .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , heading home after a two - day visit to Iraq , again touted his country 's closer relations with Iraq and reiterated his criticism of the United States .
" No one likes them , " Ahmadinejad told reporters prior to returning to Iran , referring to the predominantly U.S. makeup of coalition forces in Iraq .
" We believe that the forces which crossed oceans and thousands of kilometers to come to this region should leave this region and hand over the affairs to the peoples and government of this region , " Ahmadinejad said .
His visit follows trips to Iran last year by top officials of Iraq 's Shiite - led government , which has been fostering a closer relationship with predominantly Shiite Iran since the Saddam Hussein regime was toppled by U.S. - led forces in 2003 .
His visit was greeted warmly by Iraq 's Shiite Muslim leaders , whose links to Iran predate the overthrow of Hussein .
Ahmadinejad met with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , other politicians , clerics , tribal leaders and academics .
At the same time , many Sunni Muslims in Iraq who dislike the Iranian regime demonstrated against his visit .
Watch as Iraqis protest the visit »
In a news briefing on Monday , Ahmadinejad said the two countries , which fought an eight - year war in the 1980s , had signed memorandums of understanding , such as economic and border agreements , and would sign many more .
On Sunday , Ahmadinejad announced plans to link Iran 's electrical grid with neighboring Iraq .
The two countries have already signed a deal to construct cross - border pipelines .

The Iranian president made digs at the United States .
He contrasted his trip , which was advertised in advance , with the " stealth " visits of others , a reference to visits by U.S. officials who sometimes do not broadcast their visits to Iraq for security reasons .
Sunday 's official welcome and meeting with Talabani took place at the presidential house outside the heavily fortified Green Zone .
And his early Monday visit to the Imam Moussa al - Kadhim shrine in Kadhimiya , the Shiite district in northwestern Baghdad , served to underscore his point that he could move more openly and with confidence around Baghdad .
He repeated his criticism of the U.S. position that Iran was backing violence in Iraq .
The United States has accused Iran of supporting insurgent groups in Iraq , including supplying explosively formed penetrators , the deadliest and most sophisticated type of roadside bomb .

" We do not care about their statements and remarks because they make statements based on erroneous information .
We cannot count on what they say , " Ahmadinejad said .
He said coalition forces " should n't interfere in the affairs of regional countries " and " should allow the region 's countries to run their own affairs . "
In Washington , U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said the United States supported Iraq 's efforts to conduct its " diplomatic relations the way it sees fit .
" These are two countries that are going to have to have relations with one another , " he said , referring to Iraq and Iran .
Casey said there were no indications that " Iran is willing to modify its behavior . "
But he said Washington hopes that the relationship presents an " opportunity for the Iranians to explain and perhaps take real action to deal with some of the problems we have pointed out in the way they manage their relationship . "
After Ahmadinejad left Iraq , Talabani 's office issued a 14 - point joint statement from Talabani and Ahmadinejad that underscored the importance of " good neighborliness and non-interference " and the need to improve ties and resolve disagreements .
It called for strengthening cooperation in gas and oil development and widening commercial cooperation .
Iraq thanked Iran for a $ 1 billion loan to support Iraq 's economy and rebuild its infrastructure .
Iran emphasized its support for Iraq 's efforts to forge national unity .
Ahmadinejad 's visit coincided with that of Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
On Sunday , in northern Iraq , he walked openly on the streets of Hawaija , a former al Qaeda in Iraq bastion now described in a Pentagon news release as " a market crowded with people and shops stocked with goods . "

The regulations impose limits on dominant suppliers
The European Commission has given permission for the regulations to lapse following a review of competition among broadband wholesalers in the UK .
The review revealed that in 64 % of UK markets competition was fierce enough to prevent any broadband wholesaler winning a dominant position .
Following the review , regulator Ofcom said its final decision about scrapping regulations would come later in 2008 .
Dominant position
Ofcom imposes regulations on companies which offer wholesale broadband services that telecoms firms then re-sell to consumers for home internet access .
The regulations were first brought in to guard against former monopoly BT getting a stranglehold on the market and to encourage new entrants into the telecoms and net - access sector .
The Commission said in a statement that in many parts of Britain , BT faces competition from four or more other wholesalers who have installed their own equipment in telephone exchanges .
" For many of these areas ex-ante regulation is no longer warranted " , said Neelie Kroes , competition commissioner at the EC .
The Commission review found that there were , or about to be , four or more competitors in 64 % of UK regions - typically around exchanges which serve 10,000 or more premises .
" In those places there 's not the opportunity for a single provider to discriminate and act against the best interests of the consumer , " said an Ofcom spokeswoman .
Regions would remain under review in case one supplier became dominant .
' Green light '
Ms Kroes added that the Commission had responded to a consultation about Ofcom 's proposal to scrap regulations and welcomed the " unprecedented " backing the regulator had won .
The consultation process still had some time to run and , once it was complete , Ofcom would issue its final decision .
" The Commission has given us the green light but our proposals are still proposals , " she said .

MEPs want EU leaders to take a tougher stance over the Olympics
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution urging EU leaders to boycott the Beijing Olympics ' opening ceremony .
MEPs want China to begin a dialogue with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama by August .
The resolution firmly condemns " the brutal repression " by China in last month 's crackdown on Tibetan protests .
It also calls for a UN inquiry into the events .
Although non-binding , it will increase pressure on EU leaders to take a tougher stance towards China .
The resolution further calls on Beijing to respect its commitments to human and minority rights .
It comes as UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has confirmed he will not attend the opening of the Olympics on 8 August .
Euro - MPs clapped as the resolution was carried with a large majority .
It urges EU leaders to adopt a united stance on Tibet , including the option of boycotting the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics .
The assembly cannot decide EU foreign policy , but together with human rights campaigners , it is exerting strong pressure on EU governments to take a tougher line towards China , one of Europe 's main trading partners .
And that collective pressure seems to be working as , one by one , the leaders of the biggest EU countries indicate they might stay away .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she never intended to go to Beijing .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who will chair the EU during the Olympic Games , has suggested he might consider boycotting the event unless China opens a dialogue with the Dalai Lama to find a political solution to the unrest .

IS IT possible — even in theory — for an organisation to work too hard for the benefit of humanity , or to devote too much money to the eradication of a deadly disease ?
To judge by some of the recent bickering between leading players in the field of global health , there are serious people who in answer to those questions would say , “ paradoxically enough , yes . ”
At the heart of the argument is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which has often been called the biggest philanthropic organisation — at least among those whose accounts and internal workings are open to public scrutiny — in the world .
Since Mr and Mrs Gates ( pictured above ) established the charity in 2000 , it has spent over $ 8 billion on improving global health , and won deservedly lavish praise for its efforts .
But just as huge , powerful countries can be awkward neighbours — a Canadian leader once likened his country 's relations with the United States to a mouse bedding down with an elephant — lavishly funded organisations can sometimes cause resentment among other outfits which are struggling to do a similar job .
And whether because of jealousy or legitimate concerns , the Gates Foundation has not been having such an easy time of late with its public image .
The philanthropic world was well enough prepared for the recent announcement that Patricia Stonesifer , the foundation 's charismatic boss , will move on before the end of the year — but it was surprised that no successor was named .
More seriously , perhaps , the New York Times this week published bits of an internal document from the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) — a letter from its chief malaria - fighter to the agency 's boss , Margaret Chan — which alleged that the Gates Foundation was having a negative influence on research into killer diseases .
The letter from Arata Kochi , a feisty veteran of the global public - health scene , said the excessive sway of the Gates Foundation was distorting research priorities and quashing independent thinking by sweeping up the best scientists and keeping them “ locked up in a cartel ” .
However unintended this effect might be , the charity 's might was marring the process of peer review because researchers were now bunched into groups which were competing for Gates funding , and each member of such a group had “ a vested interest to safeguard the work of the other ” .
Dr Kochi's outburst prompted some other critics of the Seattle - based charity to reiterate their own long - nursed complaints .
Some blame the foundation for being slow to specify areas it will definitely not invest in ; as a result , they say , smaller outfits fear to enter certain fields , because of the risk that the Gates people will jump in .
Others also worry that the foundation concentrates too much on glamorous science and long - term technology bets , and not enough on putting boots on the ground in places like Africa .
What do these criticisms add up to ?
Not much , if officialdom is to be believed .
A spokesman for Dr Chan insists the charges attributed to Dr Kochi do not reflect her organisation 's official views .
The Gates Foundation , keen to avoid a public row , also downplays them .
And yet Dr Kochi remains unbowed .
He still insists that the foundation 's massive spending on malaria research is a classic case of a near - monopoly leading to market failure : in this case , a market in medical prowess .
Not that he resents everything the Gates Foundation did to combat malaria : governments , he notes , had failed to invest in this area , so the foundation 's decision to throw money at malaria was laudable .
But there were unforeseen effects : “ Gates can solve problems with money — but a lot of money leads to a monopoly , and discourages smaller rivals and intellectual competition . ”
Dr Kochi also challenges the foundation 's recent proclamation that the total eradication of malaria is a realistic goal .
“ Like going to the moon , it sounds really good , ” he says — but he is still convinced that this dream is impossible to fulfil with the current tools , and that trying to do so may have bad side - effects .
Such “ over - reach ” , in Dr Kochi 's view , amounts to a costly , risky diversion of resources away from the realistic aim of just controlling malaria .
He also says the foundation bets too much on particular treatments , such as the artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) — a combination of drugs based on Chinese herbs .
Although ACT does work better than older therapies , there are signs that drug - resistant strains of the disease are emerging .
Dr Kochi frets about what will happen if , under the Gates influence , malaria researchers put “ all the eggs in that one basket . ”
How substantial are these charges ?
It is plain that the organisation 's wealth and targeted approach do attract clusters of leading researchers to specific areas ; indeed , that is the whole idea .
It is also true , argues Laurie Garrett of the Council on Foreign Relations , an American think - tank , that the charity 's focus on “ measurable outcomes in a short time , while a fantastic improvement on the past , exacerbates the devastating shortages of health - care workers on the ground . ”
Even Tadataka Yamada , head of the Gates Foundation 's global health efforts , admits that in the past it may have focused too much on high - profile research and not enough on boosting entire health systems .
But some good points can be made in defence of the Gates approach .
First of all , argues Dr Yamada , calling this organisation an emerging monopoly is “ way off base ” .
The foundation often collaborates with other charities , and jostles with other big agencies and newish funders , such as PEPFAR ( George Bush 's AIDS effort ) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
This week the White House announced yet another tropical health initiative : a $ 350 m effort to combat seven neglected diseases .
Dr Yamada also challenges the “ eggs in one basket ” theory .
Although it is true that Mr Gates personally has argued for the eradication of malaria , and that his charity does heavily support ACT therapies , the charity also uses a range of other approaches , like malaria vaccines and bed nets .
Dr Yamada says frankly that “ we do n't have to choose between one thing and the other : we have enough resources to do both . ”
That , of course , is just the sort of cockiness that rankles with health pundits .
At least in part , the gripes against the Gates Foundation are the churlish growls of a jealous crowd of bureaucrats and labourers at less influential charities .
Some people at the WHO , a Geneva - based arm of the United Nations , openly worry that the foundation is setting up a new power centre that may rival their organisation 's authority .
Such conspiracy theorists point to the foundation 's recent grant of over $ 100 m to the University of Washington to evaluate health treatments and monitor national health systems — jobs supposed to be done by the UN agency .
Therein lies an irony .
The WHO , one of whose captains now calls the Gates Foundation monopolistic , used itself to hold a monopoly in the fight against malaria , and it did a lousy job as a result .
Indeed , Dr Kochi himself has been refreshingly frank about the WHO 's poor record in fighting the disease .
The agency has also been criticised for accepting poor data from member countries which may downplay bad news .
As Dr Chan says candidly , that charge “ is a reality ” .
It is not her role , she says , to “ name and shame ” countries ; she prefers to exert private pressure .
But she acknowledges that some public pressure is essential , and applauds the role played by the media and charities in “ shining the light ” on previously obscure places .
A big new non-government organisation , crashing into the jungle like a young elephant , is bound to cause resentment , and perhaps bound to have unintended ripple effects .
But without this elephant 's input of new money and ideas , the battle - front against malaria and other deadly diseases might present an even worse picture , especially if the field were left to governments and inter-governmental bodies .

Nicolas Sarkozy is backing Tony Blair 's campaign to become the first President of Europe in return for the way Peter Mandelson secretly helped him win the French Presidency , it was claimed last night .
The suggestion of a secret EU Presidency deal between the three men will enrage Gordon Brown , who has always blamed Mr Mandelson for the way Mr Blair pipped him to the post of Labour leader in 1994 .
A senior member of Mr Sarkozy 's inner circle claims the French President regards his support for Mr Blair 's bid to become Europe 's first fully fledged political leader as a " quid pro quo " for EU Commissioner Mr Mandelson 's help in winning last year 's election .

Tony Blair is calling for support to tackle climate change and cut global carbon emissions
" Discussions were arranged between Mandelson and Sarkozy after Sarkozy asked to be put in touch with him , " said Mr Sarkozy 's confidant .
" Sarkozy wanted to copy what Blair had done in Britain and believed that taking advice from Peter was the best way to do it .
" In return , Sarkozy wants to help Blair become EU President .
From Sarkozy 's point of view it is part of the deal . "
The disclosure comes three weeks before Mr Sarkozy 's state visit to Britain with his new wife , Italian model Carla Bruni , and is likely to spark controversy on both sides of the Channel .

Mr Sarkozy 's Blairite style brought him to power on a tidal wave of popularity - but since then his ratings have plummeted as a result of his tangled love life .
And his political opponents have stepped up their attacks on him for backing Mr Blair as EU President .
The Sarkozy camp 's claim that it is part of a secret deal involving Mr Mandelson caused an angry response from Mr Brown 's allies last night .
" Peter Mandelson should learn to stop meddling in British politics , " said one .
" Gordon has never forgiven him for switching sides to Blair when John Smith died .
" If some kind of deal has been stitched up between Mandelson , Sarkozy and Blair , the British public has a right to know about it . "

Relations between Mr Mandelson and Mr Brown are so bad that Mr Mandelson will not be seeking the usual second term as an EU Commissioner , denying Mr Brown the satisfaction of using his power to dismiss him .
Mr Mandelson 's hallmarks were clearly visible in Mr Sarkozy 's successful election campaign , including New Labour - style glitzy public relations stunts , pledges on law and order , welfare , community relations and offering jobs to traditional political opponents .
A spokesman at the French President 's Elysée Palace would not discuss Mr Sarkozy 's dealings with Peter Mandelson , commenting : " We would not comment on such strategic matters , or on private meetings between individuals . "

The troop surge in and around Baghdad began in February
There is no single reliable source for statistics but a number agree on a marked improvement , correspondents say .
They say this is generally attributed to the US and Iraqi troop surge in and around Baghdad that began in February .
Analysts say other key factors are the halt in operations by Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr and the abandonment of al - Qaeda by some western Sunni tribes .
The BBC's Jim Muir Baghdad says different sources do have different casualty figures for October but they all agree that the number of Iraqis killed by violence was again at a much lower level , as it had been in September .
They suggest fewer than 900 people died violent deaths , compared with nearly 2,000 in January - the worst month since the attack on the key Shia shrine in Samarra in February 2006 .
Surge peak
AFP news agency quoted interior , defence and health ministry data as saying at least 887 Iraqis were killed .
Both Iraqi and US military casualties were also lower .
Gen Petraeus said objectives of the surge were " largely being met "
Thirty - eight US personnel were killed in October , compared with more than 100 in each of April , May and June .
The military casualties peaked then as the US and Iraqi forces launched numerous operations to bring Baghdad and outlying areas under control .
In his report to a congressional panel last month , top US military commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , said military objectives of the surge were " largely being met " .
He said that although improvements were " uneven " , violence had declined significantly since the surge began .
Our correspondent says one question is whether the improvement is a predictable temporary result of the surge that might be reversed when the US military starts drawing down troops .
But analysts say what might sustain the trend is the fact that Sunni tribes in western Anbar province and elsewhere have turned against al - Qaeda and have joined government and multi-national forces .
Moqtada Sadr's Shia militia , the Mehdi Army , had been blamed for many of the abductions and killings around Baghdad and his suspension of operations has also helped the downturn .
However , our correspondent says despite the improved figures , bombings and shootings happen somewhere in Iraq every day .
On Thursday , at least 16 people were killed in a number of bomb attacks in different parts of the country .
Among the attacks :
Musical heavyweights such as 50 Cent and R.E.M. can't get by with just a MySpace page and a website any more .
They need a virtual fan connection .
Almost daily , the rapper sends new videos through his Kyte.tv channel to his own Thisis50.com site and to thousands of personal sites where listeners have embedded Kyte 's player .
Recent dispatches have included new videos with G - Unit and diatribes against rival Fat Joe .
MORE : Check out five musically inclined social networking sites R.E.M. this week lets fans listen to the new album , Accelerate , on the iLike social network a week before it goes on sale .
" We hope it will get a lot of exposure , and people will recommend it to their friends , and hopefully some of them will go out and buy the record as well , " says band manager Bertis Downs .
For artists and labels , building word of mouth about an album or tour is paramount .
And they 're tapping into the growing music - based social networking scene to spread the word .
Magazine covers and TV and radio interviews do n't carry the weight of the Web , and as features evolve , R.E.M.'s website and MySpace page were not enough , Downs says .
Since its beginnings in summer 2006 as a social network for finding and recommending music , iLike.com has grown to 23 million members , says CEO Ali Partovi .
As the community grew , iLike added features for artists to post videos and news ; meanwhile , Partovi began approaching artists and labels about providing content to iLike .
One mid-November discussion Partovi had with Bono turned into a video interview in which the U2 frontman sang a just - finished song , Wave of Sorrow .
Once posted , it was viewed and forwarded by more than 1 million within a week .
Then Keith Urban signed on to post weekly videos and to offer tour ticket presales and fan events .
" The Internet basically empowers consumers to get exactly what they want and artists to put out exactly what they want , " Partovi says .
Social networks ' clout is growing within the industry .
In May , CBS purchased music recommendation site Last.fm .
In July , Warner Music cemented a relationship with community Imeem after suing the site for letting users illegally share music .
R&B singer Raheem DeVaughn seemed a perfect talent to exploit Kyte 's video network , says Dave Bell of Sony - owned Jive Records .
" He 's a genuine person , and he 's not shy . "
Using a cellphone , DeVaughn sent videos to his Kyte.tv channel from last month 's Grammys — his song Woman was nominated for best R&B single — and from his current tour with Jill Scott .
" This is so user - friendly , and as an artist you can invite somebody into your world with a snap of the finger , " DeVaughn says .

... or perhaps it could be called the McCain mantra .
Just ask him what the difference is between Sunni and Shiite , and watch the blank stare and mental scrambling begin .
When I sat down to write my book on McCain , I spoke with many figures who one could fairly say know a bit about this arena .
This list included three - decade Hill Staffer Winslow Wheeler ( worked for Sens Pete Domenici and Nancy Kassebaum , among others ) , who fought for years to reform military spending , and Iraq War vet and Executive Director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , Paul Rieckhoff .
Both are political independents , and Wheeler was a longtime Republican ( forced out of his job by McCain , when he opposed him ) .
Yet , what they had to say about McCain in my book , The Real McCain , should tell you all you need to know about the danger a McCain presidency presents .
Rieckhoff when talking about McCain 's Iraq policy , had this to say :
It 's half - assed , it 's not going to work , he 's being inconsistent in supporting it , and yet still seems to support it for political reasons .
Ouch .
So not so much " straight - talk " from McCain on Iraq .
We knew that .
But hearing a nonpartisan military expert , and one who fights for veterans every day say this , well you can guess how truly bad Mr. McCain must be .
Wheeler 's quote was even more foreboding :
It 's frightening to think of a man with his temperament with all the things a president has at his fingertips -- the IRS , CIA , FBI ...
Wheeler is no conspiracy theorist .
He now resides at the Center for Defense Information .
Not exactly a countercultural outfit .
As George H.W. Bush would say , message :
Be afraid , be very afraid ...
NOTE : Just a short pitch to pick up a copy of The Real McCain .
Only $ 10 !
You 'll make the birds sing , me smile and you 'll help push the message out into the media about McCain , so people get to know The Real McCain .
Already the response from progressives has been overwhelming , and has led to coverage at US News & World Report , Fox ( who asked McCain questions directly from my book ) , Vanity Fair and Glamour , to name a few .
But let 's keep the momentum going , so when we finally choose a nominee , the battle will be already joined ...

For Goldfinger 's Jill Masterson , being slathered in gold did n't end too well .
But a beauty company has promised that the precious metal has many benefits , leaving customers looking younger and banishing their wrinkles .
A gold - leaf facial is the latest beauty craze among ladies of a certain age .

The Luxe 24 Karat Gold Facial uses the highest grade of gold leaf in an 80 - minute procedure which costs £ 180 .
The flakes of gold leaf are laid on the face , before being massaged in .
UMO - the company behind the facial - claimed that the procedure will result in firmer , brighter and more supple skin .
The treatment 's use of the metal follows a strong historical tradition .
It is said that Cleopatra slept in a gold mask every night , and Chinese empresses supposedly used gold rollers to massage their faces .
However , the precious metal has not been commonly used for modern day treatments because it is very difficult to make it penetrate the skin .

UMO claims that it has developed technology which allows staff at the Charleston Place spa in South Carolina , where the 24 - carat facial is offered , to overcome this problem .
It is following a trend for ever more luxurious beauty treatments , such as using caviar as a conditioner on the hair .
Sturgeon eggs are also used in La Prairie 's products , whose fans in Hollywood include Angelina Jolie , and facials which use diamonds and pearls are also available .
But the supposed beautifying properties of gold would be no consolation to Miss Masterson , who betrayed her boss Auric Goldfinger to help superspy James Bond .

Her supposed cause of death in the 1964 film was " skin suffocation " , which scientists say is a medical impossibility .
It was thought at the time that the skin " breathed " through the pores .
In fact , the main drawback to being painted gold is the risk of overheating - and perhaps the possibility of being mistaken for Paris Hilton in the latest Rich Prosecco advert .
The facial is not yet available in Britain but is proving a hit across the Atlantic .
Ron Razeggi , U.S. chief operating officer of the manufacturer , UMO , said : " The skin tries to reject the gold because it 's a foreign object .
In order to do that , it builds new cells .
" Right now , the body produces new cells every 28 days .
But this accelerates the cell - building and , as a result , it firms and tightens the skin . "
‘ Do not go gentle into that good night .
...
Rage , rage against the dying of the light . ”
When Dylan Thomas wrote those lines in 1951 , he did not intend them as political advice .
But if he were alive today , he ’d surely admire Hillary Clinton ’s campaigning style .
( And probably vote for her : At 93 , he ’d be right inside her demographic sweet spot . )
As the end approaches , she has not gone gentle into that good night .
Clinton has almost no chance of winning the nomination .
Going into today ’s big votes in Texas and Ohio , she trails by more than 150 pledged delegates .
If she has an unexpectedly great day , she might gain by a couple dozen , but her best chances to gain ground will all be behind her .
She could , in theory , win the nomination with superdelegates if she could narrow the gap , but that ’s not going to happen .
Barack Obama will bring a triple - digit delegate lead to the convention , and party elites wo n’t dare overturn that .
Clinton and her supporters rage on anyway because , for so long , they had no inkling she might lose .
For Obama to take what is rightfully hers must be unfair .
The Clintonites rage against the media ( though they did n’t mind when reporters parroted her claims of inevitability a year ago ) , the unrepresentative caucus system ( though they have expressed no objection to totally undemocratic superdelegates ) or sexism ( while ignoring the benefits of white racial bias and female gender solidarity ) .
The real reason Clinton will lose is more prosaic : Obama is a far better politician .
Republicans have long had a kind of black - magic fear of the Clintons ’ political potency .
From the right ’s perspective , Bill Clinton won the presidency at a time when the GOP thought it had an electoral college lock .
Then he beat back the Republican revolution and the party ’s efforts to defeat him .
The reality is less dramatic .
Bill Clinton defeated a recession - weakened president with some help from a third - party spoiler , stopped the GOP from cutting highly popular social programs , won reelection during an economic boom and rallied his own party to thwart a wildly partisan impeachment crusade .
None of these triumphs required unusual political skill .
Hillary Clinton has tried to piggyback on her husband ’s ferocious reputation , boasting that she “ beat the Republican attack machine . ”
Of course , if anybody beat the Republican attack machine , it was Bill .
Hillary Clinton was n’t on any ballot in the 1990s .
True , her reputation was at stake , but that ’s a fight she lost :
She ended that decade a highly unpopular figure .
She remains one today , with about half of the public persistently telling pollsters they have an unfavorable view of her .
Nor was Clinton able to shed her baggage when she moved to New York .
In her November 2000 Senate race , she ran five points behind Democratic ticket - topper Al Gore in New York , and Gore himself was hardly a beloved figure at the time .
Six years later , she pummeled a token opponent .
Has Clinton been unfairly attacked ?
Without a doubt .
But she ’s also a mediocre orator who delivers themeless and not - terribly - inspiring speeches .
She ’s a good enough politician to get elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic state , but not good enough to get elected president .
To be sure , she could have won the nomination under the right circumstances , what with her reservoir of goodwill from the 1990s and multitude of political and fundraising contacts .
Alas , she had the bad fortune to go up against Obama .
Clinton and her supporters gripe about Obama ’s charms -- the packed stadiums , the witty comebacks , the starry - eyed fans .
Well , yes .
It is n’t cheating .
This is what you get when you ’re an extremely good politician .
Obama has plenty of detailed plans and policy expertise .
Yes , Clinton has a bit more .
If the only criteria for the presidency were experience and legislative accomplishment , Obama would n’t be the nominee .
But neither would Clinton .
Consider poor Joe Biden , with his decades in the Senate and exhaustive foreign policy expertise .
He wanted to be president too .
If it was Biden versus Clinton , he’d be making the same arguments against her that she ’s making against Obama .
Biden decided to go gentle into that good night .
It ’s time for Clinton to do the same .

It is all too easy to get excited about the next big sustainable technology for saving energy or producing non-polluting power – and forget the flaws in many of these ideas .
Some of the best projects show smart out - of - the - box thinking but lack feasibility or , in some cases , might do more harm than good .
While these ideas may not work at least scientists , politicians and other innovators are beginning to explore alternatives .
Biofuel has been a buzzward in green political circles for a long time , but are biofuels truly a sustainable solution ?
Many argue that they are not .
Land used in the production of biofuels often replaces much - needed farmland or is cut out of important ecosystems around the world .
In short : the big picture for biofuels does not look bright given the vast natural resources that are required to produce them in the first place .
Fusion Power is that fabled cheap - and - clean energy source that always seems to be just on the horizon and out of reach .
How many times in the past decades have we heard that this sustainable technology is just a few more years away ?
Sure , it might be true this time , but there ’s no way to say .
Some argue though that the mood ( and venture capital ) is shifting , but is it worthwhile putting so many resources toward something that is anything but a sure bet ?
Artificial Islands have been a conceptual idea for ecological power generation for over a decade .
The basic idea : use wind , wave and solar power in ideal offshore locations to produce onshore power .
The latest idea : use thermal variation to generate power .
The problem : setting up and maintaining these offshore islands could be cost and energy prohibitive , a common problem with new technologies .
Plug - In Hybrids are one proposed solution to transportation fuel in a world where soybeans , biofuels and other renewable / sustainable energy sources are competing to be the next be the next big thing .
Batteries are the big limiting factor here because they have to not only store a great deal of energy but also be able to output energy at variable intensity in order to sustain both normal use and a range of acceleration rates .
Zero-Pollution
Cars have been proposed that would keep rather than exhaust carbon which would then be recycled into usable fuel at a conversion facility .
The trick , of course , is converting said non-exhaust on - site within the vehicle itself before it is transported back to a central location .
Beyond that , the technology for converting the fuel back is feasible but its redistribution would require extensive and energy - consuming networks .
Gravity Powered devices ( such as lamps ) sound like a great idea , but no energy is free and the scalability of this concept is questionable .
The basic idea : a weight is raised then generates power for hours as it works its way down the body of the lamp .
A neat idea on a small scale that could save some energy but may not have many applications beyond more localized novelty and concept devices that still take quite a bit of energy to create .
A 15 - Year Light Source that requires no recharges sounds great – at first anyway .
It seems that this GloPaint innovation will last a long time as promised but leftover materials are of questionable toxicity so there is still waste to be considered – just fifteen years later .
This may help replace emergency lighting in the short term but still is n’t a long term solution .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton recently had to backtrack on claims that when she visited war - torn Bosnia - Herzegovina in 1996 , she landed amid dangerous sniper fire .
MTV's own former first lady ( of news ) Tabitha Soren flew into the same airbase in Tuzla about six weeks before Clinton did and sent back reports from the front on young U.S. military peacekeeping forces flown in to make sure there were no more flare - ups in the conflict that had cost more than 250,000 lives .
Arriving just weeks after the Dayton Peace Accord effectively ended the war , Soren recalled feeling tension in the air , but said she did n't sense that her life was in jeopardy .
" The reason MTV News wanted to go into Bosnia was primarily because of the age of the soldiers serving both in the peacekeeping forces and the forces that went in before the Dayton Accords , " Soren remembered .
" Their average age was about 26 , and that obviously connected directly to our audience .
Once the Dayton Accords were signed , MTV sent me and a producer and a cameraman in there .
We stopped over at the Ramstein airbase in Germany and then flew into Tuzla in a C - 17 cargo plane , which meant that I sat in some sort of cargo net on the flight over .
" It was winter , it was a bumpy flight , the weather was not great , and it was very noisy on the plane .
I believe we all had bulletproof vests on , but they were n't bulky like you 'd expect or some sort of thing you 'd see in ' Batman . '
They were pretty lightweight and you could still be shot , but they covered the important parts .
It was nerve - racking because you did n't know what to expect , but because the Dayton Accords had been signed , it did n't feel like we were flying into an active war zone .
" I was told the most hazardous part of flying into Tuzla was the land mines that they had n't excavated yet .
They were real adamant that you had to stay on the path , and anytime you went off the path , someone was there to yank you back on .
At anytime , there were landmines that you could run over , so that was the most threatening part — not landing at the airport .
We did n't expect any sniper fire , and this was a month before Hillary Clinton landed , so there was probably less of a chance of that kind of heated conflict later in the year .
Although having the first lady land might have gotten more attention than just another media crew coming in .
" I grew up in the military , so to me , we were landing on a military base on a military plane , and it was not that scary .
But anytime you 're surrounded by people with guns , I 'm a little tense .
I did n't feel like we were in immediate danger , but it did seem like an unpredictable situation , mainly because of the land mines .
" The conditions were really bad for the soldiers living on the base and for the people living in the country .
It was also hard to get work done , because the power at the hotel did n't work half the time .
There was a certain amount of power each day , and there was a toilet and shower , but the shower did n't always have water and most of the time the only light that worked was in the bathroom .
So I did most of my preparation and research lying in the bathtub , which gave it a real primitive feel . "
Soren was accompanied on the trip by producer Wilson Van Law , an Air Force veteran who was familiar with combat situations .
He said the team landed at dawn while it was still dark , and while the avowed news junkie followed the situation closely enough to know that missiles were not being used to shoot down planes , he was still a bit on edge about the early morning landing .
" I was n't overly concerned , but it was interesting that they wanted us to land before daylight , which made me wonder if they were worried about fire , " Van Law recalled .
" It turned out to just be a logistical thing , but it did seem like the base was slightly tense .
We were far from home , but it seemed completely secure and we did n't have to run from the plane anywhere and hide .
I do n't remember feeling remotely uncomfortable or hearing virtually any gunfire .
" The only time I felt unsafe was when I left the base with Tabitha and went on a helicopter ride close to the front lines .
We saw where they dug trenches so they could walk without being in the line of fire , and we saw farms that were set on fire — some were completely destroyed , some were untouched and some were still smoldering .
We saw some of the results of the ethnic cleansing that had gone on , and it was incredibly sad to see these beautiful scenes of rural solitude with some farms destroyed , while some [ farms ] 100 meters away were not .
" At one point in the helicopter , they saw something and they either stopped or took some mildly evasive action .
I was like , ' OK , what does this pilot know ? '
They did see something and refused to move until they figured out if it was a real threat .
I think Hillary is getting hammered on this , maybe unfairly .
Maybe she was exaggerating , but that happens a lot in politics .
I was n't there when she was , and things could have changed , but the situation was very secure when we were there , and I can't imagine it was any less secure when the first lady was there with her daughter .
It was not a war zone by any means . "
A TNT van leaves HMRC 's offices in Washington , Tyne and Wear
The computer discs went missing after being put into the internal post at HM Revenue and Customs in Tyne and Wear .
Police are now focusing on premises of TNT , which delivers HMRC mail , after completing inquiries at HMRC 's offices .
A spokesman for TNT confirmed that its premises in London had been searched on Friday night .
He said it was impossible to say whether the CDs had ever entered TNT 's system .
" We are all working on that theory , but it can not be proved one way or the other , " he said .
Raising fears
The missing discs hold the personal details of all families in the UK with a child under 16 .
The data on them includes the name , address , date of birth , National Insurance number and , where relevant , bank details of 25 million people .
The discs were intended for the National Audit Office ( NAO ) in London , but never arrived from HMRC 's office in Washington , Tyne and Wear .
Police looking for the discs completed their search at the Washington HMRC building on Friday night .
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed searches had now started at TNT buildings , but would not say at how many or reveal the locations .
A core team of 47 detectives from the Specialist and Economic Crime Directorate has been involved in the search operation .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think most people realise that finding the discs wo n't close the case

Send us your comments
The TNT spokesman said the sender of the CDs had used the firm 's general mail service rather than its facility that allows customers to monitor the progress of deliveries .
However , TNT was fully co-operating with police , he said .
He said the firm carried up to 100,000 items of mail each night on behalf of HMRC , and also had contracts with other government departments and bodies .
' Failure of duty '
In March , officials at HMRC began the practice of downloading the entire Child Benefit database onto CDs and sending them through the internal mail to the NAO for auditing .
The practice came to light only on Tuesday when it was revealed two discs had been lost - raising fears data protection laws had been broken .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told MPs he " profoundly regrets " the loss of the records and he apologised for the " inconvenience and worries " caused to families .
He said the government was working to prevent the data being used for fraud .
But Conservative leader David Cameron said the government had " failed in its first duty to protect the public " .
On Friday , it also emerged that the NAO had handed unencrypted discs containing details of all Child Benefit claimants to accountants KPMG .
The NAO said they had been delivered by hand and returned safely .
Meanwhile , accountancy firm Grant Thornton has warned that the loss could be repeated if plans to reshape HMRC , including " slashing its funding and staff " , continued .
Francesca Lagerberg , head of the company 's tax office , said the " hard - pushed " department was " being asked to provide more for less " .
The military is scrambling for new ways to treat the brain injuries and post - traumatic stress of troops returning home from war .
And every kind of therapy – no matter how far outside the accepted medical form – is being considered .
The Army just unveiled a $ 4 million program to investigate everything from " spiritual ministry , transcendental meditation ,
[ and ] yoga " to " bioenergies such as Qi gong , Reiki , [ and ] distant healing " to mend the psyches of wounded troops .
As many as 17 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have some form of post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , one congressional study estimates .
Nearly 3,300 troops have suffered traumatic brain injury , or TBI , according to statistics assembled last summer .
And the lifetime costs of treating these ailments could pile up to as much as $ 35 billion , a Columbia University report guesses .
Small wonder , then , that the government is looking for alternate means to treat these injuries .
The Defense Department " is dedicated to supporting evidence - based approaches to medical treatment and wants to support the use of alternative therapies if they are proven efficacious , " notes a recently - issued request for proposals .
But many of these treatments have n't been held up to much rigorous scientific scrutiny before .
So the Army is looking to hand out $ 4 million in " seedling grants " to " conduc[t ] rigorous clinical studies " into all sorts of " novel approaches . "
Projects " containing preliminary data " will be eligible for up to $ 1 million .
But even " innovative but testable hypotheses without preliminary data " could get as much as $ 300,000 .
Proposals are due May 15 .
" Music , animal - facilitated therapy , art , dance / movement , massage therapy , EMDR [ Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ] __ __program evaluation , virtual reality , acupuncture , spiritual ministry , transcendental meditation ,
[ and ] yoga , " might all be considered worth of the military 's largess .
So would " biologically - based treatments , botanicals , and nutritional supplements for enhancing cognitive function and mood in patients with trauma spectrum disorders , including
TBI and / or PTSD , depression , anxiety , and / or substance dependence / abuse . "
Even proposals for wild - sounding " therapies using bioenergies such as Qi gong , Reiki , distant healing and acupuncture " would be accepted .
The program also wants to investigate the " perceptions " of these treatments , and any " gender - specific implications and issues " involved .
All " proposals must provide a clear justification and military relevance for the choice of therapies selected , " the Army reminds grant applicants .
This is n't the first time the military has investigated these sorts of nontraditional approaches .
The semi-legendary " First Earth Battalion , " immortalized in The Men Who Stare at Goats , advocated that soldiers utilize everything from " yogic cat stretch[es ] " to " Ginseng tab regulator [s ] " to " amphetamines . "
A 1973 RAND Corporation study , put together for Darpa , lamented Soviet advances over the American military in everything from yoga to telekinesis .
More recently , Rep. Pete Visclosky , D - Ind. , inserted $ 2 million into last year 's defense budget bill for " research into the effects of prayer . "
Darpa has invested millions into natural dietary supplements .
Troops – even flag - level officers – have been known to do yoga on their own .
And while some of these techniques seem way out there – I mean way , way out there – others may have a more practical effect on psychiatric health .
Yoga , for instance , has been shown to improve the mood of psychiatric inpatients and reduce so - called " stress hormones " like cortisol .
After promising early results , planning is underway for a major study into the effects of yoga on the treatment of schizophrenia .
Full disclosure :
The doctor running that study is my wife , Elizabeth .
But she 's not planning to take any Army money .

“ Republicans support our troops ” is going to go down as one of the biggest lies ever told in American politics .
We ’ve seen a litany of things done by Republican leadership to the men and women who serve our country : not enough equipment , faulty equipment , Walter Reed , long deployments , stop - loss , and war based on a lie without an end in sight .
The latest outrage , dirty water provided by KBR , actually made U.S. soldiers sick :
U.S. soldiers at a military base in Iraq were provided with treated but untested wastewater for nearly two years by KBR , the giant government contractor , and may have suffered health problems as a result , according to a report released yesterday by the Pentagon ’s inspector general .
The inspector general said that from March 2004 to February 2006 , KBR inappropriately distributed chlorinated wastewater to 5,000 U.S. troops at Camp Q - West , located at the Qayyarah West airfield about 180 miles north of Baghdad .
The wastewater had been processed by a reverse - osmosis purification system and treated with chlorine before being distributed to showers and latrines on the base .
The report said that from October 2005 to June 2006 , sick - call records showed 38 reported illnesses that “ an attending medical official said could be attributed to water , such as skin abscesses , cellulites , skin infections and diarrhea . ”
The report said it was impossible to definitively link the treated water to all the illnesses .
At the time , KBR was owned by Dick Cheney ’s old company , Halliburton .
Keep in mind that KBR already has a very shady history in Iraq have been accused of covering up a gang rape , of “ fraud and contract abuse , ” and of overcharging for food back in 2003 — to name but a few .
The scandal about dirty water first appeared in January of 2006 .
Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , who has been doggedly investigating KBR , demanded the investigation that resulted in this latest confirmation of the company ’s atrocious behavior .
All of this happened under the watchful eyes of the Republicans who started this war .
Bush let it happen .
Cheney let it happen .
McCain let it happen .
Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman , who ran the Senate ’s Oversight Committee , let it happen .
They do n’t support the troops .
KBR did n’t fear consequences because the company ’s friends were in power .
Thanks to Senator Dorgan for actually looking out for the troops and exposing this outrage .
Someone should go to jail for this .
“ Some people want to blame our industry because they have a vested interest in doing so , either by making a name for themselves or by hampering the adaptability and usefulness of our products for competitive purposes , ” said Robert G. Pickel , chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a trade group .
“ We believe that there are good investment decisions and bad investment decisions .
We do n’t decry motor vehicles because some have been involved in accidents . ”
Already , legislators in Washington are offering detailed plans for new regulations , including ones to treat Wall Street banks like their more heavily regulated commercial brethren .
At the same time , normally wary corporate leaders like James Dimon , the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , are beginning to acknowledge that maybe , just maybe , new regulations are necessary .
“ We have a terribly global world and , over all , financial regulation has not kept up with that , ” Mr. Dimon said in an interview on Monday , the day after his bank agreed to take over Bear Stearns at a fire - sale price .
“ I ca n’t even describe the seriousness of that .
I always talk about how bad things can happen that you ca n’t expect .
I did n’t fathom this event . ”
TWO months before he resigned as chief executive of Citigroup last year amid nearly $ 20 billion in write - downs , Charles O. Prince III sat down in Washington with Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
Among the topics they discussed were investment vehicles that allowed Citigroup and other banks to keep billions of dollars in potential liabilities off of their balance sheets  and away from the scrutiny of investors and analysts .
“ Why are n’t they on your balance sheet ? ” asked Mr. Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts .
The congressman recalled that Mr. Prince said doing so would have put Citigroup at a disadvantage with Wall Street investment banks that were more loosely regulated and were allowed to take far greater risks .
( A spokeswoman for Mr. Prince confirmed the conversation . )
It was at that moment , Mr. Frank says , that he first realized just how much freedom Wall Street firms had , and how lightly regulated they were in comparison with commercial banks , which have to answer to an alphabet soup of government agencies like the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency .
“ Not only did Wall Street have so much freedom , but it gave commercial banks an incentive to try and evade their regulations , ” Mr. Frank says .
When it came to Wall Street , he says , “ we thought we did n’t need regulation . ”

NEW YORK 
Fears that the fire - sale buyout of wounded investment bank Bear Stearns ( BSC ) by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) would spark a wave of panic selling Monday on Wall Street did n't materialize .
The battered stock market finished mixed , avoiding another major leg down .
Wall Street is struggling mightily under the weight of Sunday 's implosion of Bear Stearns , the nation 's fifth - largest investment bank , as well as a financial crisis caused by massive housing and mortgage - related losses that have shaken the foundation of the U.S. financial system .
Heading into Monday 's session , with foreign stock markets already down sharply , Wall Street had a crisis of confidence .
Jittery investors wondered whether the buyout of Bear Stearns for $ 2 a share — down from $ 30 on Friday — and emergency measures by the Federal Reserve to keep the banking system liquid would be enough to restore calm .
The Dow Jones industrial average , which was down almost 200 points , finished up 21 points to 11,972 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index fell almost 1 % .
Investors sought havens , such as U.S. Treasury bonds and gold , two asset classes deemed good plays during market turmoil .
Gold closed above $ 1,000 for the first time .
The yield on the 10 - year Treasury note dropped to 3.30 % from 3.44 % as Treasury prices rose .
It 's only one day , but strategists say the fact that stocks did n't crater is a sign that investors , despite their ongoing angst , view Bear Stearns ' escape from bankruptcy and moves by the Fed to keep markets functioning smoothly and the economy from lapsing into a serious recession as steps in the right direction .
Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at LPL Financial , notes that every financial crisis results in some sort of major failure .
In 1998 , it was the collapse of hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management .
In 1990 , it was the savings - and - loan crisis .
Each time , the market fell about 20 % before rebounding .
With the market down more than 18 % from its October 2007 high , the worst of the current decline could now be priced in .
Monday 's " market action suggests that this may be the beginning of the end of the crisis , " Kleintop says .
He is optimistic because the Fed is being creative in attacking the credit crunch .
One such move came Sunday , when the Fed gave securities dealers access to its funding facilities .
Investors hope that will allay fears that other Wall Street firms will succumb to a run on the bank .
But Todd Clark , a trader at Nollenberger Capital Partners , says it is " too early " to say confidence is back in a big way .
The poor performance of brokerage and bank stocks Monday also screams caution .
JPMorgan , up 10 % , was the only major financial stock to post gains .
Lehman Bros. ( LEH ) , which is suffering from rumors that it will suffer a similar fate to Bear Stearns , plunged 19 % .
Paul Grignon ’s 47 - minute animated presentation of “ Money as Debt ” tells in very simple and effective graphic terms what money is and how it is being created .
It is an entertaining way to get the message out .

The $ 19.5 billion sale of the radio broadcaster Clear Channel Communications to two private equity firms is in jeopardy .
This time , however , instead of the buyers balking , the banks that had agreed to finance the deal have become apprehensive .
Clear Channel and the private equity buyers may go to court to try to force the banks to complete the buyout , according to people briefed on the negotiations , who were given anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal .
The legal threat is the latest indication that the banks have become reluctant to put up the money for the sale , these people said .
Earlier , the banks proposed that the buyers  Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners  put down more cash and agree to stricter repayment terms .
The buyout firms have refused .
Among the lenders are Citigroup , Deutsche Bank , Morgan Stanley , Credit Suisse , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia .
Parasites are well known to have evolved an exceptional array of strategies for perpetuating themselves .
A microscopic tropical nematode worm which lives in the gasters of ants in Panama is one of the more impressive .
Researchers at the University of Arkansas have recently illuminated its method , which manages to make the ant appear to be a fruit so that it will be eaten by birds .
At the same time , Congress and the Bush administration have directed hundreds of millions of dollars toward abstinence - only education in the public middle schools and high schools  classes that have been roundly criticized for blurring the line between science and religion .
A 2004 report issued by Representative Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , found that 11 of 13 abstinence curriculums that his government - reform committee examined were rife with scientific errors and false and misleading information about the risks of sexual activity .
Many states are now rejecting federal financing for such classes , on evidence that they fail to limit sexual behavior or reduce teen pregnancy .
In a follow - up study to a 1995 national survey of close to 12,000 students in grades 7 through 12 , two sociologists , Peter Bearman at Columbia University and Hannah Brückner at Yale , found that while those who took virginity pledges preserved their technical virginity about 18 months longer than teenagers who did n’t pledge , they were six times more likely to engage in oral sex than virgins who had n’t taken a pledge .
They were also much less likely to use condoms during their first sexual experience or to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases .
Disease rates between those who pledged and those who did n’t were actually similar .
The authors , who published their findings in 2005 , concluded that the emphasis on premarital abstinence was insufficient to fend off disease and “ collides with the realities of adolescents ’ and young adults ’ lives . ”
Many college students today , however , grew up with abstinence classes and clubs in their communities , and so the movement has raised a generation of activists .
Among prominent abstinence activists is Wendy Shalit , who wrote “ Girls Gone Mild : Young Women Reclaim Self - Respect and Find It ’s Not Bad to Be Good , ” which came out last year .
She says that talk of disease rates and the amount of sexual activity on campuses is beside the point .
A sex - saturated popular culture creates certain expectations , she argues .
“ The key thing to remember , ” Shalit wrote me recently in an e-mail message , “ is that many young people involved in sexual activity feel pressured into it . ”
Many are uncomfortable with “ the hookup scene , ” she continued , and “ college abstinence programs are growing out of this awareness that disconnected sex is not as pleasurable as the media ( and sometimes college administrators ) have led us to believe . ”
The awareness is especially acute in the highly politicized environment of the elite schools , where , according to Shalit , “ there is just one lifestyle that does n’t get recognition ”  premarital abstinence .
The Ivy League ’s abstinence clubs began emerging several years ago about the same time as student sex blogs , sex columns and , at Harvard and Yale , student sex magazines .
Those involved , however , say that the most important catalyst was university - sponsored safe - sex education , which they saw as institutional encouragement of promiscuity .
The founders of the Princeton club , the first to form in the Ivy League in 2005 , wanted to offer an opposing view .
Many were Catholic , but seeking credibility within the university at large , they decided not to present themselves as a religious organization and always to “ shy away from arguments with religious premises , ” says Kevin Joyce , a former president of the club .
“ Here at a university , we have to provide the intellectual basis ” for abstinence , he told me .
“ Every position we take as a group can be confirmed by rational thought . ”

Making a rational case against premarital sex was easier before reliable contraception .
But to shore things up , the club has turned to Catholic thinkers like Elizabeth Anscombe , the philosopher and student of Ludwig Wittgenstein .
Anscombe ’s arguments against premarital sex are as impressive as they are difficult to summarize , and the students so admired her logic , they named their society after her .
Robert George , a professor of jurisprudence at Princeton , is one of the Anscombe Society ’s informal faculty advisers .
Himself a Catholic thinker , George says that society members employ “ philosophical - ethical arguments ” to support their belief that promiscuity “ deeply compromises human dignity , ” and psychological and sociological rationale to justify the claim that casual sex leads to “ personal unhappiness and social harm . ”
The students are some of Princeton ’s most gifted , George says , and “ even people who do n’t accept their conclusions recognize that the arguments being advanced by the Anscombe students are serious and cannot be easily dismissed . ”
The Anscombe Society at Princeton went on to embrace positions not just against premarital sex but also against homosexual sex and marriage .
Founders have tried to spread its method to other schools , and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were the first to follow with another Anscombe Society .
Bill Jacobs , the president , says it ’s a loosely organized group .
“ People tend to be pretty busy with homework , ” he says .
Scientists have developed a computerised mind - reading technique which lets them accurately predict the images that people are looking at by using scanners to study brain activity .
The breakthrough by American scientists took MRI scanning equipment normally used in hospital diagnosis to observe patterns of brain activity when a subject examined a range of black and white photographs .
Then a computer was able to correctly predict in nine out of 10 cases which image people were focused on .
Guesswork would have been accurate only eight times in every 1,000 attempts .
The study raises the possibility in the future of the technology being harnessed to visualise scenes from a person 's dreams or memory .
Writing in the journal Nature , the scientists , led by Dr Jack Gallant from the University of California at Berkeley , said : " Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person 's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone .
Imagine a general brain - reading device that could reconstruct a picture of a person 's visual experience at any moment in time . "
It will inevitably also raise fears that a suspect 's brain could be interrogated against their will , raising the nightmarish possibility of interrogation for " thought crimes " .
The researchers say this is currently firmly in the realm of science fiction because the technique can only be applied to visual images and , to date , the experiments rely on cumbersome MRI scanning equipment and extremely powerful magnets .
The software decoder itself has to be adapted to each individual during hours of training while in the scanner .
However the team have warned about potential privacy issues in the future when scanning techniques improve .
" It is possible that decoding brain activity could have serious ethical and privacy implications downstream in , say , the 30 to 50 - year time frame , " said Prof Gallant .
" [ We ] believe strongly that no one should be subjected to any form of brain - reading process involuntarily , covertly , or without complete informed consent . "
The technique relies on functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , a standard technique that creates images of brain activity based on changes in blood flow to different brain regions .
The first step is to train the software decoder by scanning a subject 's visual cortex while they view thousands of images over five hours .
This teaches the decoder how that person 's brain codes visual information .
The next stage is to take a new set of images and use the decoder to predict the brain activity it would expect if the subject was viewing each of them .
Finally , the subject views images from this second set while in the scanner .
" We simply look through the list of predicted activities to see which one is most similar to the observed activity , and that 's our guess , " said Gallant .
The software matched their observed brain activity with the predicted activity from the decoder .
When using a set of 120 images , the software got it right nine out of 10 times .
With 1,000 images , the accuracy was eight out of 10 .
For 120 images , if the software were to simply make random predictions , its success rate would be just 0.8 % .
The team estimate that if they used 1bn images ( roughly the number on Google ) it would have a success rate of 20 % .
With that many images , Gallant said , the software is close to doing true image reconstruction - working out what you are seeing from scratch .
" There is no reason we should n't be able to solve this problem ...
That 's what we are working on now . "
Gallant said it might be possible in future to apply the technology to visual memories or dreams .
" Probably the visual hardware is engaged and stuff from memory is sort of downloaded into your visual hardware and then replayed , " he said .
" To the extent that that is true , we should be able to reconstruct imagery in dreams . "
However , tests using moving images are not possible because MRI scanners are only able to take a new scan every three to four seconds .
Other scientists say the advance should be welcomed as a major leap in understanding brain function .
" I think it 's a significant advance , " said Prof Marcel Just , a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
" It 's much more exciting than mind reading and police interrogation ...
These people are finding how the brain codes naturalistic scenes .
They understand what the brain is saying . "
" It 's definitely an impressive result .
It 's pushing still further on how we can make inferences about mental states from looking at fMRI activity , " said neurologist Dr Steven Laureys at the University of Liège in Belgium .
He said the technique could be useful for understanding the mental state of a person who is in a coma .
Hello , White House ?

Intelligence Puts Rationale For War on Shakier Ground
The White House faced fresh political peril yesterday in the form of a new intelligence assessment that raised sharp questions about the success of its counterterrorism strategy and judgment in making Iraq the focus of that effort .
Since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , President Bush has been able to deflect criticism of his counterterrorism policy by repeatedly noting the absence of any new domestic attacks and by citing the continuing threat that terrorists in Iraq pose to U.S. interests .
But this line of defense seemed to unravel a bit yesterday with the release of a new National Intelligence Estimate that concludes that al - Qaeda " has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability " by reestablishing a haven in Pakistan and reconstituting its top leadership .
The report also notes that al - Qaeda has been able " to recruit and indoctrinate operatives , including for Homeland attacks , " by associating itself with an Iraqi subsidiary .
These disclosures triggered a new round of criticism from Democrats and others who say that the administration took its eye off the ball by invading Iraq without first destroying Osama bin Laden 's organization in Afghanistan .

The camp I ’m in is a model of Camp X - Ray , the temporary detention facility where terror suspects were held and reportedly tortured until it was decommissioned , in 2002 .
De la Peña and Weil are adding a version of Camp Delta , as well as a “ torture contemplation area . ”
( “ We are not going to torture your avatar , ” says de la Peña .
“ For a lot of reasons .
We do n’t want to trivialize the notion of torture . ” )
Second Life residents can develop an almost umbilical attachment to their avatars .
One visitor to Gone Gitmo felt so threatened by seeing her digital doppelgänger detained that she pulled out a virtual baseball bat and started taking swings at de la Peña ’s avatar .
I ’m ashamed to say I had no such reaction , possibly because this was my first time on Second Life .
But , novice that I was , I was nevertheless able to figure out how to crack my cell door open : I clicked on it .
Once out , I explored the camp , where various screens played clips from de la Peña ’s film Unconstitutional .
I had freely chosen to visit the camp , and there were no guards to stop me from just as freely strolling out the front door or , if I was feeling fabulous , flying away .
I could even teleport to a hot tub in Tokyo to chat with avatars who ’ve paid real money for their designer genitals .
Sex , after all , accounts for an estimated 30 percent of the Second Life economy .
This portion of the pie may grow now that the businesses that once drooled over Second Life ’s marketing potential have noticed that the number of active residents , which had been steadily rising since 2003 , is plateauing at just under 600,000 .
These people do n’t seem to like being preached to .
When I visited one of the first Gone Gitmo sites , I found it eerily deserted , save for a neat brown pile in one of the cells .
It was labeled “ cat turd . ”
De la Peña says the idea behind Gone Gitmo was to create a virtual but accessible version of a place that was real but inaccessible to all but detainees , military personnel , and dedicated lawyers .
One such lawyer , Lieutenant Commander Charlie Swift , who visited the prison regularly for five years , says , “ I applaud their efforts .
It ’s very hard to explain to people what Guantánamo is like . ”
But , while the model gives a fairly accurate idea of what the prison looks like , a larger truth is lost .
“ The irony is it ’s the lack of senses that is the real hell , not any particular thing that happens .
That is the uniqueness of Guantánamo , ” says Swift , who sued George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld over the camp ’s military - tribunal system , which deprives detainees of many rights afforded prisoners in the U.S. ( See “ Taking on Guantánamo , ” by Marie Brenner . )
“ You ’re strapped down , ca n’t see or hear , ca n’t move , your muscles are cramping , and that ’s it . ”
If the people behind Gone Gitmo want a truly accurate model , Swift adds , “ the rules should change every time . …
Psychiatrists will tell you that if the game works perfectly , it ’s dangerous for people to play . ”
There is another prison on Second Life — one you ca n’t choose to go to and ca n’t get out of — a purgatory where Linden Lab , the network ’s villainous - sounding creator , occasionally sends cyber - offenders and saboteurs .
Its existence was thought to be a rumor until rebellious nerds were relegated there and sent pictures back .
It is a moonlit field with infinite rows of corn , where the only entertainment is a tractor you can ride , and a small black - and - white TV playing a moralizing 1940 film called Boy in Court on a loop .
Perhaps this geek gulag , said to have been inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone , could give Second Lifers a truer appreciation for their real - world civil rights .

The Patriots - Giants game , which was to be broadcast Saturday night to less than half the country by the NFL Network , will be available to the entire nation under an agreement reached Wednesday by NBC and CBS to simulcast it .
The 15-0 Patriots are attempting to become the first National Football League team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to go undefeated throughout the entire regular season .
Miami went on to win the Super Bowl and finish 17 - 0 that season .
NBC and CBS will show the NFL Network ’s production of the game , with the announcers Bryant Gumbel and Cris Collinsworth , and will not pay an extra rights fee .
They will each get to sell 18 30 - second commercial units .
Dick Ebersol , the chairman of NBC Universal Sports , said yesterday by telephone that in a conversation in October with Steve Bornstein , the chief executive of the NFL Network , that he would be amenable to a simulcast , and would share it with another broadcast network , if the Patriots ’ momentum toward an undefeated season continued .
Then , on Monday morning , Bornstein called to ask him if his idea was still viable for NBC .

Newswise — Using an innovative device with microscopic chambers , researchers from four institutions , including Johns Hopkins , have gleaned important new information about how bacteria survive in hostile environments by forming antibiotic - resistant communities called biofilms .
These biofilms play key roles in cystic fibrosis , urinary tract infections and other illnesses , and the researchers say their findings could help in the development of new treatments and preventive measures .
" There is a perception that single - celled organisms are asocial , but that is misguided , " said Andre Levchenko , assistant professor of biomedical engineering in The Johns Hopkins University 's Whiting School of Engineering and an affiliate of the university 's Institute for NanoBioTechnology .
" When bacteria are under stress — which is the story of their lives — they team up and form this collective called a biofilm .
If you look at naturally occurring biofilms , they have very complicated architecture .
They are like cities with channels for nutrients to go in and waste to go out . "
With a better understanding of how and why bacteria form biofilms , researchers may be able to disrupt activity in the bacterial communities and block harmful effects on their human hosts .
The team 's findings were detailed in an article published in the November 2007 issue of the journal Public Library of Science Biology .
In the article , the researchers from Johns Hopkins ; Virginia Tech ; the University of California , San Diego ; and Lund University in Sweden reported on the observation of the bacteria E. coli growing in the cramped conditions of a new microfluidic device .
The device , which allows scientists to use nanoscale volumes of cells in solution , contains a series of tiny chambers of various shapes and sizes that keep the bacteria uniformly suspended in a culture medium .
Levchenko and his colleagues recorded the behavior of single layers of cells using real - time microscopy .
Computational models validated their experimental results and could predict the behavior of other bacterial species under similar pressures .
" We were surprised to find that cells growing in chambers of all sorts of shapes gradually organized themselves into highly regular structures , " Levchenko said .
" The computational model helped explain why this was happening and how it might be used by the cells to increase chances of survival . "
The microfluidic device , which was designed and fabricated in collaboration with Alex Groisman 's laboratory at UCSD , allows the cells to flow freely into and out of the chambers .
Test volumes in the chambers were in the nano - liter range , allowing visualization of single E. coli cells .
Ann Stevens ' laboratory at Virginia
Tech helped to generate new strains of bacteria that permitted visualization of individual cells grown in a single layer .
Hojung Cho , a Johns Hopkins biomedical engineering doctoral student from Levchenko's lab and lead author of the journal article , captured on video the gradual self - organization and eventual construction of bacterial biofilms over a 24 - hour period , using real - time microscopy techniques .
The experiments were matched to modeling analysis developed in collaboration with Cho 's colleagues at Lund .
Images were analyzed using tools developed with the participation of Bruno Jedynak of the Johns Hopkins Center for Imaging Science .
Observation using microscopy revealed that the longer the packed cell population resided in the chambers , the more ordered the biofilm structure became , Levchenko said .
Being highly packed in a tiny space can be very challenging for cells , so that any type of a strategy to help colony survival can be very important , he adds .
Levchenko also noted that rod-shaped E. coli that were too short or too long typically either did not organize well or did not avoid " stampede - like " blockages toward the exits .
The shape of the confining space also strongly affected the cell organization in a colony , with highly disordered groups of cells found at sharp corners but not in the circular shaped microchambers .
Understanding how bacteria produce biofilms is important to researchers developing better ways to combat the diseases associated with them , Levchenko pointed out .
For example , people who suffer from cystic fibrosis — a genetic disorder that affects the mucus lining of the lungs — are susceptible to a species of bacteria that colonizes the lungs .
Patients choke on the colony 's byproducts .
Chronic urinary tract infections result from bacterial communities that develop inside human cells .
And biofilms cause problems in tissues where catheters have been inserted or where sutures have been used .
" You can put a patient on antibiotics , and it may seem that the infection has disappeared .
But in a few months , it reappears , and it is usually in an antibiotic - resistant form , " Levchenko says .
To explore possible treatments , Levchenko said , the microfluidic device could be used as a tool to rapidly and simultaneously screen different types of drugs for their ability to prevent biofilms .
This research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation , the National Institutes of Health and the Swedish Research Council .

Updated : Swedish telecom operator Telia and U.S. - based connectivity provider Cogent Communications have gotten into an ugly spat and have stopped interconnecting , according to some of my sources in the telecom business .
What this essentially means is that Telia ’s DSL customers could have trouble seeing Cogent - connected web services .
Telia , now part of TeliaSonera is one of the largest networks in Europe .
The bickering could be because one of the two parties feel they need to be paid for the traffic they are sending .
I am looking into this and have emails out to all my sources in the bandwidth business , and will update accordingly .
( If you have any information , drop me a line . )
Cogent had previously gotten into a slugfest with Level 3 Communications .
Cogent ’s stance towards Telia is hypocritical .
Here is a press release they issued back in 2005 when complaining about Level3 .
As a reader points out , Cogent has been involved in such spats with other carriers as well .
OpenTransit ( France Telecom ) , Teleglobe , ATDN are some of those who have had Cogent issues .
This is a letter Telia sent to its customers :
Dear Customer ,
We would like to give you the following information : Cogent has decided not to exchange traffic directly with TeliaSonera ’s AS 1299 or indirectly with AS 1299 through a third - party provider .
As a result , Cogent has partitioned the Internet and disrupted the flow of traffic between Cogent and TeliaSonera customers .
While this has a negative impact on some users of the Internet , this effect is the result of Cogent ’s decision and is unfortunately beyond TeliaSonera ’s control .
Until Cogent rectifies this situation , TeliaSonera customers experiencing any difficulty reaching Cogent ’s network can continue to purchase IP Transit from TeliaSonera along with another Tier 1 provider .
This will fix the immediate problem and ensure optimal connectivity going forward .
We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused …
If you have further concerns , please address your commercial contact at TeliaSonera
Updated with inputs from our readers .
Thanks guys
The past 10 days will be remembered as the time the U.S. government discarded a half - century of rules to save American financial capitalism from collapse .
On the Richter scale of government activism , the government 's recent actions do n't ( yet ) register at FDR levels .
They are shrouded in technicalities and buried in a pile of new acronyms .

The United States military could stay in Iraq for “ maybe a hundred years ” and that “ would be fine with me , ” John McCain told two hundred or so people at a town hall meeting in Derry , New Hampshire , on Thursday evening .
Toward the end of this session , which was being held shortly before the Iowa caucuses were to start , McCain was confronted by Dave Tiffany , who calls himself a “ full - time antiwar activist . ”
In a heated exchange , Tiffany told McCain that he had looked at McCain ’s campaign website and had found no indication of how long McCain was willing to keep U.S. troops in Iraq .
Arguing that George W. Bush ’s escalation of troops has led to a decline in U.S. casualties , McCain noted that the United States still maintains troops in South Korea and Japan .
He said he had no objection to U.S. soldiers staying in Iraq for decades , “ as long as Americans are not being injured , harmed or killed . ”
After the event ended , I asked McCain about his “ hundred years ” comment , and he reaffirmed the remark , excitedly declaring that U.S. troops could be in Iraq for “ a thousand years ” or “ a million years , ” as far as he was concerned .
The key matter , he explained , was whether they were being killed or not : “ It ’s not American presence ; it ’s American casualties . ” U.S. troops , he continued , are stationed in South Korea , Japan , Europe , Bosnia , and elsewhere as part of a “ generally accepted policy of America ’s multilateralism . ”
There ’s nothing wrong with Iraq being part of that policy , providing the government in Baghdad does not object .
In other words , McCain does not equate victory in Iraq – which he passionately urges at campaign events –with the removal of U.S. troops from that nation .
After McCain told Tiffany that he could see troops remaining in Iraq for a hundred years , a reporter sitting next to me quipped , “ There ’s the general election campaign ad . ”
He meant the Democratic ad : John McCain thinks it would be okay if U.S. troops stayed in Iraq for another hundred years …..
Well , it was straight talk .
And McCain ’s combativeness livened up a session during which he alternated between the old McCain ( as in punchy , feisty , humorous ) and the old McCain ( as in just plain old ) .
He moved a bit stiffly on the stage set up in the middle of the Adams Memorial Opera House .
And he–somewhat oddly –shared the spotlight with Senator Joseph Lieberman , who has endorsed him .
Lieberman did not merely introduce McCain ; he stood by McCain during the entire event , helping McCain to answer questions about education , climate change , and the Iraq war .
Several times , Lieberman gave more coherent and animated replies than did McCain .
Repeatedly , Lieberman maintained that McCain could rack up bipartisan successes as president .
( The Lieberman sidekick bit was curious .
But an elementary - age girl in the audience did say , after being handed a microphone , that Lieberman was her role - model and that she fancied McCain .
Lieberman hugged her , and the whole crowd oohed at this cuteness . )
Update : Video after the jump .
McCain has been coming on strong in New Hampshire , where he beat George W. Bush by 18 points in the 2000 Republican primary .
( Some polls place him in the lead . )
Eight years ago , McCain thrived as an independent - minded GOPer willing to blast the corruptions of Washington .
These days , his stock appears to be rising because he has stuck with the Iraq war and boasts of years of national security experience .
“ If the world was stable , we could afford Mitt Romney as the national CEO , ” says a McCain campaign aide ( who asks not to be identified ) .
“ But in an unsafe and unstable world , Republican voters , and some independents , are coming to see that we need a warrior in the White House . ”
The crisis in Pakistan , this aide notes , was a timely reminder .
So McCain is not doing so bad for a candidate who was on life - support last summer .
But it ’s not that he has craftily orchestrated his revival ; the other campaigns have fallen flat .
Romney has hard a tough time selling himself as a fellow ready to be commander in chief .
Rudy Giuliani cast himself as Mr. 9/11 – which is different from persuading voters you are Mr. Win the War . Fred Thompson , who highlighted the foreign policy experience he obtained on the Senate intelligence committee , has mounted a lackluster bid .
Mike Huckabee has had little to say about national security and has gaffed too often on foreign policy .
Regarding national security and the war , McCain has become the default Republican .
“ The Mac is back , ” Lieberman exclaimed in Derry .
Perhaps it ’s merely that McCain managed to stay on his feet while his rivals have faltered .
In the next few days , McCain and his supporters will be pushing him as the Republican who is ready for wartime .
This is a potent argument .
But will it win over the New Hampshire independents who swooned over McCain in 2000 ?
This slice of the electorate is not particularly fond of the war McCain champions .
Michael Dennehy , McCain ’s political director , says that independents “ will agree to disagree on the war with him if they think he ’s being honest . ”
Well , with McCain boldly declaring he does n’t give a damn how long U.S. troops are deployed in Iraq , his strategists can certainly say he is not holding back .
Whether that indeed impresses independents ( and Republicans ) in New Hampshire wo n’t be known until this Tuesday .
The problem in Iraq , we 're now told , was a lack of preparation , or the wrong kind of planning , or mistakes in implementation .
If only , say the neocons , we had put our man Ahmad Chalabi in charge from the start , the Iraqis would n't have felt so humiliated .
If only we had n't dissolved the army , the pragmatists insist , the insurgency would never have taken off .
If only the Brits had been running the show , mutter the old Whitehall hands , all would have been different .
The problem , it turns out , was not the invasion and occupation of a sovereign Arab oil state on a tide of official deceit , but the way it was carried out .
Meanwhile , we 're being subjected to a renewed barrage of spin about the success of the US surge in turning the country round , quelling the violence and opening the way to a sunlit future .
In an echo of his notorious " mission accomplished " speech of May 2003 , George Bush yesterday proclaimed the Iraq war a " major strategic victory " in the " war on terror " .
All this is self - delusion on a heroic scale .
The unprovoked aggression launched by the US and Britain against Iraq five years ago today has already gone down across the world as , to borrow the words of President Roosevelt , " a day which will live in infamy " .
Iraqis were promised freedom , democracy and prosperity .
Instead , as Jon Snow 's compelling TV documentary Hidden Iraq underlined this week , they have seen the physical and social destruction of their country , mass killing , tens of thousands thrown into jail without trial , rampant torture , an epidemic of sectarian terror attacks , pauperisation , and the complete breakdown of basic services and supplies .
On the eve of war , Tony Blair told parliament that , while there would be civilian casualties , Saddam Hussein would be " responsible for many more deaths even in one year than we will be in any conflict " .
Amnesty International estimated annual deaths linked to political repression in Iraq at that time to be in the low hundreds - many more were dying from the impact of western - sponsored sanctions .
In the five years since , civilian deaths are estimated at anywhere between 150,000 ( the figure accepted by the Iraqi government ) and a million - plus , with the Lancet 's estimate of 600,000 violent deaths in the first three years alone having held up as the most rigorous .
After five years of occupation , Iraq is ranked as the most violent and dangerous place in the world by an Economist Intelligence Unit index .
Two million refugees have fled the country as a result , while a further 2 million have been driven from their homes inside Iraq .
This has become the greatest humanitarian crisis on the planet .
In the western world , far from the scene of the unfolding catastrophe , such suffering has been somehow normalised as a kind of background noise .
But the impact on the aggressor states , both at home and abroad , has only begun to be felt : not only in the predicted terrorist blowback finally acknowledged by Tony Blair last year , but in a profound domestic political alienation , as well as a loss of standing and credibility across the globe .
How can anyone take seriously , for example , US or British leaders lecturing China about Tibet , Russia about Chechnya , or Sudan about Darfur , when they have triggered and presided over such an orgy of killing , collective punishment , prisoner abuse and ethnic cleansing ?
Given that the invasion of Iraq was regarded as illegal by the majority of the UN security council , its secretary general , and the overwhelming weight of international legal opinion , it must by the same token be seen as a war crime : what the Nuremberg tribunal deemed the " supreme international crime " of aggression .
If it were n't for the fact that there is not the remotest prospect of any mechanism to apply international law to powerful states , Bush and Blair would be in the dock at the Hague .
As it is , the only Briton to be found guilty of a war crime in Iraq has been corporal Donald Payne , convicted of inhumane treatment of detainees in Basra - while the man who sent him there is preposterously touted as a future president of the European Union .
Those who insist that the immolation of Iraq was the consequence of errors in the execution of an otherwise defensible policy are simply evading their own responsibility and culpability .
The likelihood of a bloody quagmire was widely foreseen before the attack .
The failure to do so by those who launched the aggression reflects a blindly arrogant refusal to accept that people are bound to resist foreign occupation , however much they detest their own government - particularly in a region that has already been subject to decades of destructive western intervention and exploitation .
Now the same voices can be heard arguing against an end to the occupation on the grounds that withdrawal might trigger even worse violence .
Of course no stabilisation of Iraq is going to be bloodless , but such arguments fail to recognise that the occupation itself has fostered sectarian conflict in classic colonial divide - and - rule style - the current US sponsorship of Sunni militias is a case in point .
As the US military 's own surveys show , Iraqis of all religious and ethnic groups believe the presence of foreign troops is the main cause of violence and 70 % want them out now .
Tellingly , violence in Basra dropped by 90 % after British troops withdrew from the city to their airport base last summer .
Naturally , the green zone government is against a US pullout , because it would n't survive on its own .
But only when the occupation forces make an unequivocal commitment to leave will Iraq 's main political and military players be compelled to come to an accommodation .
For the future , so long as the disaster of Iraq is put down to mistakes or lack of planning , the real lessons will not be learned , but repeated - as appears to be happening now in Afghanistan .
Gordon Brown has at last promised a full Iraq inquiry when British troops are no longer in the firing line .
But any more delay to a proper accounting of what has taken place - including , as the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said at the weekend , the nature of the US - British relationship - will only further corrode the political system .
The disaster of Iraq has at least had the effect of demonstrating the limits of imperial power and restraining further US attacks .
The danger is , however , that next time they 'll just try and do it differently - without the mistakes .

Chinese authorities appear to have lifted a block on BBC's English language news site after years of restricting access .
Internet users realised during last week that they could read the news coverage , although not the Chinese service .
Previously users in China who tried to access the news site were redirected to an error message stating : " The connection was reset . "
Beijing has never acknowledged blocking access to the news site and has made no comment on the apparent change in policy , which appears to have taken the BBC itself by surprise .
" It comes in with no problems or proxy ... even with a rather large report about his holiness [ the Dalai Lama ] , " wrote one web user .
Others suspected its availability might only be temporary , with one noting : " I doubt it will last , but refreshing to see . "
The timing is intriguing given the anger of officials - and many Chinese web users - at the way the western media have portrayed the unrest in Lhasa and provinces with a large Tibetan population .
Even articles about the protests are available from China .
Last year , students and their parents borrowed nearly $ 60 billion in federally guaranteed loans , a figure that has grown more than 6 percent annually over the last five years after taking into account inflation .
In recent years , the growth rate has declined but may pick up as the economy slows and as other borrowing options fade .
“ I want to make sure we are going to do our part , and that students will be able to go to college this fall , ” Ms. Spelling said .
Lawmakers in Washington have proposed increasing the amounts that students can borrow through federal programs and authorizing the Education Department to purchase federal loans , thereby providing banks with cash to make more loans .
The House Education Committee approved legislation this week that would allow dependent students to borrow a total of $ 31,000 through federal programs to pay for their undergraduate education , up from $ 23,000 now .
Still , it is difficult to gauge whether a financing problem will emerge later this year for students and , if so , how serious it might be .
The disruption in the federal lending program so far has mostly been from borrowers shifting to another lender .
Ms. Beaton , for example , expects her $ 5,000 loan request to eventually be granted .
“ By the time I get the money , school will probably be over , ” she said .
Financial aid administrators say few students had been shut out .
“ I have n’t heard anything about any sort of unusual trends so far , not to say that it is n’t going to intensify , ” said Daniel C. Walls , associate vice provost for enrollment management at Emory University in Atlanta .
“ I suspect there ’s going to be more negotiating around financial aid this year than any other year that we ’ve experienced . ”
Admitted students are just now receiving financial aid awards from colleges , and the test will come when tuition payments for the fall term are due , aid administrators say .
“ By mid- to late June , certainly July , will be the months that we really begin to understand the relative financial situations of families , ” said Jean McDonald - Rash , director of financial aid at Rutgers in New Jersey .
Rotten Celebrity Parents
There are lots of rotten parents out there … usually we do n’t get to hear about them but sometimes we get to witness the fruit of their mistakes in the flush spotlight of page 3 gossip and what not .
Here ’s a different take on celebrities – those who are n’t fit to be parents or in some cases , even to roam around unsupervised .
Here ’s the countdown …
20 . Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne
Why ?
While some might say that Ozzy and Sharon are the coolest parents in the whole wide world , we think they are pretty rotten .
How else can you explain the fact that their daughter , Kelly , was a drug addict at the age of 13 ?
And their son Jack …
Well , he got drunk for the first time when he was 14 and was , just a few years later , admitted to a child psychiatric ward for an addition to OxyContin .
Where were Ozzy and Sharon when all this took place , we wonder .
Sure , their mansion is big , but it ca n’t be THAT big …
Why ?
Supermodel Kate Moss landed on No. 19 on our list of Rotten Celeb Parents because she was busted for cocaine possession and used to let her daughter spend time with her crazy , drug addict boyfriend , Pete Doherty .
She also made this list because she forgot her own kid ’s third birthday .
What kind of mom does that ?

18 . Larry Birkhead
Why ?
As all of you probably already know , it was Larry Birkhead who turned out to be the biological father of Anna Nicole Smith ’s baby girl , Danielynn .
But after winning the lengthy custody battle against Smith ’s lawyer and husband Howard K. Stern – among others – it was clear that Birkhead did n’t fight for his fatherly rights just because of his love for his daughter , but also for the truckloads of cash that the baby might bring him in the future .
And he has already made some dough of his little baby girl by granting interviews and photo ops …
That Larry was in such a hurry to make money off the fact that he was the one with “ the most potent sperm ” makes him a pretty rotten parent in our book .
Why ?
Because this Hollywood couple has been engaged in such an extremely public custody dispute that it will haunt their two daughters for the rest of their lives !
Richards has accused Sheen for visiting prostitutes and for having both gambling and drug problems .
She has also said that Sheen has threatened to kill her and that he thinks that formula causes brain damage .
Sheen has denied all these allegations and has in turn claimed that Richards has requested his sperm in order to have another child .
Strangely enough , the couple has finally reached an agreement regarding the custody of the kids , but the fact remains – parents who publicly humiliate each other and in the long run their own children , are rotten !
16 . Joan Crawford
Why ?
Because , according to reports , actress Joan Crawford was a cruel and unusual mom .
It is said that she used to abuse her kids in weird ways .
The rumor has it that she showered her daughter Christina with gifts , just to force her to give them away and that she cut her daughter ’s hair off when she found out that she was using makeup .
Crawford adopted five children , though she raised only four .
A year and a half after Crawford ’s death ( she died in 1977 ) , her daughter Christina published a bestseller entitled , “ Mommie Dearest ” ( it later became a movie ) , which contained allegations that Crawford was emotionally and physically abusive to both her and her brother , Christopher .
15 . Nancy Aniston
Why ?
Sorry , but we just had to include Jennifer Aniston ’s mom , Nancy Aniston , on our list , even though she is not really famous .
And why did we ?
Well , because this mom from hell granted an interview about her daughter to a tabloid television show to capitalize on her daughter ’s fame .
But when Jennifer got angry and cut all ties with her mother , what did Nancy do ?
Patch things up with her daughter ?
No , instead she wrote a book called “ From Mother and Daughter to Friends : A Memoir ” .
The book was all about how to cope with estrangement from an adult child .
How disgusting is that ?
14 . Jaid Barrymore
Why ?
Because Drew Barrymore ‘s mom ( who is probably most famous for posing for Playboy ) showed her daughter how to party when she was just a kid .
It is said that Jaid took Drew to Studio 54 almost before the child could walk .
Drew was drinking at the age of nine and was snorting cocaine at 13 .
It is a miracle that the girl turned out sooooo great …
Why ?
Because Pamela Anderson brings home every weirdo she can find and after a few dates simply marries them …
Since it ca n’t be easy for her kids , Brandon and Dylan , to get a new step dad every other month or so , we think Pamela Anderson deserves her own special place in this “ Rotten Celeb Parents ” category …

12 . Dina Lohan
Why ?
Because Dina is freeloading off her own daughter .
The now famous Dina Lohan , actress Lindsay Lohan ’s mother , is trying to cash in on Lindsay ’s fame and she has succeeded – she now has her own reality show !
She even showed up at her own daughter ’s birthday party with a whole camera crew – just to make a few extra bucks off her beloved offspring – That ’s just immoral and totally rotten !
Why ?
Because the famous actor got the bubbly Melanie B. from Spice Girls pregnant and then refused to believe that the kid was his .
A paternity test later showed that the child actually was Eddie ’s , and he now takes care of the kid by paying child support …
Do we need to say more ?
More Eddie Murphy news .
10 . Whitney Houston & Bobby Brown
Why ?
Because it is said that both Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown used to smoke crack in the house while their kid was there – a fact that makes them bad parents in our book !
The couple is now divorced and Whitney has custody of their daughter .
Both Whitney and Bobby have been in rehab multiple times , and Brown has a long criminal record which includes arrests for drug possession , DUI , battery and violating parole .
Whitney met Bobby at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards .
They got married in 1992 and had their daughter the year after .
The Brown Bomber also has three other kids with different women .
Why ?
Because the former “ Baywatch ” star ’s parental skills ( or lack thereof ) are a classic example of when a kid becomes the parent ’s parent .
Just take a look at the video Hasselhoff ’s own daughter , Taylor Ann , shot of her shirtless dad when he is totally wasted .
In the video , Hasselhoff is TRYING to eat a hamburger while his daughter tells him that he cannot drink any more alcohol !
[ youtube:www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_uzZV51fM]
More David Hasselhoff news .
Why ?
Because Courtney Love took , according to some magazines , heroin while she was pregnant .
Love says that this is all a lie , but eleven years after she gave birth to her baby she lost custody of the child – after she overdosed on Oxycontin and got arrested for possession .
More Courtney Love news .
7. Woody Allen
Why ?
Simply because Woody Allen married his own stepdaughter – a fact that makes him a really nasty dad in our book .
By the way , all of you who say that you ca n’t love your kids too much – Mr. Allen has proved you wrong !
6. Hulk Hogan and Linda Bollea
Why ?
Because Linda and Terry Bollea aka Hulk Hogan have been using their 17 - year - old son , Nick , as a mediator in their bitter divorce , causing him to become introvert !
Since we feel terrible sorry for Nick , we simply had to include his parents on our list !
However , we ca n’t go to the next on our list without mentioning the latest scary story that has surfaced – that Hulk has had a sexual affair with his daughter ’s best friend , Christane Plante .
Now that ’s just simply rotten !
More Hulk Hogan news .
5. Kim Basinger
Why ?
Well , because the actress used her own daughter to get back at her ex husband , Alec Baldwin .
In order to hurt her ex , Kim Basinger allegedly leaked a nasty voicemail ( see the Alec Baldwin listing below ) to the media .
This proves to us that she does n’t care all that much about her 11 - year - old daughter ’s feelings .
The tape was played all over the world and all that Kim really accomplished was humiliating her own daughter .
A more inconsiderate mom is hard to find and that ’s why Kim Basinger is No. 5 on our Rotten Parents List !
4. Alec Baldwin
Why ?
Well , because Mr. Baldwin left an awful and very abusive message to his little 11 - year - old daughter , in which he called her a “ thoughtless little pig ” .
In the voice message that somehow was leaked to the media ( probably by the child ’s own mother , Baldwin ’s ex wife , Kim Basinger ) , he says : “ I do n’t give a damn that you ’re 12 - years - old or 11 - years - old , or that you are a child , or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass who does n’t care about what you do as far as I am concerned . ”
But he does not stop there .
He rambles on and even threatens his own daughter by saying : “ I ’m going to straighten your ass out when I see you ” .
Listen to the message and see for yourself why this dad made HotGossip.com ’s list of Rotten Celeb Parents .
[ youtube:www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J0-ZatDHug]
Why ?
Even though we all know that the King of Pop loves children ; we placed him on this list because a normal parent does n’t dangle his baby from a balcony .
Period .
It was in November 2002 , that Jackson traveled to Berlin to accept an award for his humanitarian efforts .
Lots of fans had gathered outside his hotel room when Michael suddenly decided to show the excited crowd his kid …
So he covered the baby ’s face (! ) and dangled his baby over the railing of the balcony .
That ’s just BAD !
More Michael Jackson news .
2. O.J. Simpson
Why ?
To answer this question we need to take a trip down memory lane …
As you all know O.J. Simpson was probably the one who killed the mother of his own kids back in 1994 , even though he was acquitted of the murder .
However , he was found liable for their wrongful deaths in civil court .
To date he has just paid a small portion of the $ 33.5 million judgment .
But the story about O.J. does n’t end there .
Just last year , Simpson was charged with numerous felonies , including robbery with a deadly weapon , burglary with a firearm , assault with a deadly weapon and first - degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon ( which carries a possible life sentence ) .
That Simpson is n’t a great role model for his kids must be the understatement of the millennium …
Why ?
Well , Britney Spears has probably done everything a mother should NOT do .
She has dropped one of her kids on the head , leaving him with a suspected fractured skull .
She has been caught driving around with her son in her lap and she has partied so hard that she has n’t had time to take care of her children or to even put her panties on .
Last but not least , she has been hospitalized at a psychiatric clinic a couple of times …
But all that has nothing to do with why she made this Rotten Parents List .
No , she is listed here because she managed to do something that we all thought was impossible :
To lose custody of her two kids to her seemingly clueless ex husband and wannabe rapper , K - Fed .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Most children are told to stay away from chewy candies to keep their teeth cavity - free , but children in Venezuela who ate a special cavity - fighting candy had 62 percent fewer cavities than those who brushed their teeth regularly , researchers said on Tuesday .

Most children are told to stay away from chewy candies to keep their teeth cavity - free , but children in Venezuela who ate a special cavity - fighting candy had 62 percent fewer cavities than those who brushed their teeth regularly , researchers said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Romeo Ranoco
Children in the study were testing the effectiveness of BasicMints , an experimental fluoride - free treatment designed to mimic a component in human saliva that neutralizes acids in the mouth that can erode tooth enamel .
Researchers at Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine , who developed the active compound in the mints known as CaviStat , tested them in 200 children in Venezuela aged 10 1 / 2 to 11 who were getting their adult molars but still had some baby teeth left .
Half the children in the study took two of the medicated mints in the morning after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste .
They followed the same routine at night .
The other half brushed normally twice daily with fluoride toothpaste and took plain sugarless mints .
After 12 months , children who took the cavity - fighting mints had 61.7 percent fewer cavities than the placebo group .
The soft mints are designed to be dissolved and chewed into the biting surfaces of the back teeth , where about 90 percent of cavities in children occur .
“ Unlike regular candies , we want this product to be stuck in the teeth , ” said Mitchell Goldberg , president of Ortek Therapeutics Inc , a privately held company in Roslyn Heights , New York , that licensed the technology from Stony Brook .
Goldberg said in a telephone interview that unlike sugarless gum , which fights cavities by temporarily increasing the flow of saliva in the mouth , the mints actively neutralize acids that cause cavities .
He said the company plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to begin testing the product in the United States by year end .
It may take several years of testing before it wins U.S. marketing approval .
The study was published in the March issue of the Journal of Clinical Dentistry .

The body of a man was discovered on a street in Lancaster , California around 1:45 a.m PDT ( UTC - 7 ) Tuesday morning with an arrow stuck deep into his chest .
Sheriff 's deputies who responded to the crime scene at 13th Street and Avenue K initially thought the victim to have been homeless , but he was later identified as Angel Martinez , age 62 , who resided in Lancaster .
" Who would want to do something like that to an elderly person ? " said Tony Martinez , a local resident who was among those who found the victim .
" And what was an elderly man doing out here anyway that late ? "
The attacker , who struck by night , is being sought by authorities .

Mr Bolten and Ms Miers ignored a subpoena to testify
The suit calls for former White House counsel Harriet Miers to testify to the panel and for chief - of - staff Joshua Bolten to provide subpoenaed documents .
The House Judiciary Committee said it would not allow the Bush administration " to steamroll Congress " by refusing .
A White House spokeswoman dismissed the lawsuit as " partisan theatre " .
The case , filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia , is the latest development in a row over the firing in 2006 of nine US federal prosecutors .
Critics charged that the sackings were politically motivated , directed by the White House because the attorneys in question were not supportive enough of the Republican agenda .
The White House has repeatedly denied that allegation .
' No crime '
The lawsuit filed by the House Judiciary Committee contests the White House 's view that Ms Miers is immune from being held to testify by Congress .
Alberto Gonzales resigned after months of calls for him to leave office
It also calls on Ms Miers and Mr Bolten to identify all the documents being withheld from Congress despite the subpoena issued by it early last year .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino responded : " The confidentiality that the president receives from his senior advisers and the constitutional principle of separation of powers must be protected from overreaching and we are confident that the courts will agree with us . "
Late last month , Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused to refer contempt citations passed by the Democrat - controlled House of Representatives against Ms Miers and Mr Bolten to a grand jury .
President George W Bush had instructed the pair not to comply , citing executive privilege , Mr Mukasey said , and the Justice Department had determined that that order was legal .
Federal prosecutors - or US attorneys - work under the direction of the attorney general but can be dismissed at any time at the discretion of the president .
The row over the US attorneys ' dismissal resulted in the departure of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last August , following months of calls for him to resign .

Creationists and evolutionists , Christians and non-Christians
Over the years , many people have challenged me with a question like :
I ’ve been trying to witness to my friends .
They say they do n’t believe the Bible and are n’t interested in the stuff in it .
They want real proof that there ’s a God who created , and then they ’ll listen to my claims about Christianity .
What proof can I give them without mentioning the Bible so they ’ll start to listen to me ?
Briefly , my response is as follows .
Evidence
Creationists and evolutionists , Christians and non-Christians all have the same evidence — the same facts .
Think about it : we all have the same earth , the same fossil layers , the same animals and plants , the same stars — the facts are all the same .
The difference is in the way we all interpret the facts .
And why do we interpret facts differently ?
Because we start with different presuppositions .
These are things that are assumed to be true , without being able to prove them .
These then become the basis for other conclusions .
All reasoning is based on presuppositions ( also called axioms ) .
This becomes especially relevant when dealing with past events .
Past and Present
We all exist in the present — and the facts all exist in the present .
When one is trying to understand how the evidence came about ( Where did the animals come from ?
How did the fossil layers form ? etc. ) , what we are actually trying to do is to connect the past to the present .
However , if we were n’t there in the past to observe events , how can we know what happened so we can explain the present ?
It would be great to have a time machine so we could know for sure about past events .
Christians of course claim they do , in a sense , have a “ time machine . ”
They have a book called the Bible which claims to be the Word of God who has always been there , and has revealed to us the major events of the past about which we need to know .
On the basis of these events ( Creation , Fall , Flood , Babel , etc. ) , we have a set of presuppositions to build a way of thinking which enables us to interpret the evidence of the present .
Evolutionists have certain beliefs about the past / present that they presuppose , e.g. no God ( or at least none who performed acts of special creation ) , so they build a different way of thinking to interpret the evidence of the present .
Thus , when Christians and non-Christians argue about the evidence , in reality they are arguing about their interpretations based on their presuppositions .
That ’s why the argument often turns into something like :
“ Ca n’t you see what I ’m talking about ? ” “ No , I can ’t .
Do n’t you see how wrong you are ? ”
“ No , I ’m not wrong .
It ’s obvious that I ’m right . ”
“ No , it ’s not obvious . ”
And so on .
These two people are arguing about the same evidence , but they are looking at the evidence through different glasses .
It ’s not until these two people recognize the argument is really about the presuppositions they have to start with , that they will begin to deal with the foundational reasons for their different beliefs .
A person will not interpret the evidence differently until they put on a different set of glasses — which means to change one ’s presuppositions .
The argument is really about the presuppositions they have to start with .
Christian
Christian
I ’ve found that a Christian who understands these things can actually put on the evolutionist ’s glasses ( without accepting the presuppositions as true ) and understand how they look at evidence .
However , for a number of reasons , including spiritual ones , a non-usually ca n’t put on the ’s glasses — unless they recognize the presuppositional nature of the battle and are thus beginning to question their own presuppositions .
It is of course sometimes possible that just by presenting “ evidence , ” you can convince a person that a particular scientific argument for creation makes sense “ on the facts . ”
But usually , if that person then hears a different interpretation of the same evidence that seems better than yours , that person will swing away from your argument , thinking they have found “ stronger facts . ”
However , if you had helped the person to understand this issue of presuppositions , then they will be better able to recognize this for what it is — a different interpretation based on differing presuppositions — i.e. starting beliefs .
As a teacher , I found that whenever I taught the students what I thought were the “ facts ” for creation , then their other teacher would just reinterpret the facts .
The students would then come back to me saying , “ Well sir , you need to try again . ”
However , when I learned to teach my students how we interpret facts , and how interpretations are based on our presuppositions , then when the other teacher tried to reinterpret the facts , the students would challenge the teacher ’s basic assumptions .
Then it was n’t the students who came back to me , but the other teacher !
This teacher was upset with me because the students would n’t accept her interpretation of the evidence and challenged the very basis of her thinking .
What was happening was that I had learned to teach the students how to think rather than just what to think .
What a difference that made to my class !
I have been overjoyed to find , sometimes decades later , some of those students telling me how they became active , solid Christians as a result .
Debate Terms
If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist , then they have set the terms of the debate .
In essence these terms are :
“ Facts ” are neutral .
However , there are no such things as “ brute facts ; ” all facts are interpreted .
Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument , then the Christians ’ presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts .
Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions — see Naturalism , Logic and Reality .
Truth can / should be determined independent of God .
However , the Bible states : “ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom ” ( Psalm 111:10 ) ; “ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ” ( Proverbs 1:7 ) . “ But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him ; neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned ” ( 1 Corinthians 2:14 ) .
A Christian cannot divorce the spiritual nature of the battle from the battle itself .
A non-Christian is not neutral .
The Bible makes this very clear : “ The one who is not with Me is against Me , and the one who does not gather with Me scatters ” ( Matthew 12:30 ) ; “ And this is the condemnation , that the Light has come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than the Light , because their deeds were evil ” ( John 3:19 ) .
Agreeing to such terms of debate also implicitly accepts their proposition that the Bible ’s account of the universe ’s history is irrelevant to understanding that history !
Ultimately , God ’s Word Convicts
1 Peter 3:15 and other passages make it clear we are to use every argument we can to convince people of the truth , and 2 Cor. 10:4–5 says we are to refute error ( like Paul did in his ministry to the Gentiles ) .
Nonetheless , we must never forget Hebrews 4:12 : “
For the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two - edged sword , piercing even to the dividing apart of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . ”
Also , Isaiah 55:11 : “
So shall My word be , which goes out of My mouth ; it shall not return to Me void , but it shall accomplish what I please , and it shall certainly do what I sent it to do . ”
Even though our human arguments may be powerful , ultimately it is God ’s Word that convicts and opens people to the truth .
In all of our arguments , we must not divorce what we are saying from the Word that convicts .
Practical Application
When someone tells me they want “ proof ” or “ evidence , ” not the Bible , my response is as follows :
You might not believe the Bible but I do .
And I believe it gives me the right basis to understand this universe and correctly interpret the facts around me .
I ’m going to give you some examples of how building my thinking on the Bible explains the world and is not contradicted by science .
For instance , the Bible states that God made distinct kinds of animals and plants .
Let me show you what happens when I build my thinking on this presupposition .
I will illustrate how processes such as natural selection , genetic drift , etc. can be explained and interpreted .
You will see how the science of genetics makes sense based upon the Bible .
One can of course do this with numerous scientific examples , showing how the issue of sin and judgment , for example , is relevant to geology and fossil evidence .
And how the Fall of man , with the subsequent Curse on creation , makes sense of the evidence of harmful mutations , violence , and death .
Once I ’ve explained some of this in detail , I then continue :
Now let me ask you to defend your position concerning these matters .
Please show me how your way of thinking , based on your beliefs , makes sense of the same evidence .
And I want you to point out where my science and logic are wrong .
In arguing this way , a Christian is :
Using biblical presuppositions to build a way of thinking to interpret the evidence .
Showing that the Bible and science go hand in hand .
1
Challenging the presuppositions of the other person ( many are unaware they have these ) .
Forcing the debater to logically defend his position consistent with science and his own presuppositions ( many will find that they cannot do this ) .
Honouring the Word of God that convicts the soul .
Remember , it ’s no good convincing people to believe in creation , without also leading them to believe and trust in the Creator / Redeemer , Jesus Christ .
God honours those who honour His Word .
We need to use God-honouring ways of reaching people with the truth of what life is all about .
Click to viewYou love working inside your Linux desktop , but at the most inconvenient times you 've got to reboot into Windows — whether to open a tricky Office file , try out a Windows application , or even just play a quick game .
However , with some free tools and a Windows installation disk , you can have Windows apps running right on your Linux desktop and sharing the same desktop files .
It 's relatively painless , it takes only a little bit longer than a Windows XP install , and it works just like virtualizing Windows on a Mac with Parallels Coherence — except it 's free .
Here 's how to set up Windows inside VirtualBox , and then get Windows apps running seamlessly inside your desktop .

Before getting started , make sure you have enough space on a hard drive for a Windows XP installation ( meaning at least 5 GB ) and enough memory to make two systems worthwhile .
You can follow most of these steps if you want to try running Vista inside Linux , but your mileage might vary , of course ( and check out this tip on making Vista 's networking work ) .

If you 're curious what the end result might look like , here 's a screenshot from my quick installation .
I would 've loved to have gotten iTunes running , but I did n't have time to wait for all the post - XP - installation patches / upgrades to install to show you .
( Click for larger image )
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
First off , we 'll install VirtualBox .
For most , that just involves heading to their package manager and installing all the virtualbox pacakges from the repositories ; in Ubuntu 7.10 ( " Gutsy Gibbon " ) , for example , you can use this terminal command
sudo aptitude install virtualbox - ose virtualbox - ose - modules - generic
If you do n't see VirtualBox in your installation program , the app's downloads page has packages for just about every major distribution .
After installing , give your username permissions to run VirtualBox ( substituting " su " on some systems ) :
sudo usermod - G vboxusers - a [ your username ]
Advertisement
Restart your system for good measure , and now you should see " InnoTek VirtualBox " in your application menu — it was in " System Tools ' in Gutsy .
Get your XP CD ready and fire up VirtualBox .
Choose " New " from the button menu , and then give your virtual system a name ( WIndows XP usually works for me ) and choose " Windows XP " from the bottom menu , then hit " Next . "
Decide how much RAM you 'll dedicate to it in the next window , hit " Next , " then , assuming you have n't done this before , hit " New " and follow the prompts to set up hard drive space for your virtual XP system .
Make sure that partition is selected , hit " Next , " then hit " Finish " to set up your new XP space .
Advertisement
Back at VirtualBox 's main screen , see if the " CD / DVD - ROM " menu is highlighted .
If not , click it , and then check " Mount CD / DVD Drive , " " Host CD / DVD Drive " ( and make sure it points to your system 's CD drive ) , and check yes for " Enable Passthrough . "
Hit OK , select your XP image from the left - hand column and hit " Start . "
You 'll launch into the hopefully familiar XP installation routine ; follow it through until you 're at your Windows desktop .
Advertisement
Now you 've got a working Windows inside a resizable box , but let 's take this further .
Remove your XP CD from the drive , head up to the " Devices " menu and choose " Unmount CD / DVD-ROM . "
In the same menu , choose " Install Guest Additions . "
VirtualBox should prompt you to download the Guest Additions ISO file , then select it to be mounted .
This creates a virtual CD drive in XP , which you can get to through Start Menu - >
My Computer ( it might take a moment to show up ) .
Double - click the " CD drive " and follow the prompts to install the extra tools .
Reboot once you 're done for good measure , and restart the XP machine .
Once that 's finished , you 've got a " Seamless " option available in the " Machine " menu , or by holding down the " Host " key ( Right Control by default ) and hitting " L. " Either way you run it , it drops the big window and deposits Windows ' bottom taskbar on your Linux desktop .
You can also ditch the main VirtualBox window at this point , if you 'd prefer .
Advertisement
The Start panel 's default bottom position can be a problem for GNOME - based systems , since you 've already got an app - switching bar there .
I recommend either moving your Start or GNOME menus to the left or right - hand sides , or setting your Start menu to double - height , which puts the Start button just above the GNOME bar .
Either way , make sure you un-check the " Keep the taskbar on top of other windows " option on the Windows toolbar , or you might see a few graphical glitches .
Otherwise , pretty neat , huh ?

Now for the final piece : Synchronizing your Windows and Linux desktops .
If you 're running in Seamless mode , hold down the " Host " key and hit " Home " to bring back the virtual XP desktop .
Select the " Device " menu and choose " Shared Folders . "
You 'll be prompted to choose a folder from your Linux system ; select your Desktop folder ( usually found at / home / your username / Desktop ) .
Head back to Windows , launch a command prompt ( enter " cmd " into the " Run " dialog ) , and enter the following :
net use x : \\vboxsvr \Desktop
If it worked , you should see an X : network drive mounted in your " My Computer " window .
Advertisement
Now for the final touch : Synchronizing the two desktops .
In XP , hit the " Run " dialog and type in " regedit . "
Make a backup first ( File - > Export ) , and then navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CurrentVersion -> Explorer -> User Shell Folders .
Double - click to open the properties on the " Desktop " key you 'll find there , and enter a new value of ( without the quotes ) " x : " .

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK , Wyo . 
The grassy sweep of the Lamar Valley in the northeastern corner of this park is famous for its wildlife , especially its vast herds of elk and bison and the wolves that hunt them .
But while walking across the Lamar last fall , Robert L. Crabtree , chief scientist with the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center in Bozeman , Mont. , pointed out a cascade of ecological changes under way .
The number of grizzly bears and gophers in the valley has increased , Dr. Crabtree said , an increase supported by the spread of an invasive plant from the Mediterranean that a warming climate benefits .
“ It ’s the early stages of a new ecosystem , ” he said , “ one that has n’t been seen here before . ”
The plant , Canada thistle , provides food for grizzlies in more than one way but may also be squeezing out native plants that cannot compete .
Canada thistle first appeared in North America several hundred years ago and has been present in Yellowstone at least since the 19th century , Dr. Crabtree said .
Because of its extensive root system , the plant defies spraying , and park officials have largely abandoned efforts to control it .
Warming temperatures have helped its fortunes .

Tyler Cowen is impressed with the arguments against them made by David Cutler , Obama 's chief healthcare adviser .
I 'd point out something else about this rare Clinton - Obama policy difference .
Obama is the more pragmatic and centrist of the two on this matter .
The notion that he is the more liberal of the two is not a very enlightening analysis .
In general , they represent different strands of liberalism , and it's reflected in their campaign rhetoric .
Obama tends to emphasize people 's ability to help themselves and their capacity to do so independently of government .
Clinton tends to emphasize the neediness of people for government support and help , and she 's much more comfortable with coercive government action .
It 's " Yes , We Can , " vs " I'll Take Care Of You . "
And that 's why a simplistic Obama - is - a - leftist critique wo n't work as well as some seem to think .
He 's a liberal , but a reconstructed one .
He 's the kind of liberal who sees dependency as a problem not a solution .
And he's not a statist in the way previous liberal generations have been .
He actually listened to and absorbed some of the conservative critique of liberalism these past two decades .
And he has changed not just to protect his right flank .

Mike Gray , an author , film maker , and Common Sense for Drug Policy Chairman , in cooperation with the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative , has created a documentary titled " Protestant , Catholic and Jewish Clergy Speak Out Against The War On Drugs . "
Part 1
Part 2
The reasons for making this video were clear .
As Rabbi Michael Feinberg , Executive Director of the Greater NY Labor Religion Coalition , says in the film , " I would say that the war on drugs has caused as much devastation to communities around this country , particularly low income communities , as the drugs themselves . "
And in the words of The Very Rev. Scott Richardson , Dean at St. Paul 's Episcopal Cathedral in San Diego , " One of the reasons that we as religious leaders need to speak out against it is because we share responsibility for it . "
The clergy video is available online .
Due to its length , it has been divided into two parts , both of which are embedded below .
The full - length DVD should soon be available through IDPI  stay tuned for details .

Bush session with reporters was strictly off - the - record Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Fourteen White House reporters were given a rare hour of access to President Bush on Monday , but the issues they discussed wo n't be making any headlines -- the session was all off - the - record .
The informal meeting , as reported by the Los Angeles Times , took place as part of a new White House plan to reach out to the press without having to rely on " full - blown news conferences . "
" He did the same in September , speaking aboard Air Force One with reporters while traveling to Sydney , Australia , from Iraq 's Anbar Province , " wrote the paper 's James Gerstenzang .
An additional nine reporters were invited to the Oval Office on Thursday to " preview " President Bush 's speech to the Heritage Foundation , in which he defended attorney general pick , Michael Mukasey , and characterized " some in Washington " as listening more to MoveOn.org and the anti-war group Code Pink than to " warnings of terrorists like Osama Bin Laden . "
Although that particular session was on - the - record , it was " off- camera . "
" Thursday 's effort was one of several recent steps he has taken to amplify his message as he wrestles with his lame - duck status , low approval ratings and increasingly independent congressional Republicans , " according to the LA Times .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino told the paper that the meetings were part of " a desire to be creative to try to provide some access to the president ...
It was just a new tool we 'd like to have in our toolbox . "
Off - the - record " reach outs " are not a new tack from the Bush administration .
In March 2006 , the president conducted similar invited sessions with an assortment of media outlets .
" The meetings , which the journalists have agreed not to describe publicly , have been in the White House residence , " reported the New York Times last year .
" They come as several news organizations have assigned new reporters , who had no relationship with Mr. Bush , to cover the White House . "
The Times itself chose not to participate in those talks .
" The Times has declined this opportunity after weighing the potential benefits to our readers against the prospect of withholding information from them about the discussion with Mr. Bush , " stated the paper 's Washington bureau chief , Philip Taubman , at the time .
" As a matter of policy and practice , we would prefer when possible to conduct on - the - record interviews with public officials . "
But Taubman , along with Times executive editor Bill Keller and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , did reportedly agree to keep mum about a closed door session with the president in 2005 .
According to sources cited by the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz , President Bush met with the Times representatives prior to publication of the story that the president had authorized eavesdropping on Americans without the benefit of court orders .
The Post 's executive editor , Leonard Downie Jr. , had a similar meeting that year just before that paper ran a piece about secret Eastern European prisons run by the CIA .
" But the meetings were confirmed by sources who have been briefed on them but are not authorized to comment because both sides had agreed to keep the sessions off the record , " wrote Kurtz .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp BAC.N , the largest U.S. retail bank , may set aside a record $ 6.5 billion in the first quarter to cover possible future loan losses , including in its mortgage and home equity portfolios , according to a banking analyst .

Richard Bove of Punk Ziegel &
Co also slashed his earnings forecasts for the bank through 2010 , though he still expects a first - quarter profit .
He said actual losses in the portfolios should be “ somewhat less ” than the amount he expects set aside , suggesting the bank would be conservative in its forecast of future credit trends .
“ I do not foresee the economy plunging to a level that will substantiate this reserve build , ” wrote Bove , who has a “ buy ” rating on the bank , in a report dated March 24 .
“ It is my impression that the management has made a decision to try to take , upfront , the potential losses that it believes may be nascent . ”
Bove cut his profit per share forecast to $ 2.98 from $ 3.81 for 2008 , to $ 3.96 from $ 4.30 for 2009 , and to $ 4.78 from $ 4.93 for 2010 .
He sees first - quarter profit of 37 cents per share .
Bank of America was not immediately available for comment .
In January , Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said he expected full - year profit would top $ 4 per share .
He predicted credit costs would rise by more than 20 percent , largely in consumer portfolios , but that such an increase would be manageable .
The Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank set aside $ 3.31 billion for credit losses in the fourth quarter , and $ 8.39 billion for all of 2007 , up 67 percent from a year earlier .
Bank of America agreed in January to buy Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N , the largest U.S. mortgage lender , in a transaction now valued at about $ 4.4 billion .
The all - stock transaction values Countrywide at $ 7.63 per share , which is 32 percent above Countrywide ’s Thursday closing price of $ 5.78 .
The gap reflects some investors ’ expectations that Bank of America might at least try to renegotiate the merger terms because the housing market has weakened .
Bank of America shares closed Thursday at $ 41.86 on the New York Stock Exchange .
They rose 17 percent last week , a strong week for bank stocks , and are up a little more than 1 percent this year .

On Thursday , Bush lied about Iran again : “ President Bush said the Iranian government has “ declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people . . . ”
The Iranian leaders have consistently condemned nuclear weapons as inhumane and denounced them and said that they do n’t want them and it would be illegal in Islamic law to use them .
Bush is welcome to disbelieve them , but he is not welcome to lie about what they said .
He again hinted around that they might have a nuclear weapons program , for which there is no evidence and which flies in the face of the findings of his own intelligence analysts , in the National Intelligence Estimate .
It is all the more insulting that these were Bush ’s remarks on the occasion of the Persian New Year , which should have been a moment for diplomacy and reaching out .
When Bush ’s spokesman was pressed for a clarification of Bush ’s lies , he responded with more lies , saying Bush was referring to a combination of Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s threat to ‘ wipe Israel off the face of the map . ’
But the nuclear ambitions are civilian as far as anyone can prove , and Ahmadinejad never threatened any such thing .
William Branigan ( with Robin Wright ) of the The Washington Post notes :
” In an October 2005 speech to a conference on a “ World without Zionism , ” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted by a state - run Iranian news agency as agreeing with a statement by Iran ’s late spiritual leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , that “ Israel must be wiped off the map . ”
Iran ’s foreign minister later said the comment had been incorrectly translated from Farsi and that Ahmadinejad was “ talking about the [ Israeli ] regime , ” which Iran does not recognize and wants to see collapse .
According to Farsi - speaking commentators including Juan Cole , a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan , Ahmadinejad ’s exact quote was , “ The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time . ”
Cole has written that Ahmadinejad was not calling for the “ Nazi - style extermination of a people , ” but was expressing the wish that the Israeli government would disappear just as the shah of Iran ’s regime had collapsed in 1979 .
In December , a U.S. intelligence review concluded that Iran stopped work on a suspected nuclear weapons program four years earlier , reversing a previous assessment that Iran was determined to acquire nuclear arms . ”
Branigan deserves some sort of medal for fearless truth - telling .
You can only imagine the sort of pressure he will get over these paragraphs from the Propaganda Corps .
I heard Barack Obama speaking last August , and he said something very interesting .
He said words to this effect : “ You know how they say that if you repeat a Big Lie often enough , it becomes accepted as reality ?
Well , the same thing can be said of the truth . ”
If you repeat the truth often enough , you can get it accepted as the truth .
Obama , as usual , is right and more– he reminds us that there is hope , that we do n’t have to surrender to cynicism or the Propaganda Corps in American political life .
I think this WaPo article is the biggest success I ’ve ever had in that regard .
Just to give you an idea of how wrong Bush is , here is what Ahmadinejad actually said in a recent interview in the Spanish newspaper , El Pais :
‘ Throughout its history , Iran has always been a peaceful country .
We have not attacked anybody .
Everything we are doing is aimed at defending the country .
We think that the age of nuclear weapons is over .
If they were useful , the United States would not have the troubles it currently has and the Soviet Union would not have disappeared .
The Zionists have atomic bombs , but they are failing against HAMAS .
We not only think that the age of nuclear weapons is over , but we are also not interested in building them , because we consider that they are against human rights and dignity .
Our security doctrine is a defensive doctrine . ‘
Ahmadinejad is n’t saying something new here .
I discussed his earlier statement here :
‘” Iran is not a threat to any country , and is not in any way a people of intimidation and aggression . ”
He described Iranians as people of peace and civilization .
He said that Iran does not even pose a threat to Israel , and wants to deal with the problem there peacefully , through elections :
“ Weapons research is in no way part of Iran ’s program .
Even with regard to the Zionist regime , our path to a solution is elections . ” ‘
Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei has condemned nuclear weapons , said Iran does not want them , and pledged no first strike with any sort of weapon :
‘ “ Their other issue is [ their assertion ] that Iran seeks [ a ] nuclear bomb .
It is an irrelevant and wrong statement , it is a sheer lie .
We do not need a nuclear bomb .
We do not have any objectives or aspirations for which we will need to use a nuclear bomb .
We consider using nuclear weapons against Islamic rules .
We have announced this openly .
We think imposing the costs of building and maintaining nuclear weapons on our nation is unnecessary .
Building such weapons and their maintenance are costly .
By no means we deem it right to impose these costs on the people .
We do not need those weapons .
Unlike the Americans who want to rule the world with force , we do not claim to control the world and therefore do not need a nuclear bomb .
Our nuclear bomb and our explosive powers are our faith , our youth and our people who have been present on the most difficult scenes with utmost power and faith and will continue to do so .
( Chants of slogan , God is great ) . ‘
Ahmadinejad says a lot of kooky , bigotted and objectionable things things , and he is a hardliner who has tried to purge liberals .
But Bush ’s propaganda only has the effect of building him up as important and improving his electoral chances .

Humans , birds , and other creatures share a set of genes that lead to the development of fingers and other digits ( like paws or wings ) , but the way those digits form has been a mystery .
Now a group of researchers in Wisconsin have discovered the secret of digit growth , and perhaps the key to regrowing severed or stunted fingers .
It 's even possible this research would allow you to grow an extra finger or two .
This might make working with your hands easier , or lead to strange biopunk fashions that involve fingers sprouting from your head .
Advertisement
The best part is that one of the genes involved in finger - creation is called Sonic Hedgehog :
The UW - Madison team showed that growth begins in a portion of the developing digit they have named the phalanx - forming region ( PFR ) .
They illustrated that phalanges , structures that later become finger or toe bones , arise not from cartilage cells but from mesenchymal cells .
And they discovered that a complex array of signals from a variety of genes at different times combine to form each phalanx .
Though the research was done on chick digits , it may have implications for humans born with a genetic condition known as bradydactyly , or stubby fingers and toes .
The work was undertaken in the laboratory of John Fallon , the Harland Winfield Mossman Professor of Anatomy at the SMPH , who for years has sought to understand how cell fate is determined and patterning - of digits , teeth and feathers - is achieved during embryonic development .
In birds and mammals , digits arise in the mitten - shaped autopod , or developing foot , which consists of two alternating regions .
The digital rays , made up of cartilage and mesenchyme , become the phalanges in the adult chicken 's toes .
These alternate with the interdigits , also consisting of mesenchymal tissue , which fill the space between the digit rays and eventually regress .
Scientists know that the gene Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) plays an important role in determining the form and number of digits , and many believe that other secondary signaling centers downstream of SHH also are involved in establishing a particular digit 's identity . . .
Sean Hasso , Fallon 's current graduate student , wanted to know precisely which cells in the digital ray give rise to phalanges and which molecular events determine the number , size and shape of each phalanx .
Performing microsurgery and cell marking studies on the embryonic chick autopod , Hasso showed that the cells that eventually form phalanges arise from the growth of mesenchyme at the tip of the digital ray .

If we can learn to stimulate mesenchyme cells , we could promote the growth of new digits .
No word on whether we can actually get human mesenchyme cells to grow wings or claws .

For Tava , “ the strategy was going in to talk to the right few who could fuel the many , ” she added .
In addition to providing samples to employees of companies like Apple , Bliss Spa , Google and MTV , Pepsi-Cola is giving away Tava at events like the Sundance Film Festival and to customers of businesses like Frank ’s Chop Shop , a barbershop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan .
It will also offer the beverage to arts lovers at plays , concerts and festivals , and to celebrities at locations like the set of the TV soap opera “ General Hospital . ”
Image Posters in stores are part of a campaign to introduce Tava , with flavor names like Brazilian Samba and Mediterranean Fiesta .
According to Ms. Hughes and Mr. Cooper , the campaign is zeroing in on eight major markets where consumers seem to appreciate soft drinks that contain vitamins and bear new - age flavor names like Brazilian Samba , Mediterranean Fiesta and Tahitian Tamure .
They are Boston , Chicago , Denver , Los Angeles , Miami , New York , Seattle and Raleigh , N.C .
The online aspects of the campaign extend beyond local markets .
The Web sites on which the Tava banner ads are to appear include AOL , chow.com , CitySearch , dailycandy.com , discovery.com , Evite , MSN , oprah.com , People and weather .com .

“ The target spends significant amounts of time online every day , ” said Christian Dietrich , director for the Pepsi-Cola client business at the Dallas office of Tribal DDB , “ not just for utilitarian reasons but for interest - based exploration . ”
The idea for the banner ads is to “ give you that taste , pun intended , for what the brand is about , ” he added , “ and increase your predisposition to click through to the Tava site . ”
The content of tava.com goes beyond pitches for the product , including downloadable songs from emerging musicians like Deccatree , a rock band from California , and Stephanie McKay , a singer from New York .
It also features the work of artists like Amy Guip , an illustrator and photographer , and carries information about arts events like the Boston Arts Festival , the Chicago Jazz Festival and Shakespeare in the Park at Central Park .
Feds : Employers allowed to block e-mails related to labor union activity RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 22 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Employers have the right to bar employees from sending union - related E- mails using company servers , the New York Times reports .
On Friday , the National Labor Relations Board ruled 3 - 2 that an employer , using internal company policy , has the right to classify a union - related communication as a " non-job - related solicitation . "
The two dissenting board members noted that E- mail has become a major form of communication in the workplace , and disagreed with the majority 's assertion that a company 's " property rights " trump an employee 's right to organize and discuss workplace - related issues with other workers .
# EXCERPTS : The ruling involved The Register - Guard , a newspaper in Eugene , Ore. , and e-mail messages sent in 2000 by Susi Prozanski , a newspaper employee who was president of the Newspaper Guilds unit there .
She sent an e-mail message about a union rally and two others urging employees to wear green to show support for the unions position in contract negotiations .
During the years that this case was pending , many companies were uncertain whether they could bar union - related e-mail .
But the labor boards decision gives companies nationwide the green light to flatly prohibit union - related e-mails as part of an overall non-solicitation policy .
 Anyone with e-mail knows that this is how employees communicate with each other in todays workplace ,  said Jonathan Hiatt , general counsel for the A.F.L. - C.I.O.  Outrageously in allowing employers to ban such communications for union purposes , the Bush labor board has again struck at the heart of what the nations labor laws were intended to protect  the right of employees to discuss working conditions and other matters of mutual concern . #

“ That led to a funny result , ” Mr. Manjoo writes .
“ People in the study became polarized . ”
A fair reading of the two studies might have led the students to question whether any strong conclusions could be drawn about deterrence , and thus to tone down their views on the death penalty .
But the opposite happened .
Students on each side accepted the evidence that conformed to their original views while rejecting the contrary evidence  and so afterward students on both sides were more passionate and confident than ever of their views .
That ’s what we seem to be seeing in the Democratic primaries .
Even though the policy differences between the two candidates are minimal , each camp is becoming increasingly aggravated at the other .
A Washington Post poll published Wednesday found that more than one - third of Democrats say that they may not support their party ’s nominee if it is not their own choice .
Another challenge is the biased way in which we gather information .
We seek out information that reinforces our prejudices .
One study presented listeners with static - filled recordings of speeches that they believed they were judging on persuasive power .
Listeners could push a button to tweak the signal , reducing the static to make it easier to understand .
When smokers heard a speech connecting tobacco with cancer , they did n’t try to improve the clarity to hear it more easily .
But they pushed the button to get a clearer version of a speech saying that there was no link between smoking and cancer .
Nonsmokers were the exact opposite .
This resistance to information that does n’t mesh with our preconceived beliefs afflicts both liberals and conservatives , but a raft of studies shows that it is a particular problem with conservatives .
For example , when voters receive mailings offering them free pamphlets on various political topics , liberals show some interest in getting conservative views .
In contrast , conservatives seek only those pamphlets that echo their own views .
Likewise , liberal blogs overwhelmingly link to other liberal blogs or news sources .
But with conservative blogs , the tendency is much more pronounced ; it is almost a sealed universe .
The situation is n’t hopeless .
Similar psychological processes govern our perceptions of race , yet we ’ve made great progress in revising our views and reducing prejudices .
The same is true of attitudes towards gays .
The only solutions I see are personal ones , to work out daily to build our mental muscles .
Just as we force ourselves to nibble on greens and decline cheesecake , we should seek an information diet that includes a salad bar of information sources  with a special focus on unpalatable rubbish from fools .
The worse it tastes , the better it may be for us .
If that ’s why you ’re reading this , congratulations !
And thanks !

One of them looks like a giant mint humbug , with its clear blue , green and brown stripes .
The other looks as if it has been shot through with a streak of spearmint .
These stunning banded icebergs - formed over hundreds , if not thousands , of years - were pictured floating in the waters of the Antarctic .
Scroll down for more ...
The Antartic : Norwegian sailor Oyvind Tangen was aboard a research vessel when he noticed the unusual black lines striped through the ice block
Some of the stripes formed when layers of the iceberg melted and refroze .
Others were created from the dust and soil picked up when the ice sheet that gave birth to the iceberg was sliding down an Antarctic hillside .
The sailors thought that the icebergs looked like mint humbugs
They were photographed by Norwegian sailor Oyvind Tangen , on board a research ship around 1,700 miles south of Cape Town and 660 miles north of the Antarctic .
" It reminds me of striped candy I bought as a child , " said 62 - year - old Mr Tangen .
The first iceberg was about 150ft long and 30ft high .
The second was about 100 ft tall .
Most of those in the Antarctic were formed from snow falling on the giant ice sheet that covers the continent .
Over time , the snow is compressed to form more ice , which slides slowly towards the sea .
There it either breaks off into the water , or forms an ice shelf .
Most appear white as a result of the tiny bubbles trapped within them which scatter light in every direction .
However , if the bubbles are squeezed out , or if part of the iceberg melts and quickly refreezes , it can appear blue .
Scroll down for more ...
A few days later , the ship came across another striped iceberg with a striking diagonal blue line through it , which towered about 30 metres above the ocean surface
Blue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with meltwater and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form .
When an iceberg falls into the sea , a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside .
If this is rich in algae , it can form a green stripe .
Brown , black and yellow lines are caused by sediment , picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea .
Only one - tenth of an iceberg lies above the water .
The biggest known iceberg towered 551ft above sea level - the height of a 55 - storey building .
The marbled icebergs look like rocks or striped sweets
China 's crackdown on monk - led rallies in Lhasa is part of a long history of state control of monasteries , says Peter Firstbrook , producer of BBC Four series A Year in Tibet .
Monks suffered after a Tibetan uprising was crushed in 1959 Buddhist monasteries are among the few institutions in China which have the potential to organise resistance and opposition to the government - so the Chinese Communist Party constantly worries about them .
Are some monks secret supporters of the Dalai Lama ?
Could they be working towards Tibetan independence ?
Beijing 's fear is so great that being found with just a photograph of the Dalai Lama in your possession could land you in jail .
Government regulation of the monasteries started almost as soon as the People 's Liberation Army marched into Tibet in 1950 .
See a map of Tibet
The recent protests mark the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising of 1959 when anti-Chinese and anti-communist demonstrations erupted on the streets of Lhasa , and were put down by force .
Lhasa 's three major monasteries - the Sera , Drepung and Ganden , were seriously damaged by shelling .
The Dalai Lama was forced to flee into exile and the Tibetan government - in - exile estimates that 86,000 Tibetans died .
I visit these temples once or twice a month .
I tell them what to do and what not to do .
They all listen and say nothing
Butri
Communist Party official Less than a decade later , Mao's Cultural Revolution wrought havoc in the region and the Red Guards destroyed more than 6,000 monasteries and convents - just a handful survived .
Along with the buildings , hundreds and thousands of priceless and irreplaceable statues , tapestries and manuscripts were destroyed .
" At that time all the monasteries were destroyed .
The whole country was changing during the revolution .
The wave of change was unstoppable , " says Dondrup , a 77 - year - old monk at the Pel Kor Monastery in Gyantse .
' False ' lama Further evidence of Chinese control over Tibetan Buddhism came in 1995 , with the naming of the new reincarnation of the Panchen Lama - second only to the Dalai Lama in terms of spiritual seniority in Tibet .
The Dalai Lama selected six - year - old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima - but within days the young boy and his immediate family disappeared , apparently abducted .
Although we can't have that many lamas now , we can still absorb new lamas under the current regulations and policies
Tsultrim
Pel Kor monastery
The Chinese government soon announced they had found the real Panchen Lama , a six - year old boy named Gyaltsen Norbu .
Gyaltsen Norbu just happened to be the son of two Tibetan Communist Party workers and he was soon whisked off to Beijing , where he continues to live today .
Only occasionally does he appear in public , in carefully stage - managed events .
Most monks regard him as a " false " lama , though he is venerated by ordinary Tibetans .
We filmed his visit to the Pel Kor Monastery in Gyantse in September 2006 .
It was clear the authorities were worried about demonstrations as there were hundreds of police and army personnel on the streets and the monks had to go through a security check to get into their own monastery .
Since the 1980s the Chinese government has begun to rebuild some of the monasteries and also granted greater religious freedom - although it is still limited .
But almost every aspect of the lives of Buddhist monks and nuns is monitored and controlled by the government .
Phone technology Every monastery and nunnery in Tibet is visited at least once every few weeks by a Communist Party official , who checks that the government rules and regulations are being correctly applied .
Butri , a Tibetan Communist Party cadre , explains : " I visit these temples once or twice a month .
I tell them what to do and what not to do .
They all listen and say nothing . "
The government is also very careful whom it allows to become a monk .
All novices have to go through a detailed vetting procedure which takes years to complete .
Even their families are checked for any subversive background .
The Chinese government also restricts the number of monks and nuns .
In fact , monasteries can no longer perform many of their rituals correctly because of a shortage of monks .
Tsultrim , the deputy head lama of the Pel Kor monastery in Gyantse , said at its peak the monastery was home to 1,500 monks .
Today the Chinese government restricts numbers to no more than 80 .
" Although we can't have that many lamas now , we can still absorb new lamas under the current regulations and policies , " he said .
" Of course , we need to check up on them , to see if they 're the right people for us . "
The recent conflict on the streets of Lhasa mirrors events almost 20 years ago - the last time there were major protests - when frustration among the monks and ordinary Tibetans finally reached boiling point in 1989 .
But today , there is one important difference : technology .
Practically every Tibetan monk I have met has a mobile phone .
They even have special pockets sewn inside their robes to carry them .
In the past it has been notoriously difficult to communicate across the vast expanse of Tibet .
Today , everybody is just a text away .

Linc Chafee speaks
As a rule , senatorial memoirs are n’t especially exciting .
They ’re frequently exercises in vanity , with personal anecdotes that are n’t quite as interesting as the lawmakers tend to believe .
But former Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island , who left the Republican Party after losing his re-election bid in 2006 , actually seems to have put an interesting book together .
Former U.S. Sen. Lincoln Chafee ’s new political memoir is remarkable for its candor , its delicious window into life in America ’s most exclusive club , and its condemnation of President Bush and the combination of right - wing Republicans and Democratic enablers who plunged the nation into an ill - fated war without end in Iraq .
The most startling revelation : Chafee must be the only senator in U.S. political history who says his defeat was the result of voters acting logically .
“ The system works best when power remains in the hands of the voters , ” writes Chafee .
“ I was a casualty of the system working in 2006 , and while defeat is never easy , I give the voters credit :
They made the connection between electing even popular Republicans at the cost of leaving the Senate in the hands of a leadership they had learned to mistrust . ”
That ’s a little unusual , is n’t it ?
Complimenting the voters who threw you out of office ?
Chafee directs some of his fiercest criticism at Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush , the latter of which he actually considered challenging in the New Hampshire primary .
On the Democratic frontrunner :
The book excoriates Mr. Bush and his GOP allies who repeatedly fanned such wedge issues as changing the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriage , abortion and flag - burning .
But he saves some of his harshest words for Democrats who paved the way for Mr. Bush to use the U.S. military to invade Iraq .
That includes New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , whom Chafee says put her presidential ambitions above standing up to Mr. Bush and the rush to war in Iraq .
“ I find it surprising now , in 2008 , how many Democrats are running for president after shirking their constitutional duty to check and balance this president , ” writes Chafee .
“ Being wrong about sending Americans to kill and be killed , maim and be maimed , is not like making a punctuation mistake in a highway bill .
“ They argue that the president duped them into war , but getting duped does not exactly recommend their leadership .
Helping a rogue president start an unnecessary war should be a career - ending lapse of judgment . ”
Chafee was the only Republican senator to vote against prosecuting the war .
“ The top Democrats were at their weakest when trying to show how tough they were , ” writes Chafee .
“ They were afraid that Republicans would label them soft in the post - September 11 world , and when they acted in political self - interest , they helped the president send thousands of Americans and uncounted innocent Iraqis to their doom . ”
But Chafee really unloads on Bush :
He has nothing good to say about Mr. Bush , whom he did not vote for in 2004 .
He writes that he even flirted with running against Mr. Bush in the 2004 New Hampshire primary and had hoped that a leading Republican would challenge the president .
( In the 2004 general election , Chafee wrote in the name of Mr. Bush ’s father , President George H.W. Bush , whose foreign policies were in the internationalist vein favored by Chafee ’s northeastern wing of the GOP . )
Chafee makes the case that Mr. Bush fudged all of his campaign pledges of 2000 , especially the promises about running a bipartisan administration , running a “ humble ” foreign policy that would eschew nation - building military adventures abroad , and being a “ uniter not a divider . ”
As senatorial memoirs go , it sounds like interesting stuff .

A staggering 16,000 - plus Republicans in Cuyahoga County switched parties when they voted in last week 's primary .
That includes 931 in Rocky River , 1,027 in Westlake and 1,142 in Strongsville .
More than a third of the Republicans in Solon and Bay Village switched .
Pepper Pike had the most dramatic change : just under half of its Republicans became Democrats .
And some of those who changed - it 's difficult to say how many - could be in trouble with the law .
At least one member of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections wants to investigate some Republicans who may have crossed party lines only to influence which Democrat would face John McCain in November .
Anyone who crossed lines was supposed to sign a pledge card vowing allegiance to their new party .
In Cuyahoga County , dozens and dozens of Republicans scribbled addendums onto their pledges as new Democrats .
" For one day only . "
" I do n't believe in abortion . "
A Plain Dealer review of thousands of records showed few of those who switched were challenged by poll workers .
Sandy McNair , a Democratic member of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections , said Friday that the manipulation of the system was troublesome .
" It 's something that concerns me , that I think needs to be looked at further , " McNair said .
" This is not a structural thing by the Republican Party .
If it 's a problem at all , it 's on an individual level . "
Lying on the pledge is a felony , punishable by six to 12 months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
Election watchers said they do n't know any cases that have been prosecuted in Ohio .
And it 's unlikely the Republican crossovers influenced the outcome since Clinton handily defeated Obama , said Edward Foley , an election - law professor at Ohio State University .
But he said Ohioans need to learn the rules governing their voting - and poll workers need to enforce them .
In a nutshell , here how it 's supposed to work :
Ohio voters are allowed to switch party affiliations on the day of a primary election but only if they sign a pledge vowing to support their new party - and mean it .
If a majority of poll workers at a precinct doubt a voter 's sincerity , they can challenge the voter even if the voter signed the pledge .
In the days following the election , The Plain Dealer interviewed more than two dozen voters - most of them Republicans who crossed over to Democrats last week .
None - including five who acknowledged lying about supporting the Democrats - were challenged .
And several said poll workers never asked them to sign a pledge , but gave them a Democratic ticket .
A movement is afoot ...
Some Republicans refer to it as " the plot . "
It started a few weeks ago when conservative radio powerhouse Rush Limbaugh suggested that his Republican following cross over during the primary to vote for Clinton .
Clinton , Limbaugh argued , would be easier for McCain to beat in November .
Soon , local morning radio show host Bob Frantz echoed Limbaugh on WTAM AM / 1100 , and the buzz began to grow .
Cuyahoga County Republican Chairman Rob Frost tried to tamp down the temptation .
He contacted Republican voters and appeared on the Frantz show urging Republicans " not to heed the siren call of Rush Limbaugh and others .
" Elections are not something you should be playing games with , " Frost said last week during a telephone interview .
Yet temptation was strong .
North Ridgeville Republican Hazel Sferry said she was kicking herself all day Tuesday after voting for McCain .
Do n't get her wrong .
Sferry supports McCain .
But after she voted , she ran into her niece who told her about " the plot . "
Her niece , Republican Sherry Newell , said she voted for Obama because she thought McCain had a better chance against him .
Regardless ,
Sferry said she thought it was a great idea to mess with the other party if it helped McCain win .
" I do n't mind being deceptive to politicians , " she said .
" They are deceptive to us . "
On both sides of the Cuyahoga
On the other side of Cleveland , temptation to cross over was strong , too .
Republican Kitty Anderson began working in voting precincts during the early 1960s and Tuesday 's turnout in the Republican stronghold of Chagrin Falls was the largest she had ever seen .
It was also the most crossover voting .
Anderson , 76 , and her husband Donald , 78 , both helped fellow Republicans change parties all day and when it was time for them to vote , they crossed over , too .
" We are both concerned about what Obama would do if he was president .
We do n't trust him , " Kitty Anderson said .
" I have five grandchildren , and I keep thinking I want this world to be safe for these kids .
I do n't feel good about Obama .
He just seems to be so vague . "
Come November , the Andersons said they will likely vote for McCain .
But not all of Chagrin Falls crossovers were motivated by the same things .
John Baggett , 50 , said there was no single thing that turned him against the Republicans .
Baggett , a former military man who describes himself as conservative , said he believed the GOP has led the country in the wrong direction .
" In presidential elections , you always seem to have to pick the lesser of two of three evils , " he said .
" And to me , the Republicans are either way too far to the right or they 're just saying things to please people .
So I 'm prepared to give the other party a chance . "
Baggett voted for Clinton .
In Cleveland and in some predominantly black suburbs , some black Republicans said they faced an unprecedented choice .
Donald Durrah , 65 , lives on Wade Park Avenue just two doors down from Democrat and U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones - one of Clinton 's most ardent supporters .
It 's has n't been easy being one of the few Republicans in the neighborhood , said Durrah .
But for decades , he believed the Republicans represented his interests , particularly since he was a small businessman .
In recent years , Durrah said that 's changed .
He has n't liked the Republican presidential choices .
Then this winter , Obama 's message caught his ear .
Obama talked about hope and the future , Durrah said , and " I wanted to participate in that change . "
Plain Dealer reporters James F. McCarty , Joe Wagner , Terry Oblander , Joe Guillen , April McClellan - Copeland , Henry Gomez and Amanda Garrett worked on this story , which was written by Garrett .
Niagara Falls is well known for the beauty it provides and for the massive amounts of water that go over it each year .
Not many people would ever brave going over the falls , especially not in a barrel !
Want to hear something ironic ?
Bobby Leach , from Cornwall , in the United Kingdom , did just that though .
He was actually the second person to ever go over the falls in a barrel , but the first man to do so .
The first person to attempt it was Annie Taylor in July 1911 .
After Leach went over the falls in the barrel , he had to spend around six months in the hospital in order to recover from the injuries he got while going over the falls .
The injuries included a fractured jaw and two broken knee caps .
Before Bobby Leach took on Niagara Falls , he was a performer with the Barnum and Bailey Circus , so he was used to being around and participating in numerous stunts .
Just before he took on the falls , he was the owner of a restaurant not too far away on Bridge Street where he was often heard boasting that if Annie could do something , that he could do it better .
Leach was able to achieve some success from his stunt going over the falls , though , unlike Annie was .
For many years after , he went on tour through the United States , England , and Canada , telling of his journey over the falls , showing the barrel he used , and posing for pictures
In 1920 , Leach went back to New York to Niagara Falls and operated a pool hall .
In 1926 , Leach went to New Zealand on a publicity tour and hurt himself when he slipped on an orange peel .
Soon after , his leg became infected .
It eventually became gangrene and his leg had to be amputated .
Two months later , Bobby Leach died from complications from the procedure .
Point of the story ?
It is often the small things that take you down .
A pro-gun advocate holds up a sign outside the Supreme Court in Washington , as the court heard arguments in an attempt to overturn the District of Columbia 's firearms ban .
The District of Columbia is asking the Supreme Court to preserve the capital 's ban on handguns in a major case over the meaning of the Second Amendment 's “ right to keep and bear arms .
Kevin R.C. Gutzman
J.D. , Ph.D .
Neither side has it right in the Second Amendment case currently before the Supreme Court .
District of Columbia v. Heller is an appeal from a federal appeals court ’s decision that the D.C. gun control laws violate the Second Amendment .
The circuit court ’s decision reflected what I believe is the emerging scholarly consensus around the position that the Second Amendment involves an individual right to keep and bear arms .
Gun control advocates on one side and gun rights advocates on the other dispute this question .
Since I am known as an originalist , I was asked to sign an amicus brief arguing that the Second Amendment bans laws like D.C.’s.
I refused to sign .
Does that mean that I do not believe that the Second Amendment reflected an individual right to keep and bear arms ?
No , it means that I do not believe that the District of Columbia is governed by the Second Amendment .
Why ?
Because the District of Columbia , insofar as it behaves as a state , is properly treated as a pseudo - state by the Supreme Court .
The original understanding of the Bill of Rights , including the Second Amendment , was reflected in the Bill ’s preamble .
That preamble says that the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution " in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its [ that is , the federal government ’s ] powers . "
It was not about empowering federal judges to strike down state laws , in other words , but about limiting federal power .
The Supreme Court reflected this understanding in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) .
There , for a unanimous Court , Chief Justice John Marshall said that the Bill of Rights limited only the powers of the federal government , not those of the states .
This was the only significant decision in which Marshall came out for a limitation on federal power ; he did so because what he was saying was indisputable .
One might counter by saying that the District of Columbia is part of the federal government .
Yet , Congress long ago delegated home rule functions to D.C. , and it allows residents to elect mayors , city councilors , and a delegate to Congress .
When it comes to the Second Amendment , then , D.C. is a state , and the Second Amendment does not restrict its policy - making discretion .
This is not to say that gun control laws are a good idea .
It also does not mean that D.C. residents do not have a right to keep and bear arms .
What it means is that if they want that right to be respected , people in D.C. should take that up with their own government , not end - run the republican process by trying to get the Court to overturn its valid laws .
If the conservative majority on the Supreme Court rules in favor of Mr. Heller and against the D.C. gun laws , it will be ruling against the original understanding of the Second Amendment .

German scientists said on Thursday that work on mice showed that tattooing was a more effective way to deliver a new generation of experimental DNA vaccines than standard injections into muscle .
Using fragments of DNA to stimulate an immune response is seen as a promising way of making better vaccines for everything from flu to cancer .
Until now , however , the concept has been hampered by its low efficiency .
“ Delivery of DNA via tattooing could be a way for a more widespread commercial application of DNA vaccines , ” said Martin Mueller of the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg .
There are currently no approved DNA vaccines on the market but several drug companies are conducting clinical trials and investing in the technology .
Pfizer Inc , the world ’s biggest drugmaker , placed a sizeable bet on DNA vaccines in October 2006 when it bought British pioneer PowderMed .
Mueller and his colleagues tested tattooing by vaccinating mice with a protein fragment of human papillomavirus , or HPV , a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer .
No ink was used , so the tattoo left no permanent mark .
They found three doses of DNA vaccine given by tattooing produced at least 16 times higher antibody levels than three intramuscular injections .
The far stronger response reflects the fact that giving a tattoo with a vibrating needle causes a wound and inflammation .
As a result , the tattoo -- measuring around 1 centimeter square -- is more painful but more efficient than a normal injection .
“ This is probably what makes it work better than normal injections because the tissue is damaged and this affects the immune cells , which then look out for antigens , ” Mueller said in a telephone interview .
His team ’s research was published in the online open access journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy .
Tattoo vaccines are unlikely to be for everyone .
But they could be valuable for delivering certain therapeutic vaccines to fight cancer or other serious conditions , where some pain is acceptable , Mueller said .
Therapeutic , as opposed to prophylactic , vaccines are being developed to treat disease , rather than just prevent it .
Mueller said tattooing could also have a role to play in routine vaccination of cattle .
Nancy Pelosi is Sponsoring a bill That will Benefit Her Husband
Nancy Pelosi is sponsoring a bill that would allow HIV - positive patients who do not have AIDS to qualify for Medicaid .
This bill has support on both sides of the aisle and it sounds fair enough , does n’t it ?
At least it does if you think the government should be in the health - care business , but that will be a discussion for another day after November ’s election when we have national health - care again in the spotlight .
Anyway , it sounds fair , but there is a small problem with Nancy Pelosi sponsoring this bill .
Her husband owns $ 250,000 worth of stocks in a company that stands to benefit from this legislation .
That is not the only problem however .
Her campaign was given $ 20,000 by Amgen in July , one week later Pelosi introduced a bill that had been previously been stopped , the bill I mentioned above .
This bill would benefit Amgen as they make the AIDS drug that would now be covered under Medicaid , this would also benefit Pelosi ’s husband as this is the company he owns all these stocks in .
An ethical issue pops up as a result of her investment in Johnson & Johnson , ” Fitton told Cybercast News Service .
“ Obviously she should explain whether or not her contributions from Amgen and its executives are influencing her position on the HIV bill in an inappropriate way . ”
Being a Democrat has it ’s privileges though and so she will never be held accountable for this .
But this is n’t the only money she has received from Amgen .
In addition to the 28 separate contributions Pelosi received last July from Amgen , seven other contributions were made by executives in the months of July and August , for a total of $ 30,050 to Pelosi ’s re-election campaign .
Also , AmgenPAC ( political action committee ) gave Pelosi ’s campaign a total of $ 10,000 last year .
She needs to answer these questions .
This is one of the issues that the Democrats ran on in 2006 , the culture of corruption , and it is now possible that Nancy Pelosi has been caught up in it .
“ It ’s not three or four steps removed , ” Fitton said .
“ The drug presumably would be covered under the bill .
So will any Democrat or Republican ask for an investigation of this , whether she violated the rules ?
On the face of it , she seems to be bringing discredit on the House as a result of this apparent conflict of interest . ”
It will be interesting to see if anything becomes of this but I think we all no where this is headed .
Nowhere .

ZeaChem HQ ( TGW ) – ZeaChem technology has perfected a process that turns virtually any form of biomass into cheap ethanol .
The process would eliminated recent criticism of ethanol in that it ZeaChem ’s process would not necessarily need corn , soy , or any other food to create the fuel .
The procedure also produces about 40 % more ethanol and absorbs more carbon dioxide than competing processes .
The company hopes to have the fuel on the market by 2010 at about $ 0.80 per gallon , which translates to about $ 1.50 at the pump .
See the sciency stuff here .
The company has yet to prove the technology works on a larger scale .

Will you buy a diesel ?
Really ?
Are you actually ready to get out your checkbook ?
The new “ clean ” diesels are almost here .
On the eve of the first press day of the New York auto show , Mercedes - Benz is holding an event ( featuring Sheryl Crow ) in connection with the arrival of its latest Bluetec diesels , models that are engineered to meet emissions standards for all 50 states ( but at last check , had not been given final approval by the Air Resources Board in California ) .
Audi and Volkswagen are soon to follow ; BMW , Honda , Nissan and others are likely to be close behind .
But are Americans ready to buy them ?
After driving a diesel - equipped Chrysler in Europe recently , in which I got 50 percent better mileage than I did with its gasoline - burning counterpart in the U.S. , I was nearly enthusiastic enough about them to buy one .
Then I did some research .
Turns out even clean diesels have their dark sides .
Certainly , this coming generation of clean diesels is a significant , highly anticipated technological advance .
But a clean diesel will be a costly option – adding up to $ 2,000 to your new car ’s window sticker .
And clean diesels still are just not as clean , from a smog - producing standpoint , as the best gasoline engines .
Csaba Csere , editor of Car and Driver , has been following the progress of clean diesels .
He told me , “ They are about as clean as a 50 - state - legal gasoline engine . ”
But they are not capable of getting down to , say , ultra - clean SULEV emissions levels ( a certification standard under California ’s emissions regulations , which are the toughest to meet ) .
“ They are , however about 20 percent cleaner when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions . ”
Diesels will generally deliver more torque .
And they will get 25 - 50 percent better mileage .
“ Figure 30 percent as a good midrange measurement , ” Mr. Csere said .
Diesel fuel is n’t as widely available as gasoline , of course , so you will have to plan your fill - ups more carefully around diesel availability .
Will truck stops be an agreeable venue for you ?
But more important , diesel fuel costs more in the United States .
In fact , out here in California , diesel just zoomed past $ 4 a gallon .
Even $ 4 a gallon is a bargain , relative to its price in Europe , where a gallon of diesel can cost $ 7 .
Gasoline is even more expensive there — up to $ 8 a gallon in Italy .
It may take quite a bit of driving — years ’ worth , if ever — for the added fuel economy of a diesel to recoup the extra initial cost of the diesel engine .
“ The cost advantage of a diesel is half what it once was ” , Mr. Csere noted , compared with 25 years ago when Mercedes - Benz once sold 70 percent of its cars in the U.S. with diesel engines .
Back then , diesel fuel was cheaper than gasoline .
“ And as diesel prices continue to rise , that advantage shrinks even further . ”
Talk about a diminishing rate of return .
My enthusiasm has been damped , to say the least .
I still admire the technology , and think it is an important milestone on the road to more environmentally responsible vehicles .
But is clean diesel - technology a panacea for America ’s dependence on foreign oil that some people , especially the German automakers , seem to think it is ?
Is a clean diesel - powered car still on your shopping list ?
It ’s probably worth a little due diligence before taking the plunge .

Coffee is known to act on the brain
French researchers compared women aged 65 and older who drank more than three cups of coffee per day with those who drank one cup or less per day .
Those who drank more caffeine showed less decline in memory tests over a four year period .
The study , published in the journal Neurology , raises the possibility that caffeine may even protect against the development of dementia .
It might be that caffeine could slow the dementia process
Dr Karen Ritchie
French National Institute for Health and Medical Research
The results held up even after factors such as education , high blood pressure and disease were taken into account .
Caffeine is a known psychostimulant , but this study appears to suggest its effects may be more profound .
However , lead researcher Dr Karen Ritchie of the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research warned against jumping to premature conclusions .
She said : " While we have some ideas as to how this works biologically , we need to have a better understanding of how caffeine affects the brain before we can start promoting caffeine intake as a way to reduce cognitive decline .
" But the results are interesting - caffeine use is already widespread and it has fewer side effects than other treatments for cognitive decline , and it requires a relatively small amount for a beneficial effect . "
The study , which involved 7,000 women , did not find that caffeine consumers had lower rates of dementia .
Women ' more sensitive '
Dr Ritchie said : " We really need a longer study to look at whether caffeine prevents dementia ; it might be that caffeine could slow the dementia process rather than preventing it . "
She said it was not clear why the protective effect did not seem to apply to men .
" Women may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine .
Their bodies may react differently to the stimulant , or they may metabolize caffeine differently . "
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said that with no cure for Alzheimer 's disease yet available , research into possible protective factors was important , particularly as the disease is expected to become more common .
She said : " This study does not suggest that caffeine actually lowers rates of dementia in women , but since memory seems improved , it may be that it is slowing it down .
" However , research over a much longer period is still needed to establish fully what the affects of caffeine are in both men and women and whether it could reduce a person 's risk of dementia or slow down its progress . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said drinking coffee and tea had both been tipped as possible ways of delaying the onset of dementia .
However , she said : " These types of studies are complex because coffee and tea drinking can be linked to so many other social and life style factors . "
DECEMBER 3--A U.S. Senate aide was arrested Friday after allegedly arranging a lunchtime sexual encounter with a teenage boy , according to federal court records .
James McHaney , 28 , was nabbed by FBI agents after he arranged the afternoon liaison via a " cooperating witness " working with investigators .
According to a felony complaint and an accompanying statement of facts filed in U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. , the CW and McHaney were conversing online Friday afternoon when the CW asked whether McHaney was interested in engaging in anal sex with a 13 - year - old boy .
" I 'll be there , " McHaney allegedly replied .
He later asked for a photo of the child with whom he and the CW would have sex and whether the boy had " any pubes . "
When told no , McHaney allegedly replied , " That 's hot . "
McHaney was nabbed in the lobby of an unnamed " predetermined location " where he had arranged to meet CW .
Until his arrest Friday , McHaney had worked as the D.C. scheduler for Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell .
A caller to Cantwell 's office was told late today that , as of last Friday , McHaney no longer worked for the Washington State politician .

Tor art director Irene Gallo , prompted by a blog post by Pyr publisher Lou Anders , talks a bit about cover art and what “ works ” and why when it comes to sf / f fantasy books , and notes a point that many people who gripe about covers miss :
… as much as I ’d like it to be otherwise , I am not really hired for my personal preferences on cover art , but rather to get books past book buyers .
If the books do n’t make it into the stores in the first place , readers ca n’t buy them in the second place .
Which is to say that cover art is explicitly commercial art ; it ’s designed first to convince shopkeepers that this book will move , and second to convince readers in a glance what the book is about and that it ’s worth their time .
In a book series there ’s a third dimension as well , which is maintaining a consistency in feel across a series .
There ’s a reason that the cover to Zoe ’s Tale is by John Harris and features spaceships :
Because every other cover in the OMW series is by John Harris and features spaceships .
If there ’s a fifth book in the OMW universe , it very likely to have a John Harris cover , and feature , yes , spaceships .
The cover to Jay Lake ’s Escapement is by Stephan Martiniere and features an airship because the cover to the first book in the series … well , you get the idea .
Would people buy Zoe ’s Tale or Escapement without a cover consistent to their series ?
I like to think they would , but you might lose that sort of single - reflex , automatically - familiar snatch - and - grab motion that this pattern of familiarity ( hopefully ) engenders .
Tor ( and the booksellers ) want you to be able to recognize on OMW - series book across a crowded bookstore and home in on it like a heat - seeking missile .
And for matter , you know , so do I .
So I ’m glad I like my OMW series covers , and hope nothing bad ever happens to John Harris , as long as I ’m writing in that universe .
What ’s interesting to me is how the cover dynamic changes , depending on the audience .
For example , here are two covers for two different editions of Old Man ’s War :
The first is the Tor trade paperback edition .
It ’s designed to speak to booksellers , as in “ Look !
John Harris spaceships !
John Harris covers are on lots of successful science fiction books !
Like Ender ’s Game !
You sell a lot of Ender ’s Game !
You ’ll sell a lot of this , too !
And look !
Sci
Fi says it ’s essential !
Essential books must sell !
And look !
Here ’s a quote comparing the author to Heinlein , who , while dead , still sells !
Lots !
Sell ! Sell ! Sell ! ”
Note that I am not mocking Tor for doing this .
We did , in fact , sell tons of the trade paperback of OMW , and the cover went a long way in selling to book to the booksellers .
This cover did its job , and is a pretty cool cover at that .
I ’m deeply appreciative to Tor ( and to John Harris , and Irene Gallo ) for the work .
The second cover is the Subterranean Press limited hardcover edition of OMW .
It ’s not aimed at booksellers , because most of Subterranean ’s business is direct to readers — and not just readers , but collectors , many if not most of whom have read the books they will now buy in this limited edition .
This is what this cover says to them : “ Hey , remember that time in Old Man ’s War where the human soldiers totally squished those inch high aliens with their boots ?
Yeah , that was cool . ”
It ’s still commercial art ; it ’s just commercial in another direction , and to another audience .
This cover did its job , too , and is also a cool cover .
So thanks here to Bill Schafer and artist Vincent Chong .
One of the interesting questions that writers and publishers will face in the presumed ascendency of electronic books , whenever it will happen , is whether “ cover art ” will survive the translation into an electronic medium .
My suspicion is that it will because of its function — it ’s advertising for the book .
Whether it ’s packaged with the text , or part of a Web page promoting the work or whatever , it ’ll still be around , as long as it does the job of getting people to take a look at the text inside .

Republican Pollster Frank Luntz is an interesting character .
He is the modern definition of a political hack , having made his money by treating politics as an advertising industry .
But he is at least an extremely smart hack .
If you want to understand how language can be used to win campaigns , Luntz is your man .
If you want to understand how body language and image can be manipulated to sway voters , Luntz is definitely your man .
In short , if you want to win in today 's political climate , hire Frank Luntz .

It 's an interesting segment , and fascinating to see how voters react to the language of politicians :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcmI6UnR4ggResidents of a southern Israeli town want a real - life laser cannon to protect them against Palestinian rocket attacks .
And they 're suing the national government , for failing to provide the ray gun defense .
From 1996 to 2005 , the U.S. and Israeli governments worked together on the Tactical High Energy Laser project , considered by many to be the most successful energy weapon ever built .
During tests at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , the chemical - powered laser blasted 46 Katyusha rockets , artillery shells and mortars out of the sky .
( Check out the video , to the right . )
" All my career , I 've been interested in fielding lasers , " Jeff Sollee , a veteran Northrop Grumman laser scientist , told me a few years back .
" THEL was as close as they come . "
But generating the megawatts of laser power required for THEL – known in Israel as " Nautilus " – meant brewing up hundreds of gallons of toxic chemicals , like ethylene and nitrogen trifluoride .
The weapons grew bulky ; one proposed small - scale version was supposed to be kept in a mere eight cargo containers , each 40 feet long .
A mobile THEL , on just a couple of trucks , proved to be too complex , and too expensive to contemplate .
Worse , after a few shots , the lasers would have to be resupplied with a fresh batch of reactants .
The logistics of hauling those toxins either through the air or across a battlefield made generals shiver .
Israel eventually dropped out of the program .
Then America did , too , turning its focus instead to solid - state , electric lasers .
Now , Northrop is pushing an upgraded THEL , under the name SkyGuard , which it says can fit into just three cargo containers .
Newspapers have been howling for the government to put the laser defenses in place ; the volume has only gone up since Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks against northern Israel in 2006 , and since Hamas started firing longer - range rockets at southern Israel earlier this year .
But the Israeli military has said that the sci - fi-esque system is still not ready for a real - world deployment .
So a group of citizens of Sderot , which has been hit by Hamas ' rockets in recent weeks , is trying to force the government to set up the energy weapon defense – by taking prominent officials to court .
They 're suing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Ehud Barak , among others , for not adequately protecting the people of the Negev desert town .
" The failure to utilize the currently available and inexpensive ' Nautilus ' systems is gross negligence on the government and IDF 's part ... result[ing ] in the murder and injuring of dozens of residents of Sderot .
The IDF [ Israeli Defense Forces ] has completely breached its duty to protect the Negev 's civilians , " reads a press release from the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center , which filed the suit .
But Center director Nitsana Darshan - Leitner seems a little confused about some of the specifics of the laser system .
She claims it " shot down Katyushas , Kassams and bombs with 100 percent success . "
Not quite .
Yes , it did zap some 46 targets .
But , overall , “ its performance was not great , ” Penrose C. Albright , a former Pentagon official who helped initiate the project , told The New York Times .
“ Under certain conditions you can make it work .
But under salvo or cloudy conditions , you ’ve got problems . "
Darshan - Leitner also asserts that the old THEL is " just sitting there in New Mexico ...
There is a way to take it apart , bring it to Israel and rebuild it .
A company
[ you gotta figure it 's Northrop – ed. ] told me that it would take no longer than five or six months .
It would cost around 50 million dollars to rebuild it , but there would be unlimited protection . "
The laser is , in fact , in storage in New Mexico .
But that $ 50 million figure is about a third of what Northrop has said previously it would take to build a laser system .
And , as Yiftah S. Shapir , a Tel Aviv University military analyst told The New York Times : " one guerrilla with a rocket launcher could fire 40 Katyushas in less than a minute , easily overwhelming most any defense . "
Darshan - Leitner is n't just suing Israelis , however :
" We filed suit on behalf of forty Sderot residents who lost loved ones in Kassam rocket attacks , " Darshan - Leitner said .
" They 're suing
Egypt for helping the terrorist organizations smuggle weapons , bombs , oil and people into the Gaza Strip and Israel .
Since Egypt is considered a co-participant , it is responsible for damages incurred during these attacks . "
" Egypt has a relationship with Israel and
America , " Darshan - Leitner said .
" I do n't think the Egyptian government will refuse to pay . "
ALSO :
Family friends recently returned from a trip to the Wynn Las Vegas , but the first story they had to tell was n’t about luxurious accommodations , gambling , restaurants , or shows .
It was about the snacks on top of their minibar .
The motion - detector minibar was n’t new to me .
Those are bad enough :
You move any item in the minibar , and if you do n’t put it back within 60 seconds , you ’ve bought it .
So much for making room to store your own food or beverages in there .
But what the friends told us was about the outside of the minibar .
Snacks were placed on a tray .
Not inside anything , but out in the open .
( Heres a photo of the display . )
There ’s a warning that the food is on an electronic scale , and moving the item means you bought it .
This is just absurd .
What if you wanted to look at the nutritional information on the back ?
Or , as one Expedia review noted , what if you have kids who inquisitively pick stuff up ?
( Best not to take the kids to the Wynn ! )
And check your bill :
As one TripAdvisor reviewer learned , after getting hit with $ 100 of minibar fees , even though they did n’t consume anywhere near that much , you need to watch your charges , to make sure you did n’t accidentally budge anything .
The next time I will just buy some snacks from 7 - eleven , read some online casino reviews and play from home .
Much cheaper , better chances of winning , and I do n’t have to worry about accidentally being charged $ 10 for a bag of crips .
What ’s next , a tripwire that triggers a fee if you use the bathroom ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Financial firms face a “ new world order ” after a weekend fire sale of Bear Stearns and the Federal Reserve ’s first emergency weekend meeting since 1979 , research firm CreditSights said in a report on Monday .

More industry consolidation and acquisitions may follow after JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N on Sunday said it was buying Bear Stearns BSC.N for $ 236 million , or $ 2 a share , a deep discount from the $ 30 price on Friday and record share price of about $ 172 last year .
“ Last evening the Bear Stearns situation reached a crescendo , as JPMorgan agreed to acquire the wounded broker for a token amount of $ 2 per share , ” CreditSights said .
“ The reality check is that there are many challenged major banks , brokers , thrifts , finance / mortgage companies , and only a handful of bona fide strong U.S. banks . ”
CreditSights said it lowered its broker , bank and finance company recommendations to “ market weight ” due to the credit crisis and stresses in the market .
In the event of future consolidation , potential acquirers identified by CreditSights include JPMorganChase , Wells Fargo , US Bancorp , Goldman Sachs and Bank of America BAC.N , once it works through its recent agreement to acquire Countrywide Financial Corp , CFC.N the largest U.S. mortgage lender .
Possible foreign bank acquirers include HSBC , Barclays and Canadian firms , said CreditSights , which said the Bear Stearns deal should be good for bondholders .
“ The debt side whether at the parent level or on the broker / dealer levels seems to be in rather good shape with the capital structure to be assumed by JPMorgan at deal close , ” which is expected in about 90 days , CreditSights said .
Financial stocks are likely to trade lower but the overall market may begin to stabilize , according to Morgan Stanley ’s chief U.S. credit analyst .
“ I view the stabilization of Bear Stearns coupled with the liquidity action by the Fed as constructive for the proper functioning of the lending system , ” said Gregory Peters , chief U.S. credit analyst at Morgan Stanley .
“ Financial stocks will trade lower , but these are important steps in the path of trying to stabilize the credit markets . ”
Global stocks fell sharply on Monday , and U.S financial stocks tumbled in early trading , led by a 86 percent slump in Bear Stearns .
Lehman Brothers LEH.N shares sank more than 35 percent .
Financial share prices could fall further by as much as 50 percent , Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Meredith Whitney said .
“ As we believe we will begin to see goodwill write downs during the first half of this year , we believe investors will focus more on tangible book value and stocks will quickly revalue to far lower levels , ” Whitney wrote in a note to clients .
NEW ORLEANS — A new study hints that black holes might not be as good at keeping secrets as researchers have long thought .
A pair of physicists has reexamined the time it would take for information ( think : your iPhone 's memory ) to potentially escape from inside a black hole .
They find that the 1s and 0s of your address book could be recovered as quickly as 1,000 bits per second — far faster than previously expected .
" The black hole really behaves like an information mirror , " says physicist John Preskill of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
The finding , presented here at a meeting of the American Physical Society , marks the latest attempt to come to grips with the fate of information that has crossed the black hole event horizon , a boundary beyond which even light cannot escape .
There is no doubt , of course , that the ultradense singularity at the heart of a black hole would vaporize an iPhone .
The question is whether there is any imaginable way to piece together its original state .
Physicist Stephen Hawking first broached the subject in the 1970s .
He postulated that black holes would gradually evaporate by radiating particles ( now called Hawking radiation ) that had bubbled up from the vacuum around the event horizon .
The radiation would be so scrambled , he argued , that when the black hole disappeared after many trillions of years , all the information about its contents would be lost .
Other researchers insisted that the data might be imprinted on Hawking 's particles , and even Hawking has changed his mind .
As in previous work , Preskill and physicist Patrick Hayden of McGill University in Montreal imagined two citizens of a hyperadvanced civilization , Alice and Bob .
Alice wants to destroy some bits ( technically , quantum bits that are 0 and 1 simultaneously ) by throwing them into a black hole .
Bob aims to recover them by gathering all the Hawking radiation from the black hole .
Prior research had shown that if Alice dropped her bits into a relatively young black hole , Bob would have to collect the Hawking radiation for half the life of the black hole before being able to decode a single one of Alice 's bits .
In the new study , Alice holds onto her bits until after the black hole has reached the halfway mark .
Before her data dump , Bob managed to prepare some bits of his own that he entangled with Alice 's , meaning they were linked instantaneously across any distance .
Preskill reports that Bob could reconstruct Alice 's bits by mixing the next few bits of Hawking radiation following the data dump with what he 'd already collected , along with his own bits .
" It might be a very difficult quantum computation to do the decoding , " he says , but Bob would need only about 10 percent more Hawking particles than the number of bits that Alice had thrown in .
A black hole the size of the sun would emit up to 1,000 Hawking particles per second , Hayden says .
The catch is that Alice 's dumped bits would have to rapidly mix with the rest of the black hole , spreading their entanglement to the outgoing Hawking radiation that Bob collects .
Current theories cannot predict the speed at which entanglement would spread across a black hole .
Still , researchers are impressed by the novel application of quantum information theory .
" I did n't think there was much else you could say about black holes without a quantum theory of gravity , " says researcher Fotini Markopoulou of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario .
The effect comes perilously close to contradicting known rules of physics .
After reconstructing Alice 's bits , Bob could throw his copy into the black hole , where the two copies might run into one another .
Such a meeting would violate the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics because it would allow measurements of both the position and momentum of the identical quantum state .
But the few - second delay between when Alice and Bob can dump their respective bits is just long enough , Preskill says , for her bits to be destroyed by the singularity .
Such a narrow escape appeals to Stanford University physicist Leonard Susskind , who explains that if Bob had to wait for half the lifetime of a black hole to extract his first bit , quantum mechanics would be safe by a curiously wide margin , in his view .
" I like the idea , " he says , " that the most dangerous experiment you can think of is right on the edge . "
The dog's name was changed from Puddles to Panchito ( photo courtesy of Alice Echo - News )
Neighbours had asked Alice Mayor Grace Saenz - Lopez to look after the dog , Puddles , during a holiday .
She called them to say it was dead .
But the dog , which Ms Saenz - Lopez had renamed Panchito , was later seen at a dog groomer 's and at her sister 's home .
A custody hearing on Monday is expected to decide who keeps the pet .
Ms Saenz - Lopez had filed a police report to say that Puddles was missing .
She was indicted on 18 January on two counts of tampering with evidence and concealing evidence .
In a resignation letter published by the Alice Echo - News Journal Ms Saenz - Lopez apologised for the incident .
" I can tell you that I did at the time what I thought was best for Panchito and what I felt was right in my heart , " she wrote .
" I am sorry for the division that the events of these last few weeks have caused .
" It was never my intent to bring any negative exposure to our city . "
A pioneering gene therapy trial has helped a blind man to see in a breakthrough that brings hope to millions affected by eye diseases .
British scientists have claimed a world first for the revolutionary treatment , which involved a single injection into the retina at the back of the eye .
Steven Howarth , 18 , from Bolton , who has a rare inherited eye disorder which has left him with extremely poor vision and completely unable to see in the dark , improved sufficiently after the treatment to be able to navigate a " maze " in conditions similar to street lighting at night .
Experts hailed the research , supported by £ 1 m from the Department of Health , as a major advance in the treatment of blindness and predicted it would lead to new developments in gene therapy for other conditions .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dawn Primarolo , the Public Health minister , said : " This is a major achievement for British science and the NHS and shows we truly are at the forefront of innovation . "
Mr Howarth is one of the first three patients to be treated with the experimental therapy by specialists at University College London ( UCL ) and Moorfields Eye Hospital .
The other two patients , aged 17 and 23 , suffered no ill effects but did not report any improvement .
The results are published today in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Results of a similar trial by a rival US group at the University of Pennsylvania , which began eight months after the British trial , are also reported in the journal today .
Three patients , one aged 19 and two aged 26 , were injected and are reported to have improved vision as measured by standard eye tests .
One showed an improved ability to navigate an obstacle course .
However , one of the American patients developed a hole in the retina , thought to be due to the surgery , though this did not affect their sight .
Robin Ali , professor of human molecular genetics at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology , who led the British study , said : " We are thrilled .
We started with the most difficult cases – with late - stage disease , using a low dose and in the worst affected eye – because we were being cautious .
As we move to younger patients with an increased dose we expect better results . "
The technique has already been shown to work in animals where results were better in those with less - advanced disease , he said .
It is now being tried in nine younger patients , aged eight to 16 , and the researchers hope for improved results .
" It is too early to say anything but we anticipate further success , " Professor Ali said .
Mr Howarth , a student and a guitarist , said he had been nervous and excited before the treatment .
He said his eye " felt like sandpaper " after , and took over a week to return to normal .
" Now , when it 's getting dark or it 's badly lit , my sight is definitely better .
It 's a small change – but it makes a big difference to me .
Before the operation , I used to rush home from college when it started to get dark because I was worried about getting around .
Now I can take my time and stay later if I need to , for band rehearsals and things like that . "
Mr Howarth and the two other patients were born with Leber 's congenital amaurosis , an inherited degenerative disorder which leads to progressive loss of sight caused by a fault in a single gene , RPE65 .
The operation , carried out by James Bainbridge , a consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital , involved injecting normal versions of the defective gene into the back of the eye , beneath the retina .
Extreme surgical precision was required to inject the solution containing the normal genes , gently lifting the retina and causing a temporary detachment .
One slip could have torn the retina and destroyed the patient 's remaining sight .
Professor
Ali said the treatment had not merely halted the degeneration but had improved vision .
" This is a very significant milestone .
This trial establishes proof of principle of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease and paves the way for development of gene therapy approaches in a broad range of eye disorders , " he said .
It is only the second time gene therapy has been proved successful in humans , after trials showed it was effective in the rare inherited disorder called SCID ( severe combined immune deficiency ) which leaves babies without a functioning immune system so they have to live in a bubble to protect them from infection .
This advance could open the way to treatment in other conditions , including blood and immune disorders , Professor Ali said .
Len Seymour , professor of gene therapies at Oxford University and president of the British Society for Gene Therapy , said : " Carefully designed studies such as this demonstrate the remarkable power of gene therapy to correct the basis of many diseases .
The encouragement this study will bring to patients and scientists alike should give increased confidence in applying similar approaches for treatment of a host of debilitating disorders , unleashing the prospect of major advances through genetic medicine . "

Storyline :
During the late 60s , a few friends from a small town went to Bombay , the large city in India , to attend a wedding .
One of these fellows did not have a good pair of shoes for the event , so he decided to buy them when he reached Bombay .
Before they had left their home town , people had advised them " Bombay is a good place for shopping , but you have to bargain aggressively . "
On the day before the wedding , they went shopping in famous Colaba district of the city .
Now there are different types of shops in Colaba : street merchants on the walkways at the sides of the road , some mid-range shops in the street mall , and high end shops inside the five star hotels .
Their first encounter was with the street merchants .
These street merchants ( who were seasoned in the game of bargaining ) would name one price ; the fellows would counter with 70 % less and then after some haggling the merchant would yield at around 50 % less .
Coincidently , each of those merchants , while taking your money and handing you a bag of goods , would say something like " Since you seem to be nice guys ( or hard bargainers ) I am doing this for you .
But please don' t mention it to others . "
Fresh from their initial thundering success in bargaining , these fellows went inside a fancy high - end shop that sold suits , shirts and shoes .
The guy who needed shoes found a pair , and offered half the price ( Rs 50 for a Rs 100 listed price ) to the salesman .
Declining his offer , the salesman informed him that the shop sold high - end and high - quality merchandise , and that it was a fixed price shop .
Thinking that this was another type of " high end " bargaining ploy , this fellow stayed persistent .
While all this commotion was going on , a gentleman in a nice suit , who was watching this whole show from a distance , came over and told the salesman that he would handle the customer .
Thinking that was a higher level of challenge in bargaining , the out of town fellow , now impatient , rudely told the new salesperson , " Your item is worth only Rs.50 .
This is my final offer . "
As he finished , he put money in the salesman 's hand , a technique that was effective with the street merchants .
Surprisingly , the new salesman agreed and sent the shoes for packing and a few minutes later , handed a very nice looking bag with a shoe box inside .
The next morning , two hours before the wedding ceremony , the fellow opened the shoe box .
He found that there was only one shoe inside .
Angry and also in desperate need , the fellow rushed back to Colaba , a half hour ride by taxi from where he was staying .
Upon arrival , he asked for the owner .
He was surprised to find out that the owner was the second salesman from the previous night .
He told the owner , " You guys made a mistake .
There was only one shoe in the box . "
Replied the owner , " I thought you wanted only one shoe since you handed me only Rs50 , half of the listed price . "
The fellow said , " What am I going to do with one shoe ? "
Said the owner , " We were wondering that , too .
But then we get all kinds of customers with special needs so we did not ask . "
Knowing that he was under the gun , containing his anger , the fellow offered to pay remaining Rs50 to acquire the other shoe .
The owner said sarcastically , " You know , strange things happen .
We had another fellow like you who came in last night and he also wanted only one shoe , so we sold it .
If you want , we have another nice pair that will match your suit , and it is only Rs.125 . "
Reflection :
If you are planning on doing business with someone again , do n't be too tough in the negotiations .
Sooner or later you get what you pay for .
Moments after take - off , the engine failed and the plane carrying eight people crashed .
In the 16 seconds it took for the plane to fall , Mr Cook turned to Miss Dear and told her to focus on his instructions .
He clipped his harness to hers and told her to brace herself using his body to cushion the fall .
Miss Dear , who is still recovering physically and emotionally from the accident , said she was thrilled that Mr Cook was being recognised .
" He was an amazing person and he was going to go on to do amazing things himself but now he can 't , " she said .
" I am 100 % certain he could have taken measures to save his own life but he did n't , he saved mine .
There are n't many people who would put their life on the line for a stranger . "
Mr Cook 's father , Mark , has emailed the Dears to say they would never know how much it meant to see his dead son honoured by the award .
The second posthumous Star of Courage has been awarded to Kerri - Anne O'Meley , who died from multiple stab wounds inflicted by her estranged husband .
She was able to save her 13 - year - old daughter from a similar fate and whisper to her 12 - year - old son that she loved him .
Miss O'Meley and her two children were staying with her parents , Donna and Sydney O'Meley , in Newcastle , NSW when her estranged husband slipped into the house through the garage .
He said he had come to talk but he had brought gloves and a knife with him .
Miss O'Meley 's parents heard their daughter cry out and ran into her room , where they too were stabbed in a frenzied attack — Sydney O'Meley fatally .
Donna O'Meley , who survived the attack and will accept the Star of Courage on behalf of her daughter , remembers the last time she saw her alive in the small hours of June 17 , 2005 .
She was covered in blood but had managed to throw herself between her 13 - year - old daughter and her knife - wielding husband .
" My daughter did n't stop fighting for a minute .
She was stopping him from stabbing her daughter . "
Miss O'Meley died with 19 stab wounds but her children were safe .
" It does n't take the pain away , " said Mrs O'Meley .
" But I do feel so proud and honoured that she should get such an award .
I saw how brave she was .
" The last time I saw my daughter , she was being stabbed protecting her own daughter … Kerri devoted her life to those children .
She lived and she died for them , simple as that . "
A survivor of the Sea King helicopter disaster almost three years ago will also receive the Star of Courage , for dragging another man from the burning wreckage .
Although severely injured by the impact and restricted by choking black smoke , Leading Seaman Shane Warburton , of the Canberra suburb of Theodore , dragged a gravely hurt fellow passenger clear of the burning cabin .
Villagers restrained him when he tried to return to the burning wreckage to help others .
Mr Warburton , who was discharged from the navy last year , was one of two survivors .
He said he did not consider himself a hero .
" I am honoured to receive this award , but what I wish is that all my mates and colleagues were alive with me today , " Mr Warburton said in a statement .
The Star of Courage is awarded by the Governor - General for " conspicuous courage in circumstances of great peril " .

President Bush says he knew his top national security advisers discussed and approved specific details about how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , according to an exclusive interview with ABC News Friday .
From ABC
News , everything you already knew , now thrown in your face .
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects — whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news .
… At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Dick Cheney , former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft
Stewart : Pundits should say ' we were wrong about everything ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday January 10 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Jon Stewart came down hard on the pundits on Wednesday 's Daily Show for their lapses in covering the New Hampshire primary , beginning with their predictions of an Obama landslide .
" I did n't watch New Hampshire ... because I do n't watch shows that I already know the ending to , " Stewart began , adding , " So , the pundits were slightly off .
Nobody can foresee everything . "
He then played a series of clips of one pundit after another attempting to explain why their predictions were wrong : " Women ... she took charge personally ... unions ... more traditional blue - collar Democrats ... older voters ... base Democrats ... spring - like weather in New Hampshire . "
" And nobody foresaw that there might be dragons , " commented Stewart .
He turned next to the rhetorical excesses of the tv commentators , contrasting them with the simplicity of John McCain 's victory speech , where he stated merely , " I 'm grateful and humble ... "
" Johnny Mack , need flourishes , baby , metaphors , " said Stewart .
" Watch the masters . "
Stewart offered as examples a series of strained metaphors offered by commentators for the campaign : " The fall of the house of Clinton ... like kids going into a Baskin - Robbins ... that game of 52 card pickup ... a restaurant with a really short menu ... can a souffle rise twice ? "
" Now that was magic , " Stewart said reverently , but he asked further , " May I get something in a pop culture metaphor ? "
" A Perfect Storm ... The Empire Strikes Back ... Friday the 13th ... she is looking into the Abyss and the abyss is looking back . "
" Does anybody have a struggle analogy that 's a little more epic ? "
Stewart prompted , leading to an elaborate comparison from Chris Matthews : " Hillary Clinton 's campaign was not ... positioned well .
You remember in the great movie Lawrence of Arabia , where the Turks aimed all their guns at the sea and the Arabs , the Arab revolt came in from the desert .
They crossed the Nefu . ...
This latter - day Lawrence , Barack Obama , cross the Nefu and come in behind the Clintons into their base ...
They 're going to lose Aqaba to the Arabs -- or to the enemy in this case ... "
A stunned - looking Stewart pulled himself together to declare , " And that is what happened here in New Hampshire !
I think .
But of course , I was wrong ten minutes ago .
... That guy 's insane . "
Stewart finally turned to veteran newsman Tom Brokaw saying at the end of the night , " We all ought to take a deep breath . "
" Finally a little touch of class , " said Stewart with relief .
" A little old - school newsman saying , ' Hey , let 's just take a breath , let 's just stop with all the speculation , we were completely wrong about pretty much everything that happened from Iowa all the way through New Hampshire . '
So moving forward to South Carolina , I think the media 's going to heed his advice . "
However , one final set of clips proved Stewart wrong in this hope : " Black women will probably determine the outcome in South Carolina ...
Romney probably now will lose Michigan ... I think it gives McCain real momentum ...
Huckabee can draw on strong pro-life support from a very large Dutch community . "
" I always knew Huckabee was in the pocket of big wooden shoe , " was Stewart 's final comment .

MIAMI --
On the night of his last game as an NBA head coach , Pat Riley heard the final buzzer , looked straight ahead and briskly walked away .
Deep down , he knew it was over .
" I did n't have to look back , " Riley said .
" I know that 's behind me . "
And now , after spending several days plotting the Miami Heat 's next course , Riley 's past becomes Erik Spoelstra 's future .
The Hall of Fame coach resigned Monday , although he 'll remain team president .
His first act as Miami 's former coach was to choose its new one , and hired Spoelstra , a 37 - year - old who started in the Heat video room in 1995 and now becomes the NBA 's youngest coach .
Riley sees himself in Spoelstra .
Riley was 36 when he first became a head coach , and did n't have any experience either .
His first off - the - court job in the NBA was traveling secretary for the Los Angeles Lakers , handling boarding passes .
Spoelstra also was at the bottom of the Heat totem pole when starting out , making videos for the team Christmas party , but Riley is convinced he 's ready for the top job .
" It 's very rare to have the opportunity to work for one organization for your entire career like I have , " said Spoelstra , who was told the job was his Friday .
" It means it 's a special organization . "

The creator of the web has said consumers need to be protected against systems which can track their activity on the internet .
Sir Tim Berners - Lee told BBC
News he would change his internet provider if it introduced such a system .
Plans by leading internet providers to use Phorm , a company which tracks web activity to create personalised adverts , have sparked controversy .
Sir Tim said he did not want his ISP to track which websites he visited .
“ I want to know if I look up a whole lot of books about some form of cancer that that ’s not going to get to my insurance company and I ’m going to find my insurance premium is going to go up by 5 % because they ’ve figured I ’m looking at those books , ” he said .
Sir Tim said his data and web history belonged to him .
He said : “ It ’s mine – you ca n’t have it .
If you want to use it for something , then you have to negotiate with me .
I have to agree , I have to understand what I ’m getting in return . ”
Phorm has said its system offers security benefits which will warn users about potential phishing sites – websites which attempt to con users into handing over personal data .

( Adds U.N. statement , paragraph 5 )
PRISTINA , Feb 19 ( Reuters ) - U.N. police pulled out from a Kosovo border post that was destroyed on Tuesday by Serbs who vowed never to submit to the authority of Kosovo 's Albanian government and its Western backers .
Reuters witnesses saw police destroy official documents and remove computers then leave in a convoy escorted by special riot police in armored cars , and the border post known as Gate 3 - 1 north of the town of Zubin Potok was abandoned .
It was one of two border posts between Kosovo and Serbia attacked and set on fire by Kosovo Serbs earlier in the day in the Serb - dominated northwest corner of Kosovo .
Kosovo has declared its independence from Serbia , a move recognized on Monday by the United States and major European Union powers but strongly opposed by Serbia and Russia .
Police manning both posts had called for help from the NATO peacekeeping force , KFOR , a 35 - nation force of 17,000 which has French , Belgian , U.S. and Danish troops in the border zone .
A statement by the U.N. mission in Kosovo made available in New York quoted U.N. special envoy Joachim Ruecker as saying the attacks were " completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated . "
Ruecker said he had asked U.N. police and KFOR to restore order at the border crossings .
The mission indicated that the police planned to return to the crossings , saying the two posts involved had been closed " for 24 hours . "
The attacks highlighted the challenge facing a European Union law - enforcement mission preparing to deploy in the Albanian - majority territory which has been under U.N. administration for nearly nine years .
Asked if the EU was prepared to call on NATO to enforce the authority of its mission in Kosovo 's Serb stronghold , EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana said the 2,000 - man mission was not deployed yet .
" Do n't ask for the mission to do something today that they are not in a position to do , " he told a news conference on a visit to Pristina .
" I would like to say that it will be deployed in the territory of Kosovo , in all of Kosovo . "
" KFOR is here and KFOR has used its responsibility , its obligations , already today . "
One Western official in Kosovo said it looked as if the province was close to effective partition .
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim
Thaci played down the attack on the border posts .
" Everything is under the control of the NATO authorities , Kosovo police and the United Nations , and no isolated incident will undermine Kosovo 's independence celebrations , " he said .
" Kosovo is integral , inseparable and Kosovo territory is guaranteed and recognized internationally . "

Probe of Florida earmark sought Unwanted $ 10 million road project put in bill Congress had OKd
The Senate voted Thursday to ask the Justice Department to investigate allegations of impropriety and possible criminal violations involving a $ 10 million Florida highway project slipped into a bill after Congress had approved it .
The earmark , inserted two years ago into a five - year , $ 286 billion highway funding bill , was for a " Coconut Road Interchange " project on Interstate 75 near Naples , Fla .
But state and local officials never requested money for the interchange .
" If we can not trust what we agree to in both bodies of Congress will be sent to the president , then everything we pass has to be suspect , " Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , said .
Rep . Don Young , R - Alaska , the former chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , put the earmark in the bill .
His staff acknowledged to the Washington Post that his aides had " corrected " the earmark just before it went to the White House , specifying that the money be spent on the interchange .
Young spokeswoman Meredith Kenny said in a statement that the congressman always intended the earmark to designate money for that project .
She added that Young believed the project was " entirely worthy . "
Young 's office said he took up the project at the request of community residents , but he also benefited from campaign donations raised by a developer who owns 4,000 acres near the proposed interchange .
The Naples News reported that developer Daniel Aronoff held a fundraiser for Young in 2005 , bringing in more than $ 40,000 for his campaign .
Young 's office said campaign contributions were n't the motive .
The Lee County Metropolitan Planning Organization has rejected the earmark three times in the past year because it requires the money be spent on that project instead of on highway improvements throughout the county .
The amendment referring the matter to the Justice Department was sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , and was one of two options considered by the Senate .
Coburn proposed using a joint House - Senate panel to investigate .
But Boxer and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said such a panel raised constitutional separation - of - powers issues because one house of Congress would be involved in investigating the other .
Boxer 's measure passed ; Coburn 's fell short .
The House , however , would have to agree to the measure for the Justice Department to launch a probe , and Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , said Thursday that she did n't see the need for that involvement .
" We have an ethics committee , " Pelosi said .
" I do n't see why that would be necessary . "
The " shocking and sensational " inner workings of an alleged homegrown terror cell were unveiled yesterday in a Brampton court – and included the plotting of an attack " much greater " in scale than the London 2005 bombings that killed 52 people .
In a document made public for the first time , the Crown painted a broad picture of the expected evidence in the trial of a youth who pleaded not guilty to belonging to a terrorist group .
The trial opened yesterday .
According to the allegations , the so - called Toronto 18 were attempting to secure a safe house to store weapons and practise military drills , and embarking on a mission to destroy the West – one they should be willing to die for .
Details of the alleged plot , which also included storming Parliament Hill and beheading politicians , emerged in a factum filed by the Crown that described the case against the accused as " shocking and sensational . "
The document contains transcripts of wiretaps and videotapes that include one conversation in which one of the accused speaks of the group 's ambitions .
" They 're probably expecting what happened in London or something , " he said . " ...
Some bombing in a subway kills 10 people and everybody gets deported .
We 're not doing that .
...
So our thing it 's , it 's much , much greater on a scale ... you do it once and you make sure they can never recover again . "
In arguing for a publication ban , the Crown said the evidence of these violent schemes and aspirations are so disturbing they could prejudice the future trials of the 14 adults who are also charged with belonging to this group .
The accused were among 18 adults and youths arrested in a massive police sweep in 2006 for allegedly belonging to an Al Qaeda inspired cell .
Charges against three youths have been stayed .
Of the adults , 10 remain in jail and four are out on bail .
In response to concerns raised by the Crown , as well as defence lawyers representing some of the adults , the judge banned the publication of any names and a small portion of the allegations .
Until yesterday , all evidence in these cases was covered by other publication bans .
The expected evidence remains to be either admitted or rejected during the youth 's trial .
While some of the allegations have already surfaced in public reports , a great deal in the factum had never been published .
Some of that expected evidence includes :
According to the Crown 's factum , the alleged terrorists first popped onto the radar of police in August 2005 , when two of the adults were stopped at the Canada - U.S. border in a rented vehicle while attempting to smuggle firearms and ammunition into the country .
Based on the rental agreement , weapons history and intercepted telephone conversations the duo had while in jail , police expanded their investigation .
They homed in on a few individuals and contacted Mubin Shaikh to act as a police agent .
Shaikh , a well - known member of the city 's Muslim community , was told to attend a banquet hall on Nov. 27 and make contact with two of the adults .
It was there that Shaikh met the youth now on trial .
Topics of discussions between Shaikh and the adults included the worldwide oppression of Muslims and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , accompanied by an adult making a " shooting gesture . "
While there , Shaikh hugged one of the men and felt what he believed to be a firearm .
Before leaving , an adult showed Shaikh a magazine with bullets , which he referred to as " hollow points , cop killers , " according to the Crown 's factum .
A few days later , Shaikh and an adult drove to a park , where he laid out his plans to attack various targets , including the Parliament buildings .
He said he needed to assemble a group and planned to organize an outdoor training camp .
Because Shaikh had military experience , he agreed to be an instructor at the so - called camp .
In late December , 13 men and youths drove to a rural wooded area about 150 kilometres north of the city , where they participated in military marches , obstacle course runs and firearms training .
Shaikh used a 9 - mm gun brought by an adult to teach the others basic gun safety .
The prosecution alleges the true nature of the camp was revealed by an adult in a series of lectures he delivered to the group – lectures that were videotaped and subsequently found by police when they executed a covert search warrant at the home of another adult in May 2006 .

In the video , the man is seated in the dark under what appears to be a tent .
He addresses the group passionately , explaining : " Our mission 's greater , whether we get arrested , whether we get killed .
...
Rome has to be defeated .
And we have to be the ones that do it . "
He goes on to say , " We already started striking cause you know what , this training is striking at them . "
On Feb .
4 , 2006 , Shaikh and an adult were joined by two others as they drove to Opasatika , a rural town near Timmins .
There they had hoped to set up a safe house where they could practise drills and store weapons , but decided against it , the Crown alleges .
On the way back to Toronto they discussed Operation Badr , a plot to storm Parliament Hill , take politicians hostage and demand the removal of Canadian troops from Afghanistan and the release of Muslim prisoners in federal institutions , police allege .
If their demands were n't met , they'd " kill everybody , " said an adult , who also reminded the others that the prime minister was n't " Paul Loser " or " Paul Martin " – as they suggested – but was in fact " the other guy , Harper . "
After their return , an adult reported he had built the " first radio frequency remote - control detonator , " but pointed out it only had a range of 30 feet ( nine metres ) , " which is not good . "
In response , another man pointed out " 30 feet away ?
So you have to get blown up ?
Might as well sit in the car . "
He explained that if they could get the detonator to work from 300 metres , " then we 'll do it . "
He then said that when the bomb went off on Front St. , innocent people would be killed , which would be " too bad for them , " according to the Crown 's factum .
On March 5 , two of the adults met with a man named Talib , hoping he would help them generate funds to purchase military assault rifles and other weapons , which one of them had already paid a down payment .
As they attempted to recruit Talib , one man expressed their desire to establish " the religion of Allah , " adding " we 're not just a bunch of young guys . "
The other spoke of the " global fight . "
Meanwhile , a second , more advanced training camp was in the works and took place at Rockwood May 20 - 22 , police allege .
A number of the accused attended , as well a man named Shal Syed , who later voluntarily met with investigators and offered a statement about an adult 's comments and the group 's activities .
Syed said an adult said the purpose of the camp was to " train " and to prepare for jihad .
Again , an adult led a discussion circle inside a tent discussing so - called military strategies .
One of the men asked Syed if he could teach others how to use firearms and grenades and whether he had access to such weapons .
He also promised to show Syed recorded lectures given by Osama bin Laden .
On June 2 , about 400 police officers conducted a series of arrests that garnered international headlines .
On that day 17 men and youths were arrested .
An 18th suspect was arrested two months later .

Luskin v Tree of Life : More Troubles in the Tree of Animal Life ?
March 22 , 2008 19:17 MST
Casey Luskin exposes some of his unfamiliarity with evolutionary theory when he claims that there are “ More Troubles in the Tree of Animal Life ” .
And how does Luskin reach this remarkable conclusion well because of our ignorance of science .
Casey Luskin wrote :
In late 2005 , three biologists published a study in Science which concluded , “ Despite the amount of data and breadth of taxa analyzed , relationships among most [ animal ] phyla remained unresolved . ”
Luskin references an article in Science Daily titled Tree Of Animal Life Has Branches Rearranged , By Evolutionary Biologists to further his claims .
So let ’s explore Luskin ’s misunderstandings and see what science does and does not know , lest one may get the impression that there is some fundamental flaw with the ‘ Tree of Life ’
Casey Luskin wrote :
In 2008 , the relationships among animals are still controversial .
A recent news release at Science Daily highlights a new study , “ Tree Of Animal Life Has Branches Rearranged . ”
The story reports , “ The study is the most comprehensive animal phylogenomic research project to date , involving 40 million base pairs of new DNA data taken from 29 animal species . ”
Luskin focuses on the ‘ surprising results ’ while somehow avoiding the other findings of the study
The study , which appears in Nature , settles some long - standing debates about the relationships between major groups of animals and offers up a few surprises .
Luskin seems concerned about Science rearranging the root of the tree based on new findings .
I have observed that it is quite common amongst creationists to see Science ’s ability and flexibility to deal with new data , as a weakness of science .
To a creationist , the Truth has already been established .
Casey Luskin wrote :
According to the article , the study yielded surprising results : “ Comb jellyfish – common and extremely fragile jellies with well - developed tissues – appear to have diverged from other animals even before the lowly sponge , which has no tissue to speak of .
This finding calls into question the very root of the animal tree of life , which traditionally placed sponges at the base . ”
However Dunn , one of the authors of the paper in question , which was published in Nature , points out that the study has found some fascinating verifications as well as new insights into the evolution of life .
Dunn and his team : * unambiguously confirmed certain animal relationships , including the existence of a group that includes invertebrates that shed their skin , such as arthropods and nematodes ; * convincingly resolved conflicting evidence surrounding other relationships , such as the close relationship of millipedes and centipedes to spiders rather than insects ; * established new animal relationships , such as the close ties between nemerteans , or ribbon worms , and brachiopods , or two - shelled invertebrates .
“ What is exciting is that this new information changes our basic understanding about the natural world – information found in basic biology books and natural history posters , ” Dunn said .
“ While the picture of the tree of life is far from complete after this study , it is clearer .
And these new results show that these new genomic approaches will be able to resolve at least some problems that have been previously intractable . ”
Source : Casey W. Dunn et al Broad phylogenomic sampling improves resolution of the animal tree of life , Nature ( Full Text
The paper ends with the following comment
The placement of ctenophores ( comb jellies ) as the sister group to all other sampled metazoans is strongly supported in all our analyses .
This result , which has not been postulated before , should be viewed as provisional until more data are considered from placozoans and additional sponges .
If corroborated by further analyses , it would have major implications for early animal evolution , indicating either that sponges have been greatly simplified or that the complex morphology of ctenophores has arisen independently from that of other metazoans .
Independent analyses of ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins ( Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 10 ) indicate that support for this hypothesis ( and for others presented for the first time here , such as Clade A and Clade B ) is much greater in the combined analyses than in partitioned analyses with fewer genes .
This may explain why these novel clades have not been recovered before , because support requires very broad gene sampling .
Compare this with Luskin ’s description
This is the common theme among systematists trying to produce a grand “ tree of life ” : Similarities between different types of organisms commonly pop up in places they should n’t .
Such unexpected similarities were found in this study , forcing one of the scientists to conclude “ either that comb jellies evolved their complexity independently from other animals , [ or ] sponges have become greatly simplified through the course of evolution . ”
Unexpected does not mean wrong , just that new data resolves some of the details .
First of all , the data needs to be confirmed but furthermore , it has opened up evolutionary theory to more exciting hypotheses that will further new research .
What has Intelligent Design to offer here ?
Luskin does not explain , other than a strange story about Atlantis and a conclusion that “ The other possibility is that there is no Atlantis to find and that people are mistaken in their various theories about how to find Atlantis . ”
Atlantis has never been found , the Tree of Life , while well resolved at some aspects , needs more work to figure out the details in the evolutionary history of the millions of species involved .
For those interested in reading more about the this see for instance 29 +
Evidences for Macroevolution by Douglas Theobald , Ph.D. ( a little dated )
As to why morphological and genetic trees can and do conflict , see for instance Molecular versus Morphological Data in Systematic Studies
Now let me be the first one to point out that much of the Tree of Life remains unknown , although some important aspects have been successfully resolved .
Does this mean that additional data is not going to add or overturn parts of the TOL ?
Of course not , what ID sees as a weakness of evolutionary theory and science is general is how science iterates between data , hypotheses , more data , some hypotheses rejected , more hypotheses and so on , towards an ever increasing understanding of how life evolved .
Plans of three to five years are more the norm for businesses the size of Zingerman ’s , he said .
“ The biggest criticism levied against this would be that we ’re not smart enough to project that far into the future , ” Mr. Anderson said .
“ But to criticize what they ’ve done would be foolish , because they ’ve been so successful . ”

The deli alone has earned Zingerman ’s an exalted status among food lovers , said Michael Ruhlman , the author of a number of books on the food business .
“ Places like Zingerman ’s are important for two reasons : they become arbiters of taste in America ’s booming artisanal food industry simply by what they choose to put in their stores ; and second , they are fundamental middlemen between the artisan producer and the consumer , ” Mr. Ruhlman said .
“ There ’s not a lot the consumer can do , really , to get Iberian ham , but Ari can . ”
Both Mr. Saginaw and Mr. Weinzweig thought Zingerman ’s could be more than just a corner store , however .
When they brainstormed back in the early 1990s , they thought Zingerman ’s could handle as many as 15 different businesses , generating $ 20 million a year in sales , with the deli at the heart of the enterprise .
They were off - base on several counts .
Zingerman ’s revenue swelled 50 percent greater than that , to an estimated $ 30 million this year , with eight separate operations , including a bakery , restaurant , coffee - roasting company and catering business , as well as a training business meant to share Zingerman ’s people - friendly management approach .
And though 2009 is still 19 months off , Mr. Saginaw and Mr. Weinzweig are brainstorming again on a vision for the year 2020 , which they have begun sharing with their fellow managers , employees and even , via a newsletter , customers .
By then , Mr. Saginaw wants to expand the operations on the corner of East Kingsley and Detroit Streets , home to the original deli , its outdoor seating and a coffeehouse called Zingerman ’s Next Door .
There could be as many as 18 businesses : the company is weighing ventures like a microbrewery , a small hotel , fish and meat - smoking business and a publishing house .

The concentric stone circles that make up Stonehenge , 80 miles southwest of London on the sweep of Salisbury Plain , consist of giant sandstone blocks or sarsens and smaller bluestones -- volcanic rock of a blueish tint with white flecks .
Stonehenge experts Tim Darvill and Geoff Wainwright will use modern carbon dating techniques and analysis of soil pollen and sea shells to work out when the stones were set up , in the first archaeological dig at the World Heritage site since 1964 .
“ If you want to find out why Stonehenge was built , you need to look 250 kilometers away to the Presili Hills in north Pembrokeshire , where the first bluestones that built Stonehenge come from , ” Wainwright told reporters as the two - week dig began .
The two archaeologists , who have worked extensively in the Presili Hills in recent years , believe the bluestones , which made up the first stone circles at Stonehenge , were thought to have magical curative powers .
The massive standing stones , set up as long as 5,000 years ago , dominate the even older religious site , marked by numerous burial mounds or barrows .
“ If you want to find out when the first stone was placed at Stonehenge , you need to dig a small trench round one of the stone ’s sockets and date what you find .
That is what we are doing , ” Wainwright said .
Theories of the role of Stonehenge range from the supernatural -- one says the legendary wizard Merlin built it -- to sacrifices linked to sun worship .
Wainwright , president of the Society of Antiquaries , and Darvill , archaeology professor at Bournemouth University , hope their findings will support their theory that Stonehenge was the ancient equivalent of a health spa .
“ This was a place of healing , for the soul and the body , ” said Darvill .
“ The Presili Hills is a magical place .
The stones from there are regarded as having healing properties . ”
Some 80 bluestones , weighing between one and four tonnes each , were transported by land and sea from South Wales to the Salisbury Plain site between 4,500 and 5,000 years ago .
Only about one - third of them remain on the site , the rest having been stolen or broken up over the millennia .
“ In the early 1900s there were signs in Amesbury ( the nearest town to the site ) offering the hire of a hammer so that people could come up here to chip off their own bit of bluestone , ” Darvill said .
They are distinct from the massive sandstone sarsens that make the monument instantly recognizable .
The excavation has even been blessed by Druids , spiritual descendants of the learned priests of pre-Christian Celtic Europe , who had links with the site in ancient times .
But there are some countries out there ( Russia , Norway and Greenland ) where the rules and regulations are not followed as closely .
Why are n’t there protests about the conditions surrounding those seal hunts ?
You ca n’t protest the Canadian seal hunt where it ’s relatively humane and not see a difference between Canada and those countries where in some cases , the seal is still alive when the fur is being torn off of his body .
Every year PETA and HSUB get up in arms about the Canadian seal hunt and manage to get millions in dollars in donations from a captive marked fueled by news reports and videos of baby seals being slain .
Do I agree with the killing baby seals ?
Absolutely not .
I think it 's a barbaric senseless act and I can truly say it 's the one thing about Canada that I 'm not proud to be part of .
Having said that , the seal hunt in Canada is closely regulated , from the time of year , to the numbers of seals , to the methods of execution and fur removal .
All aspects of the hunt have laws and most hunters follow them .
Being a Canadian , I 'm accustomed to reading and seeing various protests against the Canadian Seal Fur trade every year .
This year is no exception , throughout the blogosphere , print media and tv , images and video are shown of Canadian hunters thumping baby seals on the head and then proceeding to remove the pelt off of the animal .
My theory about the Canadian Seal Hunt is fairly simple .
People protest it and hate it largely because baby seals are so cute .
People do n't like to see cute animals die even if it ’s a humane death .
Which brings me to my point .
I think people , in general do n’t find cats cute .
I make this assessment based upon the fact that every day cats are tortured and killed for their fur too but in large , most people do n't know about the Cat Hunt .
And they do n’t seem to care that every year , more cats are hunted for their fur than seals .
Currently there are over two million dogs and cats each year that are killed mainly in countries like China , the Philippines , Thailand and Switzerland .
The Canadian Seal Hunt has a season and then its over .
But cats are hunted all year round and in most cases the deaths are not humane , by any definition .
And the torturing and suffering of the cat before the fur is ripped from its body is mind bobbling .
I truly believe if seals looked like cats , fewer people would care .
How do I know this ?
With the exception of a couple of limited protests by the PETA people , Cat Hunt crimes go mostly unnoticed .
Part of the problem is throughout history ; cats have been hunted for their fur .
It was documented in 1127 , AD in the Westminster Church Council records that nuns were permitted to wear cat fur because it was so common .
The saying , “ there are many ways to skin a cat ” originated in the Middle Ages and is still used today .
Here are some other interesting facts that you may or may not know about the cat fur trade :
- Cat fur is virtually indistinguishable from other furs once its cut and died .
This probably explains why many retailers in the United States , The Netherlands , France , Germany , Italy and Spain routinely sell toys , gloves and jackets that are made from cat fur but call it something else .
- Many countries ( including the United States ) do not require a label explaining the type of fur used if the item retails for less than $ 150 .
Products that sell for less than this set amount are a prime target for cat fur .
- Unlike the Canadian seal fur trade , the cat fur trade is not regulated at all .
If the cats are killed before skinning , they are killed inhumanely by electrocution ( electrodes in the mouth and anus ) , gassing , lethal injection and simple neck breaking .
But most cats are skinned alive .
- In China , there are no laws governing cruelty to cats .
It 's perfectly legal to remove cats from the street and take them to mass slaughter houses where they are hung and skinned alive , then thrown onto a pile of skinless live cats .
If they do n’t die by the time the skinning is over , they are incinerated alive , or butchered for their meat .
- Beijing has over a 100 restaurants that specialize in serving cat meat .
Many of the cats used in meals are formerly owned cats ( over 150 family cats go missing every month in Beijing ) or feral cats .
The Chinese government has intentions of hiding this from Western media during the Olympics by having these restaurants remove the cat meat dishes from their menus .
- It 's not uncommon for people to lose their domestic cats in Switzerland , as it's completely legal to shoot a cat as long as it's 200 yards from its home even if it belongs to your neighbor .
Even residents of neighboring France complain about the fact that many of their cats go missing due to legal Swiss cat hunting .
- Cat fur is exported to the United States from countries like Switzerland , France , Germany , Italy and Spain .
Would all of this happen if cats were as cute as seals ?
I do n’t think so .
So while it 's a shame that over 300 000 baby seals will be brutally murdered , let 's not forget about the over one million cats that will die a horrible death this year .
Again , I do n’t agree with the seal hunt , but the reality is that there is a market for fur .
Until that market disappears , the Canadian Seal hunt and the Underground Cat Hunt will go on .
This is the reality that you , me , and all the protestors out there can't change .
If you want to come down on someone , come down on the people wearing the fur .
The European Fur Trade , the ones fueling the Seal Hunt and the Cat Hunt as well as the hunting of other animals including , fox , dogs , snakes , and the list goes on .
Cats feel pain the same way you and I do .
And personally , I think cats are pretty cute too .

Woman gets tackled by a lion at a Photoshoot !
No one is exactly holding their breath over the outcome of Sunday 's elections to find a new president of Russia .
The winner will be the man widely known as Putin 's puppet , Dmitri Medvedev .
Mr Medvedev rose from the position of humble lawyer to become head of Russia 's largest company , Gazprom , and then Russia 's first deputy prime minister solely due to the patronage of his boss , the outgoing president , Vladimir Putin .
He has been the front - runner , with opinion poll ratings of 70 to 80 per cent , since Mr Putin endorsed him as his successor last year .
In Russia you do not need an election to know the name of the next president .
There is a temptation to smile at the Ruritanian nature of all this .
But there is nothing funny about the decision of Europe 's main election watchdog , the Organisation for Security and Co-operation , to pull out of monitoring the vote because of the restrictions imposed on it .
Those restrictions are of a piece with the shackling of opposition candidates , political dissidents , human rights activists and journalists who do not work for a national media under the thumb of the Kremlin .
Some will argue that the majority of the Russian people , even if they are denied a free and fair election , seem content with a continuation of a regime which has overseen the country 's strongest economic boom in a generation .
Yet this is unconvincing .
If Russian voters are so manifestly content for the existing regime to remain in power , why has Mr Putin gone to such lengths to prevent credible opposition candidates standing against him ?
The answer is insecurity .
And the bellicose posturing we have seen from the Russian government in recent years on the world stage is a symptom of the same emotion .

Russia is treated like a third - rate country even now , Messers Putin and Medvedev say .
Which is why Russian bombers intrude on Japanese airspace or buzz American aircraft carriers in echoes of the Cold War .
They are only echoes , however .
The armed forces of the reawakened Russian Bear have a fraction of the global reach and power of Soviet days .
And moves such as the closing down of British Council offices have something of bluster about them .
But the turning off of gas supplies and the use of trade boycotts against neighbouring states such as Georgia and Ukraine are real enough .
Europe , too , is sleepwalking into an ever - growing dependence on Russia for its energy in a way which restricts our ability to criticise the Kremlin .
This need not be the case .
Mr Medvedev knows that Russia requires a hefty dose of foreign investment and access to European markets if it is to address its social and economic problems : oil revenues squandered through corruption , crumbling industrial infrastructure , rising inflation , a widening gap between rich and poor and a population which cannot cope on average wages with rising living costs .
Europe has significant potential leverage here .
The economy of the European Union is 15 times larger than that of Russia .
Half of Russia 's trade is with the EU , which considerably outweighs the amount of gas Russia provides to the EU ( about a quarter of our needs ) .
Britain is the largest inward investor in Russia .
But until now , Moscow has successfully followed a policy of divide and rule , doing deals which appeal to the national interests of individual European countries .
Things will only change if Europe adopts a more united front in its dealings with Russia .
If that happens then issues such as democracy , human rights , respect for the rule of law at home and abroad , and greater respect for the sovereignty of neighbouring states , will become concerns that Russia 's new president , and the man pulling his strings , will be unable to ignore .
I 've heard from many people that the ideal game is the one that has everything .
It 's a game where players are constrained by nothing .
These people believe in a sandbox where their very imagination is the only boundary .
They believe in game with no limits .
On the surface , this game sounds great .
Who would n't want an infinite number of play mechanics ?
Who would n't enjoy the complete freedom of the ultimate kitchen sink game ?
But ironically , a title with too many avenues of influence becomes less of a game and more like life .
This game would be horrible .
Of course , this game is n't feasible .
The scope of its game world reaches well beyond what technology can accomplish .
But what if we collapsed this game world into one small room , keeping the infinite game mechanics ?
What if we could do anything we want in this tiny space ?
Would it be fun ?
No .
Because it 's not this theoretical game world 's sheer size that dulls it .
The huge set of game mechanics is the villain , and its downfall is that there 's just too much to do .
Games are always just systems waiting to be understood .
Fun is in the learning , and the payoff is in our influence over these systems .
But a player wields influence only through game mechanics .
Anyone would agree that by adding mechanics we inevitably complicate the player 's influence over their world .
But while game mechanics always add complexity to player input , they rarely alter game output .
A good example of mechanic complexity is the legendary Shenmue .
While its interaction - heavy gameplay was a novel concept at the time , the industry at large has since avoided such complication in games .
Players simply do n't enjoy a game about everything .
High mechanic counts dilute a title 's identity and possibility for engagement .
In these following paragraphs I will explore specific methods for distilling a game 's fun by reducing its mechanic set .
The Play Aesthetic
All works of literature , film , and music possess their own particular aesthetic .
This is the piece 's overall feel and character .
Not surprisingly , a work 's aesthetic reflects the sensibilities of its creators .
When judged by a sensitive audience , the aesthetic must always display a great sense of cohesion .
Great artists are careful not to include something that just does n't belong .
Games are no exception in possessing their own aesthetics .
Interactive media even have their own distinct form , the play aesthetic .
This is the overall feel and character of the gameplay , and it too must seem cohesive .
Where painters use their brushes to create a unified composition , designers use gameplay .
Where artists need to generate a harmonious color palette , game developers should engineer a set of congruous mechanics .
God of War conveys a strong play aesthetic , centered squarely on brutal violence .
The meat of this experience is fluid melee combat and how to master it .
The Blades of Chaos exist solely to support the feel of flowing , sinuous battle .
Most players would agree that God of War 's play aesthetic is unique and instantly identifiable .
Platforming is secondary to combo chains .
Environments contain a sense of dread and the storyline firmly rests on simple , violent revenge .
This overall cohesion does much to characterize it , but the unity of gameplay alone is enough to define God of War .
This is a worthy goal for every title .
Strong aesthetics are always simple and identifiable .
It 's no mistake that Picasso's Guernica and Sargent 's Madame X evoke a straightforward but powerful emotion in their audiences .
Great stories like Moby - Dick , Lolita and The Old Man and the Sea get their strength from foundations that are simple and robust .
Designers must engineer their play aesthetics in the same manner .
The overall look and feel should be something palpable .
If part of a game feels " tacked on , " the designers have violated this rule .
Masters of many art forms have long been practicing aesthetic techniques , but most game designers have not yet caught on .
The ways in which game mechanics interact manipulate the play aesthetic .
When players possess a more limited arsenal of influence , odds are greater that particular mechanics wo n't appear out of place .
Players must feel as though their possible actions form a cohesive whole .
They must think that they sufficiently understand the system of their game world .
Therefore we must make our systems strong enough to be understandable .
The inclusion of too many game mechanics is the surest way to dilute this strength and rob players of their valuable insight .
Summer of 2004 .
I have considered myself an atheist at least since the summer of 2004 .
For the sake of feeling smart and consistent , I believe I ’ve considered myself an atheist for much longer .
But I only have documented evidence of such a stance dating back to the summer of 2004 .
Did I have some great logical awakening that roused me to critical thinking and clear - headedness ?
No .
I know I did not .
I know I did n’t become a perfect bastion of scientific thinking because , in the summer of 2004 , I believed in handwriting analysis .
A knowledge - thirsty little 10th grader , I still believed then that if someone with a PhD wrote a book , that book had to contain gospel truth .
I did n’t know the difference between bad science and good science .
I did n’t even realize such a rift existed .
So handwriting analysis , with all of its certain language and its sheer lack of cited empirical evidence , seemed as valid as medicine or geology .
Only half a year or so later , as I struggled to tell a friend that the dominating middle region in her script belied a permanently childish outlook , did I begin to realize exactly how idiotic this whole graphology thing sounded .
Ouch .
It still stings to admit .
Should I also admit that I used to take multivitamins ?
That I preferred bottled water over tap ?
Evidence supports none of these beliefs .
I hope I ’ve made my point clearly : atheism did not protect me from having moronic faith in things not supported by evidence .
The empiricism I had used to destroy God did not extend automatically to all other silly things settled in my head .
I had to force out all of the cobwebs .
Recently , I ’ve taken a more active interest in the so - called Skeptical Community , though my personal skepticism began the day I looked for evidence supporting handwriting analysis .
I would recommend podcasts like the Skeptic ’s Guide to the Universe and blogs like Skepchick and Science - Based Medicine to anyone , even hardened atheist curmudgeons .
As I ’ve exemplified , even the curmudgeoniest of us can hold on to empty faith of the less godly sort .
Skepticism differs from atheism because it makes for a much more continuous process .
While an ideal atheist would forever continue to examine their beliefs and inspect their logic , most of us do place our lack of faith on a shelf and forget about it for extended periods of time .
It becomes static and neglected .
Skepticism , on the other hand , requires that we scrutinize scientific claims with the mettle that we once used to tackle claims of God .
Do these claims follow valid logical reasoning ?
Does the evidence support this claim ?
Does the research in favor of this claim follow proper procedure ?
Does the theoretical explanation make sense ?
And so on .
And so on .
The atheists and other assorted heathens on this blog no doubt already undergo this process rather often .
But despite our well - reasoned positions on God , I suspect we all have “ cobwebs ” , like mine regarding multivitamins and graphology .
Skepticism and the idea of a “ community ” of skeptics comes in handy for this particular situation .
Momentously unscientific claims usually get caught in our conscious attention , as in the case of ghosts or psychics .
We do n’t need help or a “ community ” to see the flaws in those fakes .
But the really dangerous claims sound plausible , or have a botched attempt at scientific explanation .
These ones slip under the radar .
Until looking into the Skeptical Community , I took many of these things for granted .
Take for instance this post on Skepchick about the efficacy of different lotions and other beauty products .
Yeah , I used to think expensive creams worked better , too .
For this reason , I make my claim that skepticism “ matters ” but atheism does n’t .
Atheism addresses a fleeting , supernatural belief , and does n’t have any application to real life .
In life and outlook , an atheist and a deist measure up about equally ; in the end , that last step of denying a “ God ” is intangible and largely irrelevant .
Skepticism , however , deals with actual practical questions - should I really drink eight glasses of water a day ?
Should I try that new cancer “ cure ” ?
Should I fail to immunize my child out of fear of Autism ?
The answers to these questions can directly change your habits , and even your life .
Denying the existence of a “ God ” , no matter how important it sounds or feels , has far fewer real life results .
I would more quickly trust the judgment of a skeptical theist than a true - believer atheist .
It ’s the skeptical approach , which often leads to atheism , that has value .
The atheism itself does not .
“ I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business , for Wall Street and the bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism .
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914 .
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in .
I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street .
I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 – 1912 .
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916 .
I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903 .
In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested . ”
“ During those years , I had as the boys in the back room would say , a swell racket .
Looking back on it , I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints .
The best that he could do was operate his racket in three districts .
I operated on three continents . ”
War Is A Racket
War Is A Racket
WAR is a racket .
It always has been .
It is possibly the oldest , easily the most profitable , surely the most vicious .
It is the only one international in scope .
It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives .
A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people .
Only a small " inside " group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few , at the expense of the very many .
Out of war a few people make huge fortunes .
How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle ?
How many of them dug a trench ?
How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat - infested dug - out ?
How many of them spent sleepless , frightened nights , ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets ?
How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy ?
How many of them were wounded or killed in battle ?
Out of war nations acquire additional territory , if they are victorious .
They just take it .
This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few – the selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war .
The general public shoulders the bill .
And what is this bill ?
This bill renders a horrible accounting .
Newly placed gravestones .
Mangled bodies .
Shattered minds .
Broken hearts and homes .
Economic instability .
Depression and all its attendant miseries .
Back - breaking taxation for generations and generations .
For a great many years , as a soldier , I had a suspicion that war was a racket ; not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it .
Now that I see the international war clouds gathering , as they are today , I must face it and speak out .
The Business Plot
inaugural speech
Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind 's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence , have admitted their failure , and have abdicated .
Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men .
True they have tried , but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition .
Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money .
Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership , they have resorted to exhortations , pleading tearfully for restored confidence ....
The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization .
We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths .
The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit .
The country was in tatters as a result of the Republican Great Depression and strong leadership was essential to beat back the wolves and imbue the common man with a long forsaken dignity .
An argument that I often hear from conservatives is that FDR was a dictator and while he was able to amass great power he unlike the current occupants of the White House used it to help normal Americans , reign in the oligarchs and bring about the end to the economic disaster through the implementing of the New Deal and the WPA as well as regulations that have since been overturned by the treasonous looters who have seized control of the system and whose continuing hatred for Roosevelt drive their every move as they seek to dismantle the social safety net .
Gasbag pundit Rush Limbaugh ( our modern day Father Couglin ) has said “ Roosevelt is dead , his programs live on but we are in the process of doing something about that as well ” and the neocons along with their fascist packed court system are going to be raping and pillaging the land on behalf of the greed mongers and blood barters for at least a generation barring any sort of intervention by a reinvigorated public or a bought and sold congress .
The business plotters attempted to recruit Butler to lead their march on Washington due to his great popularity with veterans for his speech to the Bonus Army during their 1932 protest .
The demonstration was broken up through the domestic use of military forces led by George S. Patton and Douglas MacArthur that was in clear violation of the Posse Comitatus
Act which should be especially relevant today with the rise of the Bush - Cheney neocon junta .
The renegade occupying force in Washington has established a domestic military force with Northcom and tasked it with defending The Homeland in the event of an ‘ emergency ’ of which the definitions are intentionally vague to facilitate the rogue government when it deems that a declaration of martial law is necessary in order to protect the illegitimate administration that currently has a stranglehold on state power .

The brain can sense the calories in food , independent of the taste mechanism , researchers have found in studies with mice .
Their finding that the brain ’s reward system is switched on by this “ sixth sense ” machinery could have implications for understanding the causes of obesity .
For example , the findings suggest why high - fructose corn syrup , widely used as a sweetener in foods , might contribute to obesity .
In their experiments , Ivan de Araujo and colleagues genetically altered mice to make them “ sweet - blind , ” lacking a key component of taste receptor cells that enabled them to detect the sweet taste .
The researchers next performed behavioral tests in which they compared normal and sweet - blind mice in their preference for sugar solutions and those containing the noncaloric sweetener sucralose .
In those tests , the sweet - blind mice showed a preference for calorie - containing sugar water that did not depend on their ability to taste , but on the calorie content .
In analyzing the brains of the sweet - blind mice , the researchers showed that the animals ’ reward circuitry was switched on by caloric intake , independent of the animals ’ ability to taste .
Those analyses showed that levels of the brain chemical dopamine , known to be central to activating the reward circuitry , increased with caloric intake .
Also , electrophysiological studies showed that neurons in the food - reward region , called the nucleus accumbens , were activated by caloric intake , independent of taste .
Significantly , the researchers found that a preference for sucrose over sucralose developed only after ten minutes of a one - hour feeding session and that neurons in the reward region also responded with the same delay .
“ In summary , we showed that dopamine - ventral striatum reward systems , previously associated with the detection and assignment of reward value to palatable compounds , respond to the caloric value of sucrose in the absence of taste receptor signaling , ” concluded the researchers .
“ Thus , these brain pathways do not exclusively encode the sensory - related hedonic impact of foods , but might also perform previously unidentified functions that include the detection of gastrointestinal and metabolic signals , ” they wrote .
The scientific questions raised by the discovery of the brain ’s calorie - sensing system “ are extremely important to understanding the pathogenesis and sociology of human obesity , ” wrote Zane Andrews and Tamas Horvath in a preview of the article in Neuron .
“ For example , high - fructose corn syrup is a ubiquitous sweetener in American society , and evidence suggests that fructose is not as effective as sucrose in terminating a meal .
It may be that fructose produces stronger activation of the reward system and that removing high - fructose corn syrup as a sweetener will curb some desire for these products .
Regardless , the present study alone will further galvanize the scientific community to understand how higher cognitive centers in the brain control food intake and body weight regulation , ” wrote Andrews and Horvath .

Facebook KHARTOUM , Sudan ( AP )  Britain 's foreign secretary summoned the Sudanese ambassador Thursday to explain why a British schoolteacher was sentenced to prison for allowing her Sudanese pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad .
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , was arrested Sunday after complaints to the Sudanese Education Ministry that she had insulted the Prophet Muhammad , the most revered figure in Islam , by applying his name to a toy animal .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband had said diplomats would do anything to avoid any of the possible sentences — including 40 lashes — that could have been imposed on Gibbons .
But her defense lawyer said Thursday the teacher had been sentenced to 15 days in prison and would be deported .
" We are extremely disappointed with the sentence , " a Foreign Office spokeswoman said , speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government policy .
The Sudanese ambassador , Omer Mohammed Ahmed Siddig , was called to the Foreign Office on Thursday night .
He stayed for just under an hour , and left without speaking to reporters waiting outside .
The Foreign Office also declined to comment on the visit .
Miliband had already met with Siddig before the verdict and stressed Britain 's respect for Islam , seeking to head off any call from religious hard - liners for Gibbons ' case to be used as an example of perceived anti-Muslim sentiment in the West .
He also released a conciliatory statement , noting the " close relations " Britain and Sudan had enjoyed , " based on our mutual respect for each others ' religious and cultural values . "
The Muslim Council of Britain , an umbrella group of British Muslim organizations , called the sentence " completely unjustified . " " ( Gibbons ) should never have been arrested in the first place , let alone convicted of any crime , " Muslim Council of Britain spokesman Inayat Bunglawala said .
" There was no crime , it was a wholly innocent and naive .
...
The worst you could say about her actions is that she was inadvertently naive .
She should not be put in prison for that . "
Zia Chaudhry , chairman of the Merseyside Council of Faiths and a lawyer in Liverpool , Gibbons ' north England home , said he was disappointed by the verdict .
" No Muslim I have come across is in favor of this type of action , " he said .
Britons interviewed in central London criticized the verdict .
" It is ridiculous , but if you go to the Sudan and know about the Danish cartoons , you 've got to be aware that it ( naming a teddy bear Muhammad ) could cause a problem , " said Henrietta Lewis , a 43 - year - old editor .
Another person expressed relief that the sentence was not as bad as it could have been .
" Well that 's not as bad as lashes , " said Kenlloyd Henry , 26 , who works for a consulting firm .

New research on mice shows the brain processes aggressive behavior as it does other rewards .
Mice sought violence , in fact , picking fights for no apparent reason other than the rewarding feeling .
The mouse brain is thought to be analogous to the human brain in this study , which could shed light on our fascination with brutal sports as well as our own penchant for the classic bar brawl .
In fact , the researcher say , humans seem to crave violence just like they do sex , food or drugs .
Love to fight
Scientists have known that mice and other animals are drawn to fights .
Until now , they did n't know how the brain was involved .
The new study , detailed online this week in the journal Psychopharmacology , reveals the same clusters of brain cells involved in other rewards are also behind the craving for violence .
" Aggression occurs among virtually all vertebrates and is necessary to get and keep important resources such as mates , territory and food , " said study team member Craig Kennedy , professor of special education and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee .
" We have found that the reward pathway in the brain becomes engaged in response to an aggressive event and that dopamine is involved . "
Mouse brawl
For the experiments , the researchers placed a pair of mice , one male and one female , in a cage .
Then , the female was removed and a so - called male intruder mouse entered the cage .
That triggered aggressive behavior in the resident male .
The tell - tale signs of aggression included tail rattle , an aggressive sideways stance , boxing and biting .
After the initial scuffle ended , the resident male mouse was trained to nose - poke a target to get the intruder to return .
Results showed the home mouse consistently poked the target and fought with the introduced mouse , indicating , the researchers say , that the aggressive encounter was seen as a reward .
" We learned from these experiments that an individual will intentionally seek out an aggressive encounter solely because they experience a rewarding sensation from it , " Kennedy said .
To figure out whether the brain 's reward pathway was involved , the scientists treated the home mice with a drug to block dopamine in certain parts of the brain known to be involved in rewards like food and drugs .
The treated mice were less likely to instigate the intruder 's entry .
“ This shows for the first time that aggression , on its own , is motivating , and that the well - known positive reinforcer dopamine plays a critical role , " Kennedy said .
Human violence
Kennedy explained that the experiments have implications for humans .
The reward pathway in the brains of humans and mice are very similar , he said .
" Aggression is highly conserved in vertebrates in general and particularly in mammals , " Kennedy told LiveScience .
" Almost all mammals are aggressive in some way or another . "
He added , " It serves a really useful evolutionary role probably , which is you defend territory ; you defend your mate ; if you 're a female , you defend your offspring . "
Even though it served a purpose for other animals , in modern human societies , Kennedy said , a propensity toward aggression is not beneficial and can be a problem .

Abid Husain , who could n't be saved despite CPR and an epinephrine shot from a doctor friend who was aboard , was one of hundreds of people who have died on planes in recent years - a dreadful and often traumatising experience for family members and fellow passengers who are forced to take a close - up look at frailty and death and share their journey in close quarters with a corpse .
" It 's one of the most overwhelmingly emotional situations possible , " said Heidi MacFarlane , a spokeswoman for MedAire , a company that has doctors available on the ground to advise flight crews in a medical emergency .
" When you 're the one sitting next to the remains , it can be shocking and upsetting . "
The macabre phenomenon has received renewed attention since a 44 - year - old woman died on a flight from Haiti to New York last week , drawing complaints from her family that the airline did not do enough to respond .
When a passenger is stricken aboard a plane , flight crews and travelers with medical training often pull out emergency medical supplies and rush to save the patient 's life in full view of other passengers .
If the person dies , the crew often throws a blanket over the corpse or puts it in a body bag , an item routinely kept on some planes .
The dead passenger is sometimes placed on the floor in a galley area , or kept buckled in his or her seat , since a corpse cannot be allowed to block certain emergency exits .
Pilots may consider making an emergency landing , but often they keep going .
Airlines are not required to track or report the medical incidents they handle , so an exact tally of in - flight deaths is hard to find .
But fatalities and serious illnesses on planes are rare when compared to the large number of people who fly .
MedAire is on call for about one - third of the world 's commercial flights and counted 89 deaths in 2006 .
That means that if a similar death rate occurs on the other flights , the number of annual deaths exceeds 260 .
MedAire says that each passenger boarding one of the flights monitored by the company in 2006 had at least a 1 - in - 7.6 million chance of dying on board in a medical incident .
People are far more likely to die in a plane crash .
In 2007 , 1 in 1.3 million travelers who boarded a commercial flight anywhere in the world died in an incident in which the plane was damaged , according to the International Air Transport Association .
In 2006 , the rate was 1 in 1.5 million .
The Federal Aviation Administration requires airlines to stock certain emergency medical supplies , such as defibrillators , syringes and epinephrine , and train flight attendants in CPR and some first aid .
FAA spokesman Les Dorr said he was unaware of any policies that specifically address what should be done if someone dies in flight .
The airlines make those decisions on their own .
When a passenger falls seriously ill , flight attendants often contact the pilot .
The crew typically makes an announcement to the passengers , asking whether there is a doctor or other medical professional aboard .
And in many cases , there is .
But if there is n't , the crew can usually reach specialists on the ground for advice on such things on what treatment to give and whether to make an emergency landing .
The procedures for how to handle plane deaths are less public .
Northwest Airlines and JetBlue declined to release their policies on how crew members decide where to place the body and what they are supposed to say to family members and other passengers .
Delta Air Lines did not return a call .
" When there is a death aboard a flight the general procedure is to move the deceased to an area of the cabin where they can be isolated to some extent and covered in as dignified a way as possible , " said Tim Smith , a spokesman for American Airlines , which is under scrutiny over the death last week of Carine Desir .
MedAire advises crews not to place the body in a lavatory .
In the past , that has made it difficult to remove the remains from the tiny space after rigor mortis has set in .
While the pilot has the option of diverting the plane after someone has died , often the flight continues on to its destination .
If the flight lands in another location , the family of the dead passenger often has to make arrangements to transport the body .
In Desir 's case , her body was covered with a blanket and placed on the floor in first class .
Other passengers were moved to seats farther away .
Friends and family of employees who were flying at a discounted rate were seated closest to the body , Smith said .
The plane continued on to New York , even though it could have put down in Miami .
Decades ago , in the early days of commercial flight , all stewardesses were nurses .
Now , the FAA mandates that flight attendants receive non-professional - level training in such methods as CPR , but they are not required to be able to use the syringes and intravenous drips in onboard medical kits .
Northwest said that doctors , nurses or paramedics are aboard an estimated 96 percent of its flights .
MedAire said medical professionals stepped forward to help in 48 percent of the more than 17,000 medical situations it was called on to help with last year .
In Desir 's case , a cousin who was with her claimed that she was initially refused access to oxygen tanks and that they were n't working .
American Airlines said that she was helped swiftly and that the equipment worked .
Nevertheless , the oxygen tanks that the FAA requires aboard planes are not designed primarily for such medical emergencies .
Instead , the tanks are meant to help people in case of sudden cabin decompression , according to the FAA .
Oxygen at a hospital may be more concentrated and can be given directly through a nose tube .
Desir 's husband and two children , ages 23 and 10 , have hired a law firm to investigate the death of the Brooklyn nurse .
" My wife died on the plane , " her husband , Mario Fontus , told said .
" And I want to know what happened on that plane . "

Weird ads for a product called “ Obay ” have been popping up all over Accordion City for the past week :
It ’s obvious that the product does n’t actually exist and that it ’s some sort of viral marketing campaign .
As for what the campaign is meant to promote , most people with whom I ’ve spoken to about the ads think that it ’s some kind of jab at parents who are following the disturbing trend of medicating their teenage kids out of normal teenage behaviour and into Stepford adolescence .
One person on the TorCamp mailing list wrote that a colleague doing consulting work for a nearby college says that it ’s an ad campaign for Ontario colleges .
I suppose we ’ll find out soon enough .

Wife 's beer earnings have afforded GOP presidential nominee a wealthy lifestyle Associated Press

On a spring day at a speedway in the South , John McCain posed with his wife , Cindy , and racing star Dale Earnhardt Jr. , highlighting the couple 's political and business interests in a single snapshot .
McCain served as honorary starter of the NASCAR race that weekend in Charlotte , N.C. Earnhardt drove the Budweiser car , painted military camouflage , rather than its trademark red , to honor the troops .
Budweiser , then NASCAR 's official beer , is brewed by Anheuser - Busch Cos. Inc. , whose products have made Cindy McCain and her family a fortune .
The brewer sold toy replicas of its race car to aid the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and publicized its support for the group , on whose board John McCain served and whose chairman later endorsed him .
The speedway appearance helped McCain court NASCAR voters , and his campaign circulated video of the event over the Internet .
The McCains ' marriage has mixed business and politics from the beginning , according to an expansive review by The Associated Press of thousands of pages of campaign , personal finance , real estate and property records nationwide .
The paperwork chronicles the McCains ' ascent from Arizona newlyweds to political power couple on the national stage .
As heiress to her father 's stake in Hensley & Co. of Phoenix , Cindy McCain is an executive whose worth may exceed $ 100 million .
Her beer earnings have afforded the GOP presidential nominee a wealthy lifestyle with a private jet and vacation homes at his disposal , and her connections helped him launch his political career  even if the millions remain in her name alone .
Yet the arm 's - length distance between McCain and his wife 's assets also has helped shield him from conflict - of - interest problems .
Nearly 30 years before John McCain became the Republican presidential nominee , he worked in public relations at his wife 's family company .
Within a few years of marrying Cindy Hensley , the daughter of a multimillionaire Anheuser - Busch distributor , John McCain won his first election .
He was new to Arizona politics and fundraising in the 1982 House race , and his campaign quickly fell into debt .
Personal money  tens of thousands of dollars in loans to his campaign from McCain bank accounts  helped him survive .
Anheuser - Busch 's political action committee was among McCain 's earliest donors .
Cindy McCain 's father , James Hensley , and other Hensley & Co. executives gave so much the Federal Election Commission ordered McCain to give some of it back .
McCain 's campaign used Hensley office equipment such as computers and copiers , and Cindy McCain personally paid some of the campaign 's bills .
The campaign gradually reimbursed Hensley for use of its equipment and Cindy McCain for her expenses .
The loans  described initially by John McCain as coming from him and his wife  caught the eye of the FEC , which repeatedly questioned him about them ; spouses are held to the same donation limits as everyone else .
McCain told the FEC the loaned money came from his share of joint accounts .
At the time , McCain reported drawing a $ 25,067 salary and $ 25,000 bonus working for Hensley in public relations and receiving a Navy pension of $ 11,038 a year ; his 1982 financial disclosure report showed bank interest but did n't say how much the bank accounts held .
McCain 's campaign debt grew to about $ 177,000 by the end of 1982 .
His 1984
House campaign repaid just under half the loans .
McCain forgave about $ 93,000 in loans , a sizable personal donation to his inaugural campaign .
McCain 's fundraising base is now far broader than his family bank accounts and Hensley .
Still , Hensley and Anheuser - Busch executives have been important and longtime supporters .
Long before McCain became a sought - after speaker on the national stage , he gave several speeches at Anheuser - Busch 's invitation in the 1980s and donated his fees to charity .
Hensley executives are among the Arizona senator 's top career givers .
The Anheuser - Busch PAC has given McCain 's campaigns at least $ 19,500 over the years .
McCain 's campaign fundraisers include Robert Delgado , Hensley 's president and chief executive officer ; Andrew McCain , the company 's chief financial officer and John McCain 's stepson from his first marriage , to Carol Shepp ; and August Busch III , chairman of Anheuser - Busch 's executive committee .
Anheuser - Busch in 2006 gave $ 25,000 to the International Republican Institute , a pro-democracy group chaired by McCain .
McCain 's campaign still taps Hensley assets :
His presidential campaign paid at least $ 227,000 last year to a limited liability company in which his wife and children are invested , King Aviation , for use of its private jet , according to campaign finance reports .
Although Cindy McCain 's business connections have benefited John McCain politically , they appear to have had little impact on his personal fortunes .
McCain is routinely ranked among the richest senators .
But a prenuptial agreement has kept most assets in his wife 's name .
That arrangement served as a defense for McCain when the Senate ethics committee scrutinized a real estate deal involving his wife , her father and disgraced savings and loan owner Charles Keating Jr. McCain said at the time the separation of assets helped prove the deal did n't benefit him .
McCain himself reports little more wealth than when he started in politics .
With his book royalties and radio- appearance fees donated to charity , McCain 's Senate salary of $ 169,300 and Navy pension of about $ 56,000 are his only significant sources of income .
He has accounts at two banks with his wife worth up to $ 15,000 each , according to his most recent financial disclosure report .
In contrast , Cindy McCain is a millionaire many times over  though the McCains have n't disclosed just how many times .
In government records , McCain is permitted to describe his wife 's salary at Hensley as simply " more than $ 1,000 " and , when listing her major assets , say only that they are worth " more than $ 1 million . "
The reports show Cindy McCain has at least $ 9 million in assets on her own and at least $ 15 million with the McCain children .
But those figures are virtually meaningless ; her stake in Hensley & Co. alone almost certainly exceeds them by tens of millions of dollars .
Beverage industry analysts estimate Hensley 's value at more than $ 250 million and its annual sales at $ 300 million or more .
Hensley describes itself as the third - largest Anheuser - Bush wholesaler in the United States .
It sold more than 23 million cases of beer last year and is among the nation 's biggest beer distributors regardless of brand .
Still , do n't expect Budweiser to be the beverage of choice at the White House if McCain is elected .
" Senator McCain very rarely , if ever , drinks alcohol , " campaign spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said .
Hensley is a prominent presence in Phoenix .
Its sports sponsorships include the Phoenix International Raceway , and its foundation gives tens of thousands of dollars to local causes each year .
McCain turns over most of his book and speaking proceeds to Hensley 's foundation , which distributes them to charities .
Hensley 's philanthropy includes supporting a flatbed - truck service that transports intoxicated drivers and their vehicles .
Cindy McCain is Hensley 's chairwoman and holds at least a 20 percent stake in it , according to Arizona corporate records .
She works mostly on strategic planning and corporate vision , said Hensley spokesman Douglas Yonko .
The company is family owned , but Hensley wo n't say whether Cindy McCain is a majority shareholder .
Within the industry , as heiress to her father , she is widely assumed to own a majority of the company .
If so , that would make her net worth at least $ 100 million , if industry estimates of Hensley 's value are accurate .
Hensley distributes only Anheuser - Busch products , which makes it and the St. Louis - based brewer heavily dependent on each other , said Joe Thompson , president of the Independent Beverage Group , a research and consulting firm .
" It is a very , very competitive business , and Phoenix is a very , very competitive market , " Thompson said .
Nationally , some Anheuser - Busch wholesalers are looking to end exclusive arrangements with the brewer , but Thompson does not believe Hensley is among them : " They 've been very loyal to Anheuser - Busch , and Anheuser - Busch has been very loyal to them . "
Hensley 's
Web site includes links to Anheuser - Busch promotions and to the National Beer Wholesalers Association , a powerful trade group .
Hensley 's spokesman , Yonko , is the lobby 's Arizona director , and Hensley executives gave enough to the group 's political action committee to make its company honor roll .
The PAC doles out millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican congressional candidates each election .
John McCain 's campaigns have received at least $ 26,000 from it over the years .
An informal poll on the trade group 's Web site asks visitors which presidential candidate they would most like to have a beer with ( Democrat Barack Obama was way ahead in late March with 45 percent , McCain was second , with 23 percent ) .
The association 's priorities include drunken - driving laws ; trucking and labor regulations ; estate , fuel and alcoholic - beverage taxes ; beer labeling and advertising rules ; recycling programs and campaign finance restrictions .
Many of those issues come under the purview of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , which McCain chaired from 1997 - 2001 and again from 2003 - 2005 .
McCain has long said he refrains from voting on beer industry - specific issues .
Following that policy , McCain voted " present " when the Senate voted in March 1998 to withhold state highway funding from states that failed to adopt a .08 blood - alcohol standard for drunken driving .
Two years later , McCain voted against the fiscal 2001 transportation appropriations bill , which set a national .08 standard .
The National Beer Wholesalers Association opposed the legislation and told its members it had at least succeeded in " delaying and diluting the final version . "
McCain voted against the bill because he objected to " pork - barrel spending , " Hazelbaker said .
On some high - profile issues , McCain disagrees with his wife 's industry .
Beer wholesalers and other businesses tried unsuccessfully to block a campaign finance law that McCain co-sponsored banning corporate contributions to the national Democratic and Republican parties .
On another top business issue , the estate tax , McCain has supported cuts but opposes permanent repeal .
Beer wholesalers contend a repeal would help save family businesses like Hensley .
Cindy McCain became chairwoman of Hensley in 2000 around the time of her father 's death .
She previously served as a vice president and director of the company .
" She is regarded as a serious businesswoman , " said Art Pearce , a Hensley competitor in Phoenix until he sold his family 's Coors beer distributorship in 2004 .
Pearce said he worked with Cindy McCain on tax and recycling issues in Arizona .
" We were major competitors , but she was open - minded and listened to issues , and I could n't have asked for anybody better to deal with , really . "
Pearce said she scaled back her involvement in state beer issues after John McCain was elected to Congress .
Still , Cindy McCain remained involved in Hensley as her husband began his presidential campaign .
A company photo last year shows her posing with a shovel at a groundbreaking ceremony for a distribution facility in Chandler , Ariz .
Hensley declined to say whether she will step down if she becomes first lady .
Cindy McCain 's assets go beyond the family beer company .
She and her children own a minority stake in the Arizona Diamondbacks .
The professional baseball team 's chief executive , Jeff Moorad , and former majority owner Jerry Colangelo are McCain fundraisers .
Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling , a former Diamondback player , appeared in a New Hampshire campaign advertisement for McCain .
Assets held by Cindy McCain alone or with her children also include Anheuser - Busch stock ; two condominiums along the California coast worth a total of at least $ 3 million and Arizona investments in rental medical offices and a parking lot , according to property records and John McCain 's latest financial disclosure reports .
John McCain has seven ch1ildren : two stepsons and a daughter from his first marriage , and two sons , a daughter and an adopted daughter from his second .
McCain 's financial disclosure reports do not identify the children who share assets with Cindy McCain .
Arizona is a community property state , so McCain may share possessions his wife did n't inherit , such as their primary home .
Cindy McCain , through a family trust , sold the family mansion in Phoenix for $ 3.2 million and bought a $ 4.6 million Phoenix condo in 2006 .
The couple may also jointly own a condo in Arlington , Va. , assessed at $ 847,800 .
McCain 's campaign and Hensley declined to say whether the couple has communal property .
John McCain held a barbecue recently for reporters at a two - story cabin near Sedona , Ariz. , that sits on 15 acres owned by his wife 's family trust and a real estate partnership in her name .
The property includes four single - family homes and is worth nearly $ 1.8 million .
It 's clear the rustic retreat is considered family property .
The cabin features artwork by the McCain children and editorial cartoons depicting McCain .
A doormat reads : " GEEZER ( formerly known as ` Stud Muffin ' ) Lives Here . "
The amenities include a soda fountain and , of course , a Budweiser beer tap .
This video is from The Associated Press , broadcast April 3 , 2008 .

So sayeth the NY Times / CBS poll .
And this is not going to help John McCain win an election ( nor help John Boehner keep his job ... who wants to be a Republican ?
The answer is no one ) .
Americans are more dissatisfied with the country ’s direction than at any time since the New York Times / CBS News poll began asking about the subject in the early 1990s , according to the latest poll ...
The dissatisfaction is especially striking because public opinion usually hits its low point only in the months and years after an economic downturn , not at the beginning of one .
Today , however , Americans report being deeply worried about the country even though many say their own personal finances are still in fairly good shape .
Ouch .
Maybe it 's because no one can stand George W. Bush , and everyone realizes he 's ruined the Republican brand .
The unhappiness presents clear risks for Republicans in this year ’s elections , given the continued unpopularity of President Bush .
Twenty - eight percent of respondents said they approved of the job he was doing , a number that has barely changed since last summer .
But Democrats , who have controlled the House and Senate since last year , also face the risk that unhappy voters will punish Congressional incumbents .
Oooh , I love that fair and balanced analysis .
By the way , it 's the exact same tripe ( Democrats will pay for Republican failures ) that the media was pushing just before the Democrats unexpectedly retook Congress in 2006 .
That 's hogwash , probably stuck in by an editor looking over his or her shoulder .
Republican self - identification is down , Democratic primary votes are up , people vote the economy , and
The poll found that Americans blame government officials for the crisis more than banks or home buyers and other borrowers .
Forty percent of respondents said regulators were mostly to blame , while 28 percent named lenders and 14 percent named borrowers .
In assessing possible responses to the mortgage crisis , Americans displayed a populist streak , favoring help for individuals but not for financial institutions .
A clear majority said they did not want the government to lend a hand to banks , even if the measures would help limit the depth of a recession .
John McMoreofsame , economics reformer in a change election ?
I think not .
A majority of nearly every demographic and political group — Democrats and Republicans , men and women , residents of cities and rural areas , college graduates and those who finished only high school — say the United States is headed in the wrong direction .
Seventy - eight percent of respondents said the country was worse off than five years ago ; just 4 percent said it was better off .
Blather on , cable TV , about the horse race .
Americans are paying attention to the shape our country is in , and they will not ignore which party was in the White House steering us there .
Exclusive BT secretly intercepted and profiled the web browsing of 18,000 of its broadband customers in 2006 using advertising technology provided by 121 Media , the alleged spyware company that changed its name to Phorm last year .
BT Retail ran the " stealth " pilot without customer consent between 23 September and 6 October 2006 .
The technology was approved , pending a further trial * .
Documents seen by The Register show that the companies used the secret profiles to target advertising at broadband customers when they visited certain popular websites .
Phorm had purchased commercial space on these websites , although their URLs are not included in the documents .
The groups targeted included people interested in finance ( for an Egg credit card campaign ) , weight loss ( a Weight Watchers campaign ) , and jobs ( a Monster.com campaign ) .
The technical report drawn up by BT in the wake of the 2006 trial states : " The validation was made within BT 's live broadband environment and involved a user base of approximately 18,000 customers , with a maximum of 10,000 online concurrently .
" The customers who participated in the trial were not made aware of this fact as one of the aims of the validation was not to affect their experience . "
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ( RIPA ) makes intercepting internet traffic without a warrant or consent an offence .
BT claims that when it launches , Phorm 's technology will be legal under RIPA , despite counter arguments from respected experts on the legislation .
The ISP's and Phorm 's claim is based on advice from the Home Office , which was recently published and disputed on the influential UK - Crypto mailing list .
The government advice was solicited by the ISPs and Phorm in the run up to the announcement of their partnership on 14 February .
Written by civil servant Simon Watkin , it argues that the system will probably be legal if consent is obtained from users .
Watkin wrote : " Targeted online advertising services should be provided with the explicit consent of ISPs ' users or by the acceptance of the ISP terms and conditions . "
BT has said it plans to change its terms and conditions accordingly to comply with the law .
On the legality of the proposed opt - out system using cookies , the BT technical report states : " Whilst the ... issue is not really a technical consideration of this report , it is mentioned since owing to the legal position , direct cookie dropping could not be trialed and should be verified once the legal position is clearer . "
That means all 18,000 test subjects were always opted - in without their knowledge .
BT has not answered The Register 's question , posed on Friday morning , over whether it believes intercepting and profiling the web traffic of 18,000 customers without telling them was a lawful act .
A statement it sent us merely confirmed it performed the experiments on customer data , and repeated the party line that no personally identifiable information is used by Phorm technology .
You can read the statement here .
BT also refused to reveal where in the national broadband network the thousands of guinea pigs were sourced from .
One senior source in the broadband industry we spoke to was appalled by BT 's actions .
" This is extremely serious , " he said .
" Data protection errors are generally viewed as a potentially bad thing by the industry , but not a real threat to an ISP 's reputation .
This seems like a breach of criminal law , which is much , much worse . "
Even during the early phase of the BT / Phorm deal that the technical report describes , the pair were preparing to spin the technology to the public .
" 121 Media [ Phorm ] will take action ( both technical and public relations ) to avoid any perception that their system is a virus , malware or spyware and to show that in effect it is a positive web development , " BT wrote in the report .

Supreme Court Justices to abolish Texas Death Penalty - they want an evening off
( ACPA - Houston , TX ) Texas is reeling at news that the death penalty is facing the possibility of being declared unconstitutional .
Supreme Court Justices , sick of missing Friday night poker and evenings at the symphony , plan to use an upcoming appeal as an excuse to abolish executions .
" I 'll miss the overtime , " said Justice Scalia , " but not the bleeding heart lawyers with their last gasp appeals . "
Shock and Dismay
As details of the plan leaked out , groans of shock and dismay were recorded across the lone star state as Texans started to come to terms with the news that their beloved death penalty might be taken away .
" This all started with the abolition of execution for the retarded , " said Dwight Johnson of Walker County , " that dang Yankee Supreme Court should stay out of our business . "
Death row guards concerned for their jobs have decided to take action .
Union spokesman Jim Austen stated that , " we are going to start a grassroots nationwide campaign to encourage other states to have more executions . "
Arguing that the death penalty is a time honored tradition , he was quick to point out that , " the death penalty is just like freedom of religion - use it or lose it . "
Over in Houston , the Mayor is particularly concerned that mass layoffs could follow in the prosecutor 's office and he has weighed in his support for the guards union .
" You love the yellow rose of Texas , now it 's time to love the Death Rows of Texas , " he said in an impassioned plea for support from other cities nationwide .
Meanwhile traffic came to a standstill in downtown Huntsville , home of the Texas death chamber , when several members of the strapdown team staged an impromptu strap -in .
Trade War looms
On the financial front , markets reacted to the news by dumping shares of chemical companies specializing in the manufacture of sodium thiopental .
Lean times are ahead unless these companies can break into the burgeoning but restricted Chinese death penalty market .
The US is expected to raise the issue in upcoming WTO talks .

Misplaced fears about terror , privacy and child protection are preventing amateur photographers from enjoying their hobby , say campaigners .
Phil Smith thought ex-EastEnder Letitia Dean turning on the Christmas lights in Ipswich would make a good snap for his collection .
The 49 - year - old started by firing off a few shots of the warm - up act on stage .
But before the main attraction showed up , Mr Smith was challenged by a police officer who asked if he had a licence for the camera .
After explaining he did n't need one , he was taken down a side - street for a formal " stop and search " , then asked to delete the photos and ordered not take any more .
So he slunk home with his camera .
To be pulled out of a crowd is very daunting and I was n't aware of my rights
Phil Smith " People were still taking photos with mobile phones and pocket cameras , so maybe it was because mine looked like a professional camera with a flash on top , " he says .
" I was n't very pleased because I was taken through the crowd and through the barriers at the front and people were probably thinking ' I wonder what he was doing . '
" To be pulled out of a crowd is very daunting and I was n't aware of my rights .
" It 's a sad state of affairs today if an amateur photographer can't stand in the street taking photographs . "
' Crazy ' officials
But he's not the only snapper to fall foul of the authorities while innocently pursuing a hobby or working .
There 's a general alarm about terrorism and about paedophiles , two heady cocktails
Austin Mitchell MP Austin Mitchell MP has tabled a motion in the Commons that has drawn on cross-party support from 150 other MPs , calling on the Home Office and the police to educate officers about photographers ' rights .
Mr Mitchell , himself a keen photographer , was challenged twice , once by a lock - keeper while photographing a barge on the Leeds to Liverpool canal and once on the beach at Cleethorpes .
" There 's a general alarm about terrorism and about paedophiles , two heady cocktails , and police and PCSOs [ police community support officers ] and wardens and authorities generally seem to be worried about this . "
Photographers have every right to take photos in a public place , he says , and it 's crazy for officials to challenge them when there are so many security cameras around and so many people now have cameras on phones .
But it 's usually inexperienced officers responsible .
" If a decision is made to crack down on photographers , it should be made at the top .
It 's a general officiousness and a desire to interfere with people going about their legitimate business . "
Furtive photos Steve Carroll was another hapless victim of this growing suspicion .
Police seized the film from his camera while he was out taking snaps in a Hull shopping centre .
They later returned it but a police investigation found they had acted correctly because he appeared to be taking photographs covertly .
Be aware of people taking photos - the Met 's latest campaign .

And photography enthusiast Adam Jones has started an online petition on the Downing Street website urging the prime minister to clarify the law .
It has gained hundreds of supporters .
He says it has become increasingly difficult to take photos in public places because of terrorism fears .
Holidaymakers to some overseas destinations will be familiar with this sort of attitude - travel guides frequently caution readers that innocently posing for a snapshot outside a government building could lead to some stern questions from local law enforcers .
But in Britain this sort of attitude is new .
So what is the law ?
" If you are a normal person going about your business and you see something you want to take a picture of , then you are fine unless you 're taking picture of something inherently private , " says Hanna Basha , partner at solicitors Carter - Ruck .
" But if it 's the London Marathon or something , you 're fine . "
Everyone in the photographic world has become so concerned we 're mounting campaigns

There are also restrictions around some public buildings , like those involved in national defence .
And under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , police officers may randomly stop someone without reasonable suspicion , providing the area has been designated a likely target for an attack .
Child protection has been an issue for years , says Stewart Gibson of the Bureau of Freelance Photographers , but what 's happened recently is a rather odd interpretation of privacy and heightened fears about terrorism .
" They [ police , park wardens , security guards ] seem to think you can't take pictures of people in public places .
It 's reached a point where everyone in the photographic world has become so concerned we 're mounting campaigns and trying to publicise this . "
It seems to be increasing , he says .
" There 's a great deal of paranoia around but the police are on alert for anything that vaguely resembles terrorism .
It 's difficult because the more professional a photographer , paradoxically , the more likely they are to be stopped or questioned .
" If people were using photos for terrorism purposes they would be using the smallest camera possible . "
Complaint The National Union of Journalists has staged a demo to highlight how media photographers are wrongly challenged by police .
In May last year , Thames Valley Police overturned a caution issued to photographer Andy Handley of the MK News in Milton Keynes , after he took pictures at the scene of a road accident .
Guidelines agreed between senior police and the media were adopted by all forces in England and Wales last year .
They state that police have no power to prevent the media taking photos .
They state that " once images are recorded , [ the police ] have no power to delete or confiscate them without a court order , even if [ the police ] think they contain damaging or useful evidence . "
And in the case of Phil Smith , an official complaint about the Christmas lights incident helped sort matters out .
Not only did he receive a written apology from Suffolk Police , but also a visit from an inspector , who explained that the officer , a special constable , had acted wrongly .
And there was one consolation for Mr Smith as he trudged home while lamenting the shots of Letitia Dean that never were - she did n't turn up anyway .
Here is a selection of your comments .
My hobby is walking around cities taking photos of interesting places that never make it on to the postcards .
Only last weekend I photographed Postman 's Park and the Gherkin ( looking up from the ground ) .
It just struck me that taking those photos could be seen as somehow dodgy - and that 's wrong .
Why has an activity that thousands of people do , and take pleasure in , and become good at , become something suspicious because a terrorist took a few snaps ?
And let 's face it , most terrorist targets are the kind of thing that gets displayed on postcards anyway .
Have a camera should not automatically make someone a criminal .
Nona , London
In the modern world , it is possible to take thousands of snaps with camera phones or more discreet cameras , so why would any aspiring terrorist need to use an obvious camera ?
And as the information on most ' target ' buildings are freely available on the internet , why would they bother with taking photographs anyway ?
This seems like another misdirected exercise in providing " visual proof " that the police force are tackling terrorism .
Heather , Willenhall I was stopped ( quite nicely but firmly ) by some private security staff from photographing a well - known London landmark building at night .
Bizarrely , I was told that I was ok to photograph so long as I did n't use a tripod ( because using one meant I was a professional ) .
I actually got some pretty nice photos laid down on the ground .
Haysie , UK
Take some photos of the police who are trying to stop you taking photos .
Then tell them you are within your rights to do so and you will not delete them and if they arrest you then you will pursue a case of wrongful arrest .
They really hate that .
Graham , Reading Cartier - Bresson must be spinning in his grave .
Media - fuelled public paranoia about potential paedophiles is destroying the ability of innocent photographers documenting everyday life in this country .
Licence to take photographs ?
How fascist is that sort of inquisition ?
We need to defend our freedoms more carefully , to the point of seeming awkward .
The state is there to serve us , not to control us .
Tim , Warwick
How pathetic has this country become that a person who wishes to take a photograph , comes under suspicion of " terrorism . "
I 'm pretty sure that terrorists did n't bomb London and New York with a few photographs .
Mike , Watford , Hertfordshire I think that our appointed authorities should get a grip on reality and realise that we live in an information - rich world , where all of us can claim our 15 minutes of broadcast fame .
And what happens when there is an incident ?
Well , we are all asked if anyone was out there taking photographs that might assist the authorities with their enquiries !
Jochim Mittwoch , East Grinstead
This sort of attitude by the authorities smacks of the over fearful attitudes of Communist governments who prevented people taking photos of any municipal building .
As visitors to Poland in 1990 , we were disallowed of taking photos of anything of interest by the ever present authoritative figure .
When will the government get rid of the generally irrational fear of all things that might be connected to child abuse or terrorism ?
Becky I have been challenged by a parent from the other team for taking snaps of my 13 - year - old son playing football , even though the coach verified that it was my son playing .
I have also been asked whether I should be taking pictures of my 15 - year - old son playing guitar in his band at a school performance .
Yet in the same town I am allowed to take my video camera in to my nine - year - old daughter 's annual dance show , where girls aged four - 18 dressed in leotards perform .
You can even buy an official DVD of the show afterwards .
Ian , Cirencester , Gloucestershire
It 's good that this being highlighted .
If something or someone is in public , they have no right not to be photographed .
We are all recorded on CCTV cameras every time we leave our homes .
Steve R , London
I was stopped by police when photographing the motorway at night - trying to practice getting those trailblazing shots is hard enough but when a policeman taps you on the shoulder and you almost throw your camera over the edge of the walkway makes it that little bit more difficult .
He was interested in what I was doing and also impressed with what I had done but then turned and told me to finish up and walk away !
Rowan Troy , Gravesend
I see odd people taking photos all the time , I think they are called tourists !
Nick , Perth
As a keen amateur photographer myself , I 've heard many stories about people being stopped at searched / questioned and generally harassed by security guards and law enforcement officials !
To help me if I ever come across issues , I 've now got a small handy print out of what rights I have a photographer kept in my camera bag - so if someone challenges me I can refer to that if need be .
Matt Morris , Bristol
Even if it were legal , it would still be idiotic for police to target those with big , obvious cameras .
If terrorists want shots of buildings for nefarious purposes , they would probably do it subtly with a camera phone .
David , Sussex
There are forms that a few photographers have put together forms , ( which every keen photographer should carry at all times in their bag ) , explaining what police can and cannot do under the Prevention of Terrorism rules .
Liberty also has helped with what procedures you should follow if stopped .
Andrew Cook , Ipswich
This certainly explains what I saw in London recently .
Waiting for the tube at an underground station was another passenger who was taking some shots of the tunnel , track etc .
I 'm a photographer and could understand why - interesting shapes etc .
He was approached by a member of staff who told him to stop .
Another day a passenger on an underground train took a photo , looked sheepish and explained to me ( I had n't asked for an explanation ) that she was just taking a photo of the caps the group were wearing ( bright green ) .
Certainly paranoia regarding photos seems to be growing .
Especially if you use a ' real ' camera !
Pauline R , Scotland
I 've been fortunate not to have this happen .
That said recently in London I was taking photos of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben , and I could n't help notice a rather threatening look from some of the police officers , because I had a big black camera .
It was n't as if I was taking close up shots , they were with my 50 mm lens !
This put me off as I was very aware of what they were thinking .
It 's just a hobby , it 's better than me sniffing crack and being a gobby mare at the weekends causing trouble after kicking out time .
Vicky Lamburn , Worthing
If the police were to stop everyone who wanders around Oxford waving a camera , they 'd never get anything else done !
I usually get snapped about six times just walking form work to the supermarket at lunchtime ...
Kate , Oxford
You should see what it 's like in the US .
I almost got shot for taking a photo of the outside of the Pentagon .
Quizzed about my visit with passport and camera confiscated .
And it was n't even a decent photo .
Kevin Graham , London
In 2007 , when I was on holiday in Los Angeles , my family and I were taking pictures in Victoria Gardens where there was a huge Christmas tree when a police officer approached us and warned us to stop taking pictures as we could be arrested as suspects for scouting for terrorists .
I found it ridiculous .

Cast members parody the Democratic presidential debates , with Fred Armisen — sporting the dusted - off ears used for Bush sketches — playing a perfectly pitched Obama and Amy Poehler as the cackling Clinton .
' SNL ' skits raise doubts about neutrality
If “ Saturday Night Live ” aired on Sunday morning , it would be called “ Mock the Press . ”
Two recent political sketches on the show have focused solely on the media ’s supposed consecration of presidential candidate Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) and desecration of his rival Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , possibly to the chagrin of Campbell Brown but to the glee of Howard Wolfson .
Advertisement
Since it began , " SNL " has been on the front lines of political parody , lampooning a clumsy Gerald Ford and a " prudent " George H.W. Bush .
But with Clinton using the recent skits as a rallying cry , some question the show ’s comic neutrality .
Others say there is no objectivity when it comes to satire .
“ Hillary Clinton seems to be as delighted as a schoolgirl in a new party dress with what ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ has done , ” said Robert Thompson , a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University .
The sketches in question opened the last two shows .
They parody the Democratic presidential debates , with Fred Armisen — sporting the dusted - off ears used for Bush sketches — playing a perfectly pitched Obama and Amy Poehler as the cackling Clinton .
When Obama speaks , moderator Brown ( played by Kristen Wiig ) gets all verklempt , and Jorge Ramos ( Will Forte ) is identified as “ Univision Anchor / Obama Stalker . ”
When Clinton speaks — well , she does n’t really get the chance to .
In real life , Clinton — misquoting the first " SNL " debate sketch , but getting at the gist of it — said at the recent Cleveland debate , “ And if anybody saw ‘ Saturday Night Live , ’ maybe we should ask Barack if he ’s comfortable and needs another pillow . ”
Clinton won the Ohio primary a week later .
Washington - based comedian Randolph Terrance , known on the circuit as “ Randolph T , ” scrutinized the opening skits .
“ To me , everybody at ' SNL ' is completely in the bag for Hillary Clinton , ” Terrance said , but he added that he was not bothered at all by the bias , since " SNL , " like " The Daily Show , " does not pretend to be a serious news program .
“ Unquestionably , ' SNL ' has a liberal slant , and , as a group , the cast is probably more Democratic - leaning than not , ” said Doug Hecox , author of the book “ Star Spangled Banter . ”
He added that he saw the " SNL " cast as more “ anti-establishment ” than Hillary supporters .
Mark Katz is the principal of the Sound Bite Institute , a strategic communications firm , and former head joke writer for the Clinton administration .
Katz said the debate sketches could represent a balancing act on the part of General Electric , the company that owns both NBC and MSNBC .
“ In some ways , it may be a kind of mea culpa on behalf of the media in general , ” explained Katz .
MSNBC and NBC could be “ working both sides of the equation , ” continued Katz , with the cable network being accused of being tough on Hillary and the prime - time network poking fun at those same accusations .
In a February article about the cable network ’s treatment of Clinton , New York Times reporter Alessandra Stanley said “ MSNBC has a vein of bratty , adolescent insensitivity , especially toward women , that keeps popping out . ”
“ I feel like it 's two hands working in tandem , ” Katz said .
Jeff Weingrad , co-author of the " SNL " bible , “ Saturday Night : A Backstage History of ' Saturday Night Live , ' ” said he doubted the show was putting its “ satirical might ” behind one candidate over another .
“ The fact is , quite often , the ‘ they ’ is really one or two people , ” said Weingrad , referring to the notion that the show ’s bits are representative of the entire cast ’s political leanings .
But there could be other gag gears shifting when it comes to how “ Saturday Night ” chooses to play the senator from Illinois .
Katz said there was a strict comic rule during the last months of the Clinton White House — “ joke about the smoke and not the fire . ”
Some of that could be happening this year as well , with " SNL " preferring to skewer the perception of Obama as opposed to Obama himself .
Though he was understandably hesitant to make the comparison , Hecox allowed that the difficulties with lampooning Obama ’s character could be along the same lines as those associated with clowning Martin Luther King Jr. or Malcolm X in the 1960s .
“ Well - meaning social icons ” are tough to laugh at , he said .
Add to that the fact that Obama is being played by eerie - look - alike Fred Armisen — who , according to the Internet Movie Database , is “ of German , Japanese and Venezuelan descent ” — and the debate sketches could take on another meaning .
Playing Obama with a furrowed brow and staccato speech , Armisen does an excellent job of mimicking the senator , but for some black comedians , that is far from the point .
“ I expect Fred Armisen to do a good job .
Why would n’t he ? ”
Terrance said , before adding : “ But come on .
If Tim Meadows was there , it would have been Tim Meadows . ”
Katz argued that “ the racial framework ” misses the point of the sketches , which thus far have centered on the Obama campaign as a “ messianic phenomenon . ”
“ Obama is black the way Elvis was a truck driver , ” said Katz .
“ It ’s part of the narrative , but it ’s hardly the point . ”
Leighann Lord , a comedian based in New York , said her first reaction to Armisen ’s Obama was laughter , “ and then that other thought came in . ”
“ Yeah , he was good and he was funny , but did they even try ” to find a black actor for the part ?
What Lord found interesting were the sketches to come , particularly if Obama clinches not just the Democratic nomination but the presidency .
What will we make fun of then ?
“ Toes will be stepped on , boundaries will be stretched , and you ’re going to find the new edge of funny , ” explained Lord , who called comedy “ the town crier ” on sensitive topics such as race and gender .
Like Terrance , Lord praised Armisen as Obama but said “ it would have been nice ” to have a black cast member play him .
“ But , again , that ’s me dreaming , ” said Lord .
“ You know ?
Saying , ‘ Yes we can . ’ ”
Still , the question of whether any of this matters at the end of an hour and a half , Lord said , “ depends on the day of the week and how many drinks you ’ve had . ”
I THINK my breaking point came yesterday morning when I received an email from the Clinton campaign criticising Barack Obama for not releasing his tax returns for 1997 , 1998 and 1999 .
Notes like that should come with a little kitchen - sink icon pinned to them .
Included in the missive was the obligatory reference to Tony Rezko — again this should be an automatic attachment .
They can even label it " Obama ’s Whitewater " if they like .
I ’d appreciate the irony .
This was followed by a virtual flood of emails in which Clinton - supporting politicians ( not one of whom I had heard of ) expressed eerily similar outrage over Mr Obama ’s “ bitter ” comments .
Mrs Clinton herself , of course , has spent the past five days harping on the same subject .
Or perhaps my breaking point came today , when Bill Clinton , the most poll - driven president in history , claimed to have told his wife to forget about " the shifting polls and the daily back - and - forth " and focus on promoting her values .
I ’m guessing his actual advice sounded more like this .
I ’m not exactly sure when it happened , but my will has been broken .
I ’ve realised that covering Mrs Clinton 's campaign without explicitly stating that it has turned into a win- at - all - costs operation fueled by phony outrage , hypocritical proclamations and absurd notions of who is electable and who is not is an exercise in deliberate deception , and I can't do that .
Perhaps I am weaker than my colleagues , but a certain fatigue sets in when trying to sort through it all .
Mrs Clinton does have substance , and some well - thought - out policy prescriptions , but did you know Barack Obama is an elitist ?
Never mind that the Clintons largely agree with what Mr Obama said , or meant to say .
Perhaps it is because Mrs Clinton is the underdog that the tone of her campaign is so different from Mr Obama’s .
Her efforts to connect with different voting blocs have not worked — one day she ’s a sniper - dodging commander - in - chief , the next she ’s a gun-shooting woman of the people .
Most of the time she simply looks like a caricature of the voters she ’s trying to lure .
And when it comes down to policy , there are simply not enough big differences between the two candidates to allow her to catch up .
So she must make Mr Obama look unelectable .
She must go negative .
And she has .
That ’s fine , but let ’s be forthright about it .
This is no longer a campaign based on ideas .
It is a campaign focused on tearing down Mr Obama .
We all know that ’s her only shot at the nomination .
I ’m tired of pretending otherwise .

Google recently acquired DoubleClick in a multi-billion dollar deal Google has announced its first sizeable cuts , with the axing of 300 jobs at its online advertising unit DoubleClick .
The lay - offs make up about a quarter of DoubleClick 's 1,200 - strong workforce in the US .
Worldwide , DoubleClick has about 1,500 employees .
Google 's chief executive Eric Schmidt has suggested that overseas operations , employing a further 300 people , will also be affected at a later date .
It is a first for Google and perhaps not one they want to trumpet too much .
In a statement , Google said : " Since our acquisition of DoubleClick closed on March 11 , we have been working to match and align DoubleClick employees in the US with our organisational plan for the business .
" As with many mergers , this review has resulted in a reduction in head - count at the acquired company . "
Privacy concerns
Some workers have been laid off already , while Google says others are being offered transitional roles , or contract jobs , which are expected to end after the two companies are fully integrated .
In a blog posting in March , Mr Schmidt gave a heads - up that job cuts would be likely and that those outside the US would be made " in accordance with local law " .
At over $ 3 billion ( £ 1.5bn ) , Google 's purchase of DoubleClick is its largest to date and completed less than a month ago , after being held up by regulators for a year .
At the time , the deal was heavily criticised and resisted by non-profit privacy groups which argued that it would give Google unprecedented access to information about consumers ' online behaviour .
Microsoft and AT&T also opposed the transaction , which was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in December .
Conflict of interest ?
On top of the news of the lay - offs , Google says it also plans to sell a DoubleClick unit called Performics Search Marketing .
At Google , maintaining objectivity in both search and advertising is paramount to our mission and core to the trust we ask from our users
Tom Phillips
Director of DoubleClick Integration
That arm of the business helps marketers place adverts on search engines , including those owned by Google and its main rivals in the field , Yahoo and Microsoft .
It has always been felt that this represented a conflict of interest for Google .
In an official Google blog , Tom Phillips , director of DoubleClick Integration , writes : " It is clear to us that we do not want to be in the search engine marketing business .
" At Google , maintaining objectivity in both search and advertising is paramount to our mission and core to the trust we ask from our users . "
Industry watchers maintain that the decision to sell off Performics Search Marketing makes good business sense and that Google 's primary focus is to get paid as much as possible for the adverts that appear on its pages .
Rumours abound that Google is already in talks with a third party to sell the business for an undisclosed sum .
Although on his blog Mr Phillips maintains no buyer is waiting in the wings , he does concede there has been quite a bit of interest " from a number of current partners " .
Danny Sullivan , editor of SeachEngineLand.com , praises the much anticipated sell - off and says it was not unexpected .
Google said the business would continue to run as a separate entity until the division was sold .

Objectives
Our research is to extend functional programming languages with aspect - oriented features .
It currently consists of three projects , the original theory of aspects , research on harmless advice , and research on polymorphic advice .
The original research on the theory of aspects defined the semantics of MinAML , an idealized aspect - oriented programming language , by giving a type - directed translation from a user - friendly external language to a compact , well - defined core language .
The core language extends the simply - typed lambda calculus with two central new abstractions : explicitly labeled program points and first - class advice .
The labels serve both to trigger advice and to mark continuations that the advice may return to .
The harmless advice project defines an object - oriented language with harmless aspect - oriented advice .
A piece of harmless advice is a computation that , like ordinary aspect - oriented advice , executes when control reaches a designated control - flow point .
However , unlike ordinary advice , harmless advice is designed to obey a weak non-interference property .
Harmless advice may change the termination behavior of computations and use I/O , but it does not otherwise influence the final result of the mainline code .
The benefit of harmless advice is that it facilitates local reasoning about program behavior .
In addition , programmers may add new pieces of harmless advice to pre-existing programs in typical ``after - the - fact ' ' aspect - oriented style without fear they will break important data invariants used by the mainline code .
The polymorphic advice project defines PolyAML , a typed functional , aspect - oriented programming language .
The main contribution of PolyAML is the seamless integration of polymorphism , run-time type analysis and aspect - oriented programming language features .
In particular , PolyAML allows programmers to define type - safe polymorphic advice using pointcuts constructed from a collection of polymorphic join points .
PolyAML also comes equipped with a type inference algorithm that conservatively extends Hindley - Milner type inference .

By the time Specialist Jerry Ryen King decided to write about his experiences in Iraq , the teen - age paratrooper had more to share than most other soldiers .
In two operations to clear the outskirts of the village of Turki in the deadly Diyala Province , Specialist King and the rest of the Fifth Squadron faced days of firefights , grenade attacks and land mines .
Well - trained insurgents had burrowed deep into muddy canals , a throwback to the trenches of World War I .
As the fighting wore on , B - 1 bombers and F - 16s were called in to drop a series of powerful bombs .
Once the area was clear of insurgents , the squadron , part of the 82nd Airborne Division , uncovered hidden caches with thousands of weapons .
Two months later , Specialist King , a handsome former honors student and double - sport athlete from Georgia , sat down at his computer .
In informal but powerful prose , he began a journal .
After 232 long , desolate , morose , but somewhat days of tranquility into deployment , I ’ve decided that I should start writing some of the things I experienced here in Iraq .
I have to say that the events that I have encountered here have changed my outlook on life ...
The most recent mission started out as a 24 - 36 hour air - assault sniper mission in a known al - Qaida stronghold just north of Baghdad .
We landed a few hours before daybreak and as soon as I got off the helicopter my night vision broke , I was surrounded by the sound of artillery rounds , people screaming in Arabic , automatic weapons , and the terrain did n’t look anything like what we were briefed .
I knew it was going to be a bad day and a half .
Jerry Ryen King , journal entry , March 7 , 2007
A month later , Specialist King was sitting inside his combat outpost , an abandoned school in Sadah , when suicide bombers exploded two dump trucks just outside the building .
The school collapsed , killing Specialist King on April 23 , 2007 , along with eight other soldiers , and making the blast one of the most lethal for Americans fighting in Iraq .

In that instant , Specialist King became one of 4,000 service members and Defense Department civilians to die in the Iraq war  a milestone that was reached late Sunday , five years since the war began in March 2003 .
The last four members of that group , like the majority of the most recent 1,000 to die , were killed by an improvised explosive device .
They died at 10 p.m. Sunday on a patrol in Baghdad , military officials said ; their names have not yet been released .
The next day we cleared an area that made me feel as if I were in Vietnam .
Honestly , it was one of the scariest times of my life .
At one point I was in water up to my waist and heard an AK fire in my direction .
But all in all the day was going pretty good , no one was hurt , I got to shoot a few rounds , toss a grenade , and we were walking to where the helicopter was supposed to pick us up .
Jerry Ryen King , journal entry , March 7 , 2007
The year 2007 would prove to be especially hard on American service members ; more of them died last year than in any other since the war began .
Many of those deaths came in the midst of the 30,000 - troop buildup known as “ the surge , ” the linchpin of President Bush ’s strategy to tamp down widespread violence between Islamic Sunnis and Shiites , much of it in the country ’s capital , Baghdad .
In April , May and June alone , 331 American service members died , making it the deadliest three - month period since the war began .
But by fall , the strategy , bolstered by new alliances with Sunni tribal chiefs and a decision by the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr to order his militia to stop fighting , appeared to be paying off as the country entered a period of relative calm .
Military casualties and Iraqi civilian deaths fell , and the October - December period produced the fewest casualties of any three months of the war .
The past month , though , has seen an uptick in killings and explosions , particularly suicide bombings .
Much of the violence has traveled north to Mosul , where the group calling itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia remains strong .
Everything changed in a matter of 15 minutes ...
About the time I was opening my MRE ( meal ready to eat ) I heard an explosion .
Everyone started running towards the sound of the explosion .
Apparently a suicide bomber had blown himself up killing four soldiers from my squadron and injuring another .
Our 36 hour mission turned into another air - assault into a totally different city , the clearing of it , and 5 more days .
We did find over 100 RPG ’s , IED making materials , insurgents implacing IED ’s , artillery rounds , a sniper rifle , and sort of like a terrorist training book and cd’s .
Jerry Ryen King , journal entry , March 7 , 2007
Unlike the soldiers of some previous wars , who were only occasionally able to send letters back home to loved ones , many of those who died left behind an extraordinary electronic testimony describing in detail the labor , the fears and the banality of serving in Iraq .
In excerpts published here from journals , blogs and e-mail messages , six soldiers who died in the most recent group of 1,000 mostly skim the alarming particulars of combat , a kindness shown their relatives and close friends .
Instead , they plunge readily into the mundane , but no less important rhythms of home .
They fire off comments about holiday celebrations , impending weddings , credit card bills , school antics and the creeping anxiety of family members who are coping with one deployment too many .
At other moments , the service members describe the humor of daily life down range , as they call it .
Hurriedly , with little time to worry about spelling or grammar , they riff on the chaos around them and reveal moments of fear .
As casualties climb and the violence intensifies , so does their urge to share their grief and foreboding .

Juan Campos , e-mail message to his wife , Dec. 12 , 2006 .
When Staff Sgt. Juan Campos , 27 , flew from Baghdad to Texas for two weeks last year , there was more on his mind than rest and relaxation .
He visited his father ’s grave , which he had never seen .
He spent time with his grandparents and touched base with the rest of his rambling , extended family .
The day he was scheduled to return to war , Sergeant Campos and his wife went out dancing and drinking all evening with friends .
Calm and reserved by nature , Sergeant Campos could out - salsa and out - hip - hop most anyone on the dance floor .
At the airport , his wife , Jamie Campos , who had grown used to the upheaval of deployment , surprised herself .
“ I cried and I have never ever cried before , ” said Mrs. Campos , 26 , who has a 9 - year - old son , Andre .
“ It was just really , really weird .
He knew , and I kind of knew .
It felt different . ”
“ We both felt that it was the last goodbye , ” she said .

Mood : gloomy
The life of an infantryman is never safe .. how do I know , well I live it every day .
I lost a good friend of mine just two days ago to an enemy sniper .
The worst feeling in the world is having lost one of your own and not being able to fight back .
The more I go on patrol , the more alert I tend to be , but regardless of the situation here in Iraq is that we are never safe .
No matter the countermeasures we take to prevent any attacks .
They seem to seep through the cracks .
Every day a soldier is lost or wounded by enemy attacks .
I for one would like to make it home to my family one day .
Pray for us and keep us in your thoughts ... for an infantryman ’s life is never safe .

Sergeant Campos , a member of the First Battalion , 26th Infantry , Charlie Company out of Germany , was one of thousands of infantrymen assigned to stabilize Baghdad and the surrounding areas last year during the troop buildup .
Troops were sent deep into insurgent neighborhoods , where they lived in small outposts , patrolled on foot , cleared houses , mingled with Iraqis and rebuilt the infrastructure .
The extra 30,000 service members  160,000 in all  were deployed to Iraq to help quell the runaway violence that threatened large - scale civil war .
Most soldiers spent 15 months in Iraq , a length of time that military commanders have said is unsustainable .
Many had fought in the war at least once .
A few had been in Iraq multiple times .
My only goals are to make it out of this place alive and return you guys and make you as happy as I can .
Juan Campos , e-mail message to his wife , Dec. 15 , 2006 .
But to Sergeant Campos and the rest of Charlie Company in Adhamiya , a north Baghdad stronghold for Sunni insurgents , the buildup seemed oddly invisible .
The men patrolled almost every day , sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day for months , often in 120 - degree weather .
Exhaustion was too kind a word for their fatigue .
More than 150 soldiers lived in a two - story house with portable toilets , no air - conditioning and temperamental showers .
Sleep came only a few hours at a time .
The fighting was vicious .
Adhamiya was such a magnet for sectarian bloodletting that the military built a wall around it to contain the violence .
“ They walled us in and left us there , ” Staff Sgt. Robin Johnson , 28 , said of the 110 men in Charlie Company .
“ We were a family .
I would die for these guys before I die for my own blood brother . ”
On patrol , sniper fire rang out so routinely that soldiers in Sergeant Campos ’s platoon seldom stood still for more than four seconds .
They scoured rooftops for Iraqi children who lobbed grenades at American soldiers for a handful of cash .
Roadside bombs burst from inside drainage pipes , impossible to detect from the street .
The bombs grew larger by the month .
Last year , these powerful improvised explosive devices , known as I.E.D.s were responsible for a majority of American fatalities , a new milestone .
The bombs also killed multiple soldiers more often than in the past , a testament to their potency .

“ It was the most horrible thing you could possibly imagine , ” Sergeant Johnson said .
“ As soon as you left the gate , you could die at any second .
If you went out for a day and you were n’t attacked , it was confusing . ”
Charlie Company soldiers found a steady stream of Iraqis killed by insurgents for money or revenge .
Some had their faces wiped clean by acid .
Others were missing their heads or limbs .
' It Could Have Been Me '
to tell the story of iraq is a hard one .

Sgt. Ryan M. Wood , 22 , a gifted artist , prolific writer and a sly romantic from Oklahoma , was also one of the bluntest soldiers inside Charlie Company .
it is fighting extreme boredom with the lingering thought in the forefront of your mind that any minute on this patrol could be my last endeavour , only highlighted by times of such extreme terror and an adrenaline rush that no drug can touch .
what [ expletive ] circumstances thinking “ that should ’ve been me ” or “ it could ’ve been me ” .
wondering it that pile of trash will suddenly explode killing you or worse one of your beloved comrads .. only backed by the past thoughts and experiences of really losing friends of yours and not feeling completely hopeless that it was all for nothing because all in all , you know the final outcome of this war .
it is walking on that thin line between sanity and insanity .
that feeling of total abandonment by a government and a country you used to love because politics are fighting this war ...... and its a losing battle .... and we ’re the ones ultimently paying the price .
Ryan Wood , Myspace blog , Adhamiya
For the soldiers in Iraq , reconciling Adhamiya with America was not always easy .
One place was buried in garbage and gore and hopelessness .
The other seemed unmoored from the war , fixated on the minutia of daily life and the hiccups of the famous .
The media was content to indulge .
WHAT THE HELL AMERICA ??
“ What the hell happened ? ” any intelligent American might ask themselves throughout their day .
While the ignorant , dragging themselves to thier closed off cubicle , contemplate the simple things in life such as “ fast food tonight ? ” or “ I wonder what motivated Brittany Spears to shave her unsightly , mishaped domepiece ? ”
To the simpleton , this news might appear “ devastating . ”
I assume not everyone thinks this way , but from my little corner of the earth , Iraq , a spot in the world a majority of Americans could ’nt point out on the map , it certainly appears so .
This little piece of truly , heart - breaking news captured headlines and apparently American imaginations as FOX news did a two hour , truly enlightening piece of breaking news history .
American veiwers watched intently , and impatiently as the pretty colors flashed and the media exposed the inner workings of Brittany ’s obviously , deep character .
I was amazed , truly dumbfounded wondering how we as Americans have sank so low .
To all Americans I have but one phrase that helps me throughout my day of constant dangers and ever present death around the corner , “ WHO THE [ expletive ] CARES ! ”
Wow America , we have truly become a nation of self - absorbed retards .
...
This world has serious problems and it ’s time for America to start addressing them .

The somberness of the job was hard to shake off .
But , day to day , there was no more reliable antidote than Pfc. Daniel J. Agami , a South Floridian with biceps the size of cantaloupes , and Pfc. Ryan J. Hill , a self - described hellion who loved his “ momma ” and hailed from what he called the “ felony flats ” of Oregon .
Funny men in the best sense of the word , the two provided a valuable and essential commodity in a war zone .

Their mother jokes  the kind that begin , “ your mother is so ... ”  were legendary , culminating in a Myspace joke - off .
It ended abruptly after an enough - is - enough phone call from Private Hill ’s mother , who ranked No. 1 on his list of heroes in Myspace .
Private Agami proclaimed victory .
About a month later ... I went to my room and my mattress was missing and all my close were being worn by other people .
I could n’t figure it out so I knew right off the bat to go to Hill .
I saw him walking down the hall wearing five of my winter jackets .
He sold half my wardrobe right off his back to people in our company and my mattress was in someone else ’s room .
So then I had go to around and buy all my stuff back .
( Now I think he won ) .

Eulogy sent via e-mail message to his mother , Jan. 29 , 2007
To keep their spirits up , combat soldiers learned to appreciate the incongruities of war in Iraq .
Jokes scrawled inside a Port - o - Potty quickly made the rounds .
Situational humor , from goofy to macabre , proved plentiful .
A really girly guy who was a cheerleader in high school , got knocked down and nearly hurt by the wind of the helicopter .
Listening to Dickson recite what was in every single MRE was pretty funny .
A cow charged and nearly trampled one of my friends when we were raiding a compound .
And lastly , I thought that it was pretty comical that I shot at a guy a long ways out but missed and later after taking his house and using it as a patrol base he offered me Chai and rice .

Even a trip to the dentist , with its fringe benefits , is cause for amusement in a war zone .
Last Sat .
I had two of my wisdom teeth pulled .
After taking double the prescribe percocot and morphine pills that the doctor gave me for the pain I decided to catch a flight back to my FOB ( forward operation base ) .
It was the coolest Blackhawk ride I ’ve had , I was absolutely ripped and I talked the pilots into leaving the doors open .
We had four more guys die a couple days ago .
They hit an IED , it killed everyone in the humvee ..
It ’s starting to get a little scary .
We made it our first six months with just two deaths and that was plenty .
But now just in the past two and a half weeks we ’ve had nine more guys get killed , and over 50 wounded .
I ’m just hoping that I can make it the 75 more days or so that we have left of combat operations before we start packing .
Jerry Ryen King , journal entry , April 11 , 2007
Among the guys in Charlie Company , Private Agami , 25 , was one of the boldest and most resilient .
He was the kind of guy who joined an endurance ski contest on a whim .
He came in fourth .
He had never skied in his life .
Private Agami had time for everyone , and everyone had time for him .
Affectionately called GI Jew , he held his religion up to the light .
He used it to build tolerance among the troops and shatter stereotypes ; few in his unit had ever met a Jew .
He flew the Israeli flag over his cot in Adhamiya .
He painted the words Hebrew Hammer onto his rifle .
He even managed to keep kosher , a feat that required a steady diet of protein shakes and cereal .

Commander Mom , I cant wait to come home and when I do , dont worry ill have allot to say to the congregation .
Dont worry about my mental stage either , we all receive counseling and help from doctors when something like this happens .
I am a strong individual physically and mentally and if there is one thing the army teaches you , it is how to deal with death .
Everyday that passes it gets easier and easier .
I miss you guys very much and I love you !
Daniel Agami , e-mail message to his mother , Oct. 28 , 2006
It did not get easier .
I try not to cry .
I have never cried this much my entire life .
two great men got taken from us way too soon .
i wonder why it was them in not me .
I sit here right now wondering why did they go to the gates of heaven n not me .
I try everynight count my blessing that I made it another day but why are we in this hell over here ?
why ?
i cant stop askin why ?
Ryan Hill , Myspace blog , Nov. 1 , 2006
Private Hill was riding in a Humvee on Jan. 20 , 2007 when an I.E.D. buried in the middle of the road detonated under his seat , killing him instantly .
Sergeant Campos was riding in a Humvee on May 14 , 2007 , two weeks after returning from Texas , when it hit an I.E.D .
The bomb lifted the Humvee five feet off the ground and engulfed it in flames .
“ That ’s when we just left hope at the door , ” Sergeant .
Johnson said .
Severely burned over 80 percent of his body , Sergeant Campos lived two weeks .
He died June 1 .
Another soldier , Pfc. Nicholas S. Hartge , 20 , of Indiana , died in the same attack .
Private Agami was driving a Bradley fighting vehicle on June 21 , 2007 when it hit an I.E.D .
The explosion flipped the 30 - ton vehicle , which also carried Sergeant Wood .
Both men were killed , along with three other soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter .
“ Obviously , it came to a point , you did n’t care anymore if it got better , ” said Staff Sgt. Jeremy S. Rausch , 31 , one of Sergeant Campos ’s best friends in Charlie Company .
“ You did n’t care about the people because they did n’t care about themselves .
We had already lost enough people that we just thought , you know , ‘ why ? ’ ”
During their time in Adhamiya , the soldiers of Charlie Company caught more than two dozen high - value targets , found nearly 50 weapons caches , detained innumerable insurgents and won countless combat awards .
They lost 14 men .
Their mission was hailed a success .
Just in Case
Texan to the core , enamored of the military , Specialist Daniel E. Gomez , 21 , an Army combat medic in the division ’s Alpha Company , relied on his books , his iPod and an Xbox to distract him from the swirl .
Federal , state and local cops are huddling together in domestic intelligence dens around the nation to fuse anti-terror information and tips in ways they never have before , and they want the American people to know about it – sort of .
Some of the nation 's top law enforcement and anti-terror officials got together to hold press briefings Tuesday and Wednesday mornings at the second annual National Fusion Center conference held in San
Francisco .
Homeland Security Under Secretary Charlie Allen , formerly of the
CIA , described how sharing threat assessments , and even the occasional raw intel , with the new fusion centers marks a cultural shift from the Cold War era .
Back then , spies treated everyone , other departments and agencies included , as suspicious .
" Things have changed remarkably in Washington .
We are talking to each other , " Allen said Tuesday .
" I am from the shadows of the CIA
where in the Cold War , we followed a different model .
That model does not apply for the kinds of threats we have today that are borderless .
The threats are so different and so remarkably dangerous for our citizens . "
The fifty or so U.S. fusion centers are where the federal , state and local cops share intelligence , sift data for clues , run down reports of suspicious packages and connect dots in an effort to detect and thwart terrorism attacks , drug smuggling and gang fighting .
Iowa 's fusion center director Russell Porter ran the sparsely attended press conference , flanked by FBI intelligence director Tracy Reinhold , DHS civil liberties officer David Gersten and the Justice Department 's privacy officer Kenneth Mortenson . ( L to R )
Photo : Ryan Singel / Wired.comPrivacy and civil liberties groups are increasingly suspicious of the fusion centers , but state and local officials have complained for years that the feds do n't share any useful information .
The 9/11 Commission agreed , blaming the CIA and FBI 's lack of information - sharing for wasted chances to stop the airline hijackings .
The commission strongly urged they change their ways and put holes in so - called " stove pipes . "
And in 2007 , the Democrats boosted fusion centers ' stature and funding in the first bill they passed after taking control of Congress .
More than $ 130 million federal dollars have fed the development of the fusion centers in locations as diverse as Kansas and Northern California .
On Tuesday , San Francisco police chief Heather Fong said the information flow was getting better , especially around big events being held in the city .
" When we get information , it 's not how much can we amass and keep to ourselves , " Fong said .
" It 's how much information can we obtain but appropriately share so that it positively assists others in doing their jobs around the country and the world . "
The dominant catchphrase from the officials was that the centers need to focus on " all threats , all hazards . "
That means that the fusion centers would be working on immigration , radicalization , demographic changes , hurricanes , biological and chemical threats , as well as common criminal activity .
Officials say the centers must look at even the most mundane crimes , since they can be used to fund terrorism .
By way of example , Los Angeles police chief Bratton cites the investigation of a string of gas station stick - ups in L.A. in 2005 .
The robbery investigation led to the prosecution of militant Muslim convicts who were planning attacks on synagogues .
That , Bratton said , illustrates why these intelligence centers need to be analyzing run -of - the - mill crimes .
" Information that might seem innocuous may have some connection to terrorism , " Bratton said .
But critics say that " all hazards , all threats " approach sounds suspiciously like the government is building a distributed domestic intelligence service that could easily begin keeping tabs on Americans exercising their First Amendment rights .
The scope also seems at odds with the federal government 's Information Sharing Environment guidelines , which say these centers are supposed to focus on terrorism .
California 's Anti-Terrorism Information Center admitted to spying on anti-war groups in 2003 .
And Denver 's police department built their own secret spy files on Quakers and 200 other organizations .
Earlier this year , the ACLU issued a warning report about Fusion Centers , complete with an interactive fusion center map , earlier this year .
The report , entitled What 's Wrong With Fusion Centers , cited concerns about military units operating in the centers , as well as the potential for scope creep and data mining .
How , the group asked , can citizens contest information about themselves , given the patchwork of state , local and federal sunshine laws that may or may not apply .
But in a conference keynote Tuesday , Congresswoman Jane Harman ( D - California ) , a powerful force in intelligence matters and funding , pooh - poohed the ACLU 's concerns , and said she supported both fusion centers , and civil liberties .
" I was frustrated when I met with the [ ACLU ] report authors and they could not point to a single instance of a fusion center violating someone 's civil rights or liberties , " Harman said .
" In fact , state and local laws and protections in place at many fusion centers are more rigorous than their federal counterparts . "
Tim Sparapani , the ACLU 's top legislative lawyer in D.C. , bristled at Harman 's remakrs .
" Our prognosticating track record in identifying programs ripe for abuse of privacy and civil liberties is pretty solid , " Sparapani wrote in an e-mail that listed several other programs that the ACLU correctly raised warning flags on .
" That 's not luck , " he wrote .
" It 's a trend based on seeing the surveillance industrial complex being built bit - by - bit and terabyte by terabyte .
As sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west , if Fusion Centers are n't built with rigid controls they will be privacy - invading monsters .
The ACLU points to Virginia , where legislators are moving to exempt their fusion center from government sunshine laws and give legal immunity to companies that report information – such as the name of a person accosted by a private security guard for taking pictures of a skyscraper .
On Wednesday , a trio of federal privacy and civil liberties officers , including the Department of Homeland Security 's chief privacy officer Hugo Teufel , promised they were working to make sure the centers respect citizens ' civil liberties and privacy .
David Gersten , the director of the civil rights and civil liberties programs at DHS , said he was working to expand their training course for Fusion Center employees to " include an examination of the history of privacy and civil liberties as they relate to intelligence and criminal investigations . "
That history includes the famous 1976 Church Committee report on the FBI 's notorious COINTELPRO spying program .
The report warned in the introduction " Unless new and tighter controls are established by legislation , domestic intelligence activities threaten to undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its nature .
THREAT LEVEL asked conference attendees about the concerns over expanding the dissemination of intelligence given the continuing trouble innocent Americans have trying to get off the nation 's unified terrorist watch list .
Just this week , the Justice Department 's inspector general issued a watch list audit ( .pdf ) , finding that FBI agents were watch - listing people who they were n't even investigating .
Moreover , since those names were added through a back channel , there was no scheduled review or follow - up to take them off the watch list .
Leonard Boyle , who runs the Terrorist Screening Center that curates and runs the watch list , said those problems are being fixed .
" We have streamlined our processes so [...] we avoid delays in amending nominations or removing people who ought to be removed because they are no longer suspected of having a nexus to terrorism , " Boyle said .
Also present at the conference was Ambassador Thomas McNamara who now works at the Director of National Intelligence Office .
McNamara 's group is working on custom - built XML schemes , such as a standard for Suspicious Activity Reports .
The idea is have all fusion centers and intelligence agencies using the same data format , to more easily share , search , sort and store intelligence data .
Surprisingly , a total of only three reporters showed up over two days of the conference to hear from the officials .
THREAT LEVEL was the only media outlet to show up both days .
Despite journalists taking up only two of the fifty or so chairs , officials stuck with the formality of a press conference .
Each day six to eight officials stood in a semicircle flanking the lectern and took turns issuing short remarks .
After each set of speeches , the director of the Iowa fusion center and designated emcee Russell Porter allowed for a handful of questions from the two - reporter audience .
And as for information sharing , the conference 's openness extended only so far , and the press was not allowed into sensitive sessions such as " How to Generate Suspicious Activity Reporting " and " Commanders and Analysts : Sharing Perspectives . "
Government employees manning an informational booth for the Director of National Intelligence 's OpenSource.gov website refused to even describe the program , saying they would need to call in a press minder .
The website seems to indicate that the program is a way for the government to share intel reports composed by analysts who read international newspapers and watch TV stations from around the world .
THREAT LEVEL guessed we would not be able to sign up for the email blasts , due to our propensity to share information with the public .
The taciturn DNI employees confirmed that fact , adding that they also could n't share the information from OpenSource.gov due to copyright issues .

In a blow to Justice Department prosecutors , two former directors of the Information Security Oversight Office ( ISOO ) are expected to testify for the defense in the controversial trial of two former officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) who are charged with unlawful receipt and transmission of classified information .
Steven Garfinkel ( ISOO director from 1980 - 2002 ) and J. William Leonard ( 2002 - 2007 ) have been the voice of classification authority across three decades and five presidential administrations .
They inspected , oversaw and reported to the President on the government ’s classification and declassification programs .
And last week they were listed among eight proposed expert witnesses for the defense in the AIPAC case , formally known as USA v. Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman .
As deeply knowledgeable classification officials , Mr. Garfinkel and Mr. Leonard might have been expected to testify for the government in a case involving classification policy .
The fact that they are testifying for the defense is a startling indication that the prosecution ’s case has strayed far beyond any consensus view regarding the proper protection of classified information .
The surprising participation of these former classification officials was first reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and the New York Sun .
See “ Key New Witnesses Sign on for the Defense in AIPAC Case ” by Josh Gerstein , New York Sun , March 17 .
In another sign that the government ’s case may be unraveling , the lead prosecutor quit last month to take a job in the private sector .
See “ Top prosecutor in AIPAC case quits , ” Jewish Telegraphic Agency , February 28 .
Selected case files from the AIPAC prosecution may be found here .

Clinton decision not to read NIE did n't affect her judgment , advisers say David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Military advisers touted Hillary Clinton 's foreign policy expertise Wednesday as Barack Obama was trying to buff up his own judgment when it comes to world affairs .
Clinton 's campaign also dismissed the notion that her failure to read the 96 - page National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq was a mistake .
The Clinton campaign gathered military officers and advisers on a conference call after Obama delivered his own foreign policy speech Wednesday touting his war opposition and sound judgment .
Obama has previously criticized Clinton on the campaign trail for not reading the NIE .
Lee Feinstein , the campaign 's national security director , said Clinton was briefed " in great detail about the NIE , " from officials who contributed intelligence to it and wrote the final 96 - page report .
" This notion that not having physically read it is different from getting a detailed briefing is a fallacy , " Feinstein said during the conference call , in response to a question from RAW STORY .
( Obama supporter and former presidential candidate John Kerry , who also did not read the NIE , has echoed that argument . )
Vice Admiral Joseph A. Sestak also criticized the NIE as missing some key pieces of the pre-invasion picture of Iraq , and said such problems would n't arise in a Clinton White House because it would be " her people " compiling the report .
" The NIE was flawed , and I think she 's going to bring a whole new sense of accountability , " he said .
Obama focused on his pre-invasion opposition to the war in Iraq during his speech in Chicago , where he was flanked by retired military commanders , and said his judgment went beyond simply giving a speech against the war in 2002 .
He went on to criticize Clinton for suggesting that he was not qualified to be commander in chief , while simultaneously saying John McCain was .
" This is exactly whats wrong with the national security debate in Washington , " Obama said .
" After years of a divisive politics that uses national security as a wedge to drive us apart , how much longer do we have to wait to bring this country together to confront our common enemies ?
After years of being told that Democrats have to talk , act and vote like John McCain to pass some Commander - in - Chief test , how many times do we have to learn that tough talk is not a substitute for sound judgment ? "
Former Air Force Gen. Merrill A. McPeak praised Obama 's ability to stay cool under pressure , calling him " no shock Barack ... no drama Obama . "
McPeak said those qualities were what would be needed in the White House when that " 3 a.m. phone call " came in , a reference to a recent Clinton ad .
Soon after Obama finished touting his credentials , Clinton 's campaign convened former admirals and generals supporting her to rebut his arguments .
" Here 's someone who actually can understand the process , " said Sestak , who praised Clinton 's decision last year to request a Pentagon briefing on its plans for a redeployment of troops from Iraq .
" Amateurs do tactics .
Experts do logistics , " Sestak said during a Clinton campaign conference call Wednesday .
Sestak and other participants in Wednesday 's call said they were very impressed with the Former First lady , who privately discussed the situation in Afghanistan in detail with former generals after a press conference last week .
" She 'll get into detail .
...
She will engage in subordinates and go in and solve the problem , " said Brig .
Gen. John Watkins Jr. Later in the call , Watkins tried to undercut Obama 's war opposition , which came when he was not a member of the US Senate .
" I believe if he'd been there when the debate was taking place to go to war , he probably would 've supported it as well , " Watkins said .

EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE , Florida , Feb. 16 , 2008  --
Strapped into the back seat of an F - 16 fighter jet as it tore through the sky at more than 700 miles an hour , I listened intently to Col.
Bill " Thunder " Thornton , who sat up front , his hands on the controls .
" We are three miles from release , " his voice crackled in my helmet .
Then he asked me how I was holding up .
" Doing good here , " I told him , speaking into the microphone in my oxygen mask as my hands reached for something stable to hold on to .
" You should be watching the bottom of his aircraft , and the weapon should be coming off shortly , " the colonel advised .
Despite a murmur of nausea , my eyes focused intently on the belly of the F - 15E Strike Eagle that was flying just a few feet from our wing tip .
A single bomb hung from the jet 's belly .
" Thunder One , clear to release , " I heard in my headset , recognizing the voice of Maj.
Verun " Stinger " Puri , the commander of this mission and the pilot of the F - 15E .
" Pickle , " he said , using the familiar code word for release , " weapon away . "
As he said it , the 4 - foot - long bomb fell free from the fighter jet , and for a moment it seemed to float in the air .
I strained to follow its path as it flipped itself over and released a set of wings before plunging out of sight .
" Weapon is initiating glide , " said Puri in that calm pilot drone immortalized in the movie " The Right Stuff . "
" It 's started to nose over now , " added Thornton from the front seat .
Fifteen thousand feet below , in the Command Control Center of Eglin Air Force Base , the eyes of the Bomb Development Team were glued to a series of tracking screens .
They were watching a solitary truck sitting somewhere on the base 's 900 - square - mile firing range .
On the roof of the truck sat an orange highway cone : the target .
Smaller Is Better
From my front - row seat in the sky I am witnessing the test of the latest weapon in the arsenal of the U.S. Air Force .
They call it the Small Diameter Bomb , or SDB .
As its name suggests , it is a very small bomb , carrying less than 40 pounds of explosives .
By comparison , the JDAM ( short for Joint Direct Attack Munition ) , the workhorse of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , comes in a variety of sizes , the smallest of which carries 200 pounds of explosives .
Preparation for today 's mission began long before sunrise when a single SDB was rolled out and mounted on the F - 15 .
A few early versions of these new small bombs have been in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan since last November , although only about 14 have been dropped .
This test flight is to check out a new guidance system for this very new weapon , one that is cheaper and — they hope — better .
As the Air Force now sees it , in today 's warfare smaller is better .
With these new Small Diameter Bombs , it hopes to accomplish three things at once : get more weapons on each aircraft ; fire those weapons from much further away than JDAMs allow ; and , critically , with much less explosive inside , aim to strike with surgical precision .
What that last point means is that when the new SDB strikes a target , its blast range is about 50 feet .
Compare that to the impact radius of the smallest JDAM : 100 feet … and the 2,000 - pound JDAM : 175 feet .
To understand why that matters you simply have look at some of the Air Force 's " successful " airstrikes that have had catastrophic consequences .
In one Afghanistan bombing earlier this year , two 2,000 - pound bombs not only killed their targets , they also killed nine innocent civilians in a neighboring house , including four women and four children .
In warfare they call that collateral damage , and it is uncomfortably common .
If numbers are a guide , it is also getting worse :
In 2007 airstrikes by U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan killed nearly 300 civilians , compared to 116 in 2006 .
' Responsible to the Civilian Population
The day before the test flight , I met with Col. Dick Justice , the man in charge of developing Small Diameter Bombs .
As he showed me a model of the very small bomb , he candidly told me that the Air Force cannot afford to ignore the consequences of collateral damage .
" Part of warfare is you have to be responsible to the civilian population , " said Justice .
" We are not at war with a population .
We are not at war with the Iraqi people or the people of Afghanistan .
We are at war with people who are hiding within their communities .
So you have to be very sensitive to the damages that you cause that are not against the intended target . "
In short , the U.S. military has learned that the anger incited when bombs kill innocent civilians plays right into the hands of the insurgents who are always eager to welcome new recruits .
" We are looking to minimize those effects that we do n't intend , " said the colonel .
Even critics of this war say the new SDB is a welcome addition to the Air Force arsenal .
One of them is former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco , now senior military analyst for Human Rights Watch .
" It is not the role of Human Rights Watch to advocate for a weapon or to say ' You know , this is a better way to bomb . '
But clearly it shows that the Air Force is taking the right steps as far as improving civilian protections , " said Garlasco .
" They are recognizing that you do n't want to kill civilians in conflict , that it 's counterproductive for their work and what they need to do .
So absolutely it 's a step in the right direction . "
' Direct Hit ! '
Back on the ground in the Control Center the bomb suddenly came into view on the giant screens .
" 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , " said a voice over the room 's loudspeaker .
" Impact ! "
At that very moment cameras recorded a bright flash and a huge boom .
The bomb hit the orange cone right in the center .
Even though this was a test bomb with just a fuse and no explosives , the cab of the truck was destroyed .
" Direct hit ! " said the voice on the loudspeakers .
" Very nice .
Beautiful .
Rock ' n ' roll ! "
This is exactly what they mean when they talk about a " smart bomb . "
Technology has brought warfare a very long way from those carpet bombs that were dropped randomly from the skies in Vietnam .
From 15,000 feet in the sky and 20 miles away , the computer guidance system steered the SDB to within an inch or two of its target .
" The bomb will go where it is told to go , " said Justice .
But even with staggering advances in technology , a bomb is only as smart as the intelligence the military feeds it .
That means the military has to know precisely where the bad guys are .
And in the guerilla warfare of Iraq and Afghanistan , that is still the hardest part .
Looking Ahead
of Human Rights
Watch says that is why the Air Force cannot afford to get too confident about its new technology .
" Well , historically it 's been problematic , " said Garlasco .
" When you look at what 's gone on in recent conflicts , we 've seen a lot of the high collateral damage when they thought they knew a bad guy was in a place , and either he was n't , or they knew where he was but they did n't really know where the civilians were . "
For all of the investment in technology , Garlasco says the Air Force has to continue to put just as much emphasis on developing better intelligence by working closely with U.S. troops on the ground .
Less than two hours after the jets left , they returned to the airfield at Eglin .
Their part of the mission : accomplished without incident .
While today 's test seemed to go flawlessly , it will take weeks analyze the data .
Meanwhile , the next generation of Small Diameter Bomb is already in early development .
The FLM , or Focused Lethality Munition , will take surgical precision to a new level .
It will be made of hardened plastics that disintegrate on explosion , eliminating the deadly metal fragments , or shrapnel , that causes so much unintended damage and destruction .
Clearly , the Air Force is determined to refine what it believes will be the surgical strike weapon of choice for 21st century warfare .
Girl Succumbs to Cancer After Visit From Inmate Dad Family says it was her dying wish to see her father .
March 28 , 2008  -- A 10 - year - old girl died of brain cancer early this morning , shortly after receiving what her family said was her dying wish -- a visit from her incarcerated father .
" She was holding on to see her father , " Ed Yaeger said of his niece Jayci Yaeger .
Jayci's father , Jason Charles Yaeger , is serving the final year of a five - year sentence for a drug conviction in a minimum security prison camp in South Dakota , a 3 ½ - hour drive from his daughter who was in hospice care in Lincoln , Neb .
Officials , however , had denied Jason Charles Yaeger 's repeated requests for a furlough so he could spend more time with his daughter , who suffered from terminal brain cancer .
Under the supervision of prison officials , Jason Yaeger visited Jayci Wednesday for about 20 minutes -- just days before she died .
" It 's just unfortunate that the visit was cut so short , " Ed Yaeger told ABC News .
The Yaegers are upset with prison officials because Jason Yaeger was not able to be with his daughter when she died .
" He was denied the proper good - bye , " Lori Yaeger , Jayci 's aunt , wrote in an e-mail Thursday .
Jason Charles
Yaeger had pleaded repeatedly with prison officials to honor the bureau 's apparent policy of allowing furloughs and transfers under " extraordinary " circumstances , but was rebuffed time and again , he told ABC News in a telephone interview from prison last week .
In a letter to Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska — dated Feb. 20 and obtained by ABC News — a regional director from the Department of Justice wrote that " although Mr. Yaeger believes his daughter 's severe medical condition constitutes ' extraordinary justification , ' a review of his case reveals this specific request was … reviewed … and denied … because his circumstances were not deemed to rise to the level of extraordinary . "
The congressman had requested information about the denials of the furlough or transfer .
Last week , after ABCNEWS.com published a story on Jayci , the Bureau of Prisons released a statement saying that officials there " have reviewed inmate Yaeger 's request for a compassionate release and have determined his situation does not meet the criteria . "
Jayci , named for her father 's initials , had been fighting for her life since she was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 3 , seven years ago .
But in the last six months , she had taken a severe turn downward .
Doctors declared her condition terminal in October .
Last month , they found they could n't transfer her to a children 's hospital closer to her Lincoln , Neb. , home because they said she would n't survive the trip , Lori Yaeger said .
Jason Charles
Yaeger had been allowed three brief supervised visits since the terminal diagnosis in the fall and the visits had prompted remarkable , if short - lived revivals in Jayci 's condition , she added .
The fourth visit was earlier this week .
" When he came home in February , Jayci was not expected to live through the night , " Lori Yaeger said .
" She improved throughout that whole week .
Jason was allowed to accompany her to get a [ CT ] scan .
He was able to pick her up and put her on the [ examining ] table , '' she said , growing emotional .
" And this little girl who could barely lift an arm wrapped her arms around him and held on . "

Australian engineer Bryan Roberts wants to build a power station in the sky – a cluster of flying windmills soaring 15,000 feet in the air – but is having trouble raising enough money to get the project off the ground .
After 25 years of research , Roberts has designed a helicopter - like rotorcraft to hoist a wind turbine high into the air , where winds are persistent and strong .
The craft , which is powered by its own electricity and can stay aloft for months , feeds electricity to the ground through a cable .
Roberts , a professor of engineering at the University of Technology , Sydney , believes there is enough energy in high - altitude winds to satisfy the world 's demands .
Wind - tunnel data suggests a cluster of 600 flying electric generators , or FEGs , could produce three times as much energy as the United States ' most productive nuclear power plant .
Roberts has teamed up with Sky WindPower , a San Diego startup that is trying to commercialize his invention .
The company has Federal Aviation Administration approval to conduct tests of the technology in the California desert , but needs $ 3 million to build full - size flying generators .
The company is having trouble raising the cash because there is n't likely to be an immediate return on investors ' money .
High - altitude winds could provide a potentially enormous renewable energy source , and scientists like Roberts believe flying windmills could put an end to dependence on fossil fuels .
At 15,000 feet , winds are strong and constant .
On the ground , wind is often unreliable – the biggest problem for ground - based wind turbines .
" For FEGs , the winds are much more persistent than on ground - based machines , " said Roberts .
" That 's part of the benefit , more power and greater concentration . "
Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , said tapping into just 1 percent of the energy produced by high - altitude winds could satisfy a lot of the world 's power needs .
" It 's absurd that all this time we have turned a blind eye to the energy right above our heads , " he said .
" High - altitude wind power represents the most concentrated flux of renewable energy found on Earth . "
At certain locations , the efficiency of a flying generator can be as high as 90 percent , three times higher than its grounded counterpart , according to Sky WindPower .
At this efficiency , FEGs could become the nation 's cheapest source of electricity , with an estimated cost per kilowatt hour of less than 2 cents , about half the price of coal , according to the Power Marketing Association .
Having conducted tests with models , Sky WindPower wants to scale up Roberts ' experiments and produce a commercial - sized flying windmill with four rotors .
The rotorcraft will go into the first layer of the atmosphere , called the troposphere .
Sky WindPower estimates the craft will produce 200 kilowatts per hour of electricity in an area that at ground level would produce none because of a lack of wind .
Since strong high - altitude winds exist in many locations , the company 's hope is to find sites 10 miles by 20 miles in size that are not currently used by commercial planes and turn them into restricted airspaces .
Once in the air , the FEGs ' roll and pitch would be controlled to catch the wind most effectively .
Sky WindPower intends to use GPS technology to maintain the crafts ' vertical and horizontal location to within a few feet .
The craft will be brought to ground once a month or so for maintenance checks .
The project has already received FAA approval and needs only to finalize a test site .
Currently the company favors somewhere in Southern California .
The company declined to be specific , saying it has not yet applied for local permits .
" Our desert test site does not have as good winds as future intended operational sites , " said David Shepard , president of Sky WindPower .
" But starting there will enable us to proceed to more - difficult conditions with less risk . "
However , the company has not yet raised the capital to build the craft .
Shepard said he expected the money would be found .
" We do have reason to expect that we will obtain the funding necessary to carry out our intended demonstration , " he said .
" I have reason to be optimistic . "
Caldeira , whose high - altitude wind energy graphs can be found on Wind SkyPower 's website , said he was disappointed but not surprised the company is having trouble raising money for testing .
" Investors tend not to put money into a project that is risky or wo n't pay within a few years , " he said .
Caldeira said there are lots of obstacles that scare investors : testing , obtaining local permission and quelling fears of possible danger .
" Even if this is a far - out possibility , our society is remiss in not vigorously investigating the potential for high - altitude wind power , " he added .
The lack of initial investors is expected by some economists .
" The high risk of investment is associated in terms of length before you would see a return , " said Stanley Stephenson , an economist for Litigation Economics , an economic and legal consulting firm .
Stephenson said there is also the fear that larger organizations , even oil companies , could enter the market with alternative energy technologies , which makes it more difficult to find investors who are gung - ho for small venture startups .
But Eric Becker , vice president of Trillium Asset Management , a firm that specializes in socially responsible investing , believes that entrepreneurial capital for projects such as Sky WindPower will soon start to flow .
Becker cited EnviroMission , an alternative - energy company in Australia that is building a kilometer - high solar tower .
" It 's as far - fetched as tethered wind turbines and they 've managed to go public and are on the verge of booking orders , " said Becker .
After low - altitude and wind - tunnel testing , Roberts does n't believe his invention is far - fetched at all .
" It has all been properly done in an academic sense .
I 've never had any criticism in the principle , " he said .

Some 1,000 people attended a memorial service at the Mercaz Harav rabbinical seminary Thursday , marking the one - month anniversary of the murderous attack which claimed the lives of eight young men .
Also attending the service were many prominent rabbis of the Religious Zionist Movement , who were not shy about expressing their rage against the government 's policy .
Rabbi Yaakov Shapira , head of the Mercaz Harav yeshiva , chose to explain the attack by saying that " the Torah and the land of Israel are acquired only through agony . "
Former Sephardi chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu called on the government to decree that for every life lost in the attack another yeshiva and township will be formed .
Remembering the fallen .

" Even when we seek revenge , it is important to make one thing clear – the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs .
" The Talmud states that if gentiles rob Israel of silver they will pay it back in gold , and all that is taken will be paid back in folds , but in cases like these there is nothing to pay back , since as I said – the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs , " added Rabbi Eliyahu .
Ramat Gan 's chief rabbi , Yaacov Ariel , chose to deliver a more moderate message : " We do not seek vengeance , we seek retaliation .
The terrorist 's house should have been demolished immediately , regardless of the law .
It should have been done because it was a matter of life and death – the deterrence could help save future lives . "
" We are against killing innocent people or harming children , " he added , " but once terrorists hide behind children , we have to strike back .
The blood of those living in Sderot is worth just as much as the blood of those the terrorists hide behind . "
Mercaz Harav will be holding a vigil in memory of those killed in the attack all through Thursday night .

Shop Class as Soulcraft
Matthew B. Crawford
Anyone in the market for a good used machine tool should talk to Noel Dempsey , a dealer in Richmond , Virginia .
Noel ’s bustling warehouse is full of metal lathes , milling machines , and table saws , and it turns out that most of it is from schools .
EBay is awash in such equipment , also from schools .
It appears shop class is becoming a thing of the past , as educators prepare students to become “ knowledge workers . ”
At the same time , an engineering culture has developed in recent years in which the object is to “ hide the works , ” rendering the artifacts we use unintelligible to direct inspection .
Lift the hood on some cars now ( especially German ones ) , and the engine appears a bit like the shimmering , featureless obelisk that so enthralled the cavemen in the opening scene of the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Essentially , there is another hood under the hood .
This creeping concealedness takes various forms .
The fasteners holding small appliances together now often require esoteric screwdrivers not commonly available , apparently to prevent the curious or the angry from interrogating the innards .
By way of contrast , older readers will recall that until recent decades , Sears catalogues included blown - up parts diagrams and conceptual schematics for all appliances and many other mechanical goods .
It was simply taken for granted that such information would be demanded by the consumer .
A decline in tool use would seem to betoken a shift in our mode of inhabiting the world : more passive and more dependent .
And indeed , there are fewer occasions for the kind of spiritedness that is called forth when we take things in hand for ourselves , whether to fix them or to make them .
What ordinary people once made , they buy ; and what they once fixed for themselves , they replace entirely or hire an expert to repair , whose expert fix often involves installing a pre-made replacement part .
So perhaps the time is ripe for reconsideration of an ideal that has fallen out of favor : manual competence , and the stance it entails toward the built , material world .
Neither as workers nor as consumers are we much called upon to exercise such competence , most of us anyway , and merely to recommend its cultivation is to risk the scorn of those who take themselves to be the most hard - headed : the hard - headed economist will point out the opportunity costs of making what can be bought , and the hard - headed educator will say that it is irresponsible to educate the young for the trades , which are somehow identified as the jobs of the past .
But we might pause to consider just how hard - headed these presumptions are , and whether they do n’t , on the contrary , issue from a peculiar sort of idealism , one that insistently steers young people toward the most ghostly kinds of work .
Judging from my admittedly cursory survey , articles began to appear in vocational education journals around 1985 with titles such as “ The Soaring Technology Revolution ” and “ Preparing Kids for High - Tech and the Global Future . ”
Of course , there is nothing new about American future - ism .
What is new is the wedding of future - ism to what might be called “ virtualism ” : a vision of the future in which we somehow take leave of material reality and glide about in a pure information economy .
New and yet not so new — for fifty years now we ’ve been assured that we are headed for a “ post - industrial economy . ”
While manufacturing jobs have certainly left our shores to a disturbing degree , the manual trades have not .
If you need a deck built , or your car fixed , the Chinese are of no help .
Because they are in China .
And in fact there are reported labor shortages in both construction and auto repair .
Yet the trades and manufacturing are lumped together in the mind of the pundit class as “ blue collar , ” and their requiem is intoned .
Even so , the Wall Street Journal recently wondered whether “ skilled [ manual ] labor is becoming one of the few sure paths to a good living . ”
This possibility was brought to light for many by the bestseller The Millionaire Next Door , which revealed that the typical millionaire is the guy driving a pickup , with his own business in the trades .
My real concern here is not with the economics of skilled manual work , but rather with its intrinsic satisfactions .
I mention these economic rumors only to raise a suspicion against the widespread prejudice that such work is somehow not viable as a livelihood .
The Psychic Appeal of Manual Work
I began working as an electrician ’s helper at age fourteen , and started a small electrical contracting business after college , in Santa Barbara .
In those years I never ceased to take pleasure in the moment , at the end of a job , when I would flip the switch .
“ And there was light . ”
It was an experience of agency and competence .
The effects of my work were visible for all to see , so my competence was real for others as well ; it had a social currency .
The well - founded pride of the tradesman is far from the gratuitous “ self - esteem ” that educators would impart to students , as though by magic .
I was sometimes quieted at the sight of a gang of conduit entering a large panel in a commercial setting , bent into nestled , flowing curves , with varying offsets , that somehow all terminated in the same plane .
This was a skill so far beyond my abilities that I felt I was in the presence of some genius , and the man who bent that conduit surely imagined this moment of recognition as he worked .
As a residential electrician , most of my work got covered up inside walls .
Yet even so , there is pride in meeting the aesthetic demands of a workmanlike installation .
Maybe another electrician will see it someday .
Even if not , one feels responsible to one ’s better self .
Or rather , to the thing itself — craftsmanship might be defined simply as the desire to do something well , for its own sake .
If the primary satisfaction is intrinsic and private in this way , there is nonetheless a sort of self - disclosing that takes place .
As Alexandre Kojève writes :
The man who works recognizes his own product in the World that has actually been transformed by his work : he recognizes himself in it , he sees in it his own human reality , in it he discovers and reveals to others the objective reality of his humanity , of the originally abstract and purely subjective idea he has of himself .
The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy .
They seem to relieve him of the felt need to offer chattering interpretations of himself to vindicate his worth .
He can simply point : the building stands , the car now runs , the lights are on .
Boasting is what a boy does , who has no real effect in the world .
But craftsmanship must reckon with the infallible judgment of reality , where one ’s failures or shortcomings cannot be interpreted away .
Hobbyists will tell you that making one ’s own furniture is hard to justify economically .
And yet they persist .
Shared memories attach to the material souvenirs of our lives , and producing them is a kind of communion , with others and with the future .
Finding myself at loose ends one summer in Berkeley , I built a mahogany coffee table on which I spared no expense of effort .
At that time I had no immediate prospect of becoming a father , yet I imagined a child who would form indelible impressions of this table and know that it was his father ’s work .
I imagined the table fading into the background of a future life , the defects in its execution as well as inevitable stains and scars becoming a surface textured enough that memory and sentiment might cling to it , in unnoticed accretions .
More fundamentally , the durable objects of use produced by men “ give rise to the familiarity of the world , its customs and habits of intercourse between men and things as well as between men and men , ” as Hannah Arendt says .
“ The reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on the fact that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by which they were produced , and potentially even more permanent than the lives of their authors . ”
Because craftsmanship refers to objective standards that do not issue from the self and its desires , it poses a challenge to the ethic of consumerism , as the sociologist Richard Sennett has recently argued .
The craftsman is proud of what he has made , and cherishes it , while the consumer discards things that are perfectly serviceable in his restless pursuit of the new .
The craftsman is then more possessive , more tied to what is present , the dead incarnation of past labor ; the consumer is more free , more imaginative , and so more valorous according to those who would sell us things .
Being able to think materially about material goods , hence critically , gives one some independence from the manipulations of marketing , which typically divert attention from what a thing is to a back - story intimated through associations , the point of which is to exaggerate minor differences between brands .
Knowing the production narrative , or at least being able to plausibly imagine it , renders the social narrative of the advertisement less potent .
The tradesman has an impoverished fantasy life compared to the ideal consumer ; he is more utilitarian and less given to soaring hopes .
But he is also more autonomous .
This would seem to be significant for any political typology .
Political theorists from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson have questioned the republican virtue of the mechanic , finding him too narrow in his concerns to be moved by the public good .
Yet this assessment was made before the full flowering of mass communication and mass conformity , which pose a different set of problems for the republican character : enervation of judgment and erosion of the independent spirit .
Since the standards of craftsmanship issue from the logic of things rather than the art of persuasion , practiced submission to them perhaps gives the craftsman some psychic ground to stand on against fantastic hopes aroused by demagogues , whether commercial or political .
The craftsman ’s habitual deference is not toward the New , but toward the distinction between the Right Way and the Wrong Way .
However narrow in its application , this is a rare appearance in contemporary life — a disinterested , articulable , and publicly affirmable idea of the good .
Such a strong ontology is somewhat at odds with the cutting - edge institutions of the new capitalism , and with the educational regime that aims to supply those institutions with suitable workers — pliable generalists unfettered by any single set of skills .
Today , in our schools , the manual trades are given little honor .
The egalitarian worry that has always attended tracking students into “ college prep ” and “ vocational ed ” is overlaid with another : the fear that acquiring a specific skill set means that one ’s life is determined .
In college , by contrast , many students do n’t learn anything of particular application ; college is the ticket to an open future .
Craftsmanship entails learning to do one thing really well , while the ideal of the new economy is to be able to learn new things , celebrating potential rather than achievement .
Somehow , every worker in the cutting - edge workplace is now supposed to act like an “ intrapreneur , ” that is , to be actively involved in the continuous redefinition of his own job .
Shop class presents an image of stasis that runs directly counter to what Richard Sennett identifies as “ a key element in the new economy ’s idealized self : the capacity to surrender , to give up possession of an established reality . ”
This stance toward “ established reality , ” which can only be called psychedelic , is best not indulged around a table saw .
It is dissatisfied with what Arendt calls the “ reality and reliability ” of the world .
It is a strange sort of ideal , attractive only to a peculiar sort of self — gratuitous ontological insecurity is no fun for most people .
As Sennett argues , most people take pride in being good at something specific , which happens through the accumulation of experience .
Yet the flitting disposition is pressed upon workers from above by the current generation of management revolutionaries , for whom the ethic of craftsmanship is actually something to be rooted out from the workforce .
Craftsmanship means dwelling on a task for a long time and going deeply into it , because one wants to get it right .
In management - speak , this is called being “ ingrown . ”
The preferred role model is the management consultant , who swoops in and out , and whose very pride lies in his lack of particular expertise .
Like the ideal consumer , the management consultant presents an image of soaring freedom , in light of which the manual trades appear cramped and paltry .
The Cognitive Demands of Manual Work
In The Mind at Work , Mike Rose provides “ cognitive biographies ” of several trades , and depicts the learning process in a wood shop class .
He writes that “ our testaments to physical work are so often focused on the values such work exhibits rather than on the thought it requires .
It is a subtle but pervasive omission ....
It is as though in our cultural iconography we are given the muscled arm , sleeve rolled tight against biceps , but no thought bright behind the eye , no image that links hand and brain . ”
Skilled manual labor entails a systematic encounter with the material world , precisely the kind of encounter that gives rise to natural science .
From its earliest practice , craft knowledge has entailed knowledge of the “ ways ” of one ’s materials — that is , knowledge of their nature , acquired through disciplined perception and a systematic approach to problems .
And in fact , in areas of well - developed craft , technological developments typically preceded and gave rise to advances in scientific understanding , not vice versa .
The steam engine is a good example .
It was developed by mechanics who observed the relations between volume , pressure , and temperature .
This at a time when theoretical scientists were tied to the caloric theory of heat , which later turned out to be a conceptual dead end .
The success of the steam engine contributed to the development of what we now call classical thermodynamics .
This history provides a nice illustration of a point made by Aristotle :
Lack of experience diminishes our power of taking a comprehensive view of the admitted facts .
Hence those who dwell in intimate association with nature and its phenomena are more able to lay down principles such as to admit of a wide and coherent development ; while those whom devotion to abstract discussions has rendered unobservant of facts are too ready to dogmatize on the basis of a few observations .
Another example is the Vernier scale used on machinists ’ calipers and micrometers .
Invented in 1631 , it is a sort of mechanical calculus that renders continuous measurement in discrete digital approximation to four decimal places .
Such inventions capture a reflective moment in which some skilled worker has made explicit the assumptions that are implicit in his manual skill .
In what has to be the best article ever published in an education journal , the cognitive scientists Mike Eisenberg and Ann Nishioka Eisenberg give real pedagogical force to this reflective moment , and draw out its theoretical implications ( “ Shop Class for the Next Millennium : Education Through Computer - Enriched Handicrafts , ” in the Journal of Interactive Media in Education ) .
They offer a computer program to facilitate making origami , or rather Archimedean solids , by unfolding these solids into two dimensions .
But they then have their students actually make the solids , out of paper cut according to the computer ’s instructions .
“ Computational tools for crafting are entities poised somewhere between the abstract , untouchable world of software objects and the homey constraints of human dexterity ; they are therefore creative exercises in making conscious those aspects of craft work ... that are often more easily represented ‘ in the hand ’ than in language . ”
It is worth pausing to consider their efforts , as they have implications well beyond mathematics instruction .
In our early work with HyperGami , we often ran into situations in which the program provided us with a folding net that was mathematically correct — i.e. , a technically correct unfolding of the desired solid — but otherwise disastrous .
Figure 7 shows an example .
Here , we are trying to create an approximation to a cone — a pyramid on a regular octagonal base .
HyperGami provides us with a folding net that will , indeed , produce a pyramid ; but typically , no paper crafter would come up with a net of this sort , since it is fiendishly hard to join together those eight tall triangles into a single vertex .
In fact , this is an illustrative example of a more general idea — the difficulty of formalizing , in purely mathematical terms , what it means to produce a ‘ realistic ’ ( and not merely technically correct ) solution to an algorithmic problem derived from human practice .
I take their point to be that the crafting problem is in fact not reducible to an algorithmic problem .
More precisely , any algorithmic solution to the crafting problem cannot itself be generated algorithmically , as it must include ad hoc constraints known only through practice , that is , through embodied manipulations .
Those constraints cannot be arrived at deductively , starting from mathematical entities .
It is worth noting in passing that this has implications for the theory of mind favored by artificial intelligence researchers , as it speaks to the “ computability ” of pragmatic cognition .
It would be a task for cognitive science to determine if these considerations place a theoretical limit on the automation of work , but I can speak firsthand to how one area of work is resistant to algorithmic thinking .
Following graduate school in Chicago , I took a job in a Washington , D.C. think tank .
I hated it , so I left and opened a motorcycle repair shop in Richmond .
When I would come home from work , my wife would sniff at me and say “ carbs ” or “ brakes , ” corresponding to the various solvents used .
Leaving a sensible trace , my day was at least imaginable to her .
But while the filth and odors were apparent , the amount of head - scratching I ’d done since breakfast was not .
Mike Rose writes that in the practice of surgery , “ dichotomies such as concrete versus abstract and technique versus reflection break down in practice .
The surgeon ’s judgment is simultaneously technical and deliberative , and that mix is the source of its power . ”
This could be said of any manual skill that is diagnostic , including motorcycle repair .
You come up with an imagined train of causes for manifest symptoms and judge their likelihood before tearing anything down .
This imagining relies on a stock mental library , not of natural kinds or structures , like that of the surgeon , but rather the functional kinds of an internal combustion engine , their various interpretations by different manufacturers , and their proclivities for failure .
You also develop a library of sounds and smells and feels .
For example , the backfire of a too - lean fuel mixture is subtly different from an ignition backfire .
If the motorcycle is thirty years old , from an obscure maker that went out of business twenty years ago , its proclivities are known mostly through lore .
It would probably be impossible to do such work in isolation , without access to a collective historical memory ; you have to be embedded in a community of mechanic - antiquarians .
These relationships are maintained by telephone , in a network of reciprocal favors that spans the country .
My most reliable source , Fred Cousins in Chicago , had such an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure European motorcycles that all I could offer him in exchange was regular shipments of obscure European beer .
There is always a risk of introducing new complications when working on decrepit machines , and this enters the diagnostic logic .
Measured in likelihood of screw - ups , the cost is not identical for all avenues of inquiry when deciding which hypothesis to pursue .
For example , the fasteners holding the engine covers on 1970s - era Hondas are Phillips - head , and they are always stripped and corroded .
Do you really want to check the condition of the starter clutch , if each of ten screws will need to be drilled out and extracted , risking damage to the engine case ?
Such impediments can cloud one ’s thinking .
Put more neutrally , the attractiveness of any hypothesis is determined in part by physical circumstances that have no logical connection to the diagnostic problem at hand , but a strong pragmatic bearing on it ( kind of like origami ) .
The factory service manuals tell you to be systematic in eliminating variables , but they never take such factors into account .
So you have to develop your own decision tree for the particular circumstances .
The problem is that at each node of this new tree , your own , unquantifiable risk aversion introduces ambiguity .
There comes a point where you have to step back and get a larger gestalt .
Have a cigarette and walk around the lift .
Any mechanic will tell you that it is invaluable to have other mechanics around to test your reasoning against , especially if they have a different intellectual disposition .
My shop -mate Tommy Van Auken was an accomplished visual artist , and I was repeatedly struck by his ability to literally see things that escaped me .
I had the conceit of a being an empiricist , but seeing things is not a simple matter .
Even on the relatively primitive vintage bikes that were our specialty , some diagnostic situations contain so many variables , and symptoms can be so under - determining of causes , that explicit analytical reasoning comes up short .
What is required then is the kind of judgment that arises only from experience ; hunches rather than rules .
There was more thinking going on in the bike shop than in the think tank .
Socially , being the proprietor of a bike shop in a small city gave me a feeling I never had before .
I felt I had a place in society .
Whereas “ think tank ” is an answer that , at best , buys you a few seconds when someone asks what you do , while you try to figure out what it is that you in fact do , with “ motorcycle mechanic ” I got immediate recognition .
I bartered services with machinists and metal fabricators , which has a very different feel than transactions with money , and further increased my sense of social embeddedness .
There were three restaurants with cooks whose bikes I had restored , where unless I deceive myself I was treated as a sage benefactor .
I felt pride before my wife when we would go out to dinner and be given preferential treatment , or simply a hearty greeting .
There were group rides , and bike night every Tuesday at a certain bar .
Sometimes one or two people would be wearing my shop ’s T - shirt .
It felt good .
Given the intrinsic richness of manual work , cognitively , socially , and in its broader psychic appeal , the question becomes why it has suffered such a devaluation in recent years as a component of education .
The economic rationale so often offered , namely that manual work is somehow going to disappear , is questionable if not preposterous , so it is in the murky realm of culture that we must look to understand these things .
To this end , perhaps we need to consider the origins of shop class , so that we can better understand its demise .
Arts , Crafts , and the Assembly Line
At a time when Teddy Roosevelt preached the strenuous life and elites worried about their state of “ over - civilized ” spiritual decay , the project of getting back in touch with “ real life ” took various forms .
One was romantic fantasy about the pre-modern craftsman .
This was understandable given changes in the world of work at the turn of the century , a time when the bureaucratization of economic life was rapidly increasing the number of paper shufflers .
The tangible elements of craft were appealing as an antidote to vague feelings of unreality , diminished autonomy , and a fragmented sense of self that were especially acute among the professional classes .
The Arts and Crafts movement thus fit easily with the new therapeutic ethic of self - regeneration .
Depleted from his workweek in the corporate world , the office worker repaired to his basement workshop to putter about and tinker , refreshing himself for the following week .
As T. J. Jackson Lears writes in his history of the Progressive era , No Place of Grace , “ toward the end of the nineteenth century , many beneficiaries of modern culture began to feel they were its secret victims . ”
Various forms of antimodernism gained wide currency in the middle and upper classes , including the ethic of craftsmanship .
Some Arts and Crafts enthusiasts conceived their task to be evangelizing good taste as embodied in the works of craft , as against machine - age vulgarity .
Cultivating an appreciation for objets d’art was thus a form of protest against modernity , with a view to providing a livelihood to dissident craftsmen .
But it dovetailed with , and gave a higher urgency to , the nascent culture of luxury consumption .
As Lears tells the story , the great irony is that antimodernist sentiments of aesthetic revolt against the machine paved the way for certain unattractive features of late - modern culture : therapeutic self - absorption and the hankering after “ authenticity , ” precisely those psychic hooks now relied upon by advertisers .
Such spiritualized , symbolic modes of craft practice and craft consumption represented a kind of compensation for , and therefore an accommodation to , new modes of routinized , bureaucratic work .
But not everyone worked in an office .
Indeed , there was class conflict brewing , with unassimilated immigrants accumulating in America ’s Eastern cities and serious labor violence in Chicago and elsewhere .
To the upper classes of those same cities , enamored of the craft ideal , the possibility presented itself that the laboring classes might remain satisfied with their material lot if they found joy in their labor .
Shop class could serve to put the proper spin on manual work .
Any work , it was posited , could be “ artful ” if done in the proper spirit ; somehow a movement that had started with reverence for the craftsman now offered an apologetic for factory work .
As Lears writes , “ By shifting their attention from the conditions of labor to the laborer ’s frame of mind , craft ideologues could acclaim the value of any work , however monotonous . ”
The Smith - Hughes Act of 1917 gave federal funding for manual training in two forms : as part of general education and as a separate vocational program .
The invention of modern shop class thus serviced both cultural reflexes of the Arts and Crafts movement at once .
The children of the managerial class could take shop as enrichment to the college - prep curriculum , making a bird - feeder to hang outside mom ’s kitchen window , while the children of laborers would be socialized into the work ethic appropriate to their station through what was now called “ industrial arts ” education .
The need for such socialization was not simply a matter of assimilating immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe who lacked a Protestant work ethic .
It was recognized as a necessity for the broader working - class population , precisely because the institutions that had previously served this socializing function , apprenticeship and guild traditions , had been destroyed by new modes of labor .
Writing in 1918 , one Robert Hoxie worried thus :
It is evident ... that the native efficiency of the working class must suffer from the neglect of apprenticeship , if no other means of industrial education is forthcoming .
Scientific managers , themselves , have complained bitterly of the poor and lawless material from which they must recruit their workers , compared with the efficient and self - respecting craftsmen who applied for employment twenty years ago .
Needless to say , “ scientific managers ” were concerned more with the “ efficient ” part of this formula than with the “ self - respecting ” part , yet the two are not independent .
The quandary was how to make workers efficient and attentive , when their actual labor had been degraded by automation .
The motivation previously supplied by the intrinsic satisfactions of manual work was to be replaced with ideology ; industrial arts education now concerned itself with moral formation .
Lears writes that “ American craft publicists , by treating craftsmanship ... as an agent of socialization , abandoned [ the ] effort to revive pleasurable labor .
Manual training meant specialized assembly line preparation for the lower classes and educational or recreational experiences for the bourgeoisie . ”
Of the Smith - Hughes Act ’s two rationales for shop class , vocational and general ed , only the latter emphasized the learning of aesthetic , mathematical , and physical principles through the manipulation of material things ( Dewey ’s “ learning by doing ” ) .
It is not surprising , then , that the act came four years after Henry Ford ’s innovation of the assembly line .
The act ’s dual educational scheme mirrored the assembly line ’s severing of the cognitive aspects of manual work from its physical execution .
Such a partition of thinking from doing has bequeathed us the dichotomy of “ white collar ” versus “ blue collar , ” corresponding to mental versus manual .
These seem to be the categories that inform the educational landscape even now , and this entails two big errors .
First , it assumes that all blue collar work is as mindless as assembly line work , and second , that white collar work is still recognizably mental in character .
Yet there is evidence to suggest that the new frontier of capitalism lies in doing to office work what was previously done to factory work : draining it of its cognitive elements .
Paradoxically , educators who would steer students toward cognitively rich work options might do this best by rehabilitating the manual trades , based on a firmer grasp of what such work is really like .
And would this not be in keeping with their democratic mission ?
Let them publicly honor those who gain real craft knowledge , the sort we all depend on every day .
The Degradation of Blue - Collar Work
The degradation of work in the last century is often tied to the evils of technology in one way or another .
And it is certainly true that “ technical progress has multiplied the number of simplified jobs , ” as one French sociologist wrote in the 1950s .
This writer pointed out a resemblance between the Soviet bloc and the Western bloc with regard to work ; both rival civilizations were developing “ that separation between planning and execution which seems to be in our day a common denominator linking all industrial societies together . ”
Yet while technology plays a role in facilitating this separation of planning and execution , the basic logic that drives the separation rests not on technological progress , but rather on a certain mode of economic relations , as Harry Braverman has shown in his masterpiece of economic reflection , Labor and Monopoly Capital : The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century .
Braverman was an avowed Marxist , writing in 1974 .
With the Cold War now safely decided , we may consider anew , without defensive ire , the Marxian account of alienated labor .
Braverman gives a richly descriptive account of the degradation of many different kinds of work .
In doing so , he offers nothing less than an explanation of why we are getting more stupid with every passing year — which is to say , the degradation of work is ultimately a cognitive matter .
The central culprit in Braverman ’s account is “ scientific management , ” which “ enters the workplace not as the representative of science , but as the representative of management masquerading in the trappings of science . ”
The tenets of scientific management were given their first and frankest articulation by Frederick Winslow Taylor , an unembarrassed evangelist of efficiency whose Principles of Scientific Management was hugely influential in the early decades of the twentieth century .
Stalin was a big fan , as were the founders of the first MBA program , at Harvard , where Taylor was invited to lecture annually .
Taylor writes ,
“ The managers assume ... the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying , tabulating , and reducing this knowledge to rules , laws , and formulae . ”
Scattered craft knowledge is concentrated in the hands of the employer , then doled out again to workers in the form of minute instructions needed to perform some part of what is now a work process .
This process replaces what was previously an integral activity , rooted in craft tradition and experience , animated by the worker ’s own mental image of , and intention toward , the finished product .
Thus , according to Taylor , “ All possible brain work should be removed from the shop and centered in the planning or lay - out department . ”
It is a mistake to suppose that the primary purpose of this partition is to render the work process more efficient .
It may or may not result in extracting more value from a given unit of labor time .
The concern is rather with labor cost .
Once the cognitive aspects of the job are located in a separate management class , or better yet in a process that , once designed , requires no ongoing judgment or deliberation , skilled workers can be replaced with unskilled workers at a lower rate of pay .
Taylor writes that the “ full possibilities ” of his system “ will not have been realized until almost all of the machines in the shop are run by men who are of smaller caliber and attainments , and who are therefore cheaper than those required under the old system . ”
What becomes of the skilled workers ?
They go elsewhere , of course .
But the competitive labor - cost advantage now held by the more modern firm , which has aggressively separated planning from execution , compels the whole industry to follow the same route , and entire skilled trades disappear .
Thus craft knowledge dies out , or rather gets instantiated in a different form , as process engineering knowledge .
The conception of the work is remote from the worker who does it .
Scientific management introduced the use of “ time and motion analysis ” to describe the physiological capabilities of the human body in machine terms .
As Braverman writes , “ the more labor is governed by classified motions which extend across the boundaries of trades and occupations , the more it dissolves its concrete forms into the general types of work motions .
This mechanical exercise of human faculties according to motion types which are studied independently of the particular kind of work being done , brings to life the Marxist conception of ‘ abstract labor . ’ ”
The clearest example of abstract labor is thus the assembly line .
The activity ( in the Aristotelian sense ) of self - directed labor , conducted by the worker , is dissolved into abstract parts and then reconstituted as a process controlled by management .
At the turn of the last century , the manufacture of automobiles was done by craftsmen recruited from bicycle and carriage shops : all - around mechanics who knew what they were doing .
In The Wheelwright ’s Shop , George Sturt relates his experience in taking over his family business of making wheels for carriages , in 1884 , shortly before the advent of the automobile .
He had been a school teacher with literary ambitions , but now finds himself almost overwhelmed by the cognitive demands of his new trade .
In Sturt ’s shop , working exclusively with hand tools , the skills required to build a wheel regress all the way to the selection of trees to fell for timber , the proper time for felling them , how to season them , and so forth .
To select but one minor task out of the countless he describes , here is Sturt ’s account of fabricating a part of a wheel ’s rim called a felloe :
Yet it is in vain to go into details at this point ; for when the simple apparatus had all been gotten together for one simple - looking process , a never - ending series of variations was introduced by the material .
What though two felloes might seem much alike when finished ?
It was the wheelwright himself who had to make them so .
He it was who hewed out that resemblance from quite dissimilar blocks , for no two felloe - blocks were ever alike .
Knots here , shakes there , rind - galls , waney edges ( edges with more or less bark in them ) , thicknesses , thinnesses , were for ever affording new chances or forbidding previous solutions , whereby a fresh problem confronted the workman ’s ingenuity every few minutes .
He had no band - saw ( as now [ 1923 ] ) to drive , with ruthless unintelligence , through every resistance .
The timber was far from being prey , a helpless victim , to a machine .
Rather it would lend its own special virtues to the man who knew how to humour it .
Given their likely acquaintance with such a cognitively rich world of work , it is hardly surprising that when Henry Ford introduced the assembly line in 1913 , workers simply walked out .
One of Ford ’s biographers wrote , “ So great was labor ’s distaste for the new machine system that toward the close of 1913 every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel , it was necessary to hire 963 . ”
This would seem to be a crucial moment in the history of political economy .
Evidently , the new system provoked natural revulsion .
Yet , at some point , workers became habituated to it .
How did this happen ?
One might be tempted to inquire in a typological mode :
What sort of men were these first , the 100 out of 963 who stuck it out on the new assembly line ?
Perhaps it was the men who felt less revulsion because they had less pride in their own powers , and were therefore more tractable .
Less republican , we might say .
But if there was initially such a self - selection process , it quickly gave way to something less deliberate , more systemic .
In a temporary suspension of the Taylorist logic , Ford was forced to double the daily wage of his workers to keep the line staffed .
As Braverman writes , this “ opened up new possibilities for the intensification of labor within the plants , where workers were now anxious to keep their jobs . ”
These anxious workers were more productive .
Indeed ,
Ford himself later recognized his wage increase as “ one of the finest cost - cutting moves we ever made , ” as he was able to double , and then triple , the rate at which cars were assembled by simply speeding up the conveyors .
By doing so he destroyed his competitors , and thereby destroyed the possibility of an alternative way of working .
( It also removed the wage pressure that comes from the existence of more enjoyable jobs . )
At the Columbian World Expo held in Chicago in 1893 , no fewer than seven large - scale carriage builders from Cincinnati alone presented their wares .
Adopting Ford ’s methods , the industry would soon be reduced to the Big Three .
So workers eventually became habituated to the abstraction of the assembly line .
Evidently , it inspires revulsion only if one is acquainted with more satisfying modes of work .
Here the concept of wages as compensation achieves its fullest meaning , and its central place in modern economy .
Changing attitudes toward consumption seemed to play a role .
A man whose needs are limited will find the least noxious livelihood and work in a subsistence mode , and indeed the experience of early ( eighteenth - century ) capitalism , when many producers worked at home on a piece - rate basis , was that only so much labor could be extracted from them .
Contradicting the assumptions of “ rational behavior ” of classical economics , it was found that when employers would increase the piece rate in order to boost production , it actually had the opposite effect : workers would produce less , as now they could meet their fixed needs with less work .
Eventually it was learned that the only way to get them to work harder was to play upon the imagination , stimulating new needs and wants .
The habituation of workers to the assembly line was thus perhaps made easier by another innovation of the early twentieth century : consumer debt .
As Jackson Lears has shown in a recent article , through the installment plan , previously unthinkable acquisitions became thinkable , and more than thinkable : it became normal to carry debt .
The display of a new car bought on installment became a sign that one was trustworthy .
In a wholesale transformation of the old Puritan moralism , expressed by Benjamin Franklin ( admittedly no Puritan ) with the motto “ Be frugal and free , ” the early twentieth century saw the moral legitimation of spending .
Indeed , 1907 saw the publication of a book with the immodest title The New Basis of Civilization , by Simon Nelson Patten , in which the moral valence of debt and spending is reversed , and the multiplication of wants becomes not a sign of dangerous corruption but part of the civilizing process .
That is , part of the disciplinary process .
As Lears writes , “ Indebtedness could discipline workers , keeping them at routinized jobs in factories and offices , graying but in harness , meeting payments regularly . ”
The Degradation of White - Collar Work
Much of the “ jobs of the future ” rhetoric surrounding the eagerness to end shop class and get every warm body into college , thence into a cubicle , implicitly assumes that we are heading to a “ post - industrial ” economy in which everyone will deal only in abstractions .
Yet trafficking in abstractions is not the same as thinking .
White collar professions , too , are subject to routinization and degradation , proceeding by the same process as befell manual fabrication a hundred years ago : the cognitive elements of the job are appropriated from professionals , instantiated in a system or process , and then handed back to a new class of workers — clerks — who replace the professionals .
If genuine knowledge work is not growing but actually shrinking , because it is coming to be concentrated in an ever - smaller elite , this has implications for the vocational advice that students ought to receive .
“ Expert systems , ” a term coined by artificial intelligence researchers , were initially developed by the military for battle command , then used to replicate industrial expertise in such fields as oil - well drilling and telephone - line maintenance .
Then they found their way into medical diagnosis , and eventually the cognitively murky , highly lucrative , regions of financial and legal advice .
In The Electronic Sweatshop : How Computers are Transforming the Office of the Future into the Factory of the Past , Barbara Garson details how “ Extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate the need for human ingenuity . ”
She finds that , like Taylor ’s rationalization of the shop floor , the intention of expert systems is “ to transfer knowledge , skill , and decision making from employee to employer . ”
While Taylor ’s time and motion studies broke every concrete work motion into minute parts ,
The modern knowledge engineer performs similar detailed studies , only he anatomizes decision making rather than bricklaying .
So the time - and - motion study has become a time - and - thought study ....
To build an expert system , a living expert is debriefed and then cloned by a knowledge engineer .
That is to say , an expert is interviewed , typically for weeks or months .
The knowledge engineer watches the expert work on sample problems and asks exactly what factors the expert considered in making his apparently intuitive decisions .
Eventually hundreds or thousands of rules of thumb are fed into the computer .
The result is a program that can ‘ make decisions ’ or ‘ draw conclusions ’ heuristically instead of merely calculating with equations .
Like a real expert , a sophisticated expert system should be able to draw inferences from ‘ iffy ’ or incomplete data that seems to suggest or tends to rule out .
In other words it uses ( or replaces ) judgment .
The human expert who is cloned achieves a vast dominion and immortality , in a sense .
It is other experts , and future experts , who are displaced as expertise is centralized .
“ This means that more people in the advice or human service business will be employed as the disseminators , rather than the originators , of this advice , ” Garson writes .
In his 2006 book The Culture of the New Capitalism , Richard Sennett describes just such a process , “ especially in the cutting - edge realms of high finance , advanced technology , and sophisticated services ” : genuine knowledge work comes to be concentrated in an ever - smaller elite .
It seems we must take a cold - eyed view of “ knowledge work , ” and reject the image of a rising sea of pure mentation that lifts all boats .
More likely is a rising sea of clerkdom .
To expect otherwise is to hope for a reversal in the basic logic of the modern economy — that is , cognitive stratification .
It is not clear to me what this hope could be based on , though if history is any guide we have to wonder whether the excitation of such a hope has become an instrument by which young people are prepared for clerkdom , in the same perverse way that the craft ideology prepared workers for the assembly line .
Both provide a lens that makes the work look appealing from afar , but only by presenting an image that is upside down .
The Craftsman as Stoic
We are recalled to the basic antagonism of economic life : work is toilsome and necessarily serves someone else ’s interests .
That ’s why you get paid .
Thus chastened , we may ask the proper question : what is it that we really want for a young person when we give them vocational advice ?
The only creditable answer , it seems to me , is one that avoids utopianism while keeping an eye on the human good : work that engages the human capacities as fully as possible .
What I have tried to show is that this humane and commonsensical answer goes against the central imperative of capitalism , which assiduously partitions thinking from doing .
What is to be done ?
I offer no program , only an observation that might be of interest to anyone called upon to give guidance to the young .
Since manual work has been subject to routinization for over a century , the nonroutinized manual work that remains , outside the confines of the factory , would seem to be resistant to much further routinization .
There still appear developments around the margins ; for example , in the last twenty years pre-fabricated roof trusses have eliminated some of the more challenging elements from the jobs of framers who work for large tract developers , and pre-hung doors have done the same for finish carpenters generally .
But still , the physical circumstances of the jobs performed by carpenters , plumbers , and auto mechanics vary too much for them to be executed by idiots ; they require circumspection and adaptability .
One feels like a man , not a cog in a machine .
The trades are then a natural home for anyone who would live by his own powers , free not only of deadening abstraction , but also of the insidious hopes and rising insecurities that seem to be endemic in our current economic life .
This is the stoic ideal .
So what advice should one give to a young person ?
By all means , go to college .
In fact , approach college in the spirit of craftsmanship , going deep into liberal arts and sciences .
In the summers , learn a manual trade .
You ’re likely to be less damaged , and quite possibly better paid , as an independent tradesman than as a cubicle - dwelling tender of information systems .
To heed such advice would require a certain contrarian streak , as it entails rejecting a life course mapped out by others as obligatory and inevitable .
According to a document obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation through the Freedom of Information Act , an " apparent miscommunication " resulted in unauthorized FBI access to an entire domain 's email , rather than the single email account the Bureau had permission to monitor .
As Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times reports :
A technical glitch gave the F.B.I. access to the e-mail messages from an entire computer network — perhaps hundreds of accounts or more — instead of simply the lone e-mail address that was approved by a secret intelligence court as part of a national security investigation , according to an internal report of the 2006 episode .
F.B.I. officials blamed an “ apparent miscommunication ” with the unnamed Internet provider , which mistakenly turned over all the e-mail from a small e-mail domain for which it served as host .
The records were ultimately destroyed , officials said .
Bureau officials noticed a “ surge ” in the e-mail activity they were monitoring and realized that the provider had mistakenly set its filtering equipment to trap far more data than a judge had actually authorized .
The episode is an unusual example of what has become a regular if little - noticed occurrence , as American officials have expanded their technological tools : government officials , or the private companies they rely on for surveillance operations , sometimes foul up their instructions about what they can and cannot collect .
The problem has received no discussion as part of the fierce debate in Congress about whether to expand the government ’s wiretapping authorities and give legal immunity to private telecommunications companies that have helped in those operations .
But an intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because surveillance operations are classified , said : “ It ’s inevitable that these things will happen .
It ’s not weekly , but it ’s common . ”

In a decision on March 5 , the Senate Public Health Committee voted 6 - 4 in favor of allowing the medical use of marijuana to become legal for those with debilitating diseases .
If the law is passed , those with illnesses such as glaucoma , cancer and AIDS could potentially benefit by relieving some of their symptoms through use of the plant .
However , similar legislation was approved by the committee last year and voted down by the Senate in its third reading .
" The one [ bill ] that I am the most confident in passing is Senate Bill 2865 , which would allow patients in Illinois with their doctor 's recommendation [ to ] medicate with cannabis , " Dan Linn , executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , said .
According to Linn , Senate Bill 2865 would allow for patients to grow up to eight plants and possess two and a half ounces of cannabis at a time and would also allow for caregivers to do so for the patients .
" ... The bill does allow a ' medical marijuana organization ' to be the primary caregiver for a patient and that organization would be able to provide medicine for as many patients as are registered for that ' medical marijuana organization ' as their caregiver , " Linn said .
Such an organization would be required to pay a fee and register with the Department of Public Health , according to Linn .
" The wasting syndrome associated with HIV / AIDS can be alleviated by using cannabis and the effects of chemotherapy can also be reduced , " Linn explained .
" The stereotypical ' munchies ' are vital for those who cannot stomach the food needed to survive . "
The current legislation would carry harsher penalties than simple marijuana possession for those who abuse the medical cannabis program .
" The new bill clearly defines the guidelines for the Department of Public Health to implement a medical cannabis program , " Linn said .
Contrary to published reports , a branch of the State Police Department never implemented the law when it was originally passed 30 years ago , according to Kimberly Parker , a Public Health Department spokesperson , said .
" Our agency was never [ involved ] in the statute , " Parker said when referring to the 1978 Cannabis Control Act .
The current bill will be sent to the Illinois Senate floor on April 1 .

The National Union of Public and General Employees , which represents 340,000 workers across Canada , is urging the Liberals to support its call for laws that will keep the internet free from interference by service providers .
The union , which released its letter to Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion on its website on Monday , said urgent net neutrality action is needed in light of recent moves by service providers , including Bell Canada Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc. , to limit the speeds of certain internet applications .
Dion was called on to take a " clear stand " in support of such legislation .
" These internet service providers are , with little or no public accountability , implementing measures that will discriminate against the use of legal software for legitimate uses .
This is unacceptable , " wrote NUPGE president James Clancy .
" The potential for violations of the privacy rights of users is clear .
The continued silence on these matters by the CRTC and the Canadian government violates the trust the Canadian people have placed in our public institutions . "
The Liberals have thus far been silent on the net neutrality battle , but other opposition parties have voiced their support of legislation .
NDP digital spokesman Charlie Angus last week called on Minister of Industry Jim Prentice to follow the recommendations of the Telecommunications Policy Review Panel , made in 2006 , and enact legislation that will stop large internet service providers from prioritizing certain types of internet traffic .
Prentice had rebuffed earlier questioning by Angus in the House of Commons and said the Conservatives were not in favour of regulating the internet .
" We have a well advanced internet system in this country .
It is not publicly regulated , " he said in the exchange earlier this month .
" At this point in time we will continue to leave the matter between consumers on the one hand and internet service providers on the other . "
While the Bloc Québécois has not yet spoken out on the neutrality controversy , the party is on the verge of tabling controversial new legislation that will allow Quebec to opt out of the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission and form its own regulator , according to the Montreal Gazette .
Dale Palmateer , a spokesman for Liberal Industry critic Scott Brison , told CBCNews .ca the MP was holding meetings on the topic of net neutrality in order to deepen his understanding of the issue .
Brison has already spoken with representatives from Bell , Rogers and Telus and will meet with independent parties this week .
" Until he has a better understanding of the issues , he 's reluctant to articulate a position , " Palmateer said .
Tension growing over neutrality rules
The call for political action is following on growing tension between the large service providers and smaller ISPs , consumer groups and internet experts .
On Friday , the Canadian Association of Internet Providers — which represents 55 smaller firms across Canada that rent portions of phone companies ' networks in order to provide internet service to their own customers — reiterated its request to the CRTC that it immediately stop Bell 's interference with download speeds .
Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc. and Wireless Nomad , a co-op ISP , have filed letters with the CRTC supporting CAIP 's fight with Bell .
On Friday , L’Union des consommateurs — Quebec 's consumer rights group — also joined the fray and called on the CRTC to end Bell 's traffic shaping .
The CRTC has also posted hundreds of comments from individuals supporting CAIP .
The government 's own standing committee on heritage has also urged net neutrality legislation in order to protect the CBC from potentially unfair business practices by large ISPs .
The CRTC has said it will rule on CAIP 's request some time in May .
Bell and Rogers , meanwhile , have said they need to throttle the speeds of certain internet uses — such as peer - to - peer applications like BitTorrent — in order to limit abuse of their networks by a small percentage of customers .
In his letter to Dion , NUPGE 's Clancy pointed out that Canada is well behind the United States in investigating the issue .
" Our American neighbours are taking this form of interference in internet service very seriously .
The Federal Communications Commission in the United States is conducting an investigation into the blocking of legal peer - to - peer file sharing services by Comcast and other internet service providers , " he wrote .
" Both Senator [ Hillary ] Clinton and Senator [ Barack ]
Obama have pledged to address net neutrality concerns if elected president . "

Abstract
" Happy Birthday to You " is the best - known and most frequently sung song in the world .
Many - including Justice Breyer in his dissent in Eldred v. Ashcroft - have portrayed it as an unoriginal work that is hardly worthy of copyright protection , but nonetheless remains under copyright .
Yet close historical scrutiny reveals both of those assumptions to be false .
The song that became " Happy Birthday to You , " originally written with different lyrics as " Good Morning to All , " was the product of intense creative labor , undertaken with copyright protection in mind .
However , it is almost certainly no longer under copyright , due to a lack of evidence about who wrote the words ; defective copyright notice ; and a failure to file a proper renewal application .
The falsity of the standard story about the song demonstrates the dangers of relying on anecdotes without thorough research and analysis .
It also reveals collective action barriers to mounting challenges to copyright validity : the song generates an estimated $ 2 million per year , and yet no one has ever sought adjudication of the validity of its copyright .
Finally , the true story of the song demonstrates that a long , unitary copyright term requires changes in copyright doctrine and administration .
With such a term , copyright law needs a doctrine like adverse possession to clear title and protect expectations generated when , as with this song , putative owners do not challenge distribution of unauthorized copies for more than 20 years .
And Copyright Office recordkeeping policy , which currently calls for discarding correspondence after 20 years and most registration denials and deposits after five years , must be improved to facilitate resolution of disputes involving older works .
Over two hundred unpublished documents found in six archives across the United States have been made available on a website that will serve as an online appendix to this article .
We have old cell phones and an outdated plan with Sprint .
However , we ’ve been locked in because we moved our minutes around a couple months ago .
With the new irresistible SERO plan I was wishing that we would n’t have to wait 2 more years to switch .
Then Patrick wrote how to cancel your cell phone contract without paying fees !
His first point stated that Sprint changed their contract on January 1 , 2008 .
I did n’t know that because we ’re on a family plan where another family member gets the bill at their house .
This was perfect timing and set me into action to cancel our Sprint service without paying early termination fees .
Here ’s how I did it :
Locate your Changes to Terms and Conditions
Review your last bill or look for a postcard that came in the mail describing the notification .
I found mine online with the following footnotes :
Important Notice : Changes to Terms and Conditions The Terms & Conditions for Sprint PCS and Nextel services have been updated .
These new terms are effective January 1 , 2008 , and are available at sprint.com or upon request .
Please carefully review these terms as they apply to any future use of our services .
Important Notice Regarding Sprint Surcharges Eff. 1/1/08
Sprint will no longer assess Fed. E911 ( $ 0.40 ) & WLNP ( $ 0.15 ) fees .
Eff. 1/1/08 Sprint will assess 2 new monthly charges per line : Admin . Charge ( $ 0.75 ) & Reg. Charge ( $ 0.20 ) .
See bill insert or postcard mailed to you if not receiving a paper bill .
Details : sprint.com /taxesandfees .
Sign up for your new plan
I signed up for the incredible SERO plan !
Nickel gave great step - by - step directions for the SERO plan and additional discounts .
They did a credit check , but it ’s ok , we maintain good credit .
I settled on the Palm Centro Smartphone .
It does n’t have any mail - in rebates and should be about $ 50 each after savings .
Supposedly it ’s good for people in their 20s and 30s new to smart phones .
I have a blackberry for work , but I do n’t use many features on it besides the phone and email .
If you are n’t familiar with the SERO plan it offers :
$ 30 per month for 500 minutes
Unlimited Sprint Mobile to Mobile
Unlimited Nationwide long distance
Voicemail , Call Waiting , and Caller ID
Unlimited Nights & Weekends starting at 7pm
Free text messaging : Included when you sign up by 2/16/08
: Included when you sign up by 2/16/08 Unlimited data plan… this is what we really wanted !
This plan is a million times better than our old family share plan at $ 69.98 for 3 lines with 550 shared minutes .
Call Sprint Retentions to Cancel
Call after you activate your new phones .
The direct Sprint retentions number is 877-766-7697 .
Let them know that you are canceling your contract due to the change in terms and conditions .
Of course they ’ll try to get you to stay , but that ’s where already having your new service in place helps .
I informed them that I was happy with Sprint and set up 2 new lines .
Once they verified the newly activated service , they were much more comfortable helping me cancel the old lines .
In case you get a runaround about not being able to cancel , it is your right based on the following Terms and Conditions :
When You Do n’t Have To Pay An Early Termination Fee
You are n’t responsible for paying an Early Termination Fee when terminating Services : ( a ) provided on a month - to - month basis ; ( b ) consistent with our published trial period return policy ; or ( c ) in response to a materially adverse change we make to the Agreement as described directly below .
Our Right To Change The Agreement & Your Related Rights .
We may change any part of the Agreement at any time , including , but not limited to , rates , charges , how we calculate charges , or your terms of Service .
We will provide you notice of material changes , and may provide you notice of non-material changes , in a manner consistent with this Agreement ( see “ Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement ” section ) .
If a change we make to the Agreement is material and has a material adverse effect on Services under your Term Commitment , you may terminate each line of Service materially affected without incurring an Early Termination Fee only if you : ( a ) call us within 30 days after the effective date of the change ; and ( b ) specifically advise us that you wish to cancel Services because of a material change to the Agreement that we have made .
If you do not cancel Service within 30 days of the change , an Early Termination Fee will apply if you terminate Services before the end of any applicable Term Commitment .
Enjoy your new phones
I wish I could say I was writing this article using my new phone , but that ’s still a little far - fetched for me .
I have learned how to text message though !
We could n’t keep our old phone numbers ( note to family and friends : email me to get the new numbers ! ) but it was worth it .
Great saxophone players do more than just hit the right notes on their instrument , they can also tune their own vocal tract to match , researchers say .
Musicians have long known that professional saxophonists can play very high notes that amateurs simply cannot manage .
Now a physicist from the University of New South Wales explains why .
The best saxophone players have figured out how to change the shapes of their vocal tracts so they resonate at a frequency close to that of the note they 're aiming for .
" We measured the resonances of saxophonists ' vocal tracts directly , while they played , " said doctoral student Chen Jer -Ming , whose work appears in the journal Science .
Over the standard saxophone range of roughly two - and - a - half octaves , there was no particular relationship between the vocal tract resonances and notes played , he says .
But for the highest notes , the vocal tracts of professional saxophonists did something special .
" In those higher frequencies up there , the saxophone 's own resonances are relatively weak , so that 's why it 's hard to sound those notes , " Mr Chen said .
" By adjusting your vocal tract resonances to match those in the saxophone , they add up .
That allows them to play the notes . "
New device
Musicians and scientists have been debating for 25 years the importance of the player 's vocal tract in hitting notes on single - reed instruments such as the saxophone and clarinet .
Mr Chen solved that debate by building a device that could fit unobtrusively within the mouthpiece of a saxophone and detect the resonances of the musician 's vocal tract .
He and his colleagues used the device to compare three amateur players and five professional jazz and classical saxophonists .
When Mr Chen asked the professionals how they learned to play the high notes , they all said it was something they stumbled upon and kept practising .
" They all told me the same thing , " Mr Chen said .
" Once they learned how to do it , they had to hear the note in their head first , then the note will just naturally follow .
" I think it 's a kind of muscle memory at work .
Their throat just moves in the right places at the right time . "
Now the secret is out , Mr Chen says it might be possible to teach budding saxophonists how to adjust their playing to hit those high notes .
" I believe its something most people could learn if they were conscious of it and practise hard , " he said .
" It wo n't happen overnight . "
CHICAGO  Faced with strong worldwide food demand and the accompanying higher prices , American farmers are beginning to respond to the signals of the market .
In a new government report , farmers said they would make significant cuts in corn acreage this year in favor of soybeans .
If they carry through with their intentions , the resulting additional soybean oil could help alleviate global shortages of cooking oil that have led to sharply higher prices , hitting poor countries hard .
But a smaller corn harvest would most likely raise prices for that crop , which could also increase the prices Americans pay for meat .
Most corn is used as animal feed .
Higher corn prices may also compound the difficulties of companies that use corn to produce ethanol as a motor fuel .
Despite government mandates for the use of ethanol , those companies are struggling .
They expanded so rapidly in recent years that an oversupply of ethanol depressed prices , even as the cost of their main feedstock  corn  was rising .
The release Monday morning of the Agriculture Department ’s report on farmers ’ plans , based on interviews with growers during the first two weeks of March , caused the price of corn in the commodities markets to rise past $ 6 a bushel for the first time , before falling back .
Soybean prices , meanwhile , fell 70 cents to $ 10.89 on expectations of a greater supply .

The number of national security letters issued by the FBI skyrocketed in the years after the Patriot Act became law in 2001 , according to last year ’s report by Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine .
His review is required by Congress , over the objections of the Bush administration .
The FBI improperly used national security letters in 2006 to obtain personal data on Americans during terror and spy investigations , Director Robert Mueller said Wednesday .
Mueller told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the privacy breach by FBI agents and lawyers occurred a year before the bureau enacted sweeping new reforms to prevent future lapses .
Details on the abuses will be outlined in the coming days in a report by the Justice Department ’s inspector general .
The report is a follow - up to an audit by the inspector general a year ago that found the FBI demanded personal data on people from banks , telephone and Internet providers and credit bureaus without official authorization and in non-emergency circumstances between 2003 and 2005 .
Mueller , noting senators ’ concerns about Americans ’ civil and privacy rights , said the new report “ will identify issues similar to those in the report issued last March . ”
The similarities , he said , are because the time period of the two studies “ predates the reforms we now have in place . ”

Broken bits of rubber can stick themselves back together again .
Ludwik Leibler and a bit of self - healing rubber .
NATURE
Snap this stretchy piece of rubber in two , and it will heal itself back into a stretchy piece of rubber again .
The material 's eerie ability to ' heal ' itself means that it can broken , stuck and stretched time and time again .
The self - healing rubber was made in the lab of Ludwik Leibler , at the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris .
Leibler and his colleagues built up their rubber from simple starting materials — fatty acids and urea ( that 's vegetable oil and a component of urine ) .
The resulting material is a cross between silly putty and a rubber ball — it can stretch , but when snapped in two it can be stuck back together again .
The team has n't yet tried to mold the stuff into a ball , so they do n't know for sure how bouncy it is .
But , Leibler adds , “ knowing what I know about it , it will bounce . ”
Their research is published in Nature1 .
The material is more than just a curiosity , says Takuzo Aida , a chemist at Tokyo University .
“ The discovery is very close to [ being used in ] business , ” he says .
Self - healing rubber could have applications in anything from adhesives to bicycle tyres .
Stretchy stuff
Conventional rubber is made of a single , continuous , stretchy molecule , held together with strong chemical links called covalent bonds .
Once these bonds are cut by a break in the material , that ’s it — the rubber ca n’t be reassembled .
Leibler 's approach was to use small molecular groups instead : the fatty acids from vegetable oil .
Reacting these molecules with urea in a two - step process stuck nitrogen - containing chemical groups ( amides and imidazolidones ) onto the ends of the fatty acids .
The fatty acids link to each other using hydrogen bonds — a strong attractive force between hydrogen and another atom , and the bond responsible for holding water molecules to each other .
The resulting molecular system is very non-uniform : some acids have three protruding groups and some have two .
This means that the compound can't crystallize into a hard , shatterable material .
Instead it can be stretched to five times its original size and then return to normal , albeit slower than an elastic band would — it takes around a minute .
Sticky stuff
Press two snapped bits of rubber together ...
NATURE
If rubber is cut , the end groups on the acids become exposed , and the hydrogen bonds to neighbouring groups are broken .
It is in the amide group 's nature to seek out a partner to link up to , and this happens when the cut surfaces are brought back in contact — the hydrogen bonds can form again .
The longer the cut ends are held together , the more of these partnerships are made , and the more completely healed the rubber is .
... and after a few hours you can stretch it again .
NATURE
A freshly cut sample can heal enough that the re-stuck rubber can be stretched to twice its size again after just 15 minutes .
The system is n't perfect yet — healed rubber that has n't been left long enough will break again at the original ' wound ' site .
The broken rubbers will stick only to the other broken piece , and the rubber does n’t have to be mended immediately — it can still efficiently reform up to 18 hours after being severed .
Simple stuff
ADVERTISEMENT
Other self - healing materials exist , but their bonds knit back together only when heated or a strong force is applied .
Leibler ’s material works at room temperature , and just requires the two broken bits to be held together gently .
" It is a very simplistic concept , and using renewable resources is really nice , " says Oren Scherman , a chemist at the University of Cambridge who will be running a session on self - healing materials at the upcoming American Chemical Society meeting in New Orleans .
" It 's a good indication that you can rip things apart and put them together . "
Leibler has a deal with French chemical company Arkema to develop and commercialize the material .
Leibler would like to see the rubber used in toys : " children like to break things , if you could heal them it would be very nice . "

DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf lashed out Thursday at what he called Western " intellectual arrogance " toward his country , angrily dismissing claims that rising unpopularity has undermined his authority .
Pervez Musharraf blasted what he called the West's " intellectual arrogance " in criticizing him .
He also dismissed allegations that he cannot be trusted to hold free and fair elections as " totally absurd . "
Musharraf , who was forced to impose a state of emergency last year to quell violent protests but failed to prevent the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , sought to defend his embattled leadership and record in combating terrorism .
" The mandate has been given .
Why does n't the West , which is supposed to be civilized , understand things ? "
Musharraf told CNN in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
" Why does n't it understand that we maybe are a developing country , we have our flaws , we believe in constitution , we know how to run government , we are not such clueless people who do not know how to run a country , we have our own brains . "
Watch Musharraf blast Western " intellectual arrogance " »
He added , " Unfortunately there is a degree of , may I say , intellectual arrogance that I see in the West which thinks that these developing countries are some kind of people who do not know how to govern , they do not know anything . "
Musharraf has been accused by Western critics and his political opponents of rolling back democracy in Pakistan in an effort to maintain power .
Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 military coup and resisted pressure to quit his military role until late last year , said polls that predicted a major blow to his ruling Pakistan Muslim League Party on February 18 were baseless .
He also rejected claims by Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party that the elections will be rigged , an accusation leveled at the previous votes Musharraf used to prolong his period of rule .
His landslide win in October 2007 faced a constitutional challenge by a judiciary he subsequently dismissed as he imposed the emergency rule amid violent protests .
" This [ election rigging allegation ] is the culture that [ Bhutto's supporters ] have been following themselves always , " he said .
" But this is the culture that I have changed .
The bugs that were there in the system have been removed .
By who ?
By me , by my government .
We removed the bugs . "
He rejected charges that he quelled democratic movements by dismissing the judiciary and cracking down on some media outlets , saying there were " four or five personalities who actually were inciting the people of Pakistan to agitation . "
" We can not have this , " he said .
Musharraf said the brief closure of TV broadcasters during emergency rule , which was lifted December 13 , was a necessary move .
" I closed them down for a few days because they were , No. 1 , inciting agitation -- some of them ; No. 2 , they were not showing responsibility toward terrorism and extremism . "
The president , whose security forces are often accused of colluding with militant elements in Pakistan , defended his record on tackling terrorism but insisted he was not working for the West , despite close alliance with Washington .
" The misperception is that I 'm doing something for the United States or the West , we are fighting for Pakistan and the West must know that success or failure in Pakistan will have an impact on the streets of Europe .
" Do not create such misconception that we are backtracking , we are following a multi- pronged strategy : military , political , socio-economic .
And we are doing very well . "

Pulses in an optical fibre can mimic the space - bending physics of collapsed stars .
Black holes and white holes are being mimicked " all the time " in optical - fibre cables .
GETTY
A black hole has been made in the laboratory .
It ’s not , needless to say , a collapsed star with super - strong gravity , like the black holes thought to exist in deep space .
Rather it ’s a kind of toy black hole made from light — and “ completely harmless ” , its creators say .
It might seem odd to make an analogue of a black hole — so - called because even light cannot escape its gravitational tug — from light itself .
But Ulf Leonhardt of the University of St Andrews , UK , and his colleagues demonstrate that pulses of light travelling down an optical fibre can be made to affect other light waves in much the same way as a black hole does1 .
Laboratory analogues of black holes have been proposed before , including an exotic ultracold gas of metal atoms that might act as a ‘ sonic black hole ’2 , but none has previously been demonstrated .
Lab versions of black holes might permit a key aspect of their theory to be put to the test : whether they are not in fact perfectly black , but instead emit some particles and radiation .
Although the model is made in an optical - fibre cable with special properties , the team says that almost any pulse — including those used in fibre - optic telecommunications — should be a black - hole mimic to some degree .
“ We ’re making them all the time , ” says Leonhardt .
A river runs through it
The group ’s light pulses provide not only optical black holes but ‘ white holes ’ too .
Whereas no light can escape from within a region called the event horizon surrounding the centre of a black hole — so light hitting it always falls in and becomes trapped — incoming light is repelled by the event horizon of a white hole .
The St Andrews team point out that black holes are like rivers flowing over a waterfall , carrying fish with it .
The waterfall is the hole ’s ‘ singularity ’ , where fish ‘ disappear ’ ; a little way back upstream lies the event horizon , beyond which no fish can swim fast enough to escape from the brink .
A white hole , meanwhile , is like a fast - flowing river entering the sea : when the speed of the river current exceeds that of fish in the sea , no fish can enter the river mouth .
“ These are more than analogies , ” the researchers say .
“ The propagation of waves in moving fluids is mathematically equivalent to wave propagation in spacetime . ”
Altered by the light
The laboratory analogy involves a special , ' non- linear ' optical fibre , in which light actually changes the fibre ’s light - bearing properties .
This mimics the way that a black hole ’s gravity warps the space around it , altering the way light travels through it .
Because of this property of the fibre , a stream of light behind but faster than the ‘ hole ’ pulse gets slowed down as it catches up , and then is reflected backwards ( like the fish in the sea that cannot enter a stream ) .
So light can never cross into the trailing edge of the pulse , making it like a white hole .
Just as with a cosmic white hole , the light also has its wavelength shortened by this process .
The ' black horizon ' at the pulse front is more complicated .
In a cosmic black hole , incoming light is also frequency - shifted as it approaches , until its wavelength is so small that it requires new and unknown physics to describe how the light behaves .
In the optical fibre , the alteration of wavelength is not so extreme .
The result is that the light actually bounces away .
That sounds as if it's the opposite behaviour to a real black hole , but in fact the maths governing the behaviour is the same .
The ultimate test
The researchers speculate about making such pulses act like mirrors — which might then be used to trap light in a way that could lead to ‘ black - hole lasers ’ .
In the meantime there is a more likely application for the toy : testing an unproven theory about black holes .
In 1974 , Stephen Hawking predicted that black holes should actually emit some particles and radiation .
This should happen , he said , because empty space is constantly fizzing with ‘ virtual particles ’ — pairs of particles and their corresponding antimatter particles , which annihilate one another almost as soon as they are formed .
Near the event horizon of a black hole , one member of a pair would occasionally fall across the horizon before annihilation happens , so the other would escape destruction .
The surviving particle could then escape from the edge of the black hole .
ADVERTISEMENT
This ‘ Hawking radiation ’ means that black holes should have an intrinsic temperature ( albeit very , very low ) caused by the emission of these particles .
But no one has ever been able to test this , and the prospect for doing so looks bleak : their temperature would be much lower than the pervasive afterglow of the Big Bang .
Leonhardt and his colleagues predict that their optical black holes should emit photons of ultraviolet light that are equivalent to Hawking radiation , which should be detectable .
“ They are of very low intensity , ” says Leonhardt , “ so seeing them will need great luck .
We ’d be overjoyed if we found this was happening . ”
It will also be tricky to distinguish these photons from the hole pulse itself , although the photons ought to have a characteristic fingerprint .
But the challenges clearly do n’t deter the St Andrews team .
“ Working on artificial black holes seems seriously addictive , ” they write in a press statement .
“ Maybe we are beyond the point of no return . ”

Gliding through the ocean in temperatures below freezing , she swims effortlessly through the water with nothing to help her breathe .
And the Beluga Whale seems to be managing pretty well too .
This is the extraordinary moment when the graceful mammal bumped into a free diver swimming in Russia 's White Sea .

Whale rider : Free diver Julia Petrik hitches a ride with a passing Beluga whale
Julia Petrik , had to cut through ice one foot thick to get in to the - 2C ( 28 F ) water off the north - west coast of the country .
Miss Petrik , 38 , one of the world 's top free divers , swims underwater with no air tanks and can hold her breath for up to two minutes .
After entering the water she grabbed hold of a passing Beluga Whale for a lift - a moment captured by British photographer Dan Burton .
Writing on her website , Miss Petrik says she needs to stay in top physical form to perform her extreme dives .

Brief encounter : Julia Petrik spent just a few seconds with the Beluga whale
Going up ? : Julia Petrik clings to the whale as it ascends
She says : " Diving to such a depth and holding your breath by only using the power of your body is impossible without good physical form , muscles and endurance .
" It is a case of straining but not straining at the same time .
" But it is not just the power of your body - it is managing the control over consciousness , ideas , emotions and sensations to push yourself to the limit .
" The relaxation that is created under the water is boundless .
It is a demanding sport as well as a full time job . "
Miss Petrik is an instructor for the International Federation of Free Diving and is Russia 's champion free diver .
Mr Burton , 41 , from Topsham , Devon , dived below her in scuba gear to photograph his subjects using specialist underwater camera equipment .
He said : " The way Julia moves through the water is just incredible .
" You have to be careful of hypothermia when you are in there .
" I was worried I was going to freeze but in the end I was in the water for an hour and could easily have stayed longer . "

Back on dry land : Julia Petrik with her special free diving flippers
Temperatures above the ice were as low as - 15C ( 5 F ) and during the free - dive Miss Petrik swam to depths of 82ft , wearing only ultra - tight wetsuits , face masks and flippers .
Miss Petrik managed to grab the whale for a free ride at around 26ft and floated for several seconds before letting go .
Beluga
Whales only live in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters and are protected from the sub - zero temperatures by a thick layer of blubber .
The elusive whales are an unmistakable all white in colour with a distinctive melon - shaped head and can grow up to 16 ftin length .
Scientists say Belugas have been known to live up to 50 years in the wild and have been recorded diving to depths of over 2,000ft .
Mr Burton added : " It was an unbelievable experience to be with these animals .
One of them even grabbed hold of my arm and my leg with its mouth .
" What was amazing was how dark it was underneath the ice .
When you looked up there was this green glow - it was like another world , breathtaking . "
Here 's some pictures of all what I 've done to my 2000 cougar v6 .
I 'm sure it 'll get mixed reviews lol .
Let 's start with the wonderful wheel cover .
It 's almost as old as me I think and is getting a little faded but it 's still awesome lolThese are my lovely seat covers .
This is the MP3 CD player I custom painted to match .
Hey , it was over 5 x cheaper than the absolute crappiest MP3 CD player that 's actually made to go in your car .
Plus they typically do n't have an easily accessible aux out .
Now why would I need one of those ?
We 're getting to that lol .
Now you 're probably wondering , how this all works .
Well the black remote in the first pic controls half the satellite volumes and one sub .
Speaking of satellites ... So basically the player goes into the rack mountable Peavy dual channel 15 band equalizer then recombines into stereo and goes into the Behringer headphone amp .
That 's to preserve the volume instead of using a ton of splitters and also reduces echoing interference , etc .
Then that sends to the speakers .
I 've got a set of Logitch X - 530's and Z - 5300's .
The 5300's have a 280 watt amp on the side of that sub and it's a dual chamber , turbo high quality sub .
It produces accurate , realistic bass instead of what most car subs do but it 's still capable of blasting your ears off if you want it to .
The other X - 530 sub is more like a mid .
It has trouble going below like 50 Hz .
All the satellites together can get around 120 dB and the subs are slightly louder .
Plus it sounds about 100000 x better than door speakers cuz they 're mounted up higher , there 's more of them , and they 're better quality .
The red bar you see is 10 feet of EL wire .
Btw that and all my neons are controlled by the switches you see up a couple pictures on the side of my center console .
Here 's the EL wire in context and in no light .
It still needs a little tweaking so they bunch together moreOn the driver 's side I 've got a 4 " blue neon to light up that area .
My camera really did n't pick it up well though but trust me , it 's very bright .
the controller you see there is actually for the exterior green neons and the blue is controlled by the light up blue toggle switch on my center console .
here 's the outside green ones .
They 're waaaaaaay brighter than your standard car neons .
My camera even had trouble picking it up .
Btw the red light is from my LED headlamp just to show where my car is in relation to the neons so it 's not all dark and confusing .
The rear has a single 4 " on the same controller while the front has dual 12 " but they 're close to the same brightness on the ground because of how I mounted the back one .
I could n't get a good shot of the red neon I put on top the bumper behind the grill about 2 " down because I have to start my car to get it bright enough ( it 's getting some voltage loss down the wires so it needs the extra 2volts from having the car running to really be seen ) but it looks really cool cuz there 's red light streaming out the grill .
The last one I installed is to replace that horrible , ugly , unbalanced , stupid looking , one side only , 10 watt trunk light .
I bought terminals that fit in the sockets for the plug that powers that light cuz it's also 12 volt and replaced it with a neon inverter and a single white 4 " .
Eventually I 'll have a blue 4 " on each side of the trunk instead but I did n't realize I was out of them until I started lol .
Btw extensive video instructions on how to assemble and install my exact neon kit on your car are about 75 % done .
I 'll post it here ASAP when I 'm done filming and editing it .
The rear and front neon kit plus wires and supplies is around $ 45 - 55 with shipping included depending on what you have lying around as far as tape and glue and tools and stuff .
All the other single kits are under $ 15 total for everything necessary .
Oh and the sound system altogether with wiring and the inverter and speakers and all other equipment was somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 340 .
That 's right I said $ 340 .
Try making your car sound that good for that price lol .
Remember I even have a 15 band pro quality Peavy equalizer in there to tweak it so it sounds perfect .
Door speakers + sub + amp + wiring + good player =
A LOT OF MONEY !
As for future upgrades , and this sounds harder than it is , I 'm going to " re-upholster " the floor thingy in the trunk so it has an enormous cougar logo on it in fabric and attach unpowered hydraulic cylinders to it so it opens and closes just like the rear door and where the spare tire used to be I 'm gonna put a custom built spin up storage area for airsoft ammo and guns and equipment : biggrin : and of course lots of paint and neons and EL wire and all that to match lol .
I 'll definitely post pics of that when it 's done .
Here 's my artist 's rendition :
Now for addition Q & A because nobody 's reading my replies cuz they get buried too fast ( actually just A ) : I covered my seats because in case you have n't noticed , the entire interior is black and the seats are tan .
They stand out so much it looks like they 're not even stock !
Plus my couch is leather .
Those seats might be leather but they 're not leather .
They 're made out of probably the crappiest leather in the entire world .
They feel like vinyl .
Are you sure my care even comes with leather standard cuz I do n't think they are ?
How could anyone NOT cover up those ugly bright tan 90's buick looking seats ?
The CD player and remote do n't do there , they 're just there for the picture .
Someone can sit in the passenger side .
I blocked up the back seat cuz nobody 's short enough to ride back there comfortably without hitting their head anyway .
The entire system is secured and bolted down .
It wo n't rip out unless I T - bone someone at 500 MPH .
NONE OF THE NEONS BARS ARE VISIBLE ( except the white temporary one in the trunk ) I just took it at a camera angle so you could see where it was .
The sound gear is technically home theater .
Who does n't want a home theater in their car ?
It sounds so good it would make you cry .
It 's not pretty but who cares .
If I put it all in a stylish enclosure that would be a waste of money and it would sound worse and be a massive waste of time .
I will however paint the wood black eventually I do have 2 front mounted speakers more powerful than the rest ( the centers off each system ) up front , you just can't see themI 'm using an 800 watt inverter because unlike what everyone thinks , the amps internally almost definitely do n't use 12 volt , it 's probably 18 or 24 or even higher .
Plus I do n't have to do any wiring and can plug in any house gear whenever I want .

Eliezer ’s post Saturday on if we would really like fantasy worlds raises in my mind this key question : are reality and fantasy complements or substitutes ?
That is , does exposure to fiction tend to increase or decrease our ability to see reality as it is ?
The main substitutes argument is simple and obvious but still compelling : the more we practice thinking about reality the better we see it , but attention to fiction diverts attention from reality , reducing our reality practice .
The complement arguments are many and subtle :
The real alternative to thinking about fun fiction is n’t thinking about reality , it is unthinking fun .
Fiction can frame the familiar in grand terms , making us care and think more about the familiar .
Fiction can teach us about rare but important events few actually see in reality .
Fiction can describe how familiar situations appear to many different parties .
Fiction can suppress irrelevant detail and emphasize important essences , like a math model .
Fiction is a part of reality , so exposure to fiction teaches about that part .
( I ’ll add more here as I hear more good suggestions . )
Identifying with characters important in their world lets us admit we are unimportant in ours .
Has anyone ever tried to test whether people who read more fiction see reality more clearly , controlling for other features ?
I find it suspicious that many say , " yes , fiction substitutes for reality on average , but `good ’ fiction is different " but offer no independent description of " good " we could use to test this claim .
On the last argument above , that fiction lets us admit to being unimportant , I ’ll admit that it fits with Eliezer and I being both relatively anti-fantasy and thinking ourselves unusually important .
Added :
Many seem eager to point out that fiction need not always be a substitute for reality , but will anyone defend the view that it is on the whole a complement ?
( This last part seems less relevant than I originally thought : )
A paper from the March Journal of Personality and Social Psychology adds further support , finding that people who feel less important find it harder to be objective :
Confirmatory information processing … is the tendency of individuals to systematically prefer standpoint - consistent information to standpoint - inconsistent information in information evaluation and search .
In 4 studies with political and economic decision - making scenarios , it was consistently found that individuals with depleted self - regulation resources exhibited a stronger tendency for confirmatory information processing …
Alternative explanations based on processes of ego threat , cognitive load , and mood were ruled out .
…
Individuals with depleted self - regulation resources experienced increased levels of commitment to their own standpoint , which resulted in increased confirmatory information processing .
In sum , the impact of ego depletion on confirmatory information search seems to be more motivational than cognitive in nature .

Economic downturn be damned — it ’s still impossible to get past the city ’s most elite co-op boards , even though all over the city , the rich are getting poorer .
That ’s what the Observer posits in an article today , which , like all great stories in the salmon paper , seems merely to be an excuse to get self - important fools to give ridiculously offensive quotes about themselves and their social caste .
Even if you are a titan of finance , you ’re unlikely to make it past the snootiest of boards , in famous buildings like 740 and 765 Park , 820 Fifth , and the River House .
“ I ’ll tell you why !
They do n’t want you going belly up , they do n’t want you , your fabulous company — Bear Stearns , excuse me — all of a sudden going face down , and you have to sell apartments and you ca n’t pay your maintenance , ” broker to the rich Edward Lee Cave told the paper .
“ The current crunch does n’t affect them at all . ”
Sounds fun ( even though we knew all this before ) .
What else do these impossible snobby people have to say ?
• “ I do n’t recall ever hearing of any [ minorities moving in ] , ” said financier H. Fred Krimendahl II , an 820 Fifth board member and a past president of the Philharmonic .
“ But if Tiger Woods wanted to live here , we ’d be happy to talk to him . ”
• When asked to describe the co-op 19 East 72nd , probably the hardest building off Fifth and Park Avenue to get into , one top broker said : “ You would n’t bring in a rap singer into 19 East 72nd Street — just as you would n’t take 19 East 72nd into some rap building .
They ’re divergent cultures . ”
[ Ed : What is a “ rap building ” ?
And how do you take another building into it ? ]
• “ Let ’s suppose that you know somebody on the board who belongs to a certain country club in Westchester , and the applicant belongs to the same club , ” posits lawyer Richard Siegler , who works as counsel for 720 Park and says social discrimination is entirely legal .
“ Would n’t you think , as the seller , that the board is more likely to accept the person ?
I do n’t think that ’s illegal , I just think that ’s an inducement to accept one over the other . ”
• Says River House resident ( and ambassador to Hungary ) Donald Blinken : “ You find that people at River House are rather serious and not as exposed to the vicissitudes . ”
• “ First arrivals like the Russians , I do n’t think they can get in , they ’re too new , ” broker Alice Mason said .
“ A lot of them just arrived in the last 10 years , five years . ”
Come on .
Are n’t you dying to live with these people ?
Top Co-ops Amid Dismal Economy : No Fear , Still Loathing [ NYO ]
The DRAFT LESSIG movement — to encourage Prof. Lawrence Lessig to run for the U.S. Congress from California — is off to a quick start .
Then again , if it ’s going to happen , it has to happen fast : the special election is April 8 .
The Facebook group we set up a few days ago now has over 2,000 members .
Supporters have come out of the netroots from every angle .
There are fund - raisers pledged in 6 cities .
One of the common critiques of Net politics is that it ’s meaningless just to “ join a group ” to support a candidate or a cause .
I do n’t buy it , especially since I think that joining a cause or writing about it often leads to further action .
In the case of the DRAFT LESSIG movement , we ought to prove that there ’s something different going on here with politics and the net .
In the process , we ’ll make it clear to Prof .
Lessig that we ’ve got his back — that ordinary citizens will contribute the funds needed to run his campaign and that it can be run without support from special interests .
Let ’s get 1,000 people to donate to his campaign ( or otherwise commit to volunteer if a campaign is organized ) in the coming week .
We ’ve set up an ActBlue “ draft ” account , so you can give money now , to be turned over to the campaign if it materializes .
If the campaign does not happen , the money is given in full to Creative Commons .
You ca n’t lose .
Please join me in donating now .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Six Britons accused of plotting to blow up at least seven transatlantic airliners recorded martyrdom videos saying the attacks would be revenge for the U.S. invasion of Iraq , a London court was told on Friday .
A combination image of police handout photos presented at Woolwich Crown Court on April 3 , 2008 of suspects accused of plotting to blow up transatlantic airliners using liquid explosive bombs .
The suspects on trial are ( Top L - R ) Abdullah Ahmed Ali , Arafat Waheed Khan , Assad Sarwar and Ibrahim Savant ( Bottom L - R ) Mohammed Gulzar , Tanvir Hussain , Umar Islam and Waheed Zaman .

Prosecutors said two of the suspects were secretly recorded discussing whether wives and children should go with them on the suicide mission .
In extracts of the videos heard in court the men said they wanted to punish non-Muslims and threatened “ floods of martyrdom operations ” because Osama bin Laden ’s warnings had been ignored .
“ If you think you can go into our lands and do what you are doing in Iraq , Afghanistan , Palestine and keep on supporting those who are fighting against Muslims and think it will not come back on your own doorstep may you have another think ( sic ) coming , ” Umar Islam , one of the eight defendants said .
On Thursday , the jury heard the men had planned to use liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks to simultaneously blow up aircraft heading to Canada and the United States , causing widespread loss of life .
The eight British citizens on trial at the maximum security Woolwich Crown Court in east London , are Abdullah Ahmad Ali , 27 , Assad Sarwar , 27 , Tanvir Hussain , 27 , Mohammed Gulzar , 26 , Ibrahim Savant , 27 , Arafat Khan , 26 , Waheed Zaman , 23 , and Umar Islam , 29 .
All are charged with conspiracy to murder .
They are also accused of plotting “ to commit an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft ” .
They deny the charges .
Prosecutor Peter Wright said the suicide videos had been discovered in a camera in Sarwar ’s car and on a cassette tape in the garage of his home .
In all the videos , the men sat dressed in black in front of a black flag with Arabic writing in white .
“ Each contained similar chilling sentiments , ” Wright said .
REVENGE
Ali , said by prosecutors to be one of the three ringleaders , spoke of wanting to be involved in jihad since the age of 15 .
“ Sheikh Osama warned you many times to leave our lands or you will be destroyed , ” Ali said .
“ You have nothing but to expect that floods of martyrdom operations , volcanoes of anger and revenge and raping among your capital . ”
When asked by someone off camera about innocent victims , the men said there would be none , as Britons had failed to do enough to protest against their government ’s actions , caring more about TV soaps and animals than the plight of Muslims .
Wright said computer memory sticks found at Sarwar ’s house suggested other potential targets he had in mind , including : London ’s Canary Wharf business district , British nuclear power stations , the electricity grid , a gas pipe line running between Belgium and Britain , various British airports , oil terminals and the UK ’s main Internet service provider exchange .
He also said a bug hidden in the suspected bomb making factory , a house in east London , had recorded Ali and Islam talking about taking wives and children on the mission .
“ Such a sacrifice is beyond contemplation for those , the target of an attack such as this , but not for those who participate in activities such as this , ” Wright said .
Wright said hydrogen peroxide , which the prosecution said was the main component of the planned explosives , was found in Sarwar ’s garage and the ingredients to make the detonator were discovered in a suitcase , belonging to Sarwar , buried in woodland near his home in High Wycombe , west of London .
The jury were shown a video clip of 500 ml of a hydrogen peroxide bomb in a bottle being blown up , damaging most of the room where the experiment was conducted .
The prosecution has said the men were close to putting their scheme into action when they were arrested in August 2006 .
That prompted a massive security response at global airports and a limit on liquids carried on board aircraft .
JPMorgan Chase , the largest bank in the United States , agreed Tuesday to pay a record $ 920 million to settle charges that it engaged in manipulative trades of futures tied to precious metals and Treasury bonds .

Charley Lineweaver , a scientist with the SETI Institute , argued today that pure human vanity , not scientific evidence , leads us to believe that if humans were wiped off the face of the Earth some other species ( probably an ape of some kind ) would rise to fill the " intelligence niche " that we Homo sapiens currently occupy .
He calls this the " Planet of the Apes hypothesis , " and believes that life here on Earth has already shown it to be false .
That means the way we 're searching for extra-terrestrial life — or even the act of searching itself — is terribly misguided .
Advertisement
Lineweaver 's idea kind of rocks SETI scientists ' mission statement to the core .
Ever since Carl Sagan 's famously framed the ET question " are we alone ? " as " Are there functionally equivalent humans elsewhere in the universe ? " SETI folks have been trying to answer it .
It 's a gargantuan task , and one that that Lineweaver argues we 're making worse by assuming that there is something about humans that is unique or special , or that life on Earth " wants " to be human .
If there is any tendency for life to evolve to get as functionally human - like as possible , then Lineweaver asks why have n't isolated part of Earth evolved human - like intelligence ?
Madagascar has been separated from Africa for millions of years , and should therefore be full of high - level primates instead of lemurs — apes ' distant cousins .
New Zealand ( which because of its isolation Jared Diamond said was " the best opportunity we 'll ever have to study life on another planet " ) should be filled with super - intelligent giant birds .

Lineweaver thinks that big brains are n't the be-all and end all of evolution .
In fact , he argues that the answer to Sagan 's question is " no " — functionally equivalent humans do n't exist elsewhere in the universe .
Instead , life elsewhere might be so weird as to be unrecognizable .
" Intelligence " could easily take the form of some kind of system at profound disequilibrium with its environment — something like a hurricane or a star could be intelligent .
It 's sounds like he 's begging to get the SETI Institute 's funding pulled , and to declare the entire SETI operation utterly useless , and in a sense he is .
But he also thinks it 's worth continuing the search because there 's a lot of unexplored universe still out there to look at .
And he admits he could be wrong — there could be a Planet of the Apes out there , too .

Canadian life insurers say the two activities pose the same risk and demand the same higher premiums from clients .
The insurance industry ’s national trade association argues the standard policy among insurers of tacking on increased costs to marijuana users – regardless of whether they smoke , vape or eat the drug – is based on available research .
The group also suggests pricier premiums could be due to the severity of a medical marijuana patient ’s underlying conditions .
But as medical marijuana use grows – and with legislation to legalize the drug just a year away – commercial producers and advocates are urging insurers to change policies that penalize people who use the drug , including the increasing number who ingest it in liquid form .
At the same time , commercial growers are also lobbying health insurance providers to cover medical marijuana prescriptions .

Some of the oldest tales and wisest mythology allude to the snake as a mischievous seducer , dangerous foe or powerful iconoclast ; however , the legend surrounding this proverbial predator may not be based solely on fantasy .
As scientists from the University of Virginia recently discovered , the common fear of snakes is most likely intrinsic .
Evolutionarily speaking , early humans who were capable of surviving the dangers of an uncivilized society adapted accordingly .
And the same can be said of the common fear of certain animals , such as spiders and snakes :
The ancestors of modern humans were either abnormally lucky or extraordinarily capable of detecting and deterring the threat of , for example , a poisonous snake .
Psychologists Vanessa LoBue and Judy DeLoache were able to show this phenomenon by examining the ability of adults and children to pinpoint snakes among other nonthreatening objects in pictures .
“ We wanted to know whether preschool children , who have much less experience with natural threats than adults , would detect the presence of snakes as quickly as their parents , ” LoBue explained .
“ If there is an evolved tendency in humans for the rapid detection of snakes , it should appear in young children as well as their elders . ”
Preschool children and their parents were shown nine color photographs on a computer screen and were asked to find either the single snake among eight flowers , frogs or caterpillars , or the single nonthreatening item among eight snakes .
As the study surprisingly shows , parents and their children identified snakes more rapidly than they detected the other stimuli , despite the gap in age and experience .

Democrat John Edwards looks down during a speech announcing he would withdraw his candidacy for US president in New Orleans , Louisiana January 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lee Celano
LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards said on Thursday he would not accept the nomination for U.S. vice president as he did four years ago .
Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , dropped out of the 2008 race that is still being contested by the two remaining Democrats , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , to see who represents the party in the November 4 general election .
Edwards was picked as running mate with Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry in 2004 but the two were defeated when President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were re-elected .
After his keynote speech at CTIA , the annual U.S. wireless industry showcase , Edwards was asked in a question - and - answer session if he would accept the nomination for vice president .
“ No , ” said Edwards , who also declined to say whether he would endorse Clinton or Obama .
Edwards dropped out of the presidential race after finishing third behind Obama and Clinton in key early nominating states .
Barack Obama wants to set the record straight .
He is not a Muslim , as recent e-mails falsely claim .
The Democratic presidential candidate is fighting the e-mails that have been widely circulated .
Obama has been continually speaking about the role of faith in politics since his Call to Renewal address in June 2006 .
In the days before the South Carolina primary , he is driving efforts to speaking with media to emphasize his Christian beliefs .
His campaign also sent out a recent mailer portraying the candidate with his head bowed in prayer and says that he will be guided by prayer when he is in office .
The senator from Illinois spoke with Sarah Pulliam and Ted Olsen today about his faith , abortion , and the evangelical vote .
What do you think your biggest obstacle will be in reaching evangelicals ?
You know , I think that there 's been a set of habits of thinking about the interaction between evangelicals and Democrats that we have to change .
Democrats have n't shown up .
Evangelicals have come to believe often times that Democrats are anti-faith .
Part of my job in this campaign , something that I started doing well before this campaign , was to make sure I was showing up and reaching out and sharing my faith experience with people who share that faith .
Hopefully we can build some bridges that can allow us to move the country forward .
What would you do in office differently than Hillary Clinton or John Edwards that would appeal to evangelicals ?
I have not focused on all of their policies so I do n't want to speak about what their positions will be .
I know that as president , I want to celebrate the richness and diversity of our faith experience in this country .
I think it is important for us to encourage churches and congregations ...

Carbon nanotubes used to reprogramme adult human cells ?
Nanotubes ( above ) were used to introduce a complex of proteins into testicular cells ( stained , below ) .
UNIDYM
A Californian biotech company claims that it has used carbon nanotubes to ‘ reprogramme ’ adult human cells to an embryonic - like state — a breakthrough that removes the elevated risk of cancer that blights other techniques .
But uncertainties about the cells , which have yet to be reported in a peer - reviewed journal , have left many sceptical .
PRIMEGEN
Last year , researchers led by Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University demonstrated that by using just four genes it was possible to reprogramme adult human skin cells to a stem - cell - like pluripotent state — meaning that they could develop into any of the body ’s cell types .
These ‘ induced pluripotent stem ’ ( iPS ) cells hold tremendous therapeutic potential .
But to insert the genes into the cells , researchers have had to use viral vectors , which can turn the cells cancerous .
PrimeGen , based in Irvine , claims to have got around this problem by using single - walled carbon nanotubes — cylinders of carbon molecules only a few nanometers in diameter — to introduce a complex of around a dozen proteins , including the ones coded for by the four genes used by Yamanaka , plus a fifth called Nanog .
The researchers used the nanotube delivery system to introduce genes into human testicular and retinal cells , and PrimeGen reports that they were quickly taken up by an impressive 80 % of the cells .
The method is based on work by Hongjie Dai of Stanford University in Palo Alto , California .
Dai ’s group has demonstrated that nanotubes can deliver cancer - targeting drugs1 , proteins and DNA2 into cells .
According to Dai , the nanotubes with their cargo are absorbed by the cells through endocytosis , a process by which the cell membrane envelopes molecules outside the cell , but there is uncertainty over how this happens .
PrimeGen has now announced an alliance with Unidym , based in Menlo Park , California , which makes the nanotubes .
Robert Bismuth , vice president of marketing at Unidym , says that the researchers used nanotubes because they “ are quite good at getting through a cell membrane ” and because their long tubular structure enables each to carry several molecules .
But on the bigger claim that they can reprogramme cells , PrimeGen president John Sundsmo admits a few problems .
He says that from around day three the cells start acting like embryonic stem cells and expressing proteins characterizing pluripotency .
But after day 14 “ they almost all stop ” .
“ It ’s like a switch is turned on and then turned off , ” Sundsmo says .
True embryonic stem cells and iPS cells exhibit pluripotent markers and proliferate quickly and endlessly .
“ They look really good .
But what I ’d really like to see is the paper published . ”
Konrad Hochedlinger , a stem - cell researcher at Harvard University who has done some of the most rigorous tests on iPS cells , suggests that the introduced factors produced a momentary blip of activity before being diluted .
“ These findings are less interesting as they may only reflect transient transcriptional changes but not stable cellular changes , ” he says .
However , Sundsmo says that the cells show a stable “ intermediate ” stage of reprogramming that will be useful for therapy and basic research .
He admits however the word “ intermediate ” is “ loose and somewhat arbitrary ” .
“ There is a disconnect between pluripotency and proliferation , ” he says .
“ We have n’t figured it out yet . ”
Sundsmo says that they await results of a teratoma test — where cells are allowed to develop in vivo — that could prove whether the cells actually are pluripotent .
Frank Edenhofer , a stem - cell expert at University of Bonn in Germany , calls the technique “ attractive and promising ” .
But his own experiments have shown nanoparticles to be “ toxic and display low efficiency ” .
Other groups have also found that nanotubes can kill cells and have difficulty releasing their cargo .
Matt Becker of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Maryland , says that the ability of nanotubes to transfect cells without doing harm “ depends critically on how the materials were prepared , dispersed in solution , and specific mechanism of entry into the cell interior ” .
Few scientists have seen PrimeGen ’s cells .
One , Peter Donovan , a stem - cell expert at the University of California in Irvine and a member of PrimeGen ’s advisory board , says : “ They look really good .
But what I ’d really like to see is the paper published . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Most scientists contacted by Nature have expressed scepticism because PrimeGen announced its findings on 26 February at an investors meeting rather than in a scientific publication .
Another PrimeGen scientific advisory board member , stem - cell pioneer Rudolf
Jaenisch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , told Nature , without giving a reason , that he quit the board the following day .
PrimeGen seemed unaware of Jaenisch ’s move when contacted by Nature .
Sundsmo says that they decided to announce the results ahead of publication because the company has already filed patent applications .
He says : “ This is conceptually a very simple observation that is easily repeated . ”
Two years ago , PrimeGen similarly publicized experimental results describing the derivation of pluripotent stem cells from sperm precursor cells ( see Nature 440 , 586–587 ; 2006 ) .
At the time PrimeGen told Nature they would publish a paper , but have n’t .
Sundsmo says that the science behind that paper , which has been at the core of the company ’s technology , had to be reformulated because of internal disagreement over what the experiment showed .
Sundsmo says that half the company was let go and that the paper has been accepted for publication .
New biography of shadowy Iraq figure Chalabi recalls ties to McCain
Ahmed Chalabi , former deputy prime minister of Iraq , is the subject of a new biography that reportedly reveals some shocking new examples of Chalabi 's scandalous role in US foreign policy .
Considered by some to be a neo-con " darling , " Chalabi is best known for his role in pushing questionable evidence in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq , including since - debunked claims dealing with biological weapons laboratories from the Iraqi defector code - named " Curveball . "
RAW STORY has covered other events in Chalabi 's colorful past as war cheerleader , including his re-entry into US policy - making in 2006 when it was reported that he had taken over a role as broker between the US Ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad , and Iranian officials .
In early 2007 , RAW STORY also reported that Chalabi was moving into a new role as part of the so - called " surge " in Iraq .
Among the revelations disclosed in the biography by Emmy award - winning journalist Aram Roston , The Man Who Pushed America to War : The Extraordinary Life , Adventures and Obsessions of Ahmad Chalabi , are that Chalabi " helped arrange meetings with the Iraqi oil minister for American oilmen like Bush fundraiser Albert Huddleston . "
Chalabi also reportedly " misled a team of reporters from ABC News and British publications by arranging interviews with ' Saddam 's Mistress , ' Parisoula Lampsos , who peddled countless lies about a meeting between Hussein and Osama Bin Laden " and was initially backed by Sen.
John McCain , " one of the first patrons of Chalabi 's grand - sounding International Committee for a Free Iraq when it was founded in 1991 . "
Regarding McCain , Roston adds that he was " Chalabi 's favored candidate in the 2000 election since Chalabi knew that he would be able to free up the $ 97 million in military aid plus millions pushed through in Congress and earmarked for Chalabi's exile group , the Iraqi National Congress . "
The funds were held up , however , by the Clinton administration 's State Department , Roston writes .

Here 's a question to think about over the weekend :
Is capitalism immoral ?
Stefan
Theil seems to think that is what is being taught to European school kids .
In an article in the January / February edition of Foreign Policy magazine , Stefan Theil concluded that Europe , particularly France and Germany , are teaching their children a " philosophy of failure , " based on the idea that capitalism is immoral , savage and unhealthy .
Theil - whose day job is European economics editor for Newsweek - cites a 2005 poll in which only 36 % of French ...
Parkinson 's disease affects cells in the brain
The study in Nature Medicine provides the best evidence so far that the controversial technique could one day help people with the condition .
The Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Centre team say it is the first time animals have been successfully treated with their own cloned cells .
UK experts said the work was promising and exciting development .
No rejection
In Parkinson 's disease , nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls muscle movement either die or become impaired .
Normally , these cells produce a vital chemical known as dopamine , which allows smooth , co-ordinated function of the body 's muscles and movement .
This is an exciting development , as for the first time , we can see that it may be possible to create a person 's own embryonic stem cells to potentially treat their Parkinson's
Dr Kieran Breen , Parkinson 's Disease Society
In therapeutic cloning , the nucleus of a cell is inserted into an egg with the nucleus removed .
This cell then develops into an embryo from which stem cells can be harvested and used as a treatment .
In this study , stem cells were developed into dopamine - producing neurons the missing nerve cells in Parkinson 's disease .
The mice that received neurons derived from their own clones showed significant signs of improvement .
But when these neurons were grafted into mice that did not genetically match the transplanted cells , the cells did not survive and the mice did not recover .
The researchers say the therapy is promising because , as the cells originally came from the animal that was ill , they were not rejected by its immune system .
' Great hope '
Scientists are pursuing the use of stem cell therapy for Parkinson 's disease because it would allow the replacement of the dead dopamine - producing nerve cells with new , healthy cells .
This should restore the supply of dopamine within the brain and allow it to work normally again .
However , the challenge has been to produce nerve cells which can survive after transplantation .
Dr Kieran Breen , director of research and development at the Parkinson 's Disease Society said : " This is an exciting development , as for the first time , we can see that it may be possible to create a person 's own embryonic stem cells to potentially treat their Parkinson's .
" Researchers in this area now need to carry out more studies to satisfy safety concerns and to make the process more efficient before these studies are carried out on people living with Parkinson's . "
He added : " Stem cell therapy offers great hope for repairing the brain in people with Parkinson's .
" It may ultimately offer a cure , allowing people to lead a life that is free from the symptoms of Parkinson's . "
Professor Robin Lovell - Badge , an expert in stem cell research at the National Institute of Medical Research , said this was good research which showed using therapeutic cloning could be beneficial .
" There was a very significant level of recovery .
But he added : " They only studied the mice for 11 weeks afterwards , which is not a huge amount of time to see how persistent the repaid would be . "
However , the experts said much more research in both animals and humans was needed before the treatment could be offered to people with Parkinson's .
In a separate study , a team from University College London have discovered mutations in a gene which may trigger Parkinson 's in people with a family history of the condition .
The finding could provide scientists with a clue as to what causes Parkinson 's - and could contribute to the search for new treatments .
Inside Donna Brazile 's BlackBerry
Commmenters on the fiercely pro-Hillary site HillaryIs44 have posted a couple of e-mails from Donna Brazile that capture some of the e-mail heat that superdelegates are taking -- in her case , from Clinton supporters angry at what they see as her stealth support for Obama in an op - ed calling on Hillary to stop throwing elbows .
Brazile responded to one angry e-mail :
Do you know how many undeclared supers are now just turned off by people like you ?
Do you understand you ’re hurting her and not promoting Hillary ?
Perhaps that explains why a candidate like Obama has raised $ 40 million in one month .
You do n’t have to e-mail me again .
And also :
I just sent Hillary a private e-mail telling her that supporters like you are destroying her candidacy .
I spoke to Brazile just now , who confirmed that she 's been shocked by the volume of " toxic " e-mails and responded to some of them .
Supporters of both candidates , of course , get pretty toxic at times ( see the comments section on this blog ) , and the heat is pretty jarring to many who have spent careers in Democratic politics .
The Senate is getting ready to vote on a key torture amendment today , making the Army field manual rules regarding torture apply to the entire government .
At one point during the campaign McCain praised the Army field manual as the way to go – Life is not “ 24 , ” McCain said at the time .
So how will McCain vote today ?
Will he support the Army field manual ?
Will he oppose it ?
Or will he just blow off the vote entirely on one of his signature issues that he claims he cares so much about ?
Watch McCain talk about how supportive he is of the Army field manual on torture :

PS The amendment ’s author is Senator Dianne Feinstein of California .
Now , Feinstein drives us nuts sometimes ( okay , a lot of times ) with her conservative votes .
But sometimes she also does good .
This is one of those times .
Just worth mentioning .
About 300 people gathered during the noon hour today at the state Capitol to ask state Rep. Sally Kern to apologize for calling homosexuality the biggest threat to America .
The Rev. Jim Shields , a retired United Methodist minister who lives in Kern 's district that covers parts of west Oklahoma City and Bethany , called on the Republican legislator to hold meetings in the district to talk with gays and Muslims .
If Kern does n't do those things , then she should resign , said the Rev. Loyce Newton - Edwards , assistant pastor of the Open Arms United Church of Christ and president of the Oklahoma City chapter of PFLAG , Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays .
Kern , a Republican , was not in the Capitol during the 40 - minute event in the first - floor rotunda .
The House adjourned about 10 a.m. after a one - hour session today .
AS Bill Clinton was the first baby boomer president , Barack Obama could be the first Generation X president .
Or , depending on how you figure it , Mr. Obama , born in 1961 , could be the third boomer in chief , following Presidents Clinton and Bush .
In theory , the candidate Obama belongs in the boom , defined by the Census Bureau as births during the years 1946 to 1964 .
But the practice of defining generations is more complicated than the theory .
Often their labels are about as helpful as parents who imagine that if two children are 7 , they should play together .
Generations have a natural fluidity  it can be hard to say where one group ends and the next begins .
And in the case of the current presidential campaign , some clashes between age groups are as contrived as the groups themselves .
A bar of chocolate , a long soak in the bath , a snooze in the middle of the afternoon , a leisurely stroll in the park .
These are the things that make us the most happy , according to new research from The University of Nottingham .
In a study commissioned by the National Lottery , Dr Richard Tunney of the University ’s School of Psychology found that it ’s the simple things in life that impact most positively on our sense of well being .
The study compared the ‘ happiness levels ’ of lottery jackpot winners with a control group , using a ‘ Satisfaction with Life Scale ’ developed by the University of Illinois .
Respondents were asked how satisfied they were in relation to different elements of their life , their different mood states explored , how often they treated themselves and what form this took .
Surprisingly , it was n’t the flashy cars and diamond jewellery that upped the jackpot winners ’ happiness quotient .
It was the listening to music , reading a book , or enjoying a bottle of wine with a takeaway that really made the difference .
Dr Tunney said : “ Modern - day pressures take their toll on everyday happiness .
As a result we try to make ourselves feel better and happier through personal rewards and treats .
We ’ve all heard the saying ‘ a little bit of what you fancy does you good ’ , and treating yourself is the ideal way to keep spirits lifted when you ’re down in the dumps .
“ As lottery jackpot winners are on the whole happier than non-winners — 95 per cent claim they are positive about their life compared to 71 per cent of people in the control group — we researched the treats they rewarded themselves with to see what could influence their mood state . ”
The survey contrasted cost - free activities , such as walking and snoozing , with expensive ones like overseas holidays .
It asked how frequently they might purchase ‘ staying in treats ’ — like a bottle of wine — and how often they bought themselves items like shoes , mobile phones and DVDs .
The research found that happy people — whether lottery jackpot winners or not — liked long baths , going swimming , playing games and enjoying their hobby .
Those who described themselves as less happy did n’t choose the cost - free indulgences .
They rewarded themselves with CDs , cheap DVDs and inexpensive meals out instead .
“ While buying sports cars , giving up work and going on exotic holidays is out of reach for most of us , there are small lessons we can learn from society ’s happiest people to help improve our quality of life , ” Dr Tunney added .
“ It appears that spending time relaxing is the secret to a happy life .
Cost - free pleasures are the ones that make the difference — even when you can afford anything that you want . ”
This article should come in handy for the next time you 're stuck in traffic : have you ever wondered why the Audi in front of you has a logo of four interlocked rings ?
Did you know that the Cadillac emblem was inspired by a family crest of a nobleman who later turned out to be a fraud ?
Or that Volkswagen was Hitler 's idea ?
We took a look at the evolution of tech logos before .
Today , let 's take a look at the fascinating stories behind the logos of some of the most popular cars in the world :
Alfa Romeo
Source : Cartype
Surprise !
Alfa Romeo , the car manufacturer and pride of Italy , traced its beginnings to France .
In 1910 , Milan aristocrat Cavaliere Ugo Stella collaborated with the French car company Darracq to market the line in Italy .
When the partnership failed , Stella moved the company and renamed it Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili ( Lombard Automobile Factory , Public Company ) or A.L.F.A .
Alfa Romeo's distinctive logo was created in 1910 by a draftsman named Romano Cattaneo .
One day , while waiting for a tram at the Piazza Castello station in Milan , he was inspired by the red cross in the Milan Flag and the Coat of Arms of the noble House of Visconti , which featured a biscione ( grass snake ) with a man in its jaws , symbolizing " Visconti ’s enemies that the snake [ was ] always ready to destroy . "
( Source ) Two Savoia dynasty knots separated the words ALFA and MILANO .
The Romeo part came in 1916 when Neapolitan businessman Nicola Romeo bought the company and converted its factories to produce munitions and machineries for World War I .
After the war , the company went back to producing cars and took on its owner 's last name to become Alfa Romeo .
Aston Martin
In 1913 , Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford founded a company that later would become Aston Martin .
At the time , Martin & Bamford Limited produced Singers racing cars , but the duo wanted to create a more sophisticated model of their own .
They named their first car Aston Martin after the founder Lionel Martin and the Aston Clinton hill climb racing course where their Singers car had won previously .
We can't talk about Aston Martin without mentioning James Bond .
In 1959 , Ian Fleming put his super spy James Bond in an Aston Martin DB Mark III .
When it was made into a movie in 1964 , Bond drove an updated , supersleek silver Aston Martin DB5 ( complete with machine gun , passenger ejector seat , and revolving number plates ! )
James Bond and his Aston Martin DB5 in Goldfinger
Interestingly , Ian Fleming himself did n't drive Aston Martin .
He preferred the 1963 Studebaker Avanti !
Audi
German engineer August Horch , who used to work for Karl Benz , founded his own automobile company A. Horch & Cie in 1899 .
A decade later , he was forced out of his own company and set up a new company in another town and continued using the Horch brand .
His former partners sued him , and August Horch was forced to look for a new name .
When Horch was talking to his business partner Franz Fikentscher at Franz 's apartment , Franz 's son came up with the name Audi :
During this meeting Franz 's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room .
Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working , until he finally blurted out , " Father - audiatur et altera pars ... would n't it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch ? " .
" Horch ! " in German means " Hark ! " or " listen " , which is " Audi " in Latin .
The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting .
( Source : Wikipedia , A History of Progress ( 1996 ) - Chronicle of the Audi AG )
And so Audiwerke GmbH was born in 1910 .
In 1932 , four car makers Audi , Horch , DKW , and Wanderer merged to form Auto Union .
The logo of Auto Union , four interlinked rings that would later become the modern Audi logo , was used only in racing cars - the four factories continued to produce cars under their own names and emblems .
Four car companies became Auto Union ( 1932 )
Fast forward to 1985 ( skipping a whole lot of history ) , when Auto Union ultimately became the Audi we know today .
BMW
Source : Motorcycle
In 1913 , Karl Friedrich Rapp and Gustav Otto founded two separate aircraft factories that would later merge to form BMW or Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ( Bavarian Motor Works ) .
Rapp and Otto actually had little to do with BMW 's manufacturing of cars .
Josef Popp , Max Friz and Camillo Castiglioni were the ones who played big roles in making BMW a modern car manufacturer .
Source : Cartype
The circular BMW logo was a representation of a spinning propeller of a Bavarian Luftwaffe .
At the time , aircrafts were painted with regional colors and the colors of the Bavarian flag were white and blue .
It is said that the pilot saw the propeller as alternating segments of white and blue , hence the logo .
The roundel was a nod to Karl Rapp 's original company .
During World War I , BMW was a major supplier of airplane engines ( and later airplanes such as the Red Baron ) ( thanks Redditors ! ) to the German government .
After the war , Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles to manufacture airplanes and BMW was forced to change its business : it first made railway brakes before making motorized bicycle , motorcycles and cars .
Update 3/6/08 : Neatorama readers Dan S. and Bruce Kennedy who pointed out that the idea of BMW logo being derived from spinning propeller was actually an advertisement by the company ( scroll down about halfway ) .
Also thanks to klaus who pointed us out to the logo of EMW , which BMW took over in 1928 .
Buick
Early Buick emblems ( source : Buick Car Club of Australia )
The Buick Motor Company was founded in 1903 by David Dunbar Buick , a Scottish - American inventor who invented the overhead valve engine .
If you did n't recognize the name , you 're not alone - but remember this : Buick , a high school drop out founded a company that later became the world 's largest auto company , General Motors .
At 15 years of age , Buick dropped out of school to work for a plumbing fixture manufacturer .
When that business failed , Buick and his friend took it over - but within a few years , Buick had an argument with his partner because he preferred to spend his time tinkering with car engines .
Buick sold his share in the company and quit .
With the money , Buick founded the Buick Motor Company and within a few years ran it to the ground .
He was kicked out of the company by his partner William " Billy " Durant in 1906 and later sold his stock for a mere $ 100,000 .
Had he held on to his shares , it would 've been worth well over $ 100 million today .
In his later years , Buick held low - paying jobs and could n't even afford a telephone .
He died penniless as an inspector at the Detroit School of Trades .
Ironically , years later Durant himself would be forced out .
General Motors , the company that Durant built , refused him pension and he died almost penniless .

Buick crests and tri-shields ( source : Buick Car Club of Australia )
Back to the logo story : Early Buick logos were variations of the cursive word " Buick . "
In 1930s , General Motor Styling researcher Ralph Pew found a description of the Scottish " Buik " [ sic ] family crest and decided to use it as a radiator grille decoration .
In 1960 , the logo incorporated three such shields , to represent the three Buick models then built : LeSabre , Invicta , and Electra .
In 1975 , Buick changed their logo to a hawk named " Happy " with the launch of their Skyhawk line .
However , in the late 1980s , as the Skyhawk car was retired , Buick went back to the tri-shield logo .
Cadillac
Source : car -nection.com , who has lots more Cadillac emblems .
When Henry Ford left his second automobile company , Henry Ford Company ( see below ) , his financial backers tried to liquidate the company 's assets .
An engineer named Henry M. Leland persuaded them to continue the company instead .
They listened , and so Cadillac was born .
Cadillac 's first logo was based on a family crest of a minor aristocrat that the company was named after : Antoine de La Mothe , Seigneur de Cadillac ( Sir of Cadillac ) .
In 1701 , de La Mothe founded Fort Pontchartrain which would later become Detroit .
Cadillac was named after de La Mothe in 1902 , following a bicentenary celebration of the founding of the city .
Problem was , de La Mothe was never a nobility !
Born Antoine Laumet , de La Mothe was forced to leave France for America under a mysterious circumstance ( some say he committed a crime or was unable to pay his debt ) .
In the New World , he was able to assume a new identity and cobbled together a famiy crest with elements " borrowed " from , shall we say nobler sources .
Source : car-nection.com
In 1998 , Cadillac had a new design philosophy called " art and science " and had its logo redesigned .
Gone were the six birds called the merlettes , the crown , and the entire fabricated de La Mothe family crest as the company tried to shake up its stodgy image .
The new logo made its debut a few years later , looking positively like it was made by Piet Mondrian !
Fiat

Fiat , then named Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino ( Italian Automobile Factory of Turin ) , was founded in 1899 by a group of investors , including Giovanni Agnelli who later became its Managing Director .
Agnelli bought his shares for $ 400 ( about $ 10,000 in 2007 money ) .
It 's worth billions now , and there had been an Agnelli in Fiat management ever since .
Regardless or perhaps because of its wealth , the Agnelli clan remained a fractious and complicated group of people .
Supposedly , the famous Fiat " scrabble tiles " logo of the 1960s was designed by the company 's Chief Designer who was driving past the Fiat factory during a power outage and saw an outline of the factory 's neon sign against the dark sky ( Source : The Language of Auto Emblems )
Ford
Most people know that Ford was founded by ( who else ? )
Henry Ford .
What most people did n't know was that this was his third automobile company .
Ford experimented with cars while working for Thomas Edison , and left to found his first auto company , The Detroit Automobile Company , which went bankrupt in just 2 years .
He then built a race car and founded Henry Ford Company .
Ford left that one after just one year ( the company later became Cadillac - see above ) .
In 1902 , Ford went on to create his third automobile company , the Ford & Malcomson , Ltd. , and almost lost that one when sales were slow .
He was unable to pay his bills to John and Horace Dodge , who supplied parts .
Ford 's partner brought in a group of investors and even convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept shares in the company , which was renamed Ford Motor Company .
Later , the Dodge Brothers went on to form their own car company ( can you guess what ? )
In 1909 , Childe Harold Wills , Ford 's first chief engineer and designer ( who also help to design the Model T ) , lend a script font that he created to make his own business card , to create the Ford logo .
The famous blue oval was added later for the 1927 Model A - it remained in use until today .
Mazda
Source : Mazda [ wikipedia ] and Mazda Brand Evolution
Mazda began its life in 1920 as the Toyo Cork Kogyo Co. in Hiroshima , Japan .
At the time , there was a cork shortage because of World War I , so the company was founded to process a cork substitute made from the bark of an Abemaki or Chinese cork oak tree .
It was a good idea at the time , but shortly afterwards Japan could get real cork again and the company foundered .
In 1927 , Jujiro Matsuda came onboard and the company began manufacturing tools , three - wheeled " trucks " and then cars .
After World War II , the company formally adopted the name Mazda , which depending on who you ask , stood for the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda or an anglicized pronunciation of Matsuda the founder 's name ( or both ) .
In the 1936 logo , the M shaped curve was inspired by the emblem of Hiroshima city .
The 1991 and 1992 logos symbolized a wing , the Sun and a circle of light .
Mazda 's current logo , nicknamed the " owl " logo , was designed by Rei Yoshimara in 1997 .
The stylized " M " was meant to look like stretched wings , but many people saw a stylized tulip instead .
Mercedes - Benz
Source : Mercedez - Benz UK
The modern Mercedes - Benz traced its lineage to a 1926 merger of two car companies , Daimler - Motored - Gesellschaft or DMG , founded by Gottlieb Daimler ( along with Wilhelm Maybach ) , and Benz & Cie , founded by Karl Benz .
Both Daimler and Benz worked independently to invent internal combustion - powered automobiles .
Their factories were actually just 60 miles apart , yet they did n't know of each other 's early work .
After World War I , the German economy was in tatters , and to survive , the two companies formed a syndicate in 1924 , where they would continue to sell their separate brands but would standardize design , share purchasing and advertising .
In 1926 , however , the two companies merged into Daimler - Benz .
The name " Mercedes " came about in 1900 .
A wealthy European businessman and racing enthusiast named Emil Jellinek began selling Daimler 's cars .
He wanted a faster car , and specified a new engine to be designed by Maybach and to be named after his 10 - year - old daughter 's nickname , Mercédès or Spanish for " grace . " " Mercy " ( See below )
Jellinek was quite a character .
He used to pepper DMG 's engineers with colorful suggestions and criticism such as " Your manure wagon has just broken down on schedule " and " You are all donkeys " .
However , as he actually sold a lot of cars , he was tolerated and even listened to .
Later , Jellinek would add Mercedes to his own and became Emil Jellinek - Mercedes .
( Source : My Father Mr. Mercedes by Guy Jellinek - Mercedes and MBUSA Biographies )
The star in Daimler 's logo came from an old postcard where Gottlieb Daimler had drawn a star above the picture of his house and wrote that " this star would one day shine over [ his ] own factory to symbolize prosperity . "
The three - pointed star symbolized Daimler 's ambition of making vehicles " on land , on water and in the air . "
( Source : Daimler )
After the merger , a new logo was designed .
It combined the symbols of the two companies : the three - pointed star of DMG and the laurel wreath of Benz .
Update 2/18/08 : There 's a dispute on the origin of the name " Mercedes . "
According to Baby Names World , Mercedes is a girl 's name of Spanish origin meaning " Mercy . "
It was taken from the Virgin Mary 's liturgical title " Maria de las Mercedes " ( Mary of the Mercies ; ' Our Lady of Ransom ' ) :
Latin ' mercedes ' originally meant ' wages ' or ' ransom ' .
In Christian theology , Christ 's sacrifice is regarded as a ' ransom for the sins of mankind ' , hence an ' act of ransom ' was seen as identical with an ' act of mercy ' .
Mitsubishi

In 1854 feudal Japan , a man named Yataro Iwasaki , son of a provincial farmer whose grandfather sold the family 's samurai status to settle some debt , began his career on the wrong foot : he was called home from school at the age of 19 when his father was injured in a dispute with the village leader .
Iwasaki asked a local magistrate to hear his case , and when refused , accused the man of corruption .
Iwasaki was promptly jailed for seven months .
Fast forward to 1868 : Iwasaki was working for the Tosa clan when the Meiji Restoration abolished Japan 's feudal clan system .
He acquired Tsukumo Shokai , the Tosa clan 's shipping business and renamed it Mitsubishi in 1873 .
It was a fourth - generation Iwasaki , a man named Kayota Iwasaki , who turned Mitsubishi into a giant corporate group that included an automobile manufacturing company , Mitsubishi Motors .
The name Mitsubishi was a combination of the words " mitsu " ( three ) and " hishi " ( water chestnut , used in Japan to mean a rhombus or a diamond shape ) .
The official translation of the name was " three diamonds . "
The Mitsubishi logo was a combination of the Iwasaki family crest , three stacked diamonds , and the three - leaf crest of the Tosa Clan .
Peugeot

Peugeot got its start in 1812 in Montbeliard , France , when two brothers , Jean - Pierre and Jean - Frédéric Peugeot converted their windmill into a steel mill .
Their first products were rolled steel for saw blades and clock springs , as well as cylindrical steel rods .
For decades , the Peugeot family business made metal goods , machine tools , crinoline dresses , umbrellas , wire wheels , irons , sewing machines , kitchen gadgets and by 1885 , bicycles .
Indeed , Peugeot 's entry into the automobile business was by way of bicycles .
At the time , the company was one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in France .
In 1889 , Armand Peugeot created the company 's first steam - powered car .
A year later , he abandoned steam in favor of gas - powered internal combustion engine after meeting Gottlieb Daimler .
The Peugeot " lion " logo was designed by jeweler and engraver Justin Blazer in 1847 .
It was based on the flag of the Région Franche - Comté .
The logo was stamped on Peugeot kitchen gadgets to denote the quality of their steel .
It took Armand 14 years to convince his family that cars could be a moneymaker .
Only then did they allow him to use the Peugeot lion logo .

Now , you may not drive a Peugeot car , but I bet you 've used a Peugeot invention of 1842 : the peppermill .
The mill ' smechanism was so reliable that it remained virtually unchanged until today .

Louis Renault was 21 when he made his first car in the backyard of his parent 's home .
He soon got orders for cars , so in 1898 , along with his brothers and friends , Louis opened the company Société Renault Frères in Boulogne - Billancourt , France .
The first Renault logo , drawn in 1900 featured the three initials of the Renault brothers : Louis , Ferdinand and Marcel .
In 1906 , the logo changed to a front end of a car enclosed in a gear wheel .

During World War I , Renault manufactured light tanks for the Allies called the Renault FT - 17 .
This was so popular that after the war , Renault actually changed its logo into a tank .
The diamond shape was introduced in 1925 and remained until today .
The modern Renault logo was created in 1972 by Victor Vasarely [ offical website | wikipedia ] , the father of Op art ( or optical art ) .
Saab
If you 've ever seen a Saab car commercial , then you 'd know that the company was " born from jets " .
You would n't know it from the car 's staid style , but historically this was accurate :
In 1937 , an aircraft company called Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget ( " Swedish Aeroplane Limited " or simply SAAB ) was created to meet the needs of the Swedish Air Force .
When World War II ended , SAAB the airplane company started making cars to diversify its business .
The first car it made was a prototype called the the Saab 92001 or ursaab ( meaning " original Saab " ) in 1946 .
It was test - driven for nearly 330,000 miles ( 530,000 km ) in utter secrecy , usually on narrow and muddy forest roads in the early mornings or late nights .
In 1947 , the Saab Automobile company was incorporated .
The company 's first car was the Saab 92 , named because it was simply the company 's 92nd design project ( the previous 91 had all been aircraft ) .
The griffen logo , featuring the head of a mythological beast that had a body of a lion and head and wings of an eagle , came from Vadis - Scania , a truck manufacturer that merged with SAAB ( airplane ) company .
The griffen was a coat of arms of the province Scania .
In 2000 , Saab Automobile company was bought out by General Motors , and thus no longer had any connection with SAAB outside of its history and logo similarities .

Volkswagen
Source : TheSamba
You would n't know it from the company 's website but Volkswagen ( German for " People 's Car " ) can trace its history straight to the villain of World War II : Adolf Hitler .
Here 's the short version of the story : After World War I , Germany 's economy was shot and cars cost more than most people can afford .
When Hitler rose to power and became Chancellor , he spoke at the 1933 Berlin Auto Show of his idea to create a new and affordable car .
At the same time , Ferdinand Porsche ( yes , that Porsche ) was designing an odd - looking yet inexpensive car ( which would later become the Volkswagen Beetle ) .
Porsche met with Hitler in 1934 , who asked that the car to have the following specifications : it should have a top speed of 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) , a fuel consumption of 42 mpg , and could carry 2 adults and 3 children .
He said the car should look like a Maikaefer - a May beetle and even gave Porsche a sketch of the basic design .
Porsche promised to deliver the design , with prototype cars to be built by Daimler - Benz .
In 1937 , the Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH was created ( it became simply Volkswagenwerk GmbH a year later ) .
In 1938 , Hitler opened the state - funded Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg , which was to produce the KdF - wagen ( kraft durch freude , meaning " strength through joy " ) .
Few were actually built , instead , the factory ( employing forced labor ) churned out military car , based on the same chassis : the Kübelwagen , Schwimmwagen , and Kommandeurwagen .
( Source )
It was later found out that Hitler had this in mind all along .
He added an extra secret specification to Porsche 's design : the car was to be able to carry 3 men , a machine gun , and ammunition .
After Germany was defeated in World War II , the British took over the Volkswagen factory and the KdF - Wagen was renamed the Beetle .
The British then sought to give control of the company - first they asked the Ford Motor Company , then the French Government , other British car manufacturers and lastly , Fiat .
All turned down this " free offer " because they thought the Beetle 's design was inferior and that the company would be a money drain .
( Source : The Auto Channel )
So , the British gave the Volkswagen company back to the German government in a trust .
Later , having sold more than 21 million cars , the Volkswagen Beetle would become one of the world 's best selling cars ever .
The VW logo itself was supposedly designed by Franz Xavier Reimspiess , an employee of Porsche , during an office logo design competition .
He was given a one time payment of 100 Reichsmarks ( about $ 400 ) .
If you did n't see your favorite car 's logo history , chances are it is because its logo did n't change much over the years .
There are also dozens of large car companies in the world ( many more if you counted the defunct ones ) , and we could n't fit every single one in this article .

Cancer cells divide in uncontrolled and rapid fashion
They believe it could now be possible to tamper with the mechanism - and stop tumour growth in its tracks .
Harvard Medical School identified an enzyme which enables cancer cells to consume the huge quantities of glucose they need to fuel uncontrolled growth .
Writing in Nature , they describe how starving cancer cells of the enzyme curbed their growth .
We do n't yet know whether these findings can be applied to human cancers outside the lab
Dr Joanna Peak

The key enzyme , pyruvate kinase , comes in two forms , but the Harvard team found that only one - the PKM2 form - enables cancer cells to consume glucose at an accelerated rate .
When the researchers forced cancer cells to switch to the other form of pyruvate kinase in the lab by knocking out production of PKM2 , the cells ' growth was curbed .
When the cells were injected into mice , they were much less able to produce tumours .
Warburg effect
The fact that proliferating cancer cells are able to consume glucose at a much higher rate than normal cells was first discovered by the German Nobel prize - winning chemist Otto Warburg more than 75 years ago .
He also showed that the amount of glucose the cells needed to keep their vital signs ticking over was minimal , allowing them to grow and divide at the prodigious rate usually associated with foetal cells .
Warburg 's discoveries are still used today to detect spreading cancers .
However , until now the chemistry behind the " Warburg Effect " has not been well understood .
The researchers said the exact chemistry behind glucose metabolism probably varied between types of cancer .
However , lead researcher Professor Lewis Cantley said : " Because PKM2 is found in all of the cancer cells that we have examined , because it is not found in most normal adult tissues , and because it is critical for tumour formation , this form of pyruvate kinase is a possible target for cancer therapy . "
Dr Joanna Peak , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " We do n't yet know whether these findings can be applied to human cancers outside the lab , so more research is needed before we can consider developing cancer treatments that target this process . "
However , Dr Peak said a drug called DCA which is thought to act on the relevant pathway was currently undergoing tests .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A meteorite that struck Peru in September , digging out a deep hole and startling nearby residents , traveled faster and hit harder than would have been expected , researchers reported on Tuesday .

The object , which left a 49 - foot - wide ( 15 meter ) crater , was made of rock and , in theory , should have disintegrated in the atmosphere long before reaching the Earth ’s surface , said Peter Schultz , a professor of geological sciences at Brown University in Rhode Island .
And it may have .
But the pieces stayed together and were speeding at 15,000 mph ( 24,000 kph ) when they hit , Schultz told the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in League City , Texas .
Usually only meteorites made of metal make it to the surface intact enough to scoop out a crater .
“ They come into the atmosphere , they slow down , and they plop , ” Schultz said in a telephone interview .
“ It would make a hole in the ground , like a pit , but not a crater .
But this meteorite kept on going at a speed about 40 to 50 times faster than it should have been going . ”
It landed in an arroyo , or dry stream , and the pit quickly filled with water from underneath the surface .
Schultz said his team ’s observations suggest that scientists may need to change theories about the different ways objects can hit planets .
“ We have to go back to the drawing board and think again , ” he said .
Dozens of people who visited the crater , near Lake Titicaca and the border with Bolivia , reported vomiting and headaches afterward .
Some questioned whether the noise and hole were actually caused by a meteorite .
“ That is one of the reasons we went down .
We wanted to distinguish fact from fiction , ” Schultz said .
“ These reports of all these people being sick were grossly exaggerated .
They did n’t get sick .
They were surprised . ”
FASTBALL FROM SPACE
A team from Johnson Space Center in Houston analyzed two chunks of dark gray rock from the meteorite and told the meeting they look nothing like meteorites from known sources such as Mars .
Schultz , whose team inspected the crater 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) south of Lima , said its unusually loud and messy impact happened because it was spinning and going so quickly .
“ This just is n’t what we expected , ” Schultz said .
“ It was to the point that many thought this was fake .
It was completely inconsistent with our understanding how stony meteorites act . ”
At such high velocity , fragments may not escape past the “ shock - wave ” barrier accompanying the meteorite , he said .
“ It became very streamlined and so it penetrated the Earth ’s atmosphere more efficiently , ” Schultz said .
He compared it to a flock of geese drafting behind one another in V - shaped flight .
He said this could challenge conventional wisdom that all small , stony meteorites disintegrate before striking Earth .
“ You just wonder how many other lakes and ponds were created by a stony meteorite , but we just do n’t know about them because when these things hit the surface they just completely pulverize and then they weather , ” said Schultz .
The findings may also help explain what caused various craters on Mars , he said .
October 18 , 2007 - 2:16 pm — Kitty Diggins
Here 's a link to my latest blog giving an update on the below situation .
From AMP member Kitty Diggins :
An " artist " from Costa Rica - Guillermo Habacuc Vargas - as an installation piece took a dog from the street and caused it to suffer and starve to death in the name of Art .
It looked like this ( click on link and scroll down ) :
http://elperritovive.blogspot.com/
While I do not believe in censorship , I do believe that a line must be drawn when it involves taking an unwilling model and using them against their wishes .
Maybe it is not very humane of me , but I strongly believe that people who use and abuse animals , or people for that matter , for any reason , deserve to have the same thing happen to them .
It may be an old cliché that many artists suffer in various ways for their work , but causing another being to suffer is another story .
I did not compose the following letter .
I believe it was composed by a British artist .
I am reposting it and encourage you to examine it and do something about it .
Read on , as more information follows the letter .
EXHIBITION IS TAKING PLACE AT :
info@madc.ac.cr
Centro Nacional de la Cultura
Antigua Fábrica Nacional de Licores .
Avenida 3 , calle 15 /17 .
San José , Costa Rica .
Teléfono : ( 506 ) 257 7202 / 257 9370
Fax : ( 506 ) 257 8702
SAMPLE LETTER TO SEND THE GALLERY :
I am writing regarding the horrifying actions of Guillermo Habacuc Vargas , who paid local children to catch a dog on the street and then confined , starved and publicly displayed the dog as an " art " exhibit until the innocent animal died of starvation .
I , along with many people worldwide , am outraged that Guillermo Habacuc Vargas has been selected to represent Costa Rica in " Bienal Centroamericana Honduras 2008 . ”
This man is by no definition of the word an artist .
He is a criminally insane sadist and enjoys inflicting prolonged suffering upon his innocent victims .
He is a danger to all of society , as it is well - documented that those with the capacity to intentionally cause harm to an animal have the same capacity to harm humans .
To state that this animal would have died eventually of natural causes is unjustifiable and defies logical , rational thought .
To allow Guillermo Habacuc Vargas to represent Costa Rica in Bienal Centroamericana Honduras 2008 will in no way benefit Costa Rica .
The world is watching , and the actions of this so - called artist have brought many negative assumptions as to the humanity of the people of Costa Rica .
The fact that many witnesses of this animal ’s suffering did nothing , and that the organizers of this event allowed this to happen , rather than taking action to see that Guillermo Vargas be criminally charged with animal abuse , is sending the world a message that Costa Rica is a cruel , uncivilized society that has no regard for life , but enjoys viewing and contributing to the loss of life .
Each and every person who knew of and witnessed the suffering of this innocent dog is guilty of causing its unnecessary death .
To let this crime go unpunished , and instead to reward Guillermo Vargas by choosing him to represent Costa Rica in Bienal Centroamericana Honduras 2008 is unacceptable and shameful , not only to Costa Rica but to all participants in this event .
I urge you , do not condone the heinous actions of Guillermo Vargas by allowing him to participation in Bienal Centroamericana Honduras 2008 .
He should be jailed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for this animal ’s death , and should not be allowed to represent Costa Rica as an artist , for to refer to him as such is an insult to all true artists .
Sincerely ,
Your Name
ANOTHER GALLERY SHOWING HIS WORK :
This is the email address to a gallery which currently holds some of Vargas ' work for display and sale .
If anyone would like to ask the gallery to drop him from their list of artists the email address is below .

INFORMATION ABOUT EXHIBIT
What he says on his blog ( translated ) :
I knew the dog died on the following day from lack of food .
During the inauguration , I knew that the dog was persecuted in the evening between the houses of aluminum and cardboard in a district of Managua .
5 children who helped to capture the dog received 10 bonds of córdobas for their assistance .
During the exhibition some people requested the freedom of the small dog , which the artist refused .
The name of the dog was Natividad , and I let him die of hunger in the sight of everyone , as if the death of a poor dog was a shameless media show in which nobody does anything but to applaud or to watch disturbed .
In the place that the dog was exposed remain a metal cable and a cord .
The dog was extremely ill and did not want to eat , so in natural surroundings it would have died anyway ; thus they are all poor dogs : sooner or later they die or are killed .

A BOY of two saved his mum's life - by dialling 999 .
Toddler Joshua Brookes kept his nerve after mum Isobel collapsed unconscious at home .
The youngster picked up a telephone and called the emergency services , telling an operator : ` Mummy wo n't wake up ' .
Police operator Paula
Hall told the toddler to shake his mum and the line went quiet as he went away to try to rouse her .
Moments later , Joshua returned and - becoming frightened - said : ` It has n't worked . '
Paula struggled to get him to reveal his name , even asking what name Father Christmas put on his presents , but in the end , police used the phone number to track his address .
They then sent help to the boy 's home in Wigan , while the operator tried to keep him calm and told him to open the
front door for the police .
When they arrived , Joshua used a box to stand on and reached the door handle to let them in .
Police found Isobel , 30 , who suffers from a rare heart condition , unconscious .
The mum - of - two was revived and awoke to see paramedics standing over her .
She was taken to hospital and made a full recovery .
Today , Joshua was hailed a life - saving hero after details were revealed for the first time .
Back at home in Ashton - in - Makerfield , Isobel said she had taught both Joshua , now three , and his older sister Amy , six , how to dial 999 in an emergency as soon as they could talk because her heart condition makes her prone to passing out .
She said : " Amy has done it before , but she was at school this time .
I did n't know anything about it until I woke up with a paramedic standing over me .
" Joshua did really well .
I 'm really proud of him . "
Police telephone operator Paula , who took Joshua 's 999 call , has been to visit him to tell him : ' Well done ' .
Brave
Paula , 44 , a mum who has been taking calls for the police for 12 years , said : " I knew he was very young , but I was shocked when I found out he was two .
I could tell he was very frightened , but he was very brave in the circumstances .
He stayed quite calm .
" He was saying he could n't wake mummy up .
I asked him to see if he could rouse her , but he could n't .
" I could n't get his name and asked which name Father Christmas put on his presents .
" I told him that someone would be coming to the door to help , but I was worried that he would n't be able to answer it .
" I was very pleased when I heard an adult voice and knew the officers had got there . "
Paula added : " He 's a little character . "
Cloverfield has everybody talking about the way science fiction is dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , but that giant monster movie is hardly the first SF creation to tackle terrorism , high - tech surveillance , and governments run amok in the post - 9/11 era .
As the United States has cracked down on civil liberties at home , and invaded nations abroad , in the name of national security , a crop of futuristic and fanciful tales have sprung up to satirize and justify " the war on terror . "
These tales generally deal with one of five crucial post - 9/11 themes , which we 've enumerated ( with examples ) for you below .
Advertisement
New York Must Be Destroyed
One of the most obvious ways that scifi echoed the events of 9/11 was to destroy New York , over and over again .
The collapse of New York , via time traveling shenanigans or giant sea monsters , continues to obsess scifi creators .
In the incredibly terrible A Sound of Thunder ( 2005 ) , a time traveler who steps on a butterfly during the Jurassic Age changes the present and turns New York into a savage jungle .
New York is made into a less - savage jungle by an inexplicable disease in I Am Legend ( 2007 ) .
Aliens with giant world - destroying Tripods smash New York and everywhere else in War of the Worlds ( 2004 ) .
And of course we 've already talked a lot about how Cloverfield ( 2008 ) is basically a direct allegory of 9/11 , with a giant monster standing in for scary terrorists who came out of nowhere and bashed the city .

The Surveillance State is Watching You
Although Minority Report ( 2002 ) technically came out after 9/11 , and certainly took on new overtones thanks to the passage of the USA - Patriot Act , it was probably conceived and mostly filmed before the attacks took place .
Still , another Philip K. Dick - inspired movie , A Scanner Darkly ( 2006 ) is clearly an homage to the surveillance state that the current Bush Administration built — and that John Poindexter tried to make even more science fictional with his Total Information Awareness program ( now called Terrorist Information Awareness ) .
Fear of computer surveillance — or resigned acceptance of it — permeates countless scifi creations of this era , including Vernor Vinge 's superlative near - future novel Rainbows End ( 2006 ) , which focuses in part on a biotech terrorist attack that 's being stopped by intelligence experts who work entirely within vast computer networks .

The Terrorists Are Everywhere !
Australian Max Barry published Jennifer Government in 2003 , a novel where corporations stage fake terrorist attacks to get publicity for their new shoes .
But other tales were less satirical .
Mark Millar 's Civil War comic book series ( 2006 - 7 ) dealt with what happens to the superheroes of the Marvel universe when Congress passes the " superhero registration act " and forces all heroes to be tracked in the name of fighting terror .
Hero fights hero in this response to the Bush Administration 's efforts to track Muslims and other " undesirables . "
Battlestar Galactica dug deep into politically incendiary terroritory in 2006 when some of the humans become suicide bombers in order to fight the Cylon in occupied New Caprica .
Even Star Trek : Enterprise had a terrorist plot arc with the Xindi in 2003 .
In books , Ken MacLeod 's The Execution Channel ( 2007 ) dealt with high - tech terrorists in a surveillance state .

Department of Homeland Security is Plotting to End the World
One of the conceits of post - nuke apocalypse series Jericho ( 2006 - 2008 ) is that the Department of Homeland security may have been behind the attacks that flattened most major U.S. cities with nukes .
28 Weeks Later ( 2007 ) has U.S. security forces ordered into London to " protect " citizens being repatriated after a plague has wiped out most of England .
Turns out of their orders is just to shoot everybody — innocents and monsters alike — if the situation gets out of control .
In The Mist ( 2007 ) , a secret military experiment unleashes extra-dimensional killer beasts on a small town .
And in Serenity ( 2005 ) , Joss Whedon 's film spinoff from the Firefly series , a government obsessed with quelling uprisings in its satellite colonies is hunting one of the main characters , River , an escaped experiment who would have become a mind - reading weapon under government control .

Desert Planets are the Source of All Unrest
Two new Dune miniserieses hit the bigtime on the SciFi Channel : Dune : The Miniseries ( 2001 ) and Children of Dune ( 2003 ) .
Both are true to Frank Herbert 's novels , which are thinly - veiled allegories of Middle Eastern politics — complete with Jihads and desert planets which produce a chemical that enables rapid transportation .
( " The spice must flow " = " The oil must flow " . )
New Dune novels , written by Frank Herbert 's son , came out in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 and dealt directly with Butlerian Jihad that created the world of the first novels .
Clearly , Jihad was on SF writers ' minds .
People who tuned into the Stargate TV series throughout the last ten years were treated to another desert planet full of nasties and insurrectionaries : Abydos , whose inhabitants are basically space Arabs .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Saboteurs blew up a major oil pipeline in Iraq on Thursday , cutting exports from the south of the country for the first time in years , a South Oil Company ( SOC ) official told Reuters .
The resulting blaze was quickly extinguished and officials said efforts were under way to get shipments back to normal from Iraq ’s second city of Basra where fighting broke out on Tuesday .
It is the first time since 2004 the vital southern route , responsible for about three quarters of Iraq ’s exports , has been disrupted .
Officials had different views about how long it would take to restore supplies and the gravity of the incident .
U.S. crude rose by more than $ 1 to trade above $ 107 a barrel after news of the attack .
“ This morning saboteurs blew up the pipeline transporting crude from Zubair 1 by placing bombs beneath it .
The pipeline was severely damaged , ” the SOC official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ Crude exports will be greatly affected because this is one of two main pipelines transporting crude to the southern terminals .
We will lose about a third of crude exported through Basra , ” he said .
A source at the Basra terminal later on Thursday said oil was flowing to the terminal at around 1.2 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , down 300,000 bpd from average rates .
“ The last figure I had for the oil pipeline from the Basra terminal is around 50,000 barrels per hour and the reason why it ’s not more than that is because of the damage to the pipeline earlier this morning , ” the source said .
Even if one of the main export pipelines was damaged , backup pipelines running from tanks at Zubair , Rumaila and Tuba oilfields can be used to keep supplies flowing to Basra , an oil official said .
VARYING DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS
Officials in Baghdad said the pipeline was not severely damaged and output was returning to previous levels .
“ Instructions are being given to restore pumping to normal levels .
This was a minor incident , ” one official said .
But engineers on the ground in the south said fighting was hampering efforts to repair the line and they were waiting until Friday morning to begin work .
It could then take up to three days to carry out repairs .
Reuters could not independently verify where the damage took place .
But the SOC official said the attack occurred seven kilometers south of Basra on a major pipeline connecting the Rumaila and other southern oilfields to the Basra terminal .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility .
Officials in Baghdad said a branch leading from the Bazargan oilfield to the pipeline , rather than the main export link itself , had been affected .
Iraq ’s government relies heavily on oil exports for revenue , and had managed to sustain the flow from Basra even as a violent insurgency targeted the country ’s oil installations elsewhere .
In the north , persistent sabotage and technical problems had reduced exports to a trickle since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , but flows have improved greatly since last summer .
Exports of around 430,000 bpd of Kirkuk crude continued to flow through a pipeline to Turkey , a shipping source said on Thursday .
A new “ brain test ” floating around online shows a spinning dancer and asks whether you see the image rotating clockwise or counterclockwise .
If it spins clockwise , you supposedly use more of your right brain .
Counterclockwise , and you ’re more of a left brain person .
The test then lists functions associated with each side of the brain – the left side includes “ uses logic ” and “ facts rule , ” while the right side includes “ uses feeling ” and “ imagination rules . ”
A good friend complained that the test told her she was a left brain person , even when she knew herself to not be into left brain associations such as “ math and science . ”
A similar discrepancy was discerned by one of the authors of the Freakonomics blog , when he conducted a quick , nonscientific survey of blog readers , which cross referenced college majors and spinning dancer test results .
If the test sounds flawed , that ’s not just because one should n’t use spinning dancers to characterize their brain strengths .
Rather , the test is coming up inaccurate because it provides a crude view of the “ lateralization of brain function , ” or the concept that each side of the human brain specializes in certain mental activities .
The concept was born in the 1960s , when Roger Sperry studied epilepsy patients who had had a nerve connection between their hemispheres surgically cut .
He found that the left brain hemisphere seemed to possess “ speech and a rational , intellectual style , ” while the right side was “ inarticulate , but blessed with special spatial abilities . ”
Modern neuroscience studies using brain imaging technology such as fMRI – which shows active areas of the brain while a person is trying to perform a task – have further suggested that language ability tends to be localized in the left hemisphere , while spatial ability tends to be in the right hemisphere .
However , neuroscience - minded blogs like Neurophilosophy point out that doing any complex mental activity requires cooperation from both sides of the brain , although certain processing tasks required for that activity may be concentrated on one side or the other .
In other words , saying that “ math and science are left brain functions ” is an over - generalized statement .
“ It ’s not that you have a special math module somewhere in your brain , but rather that the brain ’s particular functional organization … predisposes it towards the use of high - level imagery and spatial skills , which in turn just happen to be very useful when it comes to doing math reasoning , ” said Michael O’Boyle , a psychologist at the University of Melbourne , Australia , in a public statement through the American Psychological Association .
In fact , the best math students do n’t even seem to settle for being “ left brain ” people .
A study undertaken by O’Boyle found mathematically gifted students did better than average students on tests that required both halves of the brain to cooperate .
This demonstrated that , while the typical person might lean more heavily on one hemisphere or the other to do mental tasks necessary for math calculation , the brightest among us can more fully integrate both hemispheres of the brain .
The idea that emotion processing only occurs in the right brain hemisphere and fact processing in the left is also misleading .
Brain imaging studies have showed that people processed emotion using small parts of both brain hemispheres .
“ The popular notion of an ‘ emotional ’ right hemisphere that contrasts sharply with a ‘ rational ’ left hemisphere is like a crude pencil sketch made before a full - color painting , ” noted a 2005 Scientific American Mind article .
Believing in left brain or right brain people also fails to account for the human brain ’s mysterious flexibility and plasticity .
People who had half their brain removed encounter some problems – like not being able to move or see from one side of their body – but largely retained or relearned mental abilities such as language in their remaining brain hemisphere .
All this research clearly points out that while Nobel winner Sperry was onto something with his lateralization research , trying to fully compartmentalize mental activity by brain hemisphere is imprecise .
So what does the spinning dancer tell us ?
The whole test is more of an optical illusion than anything else , according to Steven Novella , an academic clinical neurologist at Yale University School of Medicine who blogs on NeuroLogica .
When our brains process visual images to make some order or sense of the world , they have to make assumptions .
The dancer is just a two dimensional image switching back and forth , but our brains process it as a three dimensional spinning object .
Depending on the assumptions made and visual cues picked up , your brain can make the dancer spin either way .
When my friend first sent the test to me , I saw it go clockwise … then switch to counterclockwise as I was staring at the screen .
What this tells me about my personality and mental abilities is hardly a no - brainer – the brain test connection to our mental strengths and weaknesses is nonexistent .

“ Way more fun and amusing than it has any right to be . ”
“ If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down . ”
– Charles Darwin , On The Origin of Species
The champions of Intelligent Design ( ID ) and its core argument , that of irreducible complexity , love quoting this line from the seminal work that launched the modern theory of evolution .
One of their favorite targets for this line of argument is the modern vertebrate eye – a highly complex and sophisticated organ .
The classical creationist argument is the logical fallacy known as the argument from personal incredulity – they say , how could something so complex have evolved .
ID ( or neocreationism , as some call it ) makes essentially the same argument but phrased in new lingo , calling the eye “ irreducibly complex ” – meaning it is too complex to have evolved , but more specifically that the eye could not work if it were any simpler , if any of its parts were missing .
It is astounding that this argument is still often heard , even though Darwin himself put it to rest in Origin of the Species when he pointed to the numerous examples in nature of animals with simpler , yet functional , eyes .
Of course , using extant species as examples does not provide an actual evolutionary pathway , but rather it addresses directly the question of irreducible complexity , which is a functional question .
The notion is that simpler anatomical forms cannot function – examples from nature show that they do .
In fact there are examples in nature that demonstrate the functionality of every step that would need to take place in eye evolution .
But creationists are famous for moving the goalpost , so they then challenge evolutionists to prove not only that the eye can evolve ( can pass through functional stages every step of the way ) but that it in fact did evolve – show the actual evolutionary path .
There is genetic and fossil evidence for much of eye evolution , but answers to historical questions within evolutionary theory – what actually happened in the evolutionary past – are always incomplete .
There are always gaps , and this opens the door for another of creationists ’ favorite tactics , the god of the gaps arguments .
In fact ID is nothing but an extension of the the god of the gaps logical fallacy – any gaps not currently explained by science were miracles performed by God ( Oh , wait .
I ’m sorry .
Ahem – the “ Intelligent Designer . ” )
But the theory of evolution does not predict nor should it be reasonably expected that all gaps will be filled .
History is imperfectly preserved .
It does predict that gaps will be filled over time – that as we gather new information , like pieces to a puzzle , they will fit into an evolutionary pattern .
So far all the evidence fits exquisitely into an evolutionary pattern .
But it is always nice when a new piece of evidence comes to light that fills in a fossil gap , enriching our understanding of evolutionary history .
Recently Dr Gavin Young from the Department of Earth and Marine Sciences at ANU published his analysis of a 400 - million - year - old Devonian placoderm fossil .
The placoderms were jawed ancestors of modern fish whose bodies were protected by thick bony armour – so they are transitional between jawless fish and jawed fish .
Evolutionary theory predicts , therefore , that their eye structure is likely to be transitional between the eye structure of jawless and modern jawed fish , and that is exactly what Dr. Young found .
( I always wonder if creationists squirm a little when this kind of evidence comes out . )
The article states :
“ Part of the trouble in tracing the evolution of the eye is that soft tissues do n’t tend to fossilise .
But the eye cavities in the braincase of these 400 million - year - old fossil fish were lined with a delicate layer of very thin bone .
All the details of the nerve canals and muscle insertions inside the eye socket are preserved – the first definite fossil evidence demonstrating an intermediate stage in the evolution of our most complex sensory organ .
“ These extinct placoderms had the eyeball still connected to the braincase by cartilage , as in modern sharks , and a primitive eye muscle arrangement as in living jawless fish . ”
Dr Young said that this anatomical arrangement is different from all modern vertebrates , in which there is a consistent pattern of tiny muscles for rotating each eyeball .
The history of the science of evolution and the denial of that science by creationists of all types ( including ID ’ers ) is one of constant retreat by creationists from the evidence .
First they argue that the eye could not function if it were anatomically simpler , so scientists give evidence of simpler functioning eyes .
Then they say that we have not demonstrated the actual path of evolution , but it was only a matter of time before fossils of sufficient quality to preserve information about soft body parts emerged to show the actual path .
What ID truly represents for creationists is a strategic maneuver .
In addition to replacing the Christian God with the more neutral sounding intelligent designer , ID proponents have largely retreated from macroscopic anatomy ( which has a frustrating habit of revealing itself in the fossil record – like the current example ) to microscopic biochemistry .
Here is a perfect example from Michael Behe , the father of this strategy .
He writes :
Darwin succeeded brilliantly , not by actually describing a real pathway that evolution might have used in constructing the eye , but rather by pointing to a variety of animals that were known to have eyes of various constructions , ranging from a simple light sensitive spot to the complex vertebrate camera eye , and suggesting that the evolution of the human eye might have involved similar organs as intermediates .
But the question remains , how do we see ?
Although Darwin was able to persuade much of the world that a modern eye could be produced gradually from a much simpler structure , he did not even attempt to explain how the simple light sensitive spot that was his starting point actually worked .
When discussing the eye Darwin dismissed the question of its ultimate mechanism .
Behe goes on to discuss the complex biochemical process of how the retina produces a neuronal signal from a photon of light .
He is retreating to where the fossils cannot reach him – to biochemistry .
But he is just starting the “ god of the gaps ” cycle all over again .
Just as the complexity of the modern human eye does not imply that simpler anatomies cannot function , the complexity of the modern retinal neuron and the biochemistry involved in seeing does not imply that simpler biochemical arrangements could not function .
Also , Behe ’s strategy of retreat to biochemistry is ultimately a failed one .
Just as with the bacterial flagellum , that Behe argued was irreducibly complex but was shown not to be , the evolution of retinal biochemistry is advancing quite nicely .
Here is a review article from the same time as Behe ’s article referenced above ( 1996 - 7 ) , showing , for example , the branching pattern of relatedness in the amino acid structure of the opsin group of proteins used in vision .
Here is a slightly more recent article from 2002 which reviews the phylogeny of visual protein systems .
The evidence is there , and growing , but creationists have never been bothered much by the evidence .
Behe ’s strategy is to just show how gee - whiz - complex the biochemistry of vision is then make the classic argument from personal incredulity .
He fails to acknowledge , however , that such complexity evolves not so that the system can work at all but to make the system more sensitive , more specific , or more finely tuned .
For example , a protein cascade can amplify the signal , allowing greater sensitivity to light .
A less light - sensitive system can still work and provide a survival advantage .
Also , Behe and the ID ’ers do not acknowledge what Darwin himself figured out – that of coaptation .
Structures may develop for one purpose and then be coopted for another .
For example , the bacterial flagellum likely evolved from a simpler structure that was not a motor but was used to inject proteins into prey .
As the evidence for the fact of evolution continues to pile up , the creationists are running out of places to hide .
But then again , they are not genuinely interested in scientific inquiry .
They are only interested in sowing confusion .
What they are really doing is exploiting those areas where it is easiest to confuse the public .
The fossil record is just getting too obvious , so for now they will seek refuge in the microscopic .

A grieving father who blamed doctors for the death of his four - year - old daughter has been found hanging next to her grave .
Andrew Deegan , 29 , was fighting for an inquiry into the death of his " little princess " Holly from suspected septicaemia in February .
But he was overcome by grief and was found hanging from the branch of a tree in the cemetery where she is buried .
Ben Shenton , Health Minister for Jersey , where the family lived , promised there would be an investigation into the double tragedy .

Andrew Deegan : Tormented by his daughter Holly 's death hanged himself
He said : " Andrew was critical of the fact that Holly 's infection was n't picked up immediately by the GPs and that her death came very suddenly on the children 's ward .
" However , indications are that there would have been very little that we could have done even if it was diagnosed straight away .
" I think he was devastated at the loss of his daughter in such unfortunate circumstances but it 's utterly tragic that it has ended in this way . "
The Reverend Andy Thewlis , a family friend who oversaw both Mr Deegan 's marriage and Holly 's funeral , said no one had understood how much his grief had affected him .
He added : " Like all who knew Andy , I am saddened and shocked by the news of his death .
" Perhaps we can now begin to understand the depth of despair Andy felt at the loss of Holly , who he described as his little princess . "
He said his thoughts were with Mr Deegan 's wife Amanda and his two surviving daughters , Chloe , 15 , and Codi , one .
He added : " Our hearts and prayers naturally go out to Mandy and the family at this time as we hold on to a faith that invites us to believe that Andy 's recent turmoil is now ended and he is at peace with the daughter he so loved . "
Holly , a pupil at Samares Primary School in St Clement , Jersey , became ill after a day at the beach on February 17 this year .
She complained of a stomach ache and a rash and her parents took her to two GPs and Jersey General Hospital .
Doctors diagnosed a viral infection and suggested that she be given Calpol - but Holly died four days later from suspected septicaemia , or blood poisoning .
She was buried at the Belle Vue Cemetery in the St Brelade area of the island following her funeral on March 11 .
During the service , Mr Deegan said : " Holly , you will never know how much mummy and daddy love you .
I miss you so much .
You were my entire life .
" You will forever be in my heart .
Night , night , princess .
I love you . "
At the funeral , Mr Deegan also blamed the hospital for not being able to save his daughter .
The authorities on Jersey promised to investigate the circumstances of Holly 's death , but her father was campaigning for an independent inquiry .
He said : " My grievance is that there was no lifesaving equipment on the ward to save her .
" They were saying how gravely concerned they were during the day and had many , many opportunities to move her to intensive care . "
Mr Deegan 's body was found by a woman walking through the cemetery on Tuesday morning .
A Home Office pathologist will fly to Jersey to carry out a postmortem examination .
Mr Shenton added : " There will be a full independent investigation into Holly 's death and we shall liaise completely with Mrs Deegan concerning this . "
A spokesman for the Jersey coroner said an inquest had not yet been opened .
George Bush will discuss missile defence with President Putin
Mr Bush said they would discuss American plans to site a missile defence system in Eastern Europe .
They will meet after next week 's Nato summit in Bucharest , Romania .
Russia has strongly criticised the US proposals , which would see interceptor missiles based in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic .
' Optimistic '
" President Putin has invited me to go to Sochi and it's to discuss the strategic agreement , a crucial part of which is missile defence , " Mr Bush told journalists in Washington .
He said he was optimistic they would reach a deal and described the meeting , scheduled for 6 April , as a follow - up to recent high level discussions in Moscow .
Last week US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Robert Gates held talks with senior officials in the Russian capital .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov afterwards told the Izvestiya newspaper that the US had agreed to allow Moscow to monitor the missile defence system .
The US says the system is needed to counter a potential threat from Iran , but Moscow fears it could be used against Russia .
Next week 's meeting is likely to be the last between the two presidents , since Mr Putin 's successor , Dmitry Medvedev , will take office in May .
The inconvenient fiction of the Democratic presidential race
Consider a hypothetical .
Let ’s say that right now , Barack Obama trailed Hillary Clinton among delegates , statewide victories , and popular votes .
The margins are such where it ’s extremely unlikely he ’d catch up before the convention .
She ’d raised more money than him , and had won 14 of the last 17 Democratic contests , almost all by wide margins .
Would there be intense pressure for Obama to face facts , consider the good of the party , drop out of the race ?
I think any fair reading of the political landscape suggests the answer is yes .
But , this is , of course , the exact circumstances we have today , except it ’s Clinton trailing , not leading .
I ’ve seen the argument elsewhere , but Jim Vandehei and Mike Allen do a very nice job today of summarizing a provocative point : the Democratic race is over , but no one wants to admit it .
One big fact has largely been lost in the recent coverage of the Democratic presidential race : Hillary Rodham Clinton has virtually no chance of winning .
Her own campaign acknowledges there is no way that she will finish ahead in pledged delegates .
That means the only way she wins is if Democratic superdelegates are ready to risk a backlash of historic proportions from the party ’s most reliable constituency .
Unless Clinton is able to at least win the primary popular vote — which also would take nothing less than an electoral miracle — and use that achievement to pressure superdelegates , she has only one scenario for victory .
An African - American opponent and his backers would be told that , even though he won the contest with voters , the prize is going to someone else .
People who think that scenario is even remotely likely are living on another planet .
Indeed , Vandehei and Allen note that Clinton campaign aides live right here on Earth , and one key Clinton advisor conceded that her chance of winning the nomination is no better than 10 % , “ an appraisal that was echoed by other [ Clinton ] operatives . ”
And yet , I get the sense no one — not campaign reporters , not the candidates , no one in the party — is supposed to admit any of this .
Instead , the conventional wisdom is that the race for the nomination is “ practically tied , ” and will go “ down to the wire . ”
Vandehei’s and Allen ’s broader question is a good one : why this fiction is taken so seriously .
Oddly enough , Vandehei and Allen make a very compelling case that it ’s the media ’s fault .
Journalists , for instance , have become partners with the Clinton campaign in pretending that the contest is closer than it really is .
Most coverage breathlessly portrays the race as a down - to - the - wire sprint between two well - matched candidates , one only slightly better situated than the other to win in August at the national convention in Denver .
One reason is fear of embarrassment .
In its zeal to avoid predictive reporting of the sort that embarrassed journalists in New Hampshire , the media — including Politico — have tended to avoid zeroing in on the tough math Clinton faces .
Avoiding predictions based on polls even before voters cast their ballots is wise policy .
But that ’s not the same as drawing sober and well - grounded conclusions about the current state of a race after millions of voters have registered their preferences .
The antidote to last winter ’s flawed predictions is not to promote a misleading narrative based on the desired but unlikely story line of one candidate . [ … ]
One important , if subliminal , reason is self - interest .
Reporters and editors love a close race — it ’s more fun and it ’s good for business .
The media are also enamored of the almost mystical ability of the Clintons to work their way out of tight jams , as they have done for 16 years at the national level .
That explains why some reporters are inclined to believe the Clinton campaign when it talks about how she ’s going to win on the third ballot at the Democratic National Convention in August .
That ’s certainly possible — and , to be clear , we ’d love to see the race last that long — but it ’s folly to write about this as if it is likely .
In this sense — and really , only this sense — the traditional media is actually guilty of a pro-Clinton bias .
As Atrios noted , “ [ W ] hile it would be absurd to claim that Clinton is treated well by the press – she ’s treated horribly in general – it ’s also the case that anyone else would be subjected to a louder and increasingly derisive drumbeat for her to get out of the race . ”
I think that ’s right on both counts .
When it comes to Clinton personally , the media has been vicious on far too many occasions , as demonstrated this week with reports about her presence in the White House during her husband ’s dalliances with Monica Lewinsky .
( The reports had no news value at all , but were given huge play . )
But when it comes to Clinton ’s chances , it ’s practically the polar opposite — the media , in general , treats her as a candidate right in the thick of things , who has an entirely plausible rationale for staying in the race .
Put it this way : when was the last time a reporter from a major outlet pressed Clinton on when she will drop out of the race ?
If the shoe were on the other foot , and Obama ’s campaign thought it had no better than a 10 % chance of getting the party ’s nod , would he hear the question a lot more often ?
But , Clinton supporters argue , there are 10 contests left and 260 or so uncommitted superdelegates .
Does n’t that mean anything can still happen ?
Vandehei and Allen run the numbers and explain that the odds are just too remote and unrealistic .
In my heart of hearts , I do n’t really expect campaign reporters to start covering the race this way — it ’s in their interest to promote ( and even create , if necessary ) a prolonged fight — but Vandehei and Allen make a case that ’s hard to deny .
You 're due for a new hobby .

Memo warned : EPA chief 's credibility at risk Denying state 's waiver could harm chief 's career , memo said
** FILE ** Some career staffers concerned about the reputation of the Environmental Protection Agency believed that Administrator Stephen Johnson , seen here in a file photo taken Thursday , Jan. 24 , 2008 , in Washington , would have to consider resigning if he turned down California 's request to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions , newly released documents show .

A senior Environmental Protection Agency staffer 's newly released memo warned that EPA chief Stephen Johnson would lose his credibility and might have to resign if he rejected California 's rules limiting greenhouse gases from cars and trucks .
The document , prepared by a top deputy in the EPA 's Office of Transportation and Air Quality , is further evidence of the fierce internal struggle that Johnson faced before he ruled against California in December .
Documents released earlier revealed that he overruled the unanimous opinion of his agency 's legal and technical staff , who urged him to approve the state 's rules .
California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer , who released the memo Tuesday , said it was another sign that the EPA is an agency in crisis .
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said the staffer wrote the memo as talking points , but the advice was never actually given to Johnson .
" No one ever came in and said , ' You 're going to have to resign , ' " Shradar said .
The story behind the memo is almost as interesting as the memo itself .
After the document was revealed Tuesday , former EPA administrator William Reilly , who served under President Bush 's father , called Boxer 's office to alert it that the talking points were written for him .
In an interview with The Chronicle late Tuesday , he said he called Margo Oge , director of the EPA 's Office of Transportation and Air Quality , last year .
A supporter of California 's new rules , he wanted to know " how the issue was being framed at EPA " and how many waivers he had approved for California when he ran the agency .
Oge , as a courtesy to the former administrator , asked Christopher Grundler , deputy director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality , to respond to the request .
Reilly wanted the information to use when he called Johnson last fall to make his case for California .
But the e-mail , written by Grundler , highlighted the internal opposition within EPA to what Johnson was preparing to do .
The Oct. 17 , 2007 , e-mail contained talking points - written as if they would be delivered by Reilly - including this one : " The eyes of the world are on you and the marvelous institution you and I have had the privilege of leading ; clearly the stakes are huge , especially with respect to future climate work . "
Grundler wrote that the decision was " likely to be among the two biggest decisions you get to make in the job " and acknowledged that Johnson was " under extraordinary pressure . "
He also urged Reilly to tell Johnson that the legal and scientific evidence supported California 's case .
" From what I have read and the people I have talked to , it is obvious to me that there is no legal or technical justification for denying this , " the memo said .
" The law is very specific about what you are allowed to consider , and even if you adopt the alternative interpretations that have been suggested by the automakers , you still wind up in the same place . "
In the memo , Grundler also urged Reilly to warn Johnson of the consequences of making the wrong decision .
" You have to find a way to get this done , " he wrote .
" If you cannot , you will face a pretty big personal decision about whether you are able to stay in the job under those circumstances .
" This is a choice only you can make , but I ask you to think about the history and the future of the agency in making it .
If you are asked to deny this waiver , I fear the credibility of the agency that we both love will be irreparably damaged . "
Grundler could not be reached for comment .
Reilly , who now works in San Francisco on water issues and is a member of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's blue ribbon commission on the Delta , said he did n't use much of the talking points , including the line about resigning .
He said he did use some of the background - including the fact that he had approved nine waiver requests for California .
Reilly said he told Johnson in a phone call last fall that California " has had a history of leading on air pollution matters " and that Schwarzenegger should be given a chance to implement the rules .
Still , the internal memo offers an inside account of how some EPA staffers viewed the debate over the waiver .
Grundler 's last line - " if you are asked to deny this waiver " - reflected the fears of some staffers that the White House would pressure Johnson to deny the state 's request .
Johnson has denied being pressured by the White House .
Boxer is now in a tug - of - war with the EPA to get the agency to release any e-mails or other documents showing that the White House , the vice president 's office or other executive branch officials weighed in on California 's rules .
But documents previously released by Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , show that Transportation Secretary Mary Peters joined Michigan lawmakers to lobby the EPA to reject California 's request .
Boxer released other documents Tuesday , including an Oct. 31 , 2007 , e-mail in which a staffer in the EPA 's climate change division wrote about trying to convince Johnson that California has the " compelling and extraordinary conditions " required by the Clean Air Act to set its tougher emissions rules .
" On compelling and extraordinary conditions , I got to chime in again , " the unidentified staffer wrote , describing a meeting with Johnson .
" In addition to the argument that climate change may exacerbate CA 's tropospheric ozone problem - for which CA has historically demonstrated compelling and extraordinary conditions - I think Johnson now better appreciates that there are additional conditions in CA that make them vulnerable to climate change : water resources ( we spent time talking about this ) ; wildfires ( the recent news I think is helping to push him ) ; long coast line ; largest population ; largest economy ; largest ag sector ... "
Shradar , the EPA spokesman , said the memos only suggest that there was a range of opinions offered to Johnson before he made his decision .
" At the end of the day , the administrator 's decision stands , " he said .
The memos could spark some fireworks at today 's hearing in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , which Boxer chairs , where Johnson is expected to testify about the EPA 's 2009 budget .
Boxer said the new memos prove her case that Johnson 's decision " is about special - interest governing at its worst .
...
It is just a nightmare . "
At least 18 other states want to join California 's efforts .
The new rules would require automakers to make vehicles that get 44 miles per gallon by 2020 - more than a new federal law requiring an increase to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 .
Automakers oppose the state 's rules and have praised the EPA 's decision , but California and other states have sued to overturn it .
The ruling has even become an issue in the presidential race , with the leading Democrats , Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , and the likely GOP nominee John McCain , all saying they back the states ' efforts to set tougher rules .

These people did n’t notice that they were n’t alone until they looked at the photo on their computer .
The photo was taken in Campbell River , British Columbia .
The people in this photograph were hiking in Seal Bay Park .
At the end of their walk , they found some butter mushrooms on a mossy log , and were inspecting them .
One of them decided to take a photograph , but not being terribly good at photography , the photo was taken off center .
When they returned home and downloaded the pictures off of the camera they got quite a surprise – a large animal that appears to be a wolf heading straight towards them .
They theorize that the flash from the camera scared it off , although I do n’t know if it would be a danger or not .
Certainly , it ’s not the kind of animal you would normally want to be too close to !
EDIT : If you think this photo is fake , check out the full sized version .
EDIT 2 : Here ’s the story behind the photo as told by the woman in the foreground whose back is to the camera :
MEDIA EMAIL ADDRESSES
This page of email addresses is NOT designed to be used to send individual emails .
It is designed so you can copy and paste them into your emails !
This could be compared to sending a bulk mailing via the post office !
THE PREFERRED WAY
There is NO preferred way to use this list .
Some people send emails to their Congressional Representatives and CC ( copy ) all the media email addresses .
Other people prefer to BCC ( Blind copy ) the email addresses .
The reason for this is because they want whoever is reading the email to actually READ what they have to say !
With thousands of email addresses appearing BEFORE the actual message , it is less likely the Congressional staffer will ever read the email , therefore your email may NEVER be counted !
If you want to let your Congressional Representatives know that you have also emailed the media , you can now include the link to this page and write a p.s. at the bottom of your email telling them you have BCC'd the email to thousands of media people !

Surely sometime in the past few years you have found yourself at a Forever 21 purchasing a $ 5 tunic or a $ 24 winter coat and thinking , " Where the hell did Forever 21 come from that I now buy half my clothes there , anyway ? " ( and also : " Fuck , is the sweatshop business actually cutting wages ? )
A story in the latest issue of Radar attempts to shed light on this mysterious company and its sudden success , success for which it has to thank the age - old practice whereby the fashion industry shows its collections to the public i.e. potential knockoff artists a full six months before they hit stores , and Jesus .
Jesus is huge .
Church is to Forever 21 what ... taking sexy party photos and doing lines is to American Apparel .
There are Bible verses on all shopping bags , designers go on Christian missions around the world , and the company gives shitloads of money to orphanages and churches and Christian educational institutions , etc .
" People join their church just to get close to them , " a garment district insider says of Don and Jin Sook Chang , the first generation Korean immigrant couple that founded the company in 1984 .

( Don worked at a gas station at the time ; allegedly he noticed that all the nice cars pulling up to the gas station he worked at were owned by people in the fashion industry .
And saw to it no one would be able to make fashion ever again ! )
Mrs. Chang , who attends pre-dawn services every day and strongly encourages her vendors to do the same , makes it a piot to give Christians in the industry a leg up , too .
" She plucks young designers out of the companies she 's working with , " he says .
" And if they 're Christian and religious , she puts them in business . "
Rowena Rodriguez , a 33 - year - old fashion consultant and one - time " unbeliever " who was born again with Mrs.
Chang 's help , may be one of those lucky designers .
" In the short time I worked with Mrs. Chang , my life was transformed , and I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior , " she recalls in an email interview .
" Mrs. Chang prayed me into the Kingdom !
Rodriguez says she has been approached by executives looking for the secrt to Forever 21's phenomenal success .
" I usually say , ' If you really want to know , I 'll tell you .
But you wo n't believe me ... The Changs love Jesus ! "

So anyway , obviously the next question is , hmm , so do I feel more conflicted about supporting this strange , rabid , proselytizing Christian cult ?
Or Dov Charney 's greasy - locked harem of lame unitarded people over at American Apparel ?
And it 's a tough call .
Both make clothes in the United States , and though American Apparel sticks much closer to the spirit of JC in offering its lowliest employees decent wages and benefits , Forever 21 does get points for locating its factories in a city where the authorities can actually legally , like , raid them and demand compliance with labor laws etc. etc .
Both steal ideas from designers who got rich outsourcing all their shit overseas , but Forever 21 steals more .
( Extra points ! )
And both want to sell employees and shoppers on their lifestyles ; Don Chang would have you read Left Behind series ; Dov Charney would have you ... um , show him your behind .
Whoa , weird how similar their names are , no ?
God , when did shopping turn into some insane moral allegory ???

F ull - time freelancing : 10 more things in 360 days
~ 24 April 2006 ~
Back in December when I authored the first “ 10 things learned ” article , two events were celebrated : 1 ) Suzanne ’s birthday and 2 ) 6 months of full - time freelancing .
This time around , three events warrant mention : 1 ) Hudson ’s first birthday , 2 ) my birthday ( the big 3 - 0 no less ! ) , and 3 ) 12 months of full - time freelancing .
All within the first week of May .
Yet again , somehow it — “ it ” being full - time freelancing — has worked out .
Not without plenty of ups and downs , of course : Passing up the chance to work at Apple , getting blasted with nasty email from grammarati , an appearance on stage with Craig Newmark , and so on .
I ’ve found myself in extremely good company the last 6 months , and I ’ve enjoyed the ride immensely .
But every rose has its thorn , right ?
Some of the best lessons offered in life seemingly come only following failure .
I ’ll be the first to admit I ’m no expert at offering freelancing advice , but I hope a few things I ’ve learned will assist you in setting up or optimizing your own shop .
1. Speed is paramount .
I ca n’t stress this enough .
I hate , HATE to sacrifice quality for speed .
Those of you familiar with my work know of the level of detail I put in my designs .
But truth of the matter is it ’s simply good business to be efficient more often than not .
We live , work , and sleep in a global economy that moves at lightening speed .
I repeat something I said a couple years back :
There ’s a point at which quality becomes too costly — find that point with every project .
If additional quality is both too expensive and unnoticeable by the client and its audience , it ’s time to move on to other things .
2 . Late fees a happy contract maketh .
Oops .
I missed the boat on this one .
I got stuck with a few past due balances owed to me by clients — a couple 60 + days late and even one 90 + days late .
Now , aside from the fact that billing is cyclical to begin with , i.e. revenue earned in one month is typically based on work from the previous month , having outstanding balances for two even three months at a time can be detrimental to one ’s income .
Guess what happens next ?
You start to be late on your own bills — phone , utilities , etc — and you then incur late fees of your own .
See where I ’m going with this ?
Long story short :
Be sure your contract includes stipulations for late fees as 1 ) a catalyst for encouraging faster payment and 2 ) a way to recoup losses .
3. Escape the trap of endless email .
I ’m still trying to escape this mother of a trap .
Sending and replying to email easily consumes over an hour of every morning .
Client mail comes first .
After that , I attempt to respond to nearly every note I receive from readers and colleagues .
I ’d hate to see that change , but perhaps there may come a time in the near future when necessity forces me to do otherwise .
And while I still have n’t found the optimal escape route , Keith Robinson ’s “ A Guide to Email Triage ” is at least a start .
4 . If there is n’t time to do it right now , you can bet on even less time to do it later .
Think you ’ll have time later to get around to something that could otherwise be done now ?
Think again .
Bite the bullet , knock it out now , and avoid accumulating that inevitable , overwhelming stack of pending work .
5 . Be slow to burn bridges .
Some orchids take years to produce their first bloom .
I ’ve heard six years , even fifteen .
Consider taking just as long to burn any bridges with clients , key contacts , and just plain old friends in general .
In my one - year tenure as a full - time freelancer , I ’ve already burned a couple bridges I wish I would n’t have .
Never underestimate the value of a working relationship , even if things go sour .
Yes , it ’s wise to know when to exit an ailing relationship — in love , in business , in friendship .
But wiser is he that knows how to exit .
Find a way out peaceably .
6 . Staying focused is a luxury few freelancers enjoy .
Did I just write that ?
I did .
Think about it :
You ’re on your own .
You ’re the boss .
If you lack the necessary self - control to stay on task , life as a freelancer may not be your cup of tea .
I struggle much like anyone else , so it ’s a continual battle to keep waywardness in check .
Refresh the RSS feeds only once per day .
Use IM sparingly .
Multi -task less ( yes , less ) .
“ Great souls have wills ; feeble ones have only wishes ” suggests one Chinese proverb .
Stay on task , or you ’ll be left wishing you had .
7 . Send a signed W - 9 with the contract or first invoice .
Want that deposit or up - front payment faster ?
Consider including a signed W - 9 when you fax the signed contract or first invoice and you may be one step closer .
Some clients require them , others do n’t .
But I ’ve found that some of my client contacts forget about this until it comes to time to cut the first check .
But by then , your contract / invoice has been sent to Accounting , and it ’s a bit of a run-around at that point .
8 . Trust your gut .
No really .
If something does n’t feel right — the pushy prospective client , the shady list of deliverables , the questionable revenue model , etc. — it probably is n’t .
I ’ve turned down a fair share of projects based solely on the fact that something did n’t feel right at the outset .
Fact of the matter is you ’ll inevitably be faced with unknown variables in any decision , no matter how well you do your homework .
So do n’t bite if you ca n’t see the hook .
9 . Do n’t under - promise , over - deliver .
Instead , promise consistency , deliver consistency .
We ’ve all heard the cliched phrase too many times before .
“ Under - promise , over - deliver ! ”
That ’s a noble ideal many aspire to , while failing to prepare for the costs incurred by over - delivering .
Further , it ’s easy to exceed expectations the first time with a client , but extremely difficult subsequent times .
Instead , analyze the deliverables as best you can , set reasonable expectations , word the contract accordingly , and then go give it your best .
Clients will typically come to you for one or two specific reasons — they ’ve been told you ’ve got a great turn - around time , or they know you as someone who always puts out quality , and so on .
So promise quality and deliver quality .
Or promise speed and deliver speed .
Whatever you excel in , be consistent at it .
10 . Do n’t Mess with Taxes .
I originally had a few thoughts to offer on this matter .
But Doug Bowman ’s “ Reserving Enough for Uncle Sam ” seems to say it all better than I could .
In summary , set up a separate interest - bearing account strictly for taxes , and then deposit a percentage of revenue immediately upon receiving any payment .
Your percentage will vary , but 30 % is probably a safe place to start .
And that ’s all she wrote .
This is probably the last time I ’ll author thoughts on the subject , as there are plenty of other resources offering even better advice than mine .
Hopefully my 2c helps you earn your 2c a little more wisely .
