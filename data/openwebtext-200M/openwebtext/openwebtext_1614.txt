In a BBC interview British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward said Friday that the massive petroleum gusher in the Gulf of Mexico , the greatest oil - based environmental catastrophe in recorded history with the exception of global warming itself , should not forestall further deep - water drilling .
I ’m not sure whether Hayward was channeling Sarah Palin , that font of good sense , or vice versa .
In fact , better fuel mileage standards , more subways and trains , and better urban planning would save us from needing all that petroleum BP was unleashing for us 5000 feet down .
( Petroleum in the US is mainly used to power automobiles ) .
BP ’s Hayward compared deep water oil drilling to the 1960s Apollo program of manned flight to the moon and said that Apollo 13 , in which an on - board explosion made it difficult for three astronauts to return to the US , did not stop the effort to put a man on the moon .
Except that greedily destroying the environment with offshore petroleum drilling is not actually very much like flying to the moon .
And flying to the moon , for all the pollution it causes on the way up to the stratosphere , wo n’t destroy the earth .
And the problems on Apollo 13 , when the three astronauts barely got back to earth alive , were n’t anything like the gargantuan viscous black monster that Hayward ’s incompetence has unleashed on the Gulf coast .
And finally , for some posh arrogant foreign twit to invoke the heroism of James A. Lovell , Jack Swigert , and Fred Haise to excuse the greatest corporate SNAFU of the twenty - first century just about makes my blood boil .
If BP is in favor of it , it seems as though it bodes disaster .
BP ( then the Anglo - Iranian Oil Company ) helped through its arrogance provoke the CIA overthrow of the elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran in 1953 , which brought back the shah as a Western - backed dictator and led to the 1979 Islamic Revolution and our subsequent problems with Iran .
And , BP is alleged to have been part of the prep for the Iraq War , training British troops in fall of 2002 in the upkeep and operation of the oil fields that the Anglo - American invasion force later occupied in southern Iraq .
A wise investment .
BP now has a contract to develop the huge Rumaila oil field in Iraq .
Meanwhile , ABC News revealed that BP and the White House kept a BP video of the massive gusher on the ocean floor away from the public , even though it was being looped at a White House situation room .
Firedoglake points out that experts say the video suggests that 3 million gallons a day are being spewed out , far more than the BP estimate .
You have to go to amateur video shot from a helicopter above the Gulf of Mexico and posted on Youtube to get the best reporting on the extent and implications of the BP oil volcano .
And now , like those old Japanese horror movies where Godzilla was n’t enough and sea monsters had to be added to the mix , the hurricane season is looming , with unpredictable effects on the environmental impact of the oil monster .
Torry Holt , a 12 - year veteran receiver whose best days were as part of the Rams ’ “ Greatest Show on Turf , ” will sign a one - year , $ 1.7 million deal with New England , according to a league source .
Listed at 6 - feet , 200 pounds ,
Holt spent last season with the Jaguars , with 51 receptions for 722 yards ( 14.2 yards per catch ) .
During the first 10 seasons of his career , all in St. Louis , Holt averaged 87 catches per season ; in the Super Bowl XXXVI loss to the Patriots , he recorded five grabs .
Soon to be 34 years old , Holt provides more depth to a position needing it in New England .
In March , Holt told NFL.com that he wanted to play with an elite quarterback .
He now has that in Tom Brady .
It is no secret that games that eventually reach store shelves are vast departures from the form in which these games were originally conceived .
Character designs , gameplay mechanics and story arcs generally go through multiple iterations before they are finalized , and a portion of the original Bioshock pitch - document clearly shows how much the 2007 blockbuster has departed from the original concept as presented in 2002 .
Collin Moore , Community Manager of Irrational Games , which was known as 2 K at the release of BioShock , has released the first nine pages of this pitch document , giving a unique insight into the original concept on which BioShock is based .
One of the most important aspects that differs from the final version of the game , is the fact that the story was more focused on a religious cult , and was originally intended to have a multiplayer component .
Furthermore , the document clearly states that , even in it ’s earliest form , the franchise was regarded as having strong potential for film or television .
A movie adaptation was announced in 2008 , but was still in pre-production as of January 2010 .
Rather than the underwater city known as Rapture , the story would have taken place in a complex that is built by a religious cult below an island .
Players would have been able to dynamically alter their character , their weapons and their environment , allowing them to customize weapons with components found throughout the game and use those to build unique weapons .
In the actual game , players were limited to specific upgrades for each weapon found throughout Rapture .
Furthermore , the game was intended to have a hacking - mechanic more reminicsent of System Shock 2 , which allowed players to take control of security bots , rather than just deactivating them or converting them to join the cause .
A unique feature that was oringally intended to be included is the ability to control the environment .
By using terminals to affect the level of oxygen , gravity , temprature and similar settings , players would have been able to provide damage boosts to weapons , or reduce the effectiveness of other objects .
Examples provided include increasing oxygen to increase the blast radius of explosive weapons , ionizing air to increase electrical damage and magnetizing the floor to immobilize robots and turn grenades into objects that stick to other surfaces .
Finally , the pitch - document explains that players were originally intended to be able to modify their bodies using genotypes of other species , allowing them to inherit certain types of strengths and weaknesses .
The available pages of the document , which states that the game was originally intended to be released for PC , can be found after the jump .
The eventual game was released in 2007 for the Xbox 360 and PC , with a Playstation 3 version following in 2008 and a Mac version in 2009 .

WASHINGTON —
In her early years as a law professor , Elena Kagan wrote almost exclusively on the First Amendment .
There are indications in those writings that her views on government regulation of speech were closer to the Supreme Court ’s more conservative justices , like Antonin Scalia , than to Justice John Paul Stevens , whom she hopes to replace .
Justice Stevens is not a First Amendment absolutist .
He wrote the majority opinion in 1978 in Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation , which said the government could ban the broadcast of George Carlin ’s “ seven dirty words ” monologue .
And he dissented in Texas v. Johnson , a 1989 decision striking down a state law that made it a crime to burn the flag , while Justice Scalia was in the majority .
There is good reason to think Ms. Kagan disagreed with Justice Stevens in both cases .
“ Her articles on free speech showed a strong sense of the importance of civil liberties as a bulwark against ideological orthodoxy — a perspective that will give her ready camaraderie with free speech devotees on the court like Justices Scalia , Kennedy and Thomas , ” Kathleen Sullivan , a former dean of Stanford Law School , said in a blog post on The New York Times ’s Web site .
About the flag - burning case , Ms. Kagan wrote in 1996 that “ the court , in invalidating the statute , made the correct decision . ”

" This is what I want to be known for . "
Photo : PowerPlay SolarThe Obama administration last week gave a $ 62 million boost to efforts to make solar power truly competitive with coal .
“ The projects announced today will seek to improve component and system designs to extend operation [ of concentrated solar power projects ] to an average of about 18 hours per day , a level of production that would make it possible for these plants to displace traditional coal - burning power plants , ” the Department of Energy said in a statement announcing cash grants that are being doled out over the next five years .
The recipients are companies developing technology to store energy generated by solar thermal plants so that it can be used at night or when the sun does n’t shine .
In the utility biz , that ’s called baseload power .
( Solar thermal plants typically use vast arrays of mirrors to focus the sun on a liquid - filled boiler to create steam that drives an electricity - generating turbine . )
It ’s hardly a huge amount of cash .
But it ’s going to a mix of startups and big old - line tech companies — many in California — that are working on some potentially game - changing technology .
But how much of the game needs to be changed ?
That question seems heretical — we ’ll have achieved renewable - energy nirvana when solar farms grow electrons 24/7 , right ?
But it was raised by J.D. Sitton , chief executive of Infinia , a solar startup backed by prominent green - tech venture capitalist Khosla Ventures as well as eSolar founder Bill Gross ’ Idealab and Vulcan Capital , the Seattle investment firm run by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen .
“ There ’s a raging debate in the solar thermal business about how much is storage worth and how much it matters , ” says Sitton , whose , Kennewick , Wash. , company , scored $ 3 million from the Department of Energy to create storage technology for its Stirling solar dish .
Resembling a large mirrored satellite receiver , Infinia ’s 21 - foot - tall PowerDish focuses the sun on a Stirling engine suspended on an arm over the center of the device .
The heat causes a gas inside the engine to expand and drive a piston that generates electricity .
The DOE grant — and others Infinia has received from the federal government — will allow the company to integrate storage capacity into the dish apparatus .
Sitton says that will involve some form of molten salt that will store PowerDish - generated heat that can be released to drive the Stirling engine when the sun is not shining .
Adding storage to a solar power plant also increases its cost — the more hours you want to run a solar farm , the more storage you need — and Sitton says the key is balancing that capacity with the demand on the grid .
“ We can do a 15 - minute system , a one - hour system , and , with the latest award , we can do baseload — 12 hours , ” says Sitton .
“ I do n’t think the market particularly needs that — taking a peak solar resource and trying to deliver it at midnight . ”
Rather than allowing a solar power plant to operate around the clock , the real benefit of energy storage , he says , will be to transform solar power plants into a consistent and reliable source of electricity for grid operators .
In other words , when clouds or other weather conditions cause electricity production to dip , storage systems can release heat to keep the power flowing smoothly to the grid .
That enhances the overall reliability of the renewable energy grid and in turn increases the value of solar farms to grid operators .
And just 15 minutes of stored production could make a world of difference , according to Sitton .
“ Fifteen minutes is a real differentiator as grid operators can count on the solar resource to be there , ” he says .
“ If you go talk to the grid operators in Spain , they ’ll tell you they ’ve got some headaches due to high penetration of wind — the episodic nature of the wind resource drives them a bit batty . ”
Storage also could give solar thermal technology an edge over increasingly popular photovoltaic farms , which use semiconducting materials like silicon to convert sunlight directly into electricity but do not generate heat .
The only current way to store electricity generated from PV power plants is batteries — an astronomically expensive proposition .
As solar cell prices have plummeted over the past year and some solar thermal power plant projects planned for the Mojave Desert remain bogged down in environmental disputes , California utilities have been signing ever - larger deals for photovoltaic power .
Energy storage for solar thermal plants would help balance the solar grid .
So , does that mean there ’s no place for solar power plants that can operate 12 or 18 hours a day ?
Not at all .
As the grid becomes more decentralized with the addition of electric cars , rooftop solar arrays , small - scale wind turbines , and other sources of renewable energy , being able to balance supply and demand will become more important than ever .
And in some hot regions of the country where demand peaks later in the day as everyone turns on their air conditioners upon returning home from work , such solar farms could replace so - called peaking fossil - fuel power plants that sit idle for most of the year at great expense .
( Andrew Tang , a PG&E executive , recently told me that some of his utility ’s peaking plants operate only 50 hours a year . )
But there should be no illusion that even round - the - clock solar farms alone will send coal - fired plants to the fossil - fuel bin of history .
In the United States , solar thermal power plants are mainly limited to the desert Southwest , a region that receives strong direct sunlight .
They are not feasible in the coal - dependent Midwest and East .
Still , the Southwest currently relies heavily on coal and will need to find alternatives if significant climate change legislation is ever enacted .
( Even California , which does not operate coal - fired plants , imports out - of - state dirty power to meet 20 percent of its electricity demand .
Under current law , it will have to replace those imports with green energy . )
And there ’s no shortage of interest by companies seeking to devise energy storage solutions .
eSolar , for instance , scored $ 10.8 million to pursue a new power plant design .
Bill Gross of eSolar told me the startup was n’t yet ready to talk in detail about that project , but DOE described the technology this way : “ Instead of one central tower and receiver , the plant will employ multiple , modular towers .
Using reflective mirrors , the sun ’s radiation will heat a liquid salt within each receiver .
A specialized molten salt transport system will then move the high - temperature fluid to a molten - salt steam generator that produces electricity . ”
Abengoa Solar , the U.S. arm of the Spanish renewable energy company , will also pursue molten salt technology with its $ 10.6 million grant .
Rocketdyne , the United Technologies subsidiary that pioneered molten salt technology and which licenses it to Santa Monica startup SolarReserve , received $ 10.2 million to develop a next - gen version .
The DOE also is funding feasibility studies of more cutting - edge technologies , such as storing energy in solid modular blocks .
And a company called Terrafore , based in Riverside , Calif. , will develop a storage system that “ takes advantage of the energy that is transferred when materials melt and solidify . ”
Talk about a hot technology .
Berry , 24 , testified last week that he acted in self - defense and that he opened fire when the musician , whose real name was Roderick Anthony Burton II , threatened to kill him and reached behind as if to draw a weapon .
The trial of Aubrey Berry , an events promoter from Atlanta , revolved in part around the victim ’s violent rap lyrics as the defense sought to portray the rapper as a threatening gang member who was shot as he attacked Berry .
A man accused of murdering an up - and - coming rapper who was fatally shot at the Beverly Center last year was found not guilty Friday by a Los Angeles jury .
Berry told jurors that Burton , 21 , had been part of a group of men who beat him at an Atlanta nightclub less than two weeks before the shooting .
He said the two men ran across each other by chance on May 18 , 2009 , inside a P.F.
Chang ’s restaurant at the upscale mall .
But prosecutors argued that Burton ’s lyrics were simply entertainment and that they had no bearing on what happened outside the restaurant in the mall ’s parking garage .
They noted that police never found a weapon on Burton .
And prosecutors accused Berry of shooting the musician in the back as he tried to flee .
Burton was shot four times – once in the left biceps and three times in the back .

Earlier today , reporter Jack Leonard and editor Matt Lait discussed the case :
Luis Corrons spent much of the last year helping Spanish police with an investigation that led to the arrest of three local men suspected of operating and renting access to a massive and global network of hacked computers .
Then , roughly 60 days after their arrest , something strange happened :
Two of them unexpectedly turned up at Corrons ’ office and asked to be hired as security researchers .
Corrons , a technical director and blogger for Spanish security firm Panda Security , said he received a visit from the hackers on the morning of March 22 .
The two men , known by the online nicknames “ Netkairo ” and “ Ostiator , ” were arrested in February by Spanish police for their alleged role in running the “ Mariposa ” botnet , a malware distribution platform that spread malicious software to more than 12 million Internet addresses from 190 countries ( mariposa is Spanish for “ butterfly ” ) .
Now , here the two Mariposa curators were at Panda ’s headquarters in Bilbao , their resumes in hand , practically begging for a job , Corrons said .
“ At first , I could n’t believe it , and I thought someone in the office was playing a practical joke on me , ” Corrons said .
“ But these guys were the real guys , and they were serious .
“ Ostiator told me , ‘ The thing is , with everything that ’s been happening , we ’re not earning any money at the moment , ” Corrons recalled .
“ He said , ‘ We thought we could look for some kind of agreement in which both sides would benefit .
We think we have knowledge [ that ] could be useful to Panda and thought we could have some kind of agreement with Panda . ' ”
Spanish police do not typically release the names of individuals who have been arrested , and Netkairo and Ostiator have n’t yet been charged with any crime .
But Corrons recognized that the names and addresses on the resumes matched those that police had identified as residences belonging to Netkairo and Ostiator .
Corrons said Panda ’s lawyers were unwilling to release the full names of the two men that visited Panda Labs , but said Ostiator ’s first name is Juan Jose , and that he is a 25 - year - old male from Santiago de Compostela .
Corrons said Netkairo is a 31 - year - old from Balmaseda named Florencio .
Shortly after the arrests were announced , local Spanish media said the third individual arrested by Spanish authorities in connection with Mariposa — a 30 - year - old identified by his initials “ JPR ” — used the hacker nickname “ Johny Loleante ” and lived in Molina de Segura , Murcia .
On Mar. 3 , I had the opportunity to interview Captain Cesar Lorenzana , deputy head technology crime division of the Spanish Civil Guard .
Lorenzana told Krebsonsecurity.com that Netkairo and his associate were earning about 3,000 Euros each month renting out the Mariposa botnet to other hackers .
Interviewing the same hackers less than three weeks later , Corrons asked them how they got started creating Mariposa .
“ Basically , they said they started it as kind of a hobby , and that they were n’t working at the time , ” Corrons said .
“ Suddenly , they started to earn money , a few hundred Euros a week to start , and then discovered they could n’t stop .
And the whole time , their network kept growing . ”
Corrons said he told the pair there was really no way his company could hire them , but that he ’d ask his boss all the same .
“ I told them , ‘ I ’m not sure what you were thinking , but using Mariposa as your business card is not really a great help , quite the opposite in fact , ' ” Corrons said .
“ I said , ‘ Well , I ca n’t promise anything [ and ] the fact you were behind Mariposa wo n’t work in your favor , although in any event , I do n’t have the last word .
I ’ll speak about this with the management at Panda . ’ ”
Corrons said the meeting ended shortly after that , and later that evening he noticed he had two new followers on Twitter .
One of the new followers , a user named “ FLOXTER_SEC , ” a few days later sent him a message saying “ please dont [ sic ] forget us , everyone deserves a second chance . ”
The name attached to that Twitter profile is one “ Florencio Carro ” ( Spanish authorities said Netkairo ’s real initials were FCR ) .
THE SECOND MEETING
Corrons said he had no direct contact with the two hackers again until Apr. 12 , when someone calling himself Netkairo called him at work .
“ He told me , ‘ Listen , I ’m calling because Juanjo [ Ostiator ] is insisting that I come and see you , ” Corrons said .
“ He was asking about working for us again , and said , ‘ We just want to know — as you have n’t answered — whether you ’re thinking of hiring us or not ? ' ”
Corrons said he met with with Netkairo again at Panda ’s offices , but said he repeated his previous statement that the company could not hire someone who had been accused of running a botnet .
“ So he says to me , ‘ But we still have n’t been charged , ’ Corrons recalled .
“ I told him , ‘ It does n’t matter … just the fact that you are involved is a problem when it comes to working for any serious security company . ’
And what he then came out with says a lot about him .
He said , “ Yeah , but nobody else knows that . ”
When it became clear that Panda was n’t interested in hiring him , Netkairo changed his tune , Corrons said , claiming he had found vulnerabilities in the company ’s cloud anti-virus software and hinting that he planned to publish the information .
Later that week , someone opened a blog at Google Blogspot using the account name “ NeTK , ” and posted a video labeled Panda Cloud Antivirus Detection Bypass POC .
For his part , Corrons dismisses the video , saying it merely shows the obvious result of disconnecting an anti-virus solution from the Internet .
NETKAIRO RESPONDS
Reached via e-mail and instant message , Netkairo said he was limited in what he could discuss about his case at the moment .
He acknowledged visiting Panda and asking for a job there , saying he was flat broke now that their Mariposa money - making machine was gone .
But he said Panda ’s estimate of 12 million PCs infected by the Mariposa botnet was hugely inflated .
“ I can say that they [ have ] 100 x the real numbers just to do nice marketing , ” Netkairo wrote in an e-mail .
“ The real size of mariposa was like 100,000 , [ and ] peak about 500,000 to 900,000 total machines . ”
Netkairo said Panda failed to take into account the prevalence of so - called “ dynamic ” Internet addresses , where the same computer is assigned multiple Internet addresses over a period of time .
Corrons said the 12 million estimate was never meant to mean distinct , individual PCs , and that the company was careful to note that it was only talking about the number of unique Internet addresses that it saw associated with Mariposa .
A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING
Whether the true number of PCs infected by Mariposa was one million or 12 million , the botnet culled massive amounts of personal data from infected systems .
Spanish police said Mariposa helped crooks steal sensitive data from more than 800,000 victims , including home users , companies , government agencies and universities in at least 190 countries .
The botnet was rented out to criminals as a delivery platform for installing malicious software such as the data - stealing ZeuS Trojan and pay - per- install toolbars .
Panda said the gang also stole directly from victim bank accounts , using money mules in the United States and Canada , and laundered stolen money through online gambling Web sites .
Mariposa illustrates just how much damage malicious hackers can wreak these days with just a modicum of know - how .
Corrons said both Netkairo and Ostiator told him that while they did indeed maintain the Mariposa botnet , they did not develop the botnet code and had relatively few technical skills .
One hacker in the criminal underground who is familiar with Netkairo ’s activities said the botnet owners generated many of the installations for their bot by seeding poisoned copies of pirated software on peer - to - peer file - sharing networks .
Spanish police say the break in the case came when one of the members of the Mariposa gang made an amateur mistake : Accessing the botnet ’s control networks directly from his home Internet address instead of anonymizing his connection by relaying it through a mesh of third - party systems .
Perhaps Netkairo is being so bold because he does n’t believe he will see the inside of a prison cell for his crimes .
Indeed , Spanish authorities concede it may be extremely challenging to put the men in jail , even if they are convicted at trial .
“ In Spain , it is not a crime to own and operate a botnet or distribute malware , ” Capt .
Lorenzana told Krebsonsecurity in March .
“ So even if we manage to prove they are using a botnet , we will need to prove they also were stealing identities and other things , and that is where our lines of investigation are focusing right now . ”

2 Installing The Base System
The installation of the base system is easy as 1 - 2 - 3 because the Linux Mint installer does n't offer a lot of options to choose from , so you can not go wrong .
Download the Linux Mint 9 Live DVD iso image from http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php, burn it onto a DVD , and boot your computer from it ( please note that I used the Live DVD iso image instead of the Live CD iso image ; the Live DVD comes with some additional software such as Java , VLC , F - Spot that get installed by default , whereas they are missing if you install from the Live CD ; if you use the Live CD , you must install these applications from the Synaptic Package Manager ) :
The system boots and starts a desktop that is run entirely in the RAM of your system ( the Linux Mint installation DVD is also a Live - DVD ) without changing anything on your hard disk .
This has the advantage that you can test how Linux Mint works on your hardware before you finally install it .
This is how the Linux Mint desktop looks .
Double - click the Install Linux Mint icon on the desktop to start the installation to the hard drive :
The installer starts .
First , select your language :
Then choose your time zone :
AdvertisementAdvertisement
Change the keyboard layout , if necessary :
Now we come to the partitioning of our hard disk .
Usually Erase and use the entire disk is a good choice , unless you need custom partitions and know what you 're doing .
Erase and use the entire disk will create one big / partition for us :
Type in your real name , your desired username along with a password , and click on Forward : Advertisement
The next screen shows us a summary of the installation settings .
Click on Install to start the installation :
The Linux Mint system is being installed .
This can take a few minutes , so be patient :
After the installation is complete , we must reboot the system to use it .
Click on Restart now :
The Live - CD desktop shuts down .
At the end , the Linux Mint CD is ejected .
Remove it from the CD drive and hit the < ENTER > key to boot into your new Linux Mint desktop :
Your new Linux Mint system starts .
Log in to the desktop with the username and password you provided during installation : Advertisement
When you log in for the first time , you will see the following help window .
Click on Close :
This is how your new desktop looks :
Now the base system is ready to be used .
( CNN ) --
A former Catholic bishop in Norway has admitted sexually abusing a minor 20 years ago , a spokesman for the Norwegian Catholic Church said Wednesday .
Bishop Georg Mueller admitted to having sexually abused an altar boy but said there were no other victims , said church spokesman Andreas Dingstad .
Mueller , 58 , became a priest in 1978 and served as bishop of Trondheim , Norway , from 1997 to 2009 .
The abuse is said to have happened more than 20 years ago , when Mueller was a priest in Trondheim , Dingstad said .
Allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have spread across Europe , surfacing in countries including the Netherlands , France , Mexico , Italy , Ireland , the United States , Austria and Germany , home country of Pope Benedict XVI .
Some have been critical of Catholic leaders including the pope , saying little action had been taken when he was a top Vatican official .
Waves of victims have come forward , claiming they were victims of abuse by religious leaders and saying the church did little or nothing to stop it .
In a rare move , a senior cardinal spoke Sunday before the pope 's Easter Mass at the Vatican , saying the pontiff maintains the support of Catholics around the world " who do not let themselves be influenced by the gossip . "
Cardinal Angelo Sodano , former Vatican secretary of state and dean of the College of Cardinals , did not specifically mention the sexual abuse scandal , but his remarks clearly referred to criticism leveled at church leaders .
The pope did not address the scandal in his Easter message .
In a letter last month , he said he was " truly sorry " for the abuse suffered by victims at the hands of Catholic priests in Ireland .

Tony 's terrorism claims win
by Jeremy Hooper
Just moments after President Obama 's State of the Union speech , the Family Research Council 's Tony Perkins said that the Commander in Chief is " willing to jeopardize our nation ’s security to advance the agenda of the radical homosexual lobby . "
Comments that got him ( rightly ) disinvited from a speaking engagement at Andrew 's Air Force Base .
Well now Perkins has turned his attention to Elena Kagan , using the exact same meme to reject the SCOTUS nominee 's concern for our national security :
" It 's not that Elena Kagan does not want the military to defend our nation against terrorism ; it 's just that she wants to use the military to advance the left 's radical social policy more .
At least we know her priorities . " [ SOURCE ]
Truly beyond the pale .
And honestly , the kind of thing that deserves condemnation well outside of the so - called " culture war " and the usual partisan breakdowns that fall within it .
These kinds of comments , which Tony has clearly adopted as anti-DADT strategy , deserve attention and condemnation from the political commentariat all - around .
Take Tony 's flippant words to their logical end .
What he is seriously suggesting -- without scruples , irony , humor , true Christian principles , restraint , or apology -- is that both the president and one of his crucial nominees ( and current Solicitor General ) , if given the choice between removing a live bomb from Times Square and removing the live ban from the armed forces , would choose the latter .
There is no way around it :
Tony is saying that these two ( and presumably anyone in office who supports repeal ) are willing to sacrifice as many our servicemembers ' lives as needed in order to finally remove this one bit of discrimination from the military .
Because , ya know :
He " knows her priorities . "
Tony has created a skewed , remarkably cruel straw man -- a hierarchy on which progressive supporters of DADT repeal cannot move forward with publicly popular plans for military inclusion without having to turn a blind eye to anthrax and subway bombs .
The rhetoric is truly jaw - dropping , if one thinks about what it 's actually implying .
And remember :
This is not coming from a random writer .
It 's not coming from Peter LaBarbera .
This is not coming from Paul Cameron .
Not Westboro Baptist .
This is the Family Research Council , a group that ( a ) obtains regular bookings on all mainstream cable channels , ( b ) hosts one of the most prominent annual events on the conservative calendar ( the Values Voters Summit ) , at which ( c ) all major GOP candidates willingly cater / defer to the organizational mission .
In short :
They get respect from the right .
They influence right - leaning lawmakers .
They matter to many .
And rather than fight for the basic freedoms on which this nation is built , Tony is instead fighting against those partisan opponents who are working towards the same .
At least we know his priorities .

Web video without ads ?
No one would mind that .
However , iPad users viewing the popular New York Times site are finding out that not having to sit through ads has a price — fewer videos to watch .
Here 's why : Apple wo n't allow Flash based videos to run on an iPad .
The Times and thousands of other sites use a media player called Brightcove to play those Flash - less videos .
But without Flash , Brightcove can't include ads , or the analytic tools that allow advertisers to measure the performance of ads , said Brightcove 's marketing chief Jeff Whatcott .
And since ads pay the bills , the Times wo n't post many videos on the version of its site tuned for the iPad .
Normally , the technology industry 's progress in adopting standards is like making sausage :
You do n't want to see it or know too much about it .
But as the problem on the Times Web site illustrates , the tiff over Flash and a rival video standard called HTML 5 is having a real effect on the Web - loving public .
Users of mobile devices like the iPad and iPhone are unwilling participants in the skirmish , and you can expect ripples to reach the desktop as well .
[ Is Steve Jobs playing fair , or just playing politics , with the Flash complaints ?
See CIO.com 's investigative story Apple - Adobe Feud : Is Flash as Bad as Jobs Says ? ]
" Browser wars are back , " says analyst Ron Rogowski , of Forrester Research .
In the next year or so , you 'll see all of the major browsers offering significant upgrades .
That 's a good thing , of course , but the standards battle means that users will have to upgrade if they want to have a decent experience on many of the sites they visit .
And most annoying of all , people who browse at work using locked - down machines will be stuck , says Rogowski .
Many businesses are still using IE 6 , an old browser that simply wo n't work with video content on sites that have moved to HTML 5 .
What 's New in Firefox 4
The newest member of the browser world is so new that it is n't actually here yet .
It is Firefox 4 , the open source browser from the Mozilla organization , which previewed its newest version earlier this month .
Mike Beltzner , who heads Firefox development for the Mozilla group , said in a blog post that goals for the new version of the popular browser , expected late in the year , are more speed , a move to new technologies , including HTML 5 , a cleaner interface , and more user customization and control .
More speed may seem like a given for any new product , but Beltzner was fairly specific , saying that he hopes to eliminate those annoying pop-ups that frequently appear when Firefox loads , delaying startup .
Even more significant would be the ability to update in the background , as Google 's Chrome browser already does .
Whether that feature will make the deadline to appear in Firefox 4 is n't clear ; indeed Beltzner was careful to warn that any of the features he previewed in his post are subjected to change .
The interface is likely to change , becoming cleaner and more like that of Chrome's .
The home button could disappear and be replaced with a persistent tab , while tabs themselves move about the address bar .
The new version of Firefox will likely have a revamped control panel for managing passwords , cookies , pop -up blocking , geolocation , local data storage , and related details .
It will be easier to see what permissions have been granted to Web sites for each category .
And if you 've shopped for a Windows PC lately , you 've probably noticed how many ship with a 64 - bit version of Windows , which supports much more memory than 32 - bit versions .
Mozilla has noticed that as well , and will support 64 - bit operating systems in Firefox .
Flash vs. HTML 5 : The Backlash
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs made a big splash in a blot post outlining why he wo n't allow Flash to run on Apple 's mobile devices .
( It does , however , run on Mac computers . )
It 's a battery hog , he says , and it does n't support touch and uses up your battery too fast .
All of which is true , but Jobs , a big supporter of HTML 5 , left out a few key facts .
" HTML 5 is superior for text and search optimization , " says Forrester 's Rogowski .
But when it comes to video , HTML 5 is slower than Flash or Silverlight , is n't supported by today 's browsers and does n't do as good a job rendering advanced graphics such as 3D , he said .
And as sites start to use HTML 5 , users hoping to enjoy it will have to download a new browser such as Google Chrome , Apple Safari , or Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 .
" Users will have to adjust to a new browsing experience simply to avoid downloading a plug - in , " said Rogowski .
For technical reasons that have to do with the rules governing open source software , Firefox will have to use a different codec ( the part of the browser that decodes and uncompress video ) , to play HTML 5 than that used by the other browsers .
There 's some debate about the quality of the open source codec , but whether it's as good or not , it 's simply another layer of confusion that could cause annoyance for Web users .
Ultimately , all this will settle down as the industry figures out how to integrate new technologies .
But until it does , browsing the Web will be a bit bumpier than usual , and consumers will be forced to learn more than they want to know about tech - industry standards .

Wind turbines do n’t make people sick , Ontario ’s chief medical officer of health says after conducting a study of adverse health effects associated with the clean energy sources .
After examining scientific papers and reports on wind turbines from a number of databases and sources , Dr. Arlene King released a report Thursday that concludes that while some people living near turbines report symptoms such as dizziness , headaches , and sleep disturbance , the evidence to date does not demonstrate a “ direct causal link ” between turbines and ill health .
However , a groundswell of people living in communities near some of the turbines claim the low - frequency noise emitted from the blades has sickened nearly 106 Ontario residents , who report health problems ranging from hypertension to sleeplessness and nosebleeds in children .
There are over 690 green - energy wind turbines across Ontario .
“ There are no direct links between wind turbines and adverse health impacts , ” King said in an interview .
“ This variety of symptoms can be caused by a variety of different factors .
It is important if individuals have symptoms or concerns ( that they ) be assessed by their physicians . ”
The review examined a number of areas such as the relationship between low - frequency sound , infrasound and health .
The review concluded the sound level from the turbines is “ not sufficient ” to cause hearing impairment or other direct health issues , “ but it may annoy some people ” .
Wind energy is a clean , green , source of energy .
King said the turbines are far better than coal - fired power plants which produce air pollutants proven to harm human health – especially for those with chronic respiratory problems or asthma .
Ontario promises to eliminate coal - fired generation by the end of 2014 .
John Laforet of Wind Concerns Ontario , a coalition of over 40 community groups in 27 counties across the province , called the study worthless because King did not survey the people suffering health problems .
“ She did n’t talk to a single person reporting adverse symptoms , ” he said .
“ This is either one hell of a coincidence or there is a causal relationship here . ”
King said she did obtain information from individuals that was “ received and considered . ”
She also examined scientific studies and databases , held discussions with relevant government agencies and sought input from organizations such as Laforet ’s Wind Concerns Ontario .
Barb Ashbee claims she was a victim of wind turbine noise .
She used to live near the Shelburne wind farm , where there are more than 100 turbines , but moved to the Orangeville area because of health concerns .
“ We had heart palpitations , stomach problems , sleep deprivation and terrible cognitive problems .
My husband actually had thyroid problems , ” she said .
The report ’s findings “ sicken ” Ashbee .
“ These people are supposed to protect our health , ” she said .
“ I am stunned . ”

Ashbee ’s health problems have improved since she moved away from the farms but she fears for others .
“ I get so angry .
There are so many sick people and they are shutting them out . ”
Going forward , King said she ’ll continue to watch for any new data on wind turbines and health .
The ministry of the environment is providing $ 1.5 million in funding for over five years for a research chair in renewable energy technologies and health , she added .

A video posted on YouTube two days before April Fool ’s Day asks , “ Did Sean Hannity call his audience Tim McVeigh - wannabes ? ”
Well , the answer is … sort of .
At the very end of this video clip taken from a FOX News Channel broadcast on March 30 , and uploaded by the website Mox News , conservative radio host and Fox anchor Hannity can be clearly heard telling his audience , “ Can I add one thing .
I think we won the debate . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ When you think of the vast majorities they have in Congress , and they had the bribe back room deals , corruption , ” Hannity continued , “ that ’s because of the Tea Party movement , all these Tim McVeigh wannabes . ”
So far , at press time , the video has only gotten 1,475 views , but it was mentioned on Thom Hartmann ’s radio show this morning and the link is being emailed to news sites such as RAW STORY ( A shorter clip with only 345 viewings can be viewed at this link ) .
Fox News Channel viewers , at the time of its broadcast , wondered why a crowd full of conservatives would cheer being compared to the white supremacist sympathizer who was executed for killing 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing which destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building .
At a forum for Comedy Central ’s Daily Show , viewers from the left and right were taken aback .
ADVERTISEMENT
Hopefully some staffer has already seen this – or you guys tivo his show to catch this kinda stuff , but ….
Just before his commercial break at about 9:10 , Hannity praised the crowd for being “ Tim McVeigh wannabes . ”
I could n’t believe my ears – I still kinda hope I heard it wrong .
Palin and her crosshairs are one thing , but this ????
For the sake of context …
Hannity ’s show is in the Reagan “ Library ” and they started out talking about getting rid of Obama , etc … . ….. Yeah , I heard it to .
It knocked me back so far I had to sign up here to get the word out .
Still find it hard to believe .
….. I just heard the “ Tim McVeigh Wannabes ” comment myself on the Hannity replay here in the Midwest at about 11:15 .
Immediately “ went to the Google ” to check whether I heard what I thought I heard .
I ’m about as conservative as they come ( I have Ronald Reagan ’s picture hanging nearby right now ) , but I hope that he was n’t urging on anyone who would even remotely try to emulate McVeigh . ….
Yes , as the conclusion to the host and two guests stroking up each others egos in a typical unilateral discussion anger orgy , they said that healthcare was actually a victory and then Hannity thanked the supporters of the victory including the tea party and the Tim McVeigh wannabes .
And it gets better ..
There was applause and cheering .
Forum user Rusty Bucket speculated , “ Well I could see how he might have been trying to use sarcasm – but the only thing is – alot of those people DO want to be Tim McVeigh wannabes .
So he may have been sarcastic , but I dunno about some of the fruitbats in that audience . ”
An article at Utah ’s Ksl.com reveals that Rusty Bucket pretty much nailed it .
ADVERTISEMENT
The day after the Tea Party Express made a stop in Salt Lake City , a prominent voice of conservative talk radio was in town with a similar message .
Sean Hannity broadcast his national talk show from KSL studios Wednesday .
He told a small gathering before the show that the Tea Party movement is legitimate and will withstand mounting attacks from its opponents on the left .
“ We ’ve got veterans , we ’ve got stay - at - home moms , people who really do n’t like the direction of the country .
They ’re speaking out and they ’ve been compared to terrorists , Tim McVeigh - wannabes .
They ’ve been called un -American .
They ’ve been called every name in the book .
Now , the latest attack is that these people are violent , ” he said .
So , Hannity was almost definitely using sarcasm when he referred to his audience as “ McVeigh - wannabes . ”

However , there does n’t seem to be any explanation for why Congressman Kevin McCarthy falsely said that no Republicans voted for the stimulus last year .
Liberals can feel free to mock that with no fear , since the audience at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , California cheered that , as well .

Developer Obsidian Entertainment is taking over for Bethesda Softworks for the follow - up to Fallout 3 , set three years after the events of that game and thousands of miles westward , featuring an all - new cast of characters .
What does Fallout : New Vegas have to offer the Vault dwelling veteran ?
Specifically , for the serious Fallout fan , New Vegas introduces a Hardcore option from the get - go , allowing them to bypass early tutorials and live a more difficult post - nuclear life .
Players opting to go hardcore will have to stave off hunger and dehydration , and will be required to visit doctors for more serious injuries .
Hardcore also more harshly limits the amount of ammo one can carry , applying weight to bullets .
Stimpacks wo n't heal instantly , but will heal over time .

Players can choose whether they want to go Hardcore during the game 's opening , which does n't begin in a Vault , but at the offices of New Vegas ' medicine man Doc Mitchell .
He 'll patch you right up after your whole " I 've got a bullet in my head " ordeal that starts off the next Fallout .
Yes , finding out who was trying to blow your brains clean out and why they left you for dead will play some part in the story of Fallout : New Vegas .
Doc Mitchell will fix your face up the way you like and , through a series of tests , help you determine your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. abilities ( Strength , Perception , Endurance , Charisma , Intelligence , Agility , Luck ) .
He 'll set you up with a Pip Boy 3000 and get you on your way .

Obsidian's new take on Fallout introduces a few other changes , starting with the Companion Wheel .
The pop -up radial menu lets players control their allies in battle , issuing simple command behaviors to AI - controlled compatriots .
The VATS combat system has also been tweaked , allowing for melee attack commands .
Just do n't expect a massive difference in the way the successful targeting system worked in Fallout 3 .
But do expect a greater variety of weapons , thanks to new weapon mods that let players customize their firearms with larger clips , scopes and specialized ammo .
More outlandish weapons like the grenade machine gun and golf club will also add a little variety to your post - nuclear excursions .

During your journey across the desert lands of Fallout : New Vegas , you 'll have to deal with the various factions who claim ownership of certain territories , like the New California Republic , the Brotherhood of Steel and Caesar 's Legion .
The notoriety system complements the karma system of Fallout 3 .
Depending on the actions you take — who you kill and who you befriend — various groups will either want you dead , want to be your best bud or attempt to pay tribute to your character .
We 'll have extended impressions of Fallout : New Vegas early next week , from the outskirts at Primm to details on what awaits you on The Strip , so keep an eye peeled for further details .
If you have any specific questions you want answered , let us know .
In India , even the gods are doing without .
Food inflation that has been stuck in the double digits for a year has had a deep impact on school lunches , family meals and holy offerings .
Anger with high prices erupted into protests this week that disrupted flights , trains and traffic .
While policymakers debate how to feed people without driving the country deeper in debt , Indians grapple with the sad arithmetic of how to do more with less .
Fruit is becoming a luxury .
People have cut back on protein .
Vegetable sellers complain profits are down because people are buying less .
Take M. Sakkthivel , the cook at a temple in Machimal Nagar , a fishing village not far from south Mumbai 's financial center .
Each day Sakkthivel prepares a pot of sweet ground rice as an offering to Tirupati Balaji - a south Indian god .
He used to use 7.7 pounds of sugar to prepare the prasadam , or offering , but with spiraling prices , he 's cut back to three .
The residents of Machimal Nagar say rice , potatoes and onions cost about twice what they did two years ago .
Officially , food inflation neared 22 percent in December , a 17 - year high .
By March it had eased to 16.7 percent , with the cost of wheat 14 percent higher than a year ago and pulses like the lentils known as dal - a crucial source of protein in a nation full of vegetarians - up 31 percent .
It 's too early to say whether sustained high food prices will aggravate malnutrition , but advocates worry escalating costs are eroding the diets of millions in a country where one in two children was malnourished before the price spike .
" There are large numbers of people who even in good times do n't have sufficient food intake , " said Harsh Mander , who was appointed by the Supreme Court to monitor hunger in India .
He estimates that 80 million to 200 million Indians go to sleep hungry each night .
Mander is campaigning for a right to food law being debated within the ruling Congress Party .
One version would give poor households the right to 55 pounds of grains like rice and wheat each month at 3 cents per pound , which has sparked heated debate over who qualifies as poor and how much a sweeping food subsidy would add to India 's swollen fiscal deficit .
Existing food subsidies have cushioned the poorest of the poor , but they are n't pegged to inflation and , plagued by corruption , they do n't always work .
The government has been quick to blame poor rainfall .
Last year 's monsoon was the weakest since 1972 , and on Thursday , Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said food prices would likely soften because of good rainfall this year .
But food prices began to rise months before the rains failed .
Food grain inflation has been more than 10 percent since December 2008 and fruit and vegetable prices spiked as early as October 2008 .
India 's deeper problem is a widening gap between supply and demand .
Even as the population grows and increasing wealth fattens many appetites , farm productivity has stagnated .
India 's food supply chain suffers from extensive waste and profiteering middlemen whose commissions can account for up to half the final cost of food .
Eurasia Group analyst Seema Desai says the government could have done more to keep prices in check .
This is madness .
Prior to the election campaign , it seemed certain that the Conservatives were going to scrape a majority and form the next government , even though their leader had emerged as an opportunistic populist , whose greatest pre-recession indignation was that too many people paid too much tax on their unearned inheritance income .
It was not even hard to see why this had happened .
It is widely acknowledged that oppositions do n't win elections – governments lose them .
Labour had presided over a fantasy boom that had created an unsustainable and geographically limited economy .
Its catastrophically deluded belief was that it had banished boom and bust .
What 's more , even during that boom – when I 'm sure a British government had more money to spend than ever before – Labour had not even managed to forge a more balanced and socially cohesive society .
In fact , unbelievably , it had done the opposite , and made the relatively poor relatively poorer .
As for looking after those most in need , it had not even housed them .
Instead , even less council accommodation had been built than under Thatcher , and some of the estates on which the poorest lived had become even more hopeless , state - dependent places than they were under the last Conservative government – starved of social capital , denied local economic activity , and reliant on charitable efforts to support children attempting to escape from monumentally abusive homes .
Even before the recession , Labour had been losing ground to another progressive force , the Liberal Democrats , not least because of their further obscene failures – on civil liberties , foreign policy , criminal justice , parliamentary and electoral reform , pensions , education , mental health provision and social care .
Unlike the Conservatives , the Lib Dems had seen fit to warn of the instability of the British credit boom , well before the 2005 general election .
Even in that last election , when people were understandably reluctant to accept that the boom would end – and badly – this alternative progressive force polled almost a quarter of the popular vote .
But that only got them a 10th of the seats in parliament , and the political and media establishment continued to discount the Lib Dems , conceding only , as the invasion of Iraq became a disorganised bloodbath , that the party of the " protest voter " might have had a few wise words to say on that matter , and that matter alone .
The Lib Dems were taken seriously neither by the two main parties nor by the media , even though , by weird happenstance , the party had netted itself a decent Treasury spokesman .
Then , thanks to the first television debate , a horrible secret was revealed to the public .
Nick Clegg was a perfectly respectable party leader , eminently capable of giving the big boys a run for their money .
Suddenly , the Conservatives could no longer count on a majority .
And what 's more – hallelujah !
– the electorate , especially the young , were finally pricking up their ears , and deciding it was perhaps worth registering to vote after all .
Except that the message from the media was the Lib Dems could not win .
This was understandable , coming from the larger rightwing media , which garnished its " Vote Clegg , get Brown " message with talk of Nazi slurs and private bank accounts .
But the progressive and " impartial " mainstream media fluffed its message , too .
There was virtually no analysis of how a Lib Dem win might happen , or what it could mean .
Instead , there was merely an obsession with what the Lib Dems might do if they " held the balance of power " , and a cynical hope from die - hard Labour supporters in the media that while the Lib Dems might be useful in getting the Tories out of some seats , they should n't take Labour seats , and certainly should n't " divide the progressive vote " – thus risking letting the Conservatives in ( even though the Tories had been getting in anyway , before the Lib Dems had their surge ) .
For all the talk of " game changing " , the obvious fact was also never aired that , just this once , it was pointless to vote for any of the genuinely niche parties .
Mass strategic abandonment of the " others " , in favour of the Lib Dems , would alone have brought them up a few notches in the polls .
This , in turn , would have fostered a perception that a Lib Dem vote was a positive one , and would definitely have made them the first or second party , in seats .
It would n't even have mattered which way round this result ended up .
If the Lib Dems won outright , proportional representation would be assured , and those " others " would from there on in have votes that actually counted .
If the Lib Dems came second , depriving the Conservatives of an absolute majority , then the likely consequence would be a Lib Dem - led coalition with Labour , again with proportional representation the prize for us all – especially " the others " , who should have the right to democratic representation , however " dangerous " the mainstream deems them to be .
Now – and it would be hilarious if it was not so sad – Clegg is pilloried even for imagining that he could lead the country .
A perfectly reasonable hypothetical observation , in answer to a question put to him again and again – that it would be crazy for Gordon Brown to remain prime minister if he polled fewer votes than either of the other main parties – is parleyed into personal arrogance about who should be choosing what for other political parties and the country .
And a clear indication that Clegg would not enter into a coalition with a party that would not deliver PR is somehow interpreted as possible coalition with the one party that remains unshakeably committed to first past the post .
What a total mess .
What a terrible missed opportunity .
What a disgrace .
Can the Lib Dems get their message across in this final week , with vastly smaller resources than the other two parties , and faced with a media that persists in asking " old politics " questions ?
Well , I guess there 's still hope .
But not much .
Instead , the party that is poised to make the largest , fastest cuts , and has been least honest about the cuts it intends to make , is likely to get in – either with a mandate to make these unspecified cuts , or as the minority government least able to work positively with the other two in order to tackle the deficit .
And the party that came closest to telling the truth , and made its own cuts most imaginatively and creatively , will have hardly any more seats than it did a month ago .
Doh !
Miss Druker told participants in the debate : " She was so thin , we had to put on about half a stone . "
Gerard Chevalier , a psychotherapist and former fashion photographer who also took part in the debate , said that Miss Druker went on to tell him the image had been enhanced to make the model appear two to three stone heavier than her actual weight .
He said : " She told me the girl was so thin , they had to put 15 to 20 kilograms on her . "
After filing and subsequently dismissing a lawsuit against allegedbeta hackers , Blizzard told Gamasutra on Friday that it is n't afraid to take legal action against purported violators .
"
It 's important to note that we aggressively protect our copyrights and the security of Battle.net , " Blizzard said in a statement .
" In addition to providing players with a high - quality online experience for Blizzard Entertainment games , the service is one of the most effective measures we have for preventing piracy of our software over the internet .
" Earlier this month , Blizzard filed suit against six allegedbeta hackers , accusing the group , named " StarCrack , " of working on a way to playmultiplayer games on " rogue " servers .
Blizzard dismissed the suit a week later .
" Blizzard Entertainment did file a lawsuit against a team of people developing software designed to emulate our Battle .
net gaming service and facilitate piracy of our games , " read Blizzard 's statement .
" We do n't discuss the details of litigation - related matters , but we can confirm that the matter has been resolved in a way that has allowed us to dismiss the lawsuit .
"
The statement added , " Circumventing the anti-piracy measures we have in place with Battle . net is a violation of the Beta Test Agreement for , in addition to our End User License Agreements and Battle.net Terms of Use .
"
It 's not the first time that Blizzard has sued someone for using private servers to run Blizzard 's games .
Most recently , in October 2009 , Blizzard sued one Alyson Reeves and five unnamed defendants for runningon an unauthorized private server .
Blizzard said of the most recent suit , " Battle.net - emulation software like the project we sought legal protection against has previously been ruled unlawful by the courts , and we will not hesitate to take legal action against any other such project that violates our rights , promotes piracy , and jeopardizes our goodwill with legitimate players . "
" We 've put a lot of work into developing Battle .
net into the premier online gaming destination for Blizzard Entertainment gamers , " the company said , " and we have a responsibility to protect our rights and maintain the quality and integrity of Battle .
net for our players . "

110 Billion Euro Package EU Agrees to Prop Up Greece
European promises of solidarity with Greece were not enough .

Whether it will be enough remains open .
Savage Love Bag Handlers
I 'm a mostly gay male with a boyfriend who is also mostly gay .
We are into BDSM — we are both tops and sometimes play with other sub men .
I say we are " mostly " gay because we do like to fuck / top submissive women once in a while .
We have n't done this a lot , and never together because we do n't have the same taste in women — until recently .
One of our new neighbors , a straight female , is very shy , but she 's opened up to us about her interest in BDSM .
We took her to a play party , and she was okay watching others play , but any time anyone expressed an interest in her , she clammed up and withdrew .
She stayed at our side the entire time .
We are interested in propositioning her .
Our dilemma is in how to approach someone so gun-shy .
We want to seduce her into the experience and not make her uncomfortable , but we can't agree as to how to go about it .
Another issue is that we think the reason she has been so open with us is because she assumes we are both 100 percent gay .
Two Guys And A Girl Toy
She meets two guys who live together , have presumably noisy BDSM sex with each other and other men , and identify themselves as gay .
I 'm sure you can appreciate why , under the circumstances , your neighbor might assume you two were gay , right ?
And that assumption convinced her it was safe to open up to you guys about her sexual interests — interests that are clearly scaring the shit out of her for the moment — because she further assumed , entirely reasonably , that you guys did n't wanna stick your dicks in her .
The sooner you come clean , the likelier you are to get into her pants , mouth , ass , twat , etc .
Do not attempt to be seductive .
Putting the moves on her now could transform a minor and perhaps unwitting violation of her trust into a relationship - ending violation .
Instead , just be , um , straight with her : " We should 've said something sooner , [ her name here ] , but we 're both actually bi , and we thought you should know that .
And we also wanted you to know that we 're both attracted to you and , hey , if you want to explore any of this stuff that you 're curious about with us , we'd be up for that .
If not , we 're happy to keep being your kinky , gay - identified , completely platonic buddies . "
I am a single , thirtysomething female who has been having a long - term affair with a married man .
We have one rule :
We tell one another if and when we fool around with other people .
About a year ago , I discovered another affair he was involved in while he was out of the country , which he failed to disclose to me .
I discovered it because he left his e-mail unattended .
He was not apologetic , and I ended up being the one who begged for forgiveness for invading his privacy .
He did , however , promise to end his relationship with the woman overseas .
I recently discovered that he has struck up a fresh correspondence with this same woman .
I gained this knowledge by invading his privacy again — this time by outright hacking his e-mail — but he also betrayed me , and he needs to be held accountable .
You are probably wondering why I am not just cutting this guy out of my life .
We have amazing sex and enjoy the same kinks .
It is difficult to find someone trustworthy to engage in these activities with .
But how can I trust anything he says anymore ?
I really want to call him on this .
He broke our rules .
Do you think I am out of line in confronting him ?
Mistress Is Pissed
According to the " Mistress , whining about being cheated on " listing in the Association of American Advice Columnists ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Staggeringly Self - Serving Bullshit , I 'm supposed to slap the shit out of you , MIP .
The DSM instructs me to respond to letters like yours with something like this : " Your lover is cheating on his wife with you , you dumb piece of shit , and you 're shocked to learn that he 's cheating on you , too ? "
That strikes me as a little harsh .
So I 'll go with this instead :
You can't expect a guy to take your rules more seriously than he takes his vows .
As for confronting him :
The last time you confronted him about another other - woman , MIP , you wound up begging for his forgiveness .
So let 's skip the confrontation and accept reality : Unless you 're willing to walk away from the amazing sex , unless you 're willing to dump the motherfucker , he 's going to go on cheating on you and lying to you about it , rules or no rules .
He wo n't disclose when he 's messing around with other other - women , MIP , because it 's not just the sex that turns him on .
Sneaking around , getting away with it , deceiving you and his wife and his other other - women — all of that gives him a feeling of power and control , and those feelings are as , or more , important to him than the orgasms .
Accept it or get out .
I need support under my scrotum in order to ejaculate .
I am 52 years old , and this condition has gotten worse as I have gotten older .
When I am having intercourse , I need a position that supports or raises my scrotum , and when I masturbate , I need to put something under it .
Is this okay ?
Is there a solution to make coming during intercourse easier ?
This Old Scrote
Before I touch on your sack , TOS , I 'd like to briefly — very briefly — touch on George Rekers's .
Rekers is a towering figure in the religious right .
He 's the cofounder of the Family Research Council ; a member of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality , a group that claims it can cure homosexuality ; and the go - to guy for " expert " testimony about how gay people threaten and endanger children .
And last week , Rekers got busted coming back from a 10 - day European vacation with a 20 - year - old male escort he found on Rentboy.com .
Rekers told two reporters from the Miami New Times that he " ca n't lift luggage , " so what other choice did he have but to hire a 20 - year - old with an eight - inch cock ?
To mark the downfall of yet another crazy and hypocritical closet case , I propose that " whatever floats your boat " be immediately and permanently retired in favor of " whatever lifts your luggage . "
This will be George " Rentboy " Rekers 's legacy , his lexi-colonic gift to the English language .
Help spread the meme .
Back to you , TOS : First , talk about this with a doc — get your sack examined and your prostate checked .
If there 's nothing medically wrong , rest assured there 's nothing wrong .
Some guys have large , loose sacks and sensitive balls , and the slap , slap , slap of intercourse or masturbation can be uncomfortable , and lifting your luggage spares you the slap , slap , slap .
Alternately , TOS , let 's not forget that your dick , balls , sack , and taint compose one big erogenous zone .
Lifting your luggage may provide you with a little bit of extra ball / sack / taint stimulation , added stimulation that helps put you over the top , and naturally you rely on that zap more at 52 than you did at 32 .
So instead of viewing your need for a ball lift as a problem that needs solving , why not view ball support as the solution to a problem .
Or to put it another way ...
Whatever lifts your luggage , TOS , whatever lifts your luggage .

One of the world 's leading climate scientists has launched a libel lawsuit against a Canadian newspaper for publishing articles that he says " poison " the debate on global warming .
In a case with potentially huge consequences for online publishers , lawyers acting for Andrew Weaver , a climate modeller at the University of Victoria , Canada , have demanded the National Post removes the articles not only from its own websites , but also from the numerous blogs and sites where they were reposted .
Weaver says the articles , published at the height of several recent controversies over the reliability of climate science in recent months , contain " grossly irresponsible falsehoods " .
He said he filed the suit after the newspaper refused to retract the articles .
Weaver said : " If I sit back and do nothing to clear my name , these libels will stay on the internet forever .
They 'll poison the factual record , misleading people who are looking for reliable scientific information about global warming . "
The four articles , published from December to February , claimed that Weaver cherrypicked data to support his climate research , and that he tried to blame the " evil fossil fuel " industry for break - ins at his office in 2008 to divert attention from reported mistakes in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , on which he was lead author .
The lawsuit also highlights several claims in the articles that attempt to question or undermine the scientific consensus on climate change , including that annual global mean temperatures have stopped increasing in the last decade and that climate models are " falling apart " .
Such statements , the lawsuit says , would lead readers to conclude that Weaver " is so strongly motivated by a corrupt interest in receiving government funding that he willfully conceals scientific climate data which refutes global warming in order to keep alarming the public so that it welcomes ... funding for climate scientists such as himself . "
Weaver said : " I asked the National Post to do the right thing , to retract a number of recent articles that attributed to me statements I never made , accused me of things I never did , and attacked me for views I never held .
To my absolute astonishment , the newspaper refused . "
A spokesman for the National Post said : " Beyond saying that we intend to defend the article , we do not comment on such suits . "
Weaver is suing for libel three writers at the newspaper , as well as the newspaper as a whole and several , as - yet unknown , posters on the paper 's online comment section .
Such comments , typical on articles about global warming , included claims that Weaver was " as big a hypocrite as he is a fraudster " and a rat leaving a sinking " ship of lies , red- herrings and hysteria " .
One poster suggested he should be thrown under a bus .
McConchie Law Corporation , acting for Weaver , said that the National Post articles had " gone viral on the internet " and were reproduced on dozens of other websites , including prominent climate - sceptic sites Climate Audit and Watts Up With That .
The lawsuit says the newspaper " expressly authorised republication " of the articles by including online links that invited readers to email the story to others , and share it through tools such as Facebook .
McConchie Law said it was seeking an " unprecedented " court order that would require the newspaper to help Weaver remove the articles from across the internet .
Media law experts said that such demands were becoming increasingly common in complaints to publishers , but this could be the first time they were tested in court .
Weaver 's libel action follows an official complaint made last month by a leading UK scientist to the Press Complaints Commission over a story published in the Sunday Times .
Simon Lewis , an expert on tropical forests at the University of Leeds , claimed the story published in January was misleading because it gave the impression that the IPCC made a false claim in its 2007 report that reduced rainfall could wipe out up to 40 % of the Amazon rainforest .
He said he told the newspaper that the IPCC 's statement was " poorly written and bizarrely referenced , but basically correct " .

Not a surprise , but yet to be confirmed by other less ..
Fox -y sources :
Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist has decided he will run as an independent in the race to fill the Florida U.S. Senate seat , Crist allies tell Fox News .
The official announcement is scheduled for Thursday at 5 pm ET in St. Petersburg , Florida .
The Senate campaign has been rough and tumble for Crist , he was once the front - runner -- but in recent months began trailing his GOP opponent , Florida State Speaker Marco Rubio .
Crist has said that under no circumstance would he drop out of the race , saying he will do what is best for the voters of Florida .
The governor says Republicans in Washington want him to stay in the Republican party but voters in Florida have told him they want him to run as an independent .
His campaign and the governor 's office have not officially confirmed anything , however this move by Crist has made internal communications difficult because some staff are unlikely to continue to work with Crist as an independent candidate .
The governor is expected to use much of Thursday for courtesy calls to supporters , allies and some Republican officials nationwide .
Close advisers expect him to say tomorrow that he looks forward to caucusing with Republicans but that is not a certainty , there are still some issues being worked out and discussed .
Rubio has clinched endorsements from big name Republicans including former Vice President Dick Cheney , New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former 2008 presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney .

Two parents embraced outside a Douglas County courtroom Thursday afternoon : one , a mother whose son was just sentenced to jail .
The other , a father who will never see his daughter again .
Their conversation was private , but the moment even caused court employees to get choked up .
Minutes earlier , a Douglas County District Court judge had sentenced 22 - year - old Joel Hernandez to six months in jail for drinking and driving and killing a 20 - year - old Lawrence woman in October .
The six - month sentence is the maximum allowed by law for a first - time misdemeanor DWI offense .
Hernandez made a tearful apology to the family of Rachel Leek during the sentencing hearing Thursday .
“ I ’m really sorry for what happened to Miss Leek , ” Hernandez said .
“ I go through what happened every day .
It should have never happened , but I ca n’t change that . ”
Hernandez struck and killed Leek as she was riding her bicycle near 10th and Tennessee streets on Oct. 16 .
He then left the scene .
Hernandez , a former Haskell Indian Nations University student and a Lawrence High graduate , pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident involving a death , after reaching a deal with prosecutors in April .
Hernandez will be on probation for one year after his release from jail .
Judge Michael Malone also ordered Hernandez to complete 200 hours of community service and to pay a $ 500 fine .
Malone said he hoped the jail time would serve as a deterrent to Hernandez and anyone else considering getting behind the wheel after drinking .
“ You ’re going to live with her death for the rest of your life , ” Malone told Hernandez .
Leek ’s father , sister and other relatives were in the courtroom , but did not address the judge .
Assistant District Attorney James McCabria said Leek ’s father summed up the family ’s feelings in a one - sentence statement he wrote on a form sent out by the court .
“ We cannot express the loss of our daughter in words , ” James Leek wrote .
Hernandez ’s attorney , Al Lopes , said his client felt awful about leaving the scene .
It ’s unknown whether the outcome would have been different had Leek received medical help sooner .
“ It ’s eating at him , ” Lopes said .
“ He ’s more remorseful that he left the scene of an accident and let her die on the streets of Lawrence , Kansas . ”
Lopes said from this point forward , Hernandez will be living a life for two people .
“ He ’s living his life , and a life for Rachel , ” Lopes said .
“ He has an obligation to sit down and talk about how a bad thing can happen to a good person . ”
Apple , Dell and HP are investigating their overseas partner Foxconn , a Chinese component maker that has seen several employee suicides in the past year .
Labor activists have accused Foxconn of instituting sweatshop - like work conditions for its employees , compelling nine workers to kill themselves to escape their harsh routines .
Apple , Dell and HP have announced that they are in contact with Foxconn to examine the work conditions .
“ We ’re in direct contact with Foxconn senior management and we believe they are taking this matter very seriously , ” said Steve Dowling , an Apple spokesman , in a statement to Bloomberg .
“ A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made . ”
Foxconn 's harsh work conditions have been especially high - profile because it is known for producing components for the phenomenally popular iPhone , among products for companies other than Apple .
However , labor issues have been prevalent across Asian suppliers for years .
Many Asian - supply workers and labor - rights activists have cited sweatshop - like conditions such as hourly wages below a dollar , violations of work hours and firings without notice .
The most sensational story about Foxconn to date involved an employee committing suicide over the loss of a prototype fourth - generation iPhone after allegedly being bullied by the company 's security officers .
The New York Times launched an independent investigation , in which a reporter 's translator faced physical threats from a Foxconn security officer while questioning the victim 's family .
The ninth Foxconn death occurred Tuesday with a 19 - year - old 's apparent suicide — just one week after the company 's eighth employee suicide .
To offer a first - hand account of Foxconn , reporter Liu Zhiyi of the Chinese paper Southern Weekend went undercover as an employee at the factory .
She reported that workers were stuck in grueling , repetitive jobs and working long hours for minimal pay .
In response to the scrutiny surrounding Foxconn , billionaire Terry Gou , founder of Hon Hai ( aka Foxconn Technology Group ) , this week opened a tour of the factory to journalists .
" We expect our suppliers to employ the same high standards we do in our own facilities , " a Dell spokesman said in a statement .
" We enforce these standards through a variety of tools , including the Electronics Industry code of conduct , business reviews with suppliers , self - assessments and audits . "
HP has also said it is investigating " the Foxconn practices that may be associated with these tragic events . "

Joe Pavelski Center - SJS GOALS : 9 | ASST : 5 | PTS : 14
SOG : 41 | +/-: 7
-- Joe Pavelski put himself in some elite company on Sunday night .
With two more goals in Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals , the San Jose Sharks center became the first player to enjoy three consecutive multi-goal games since former Pittsburgh Penguins captain Mario Lemieux accomplished the feat in 1992 .
Pavelski , who had 25 goals during the regular season , has scored nine times in his team 's first eight games this postseason .
It 's arguably the biggest reason why the Sharks are headed to Detroit with a 2 - 0 series lead following their second straight 4 - 3 win against the Red Wings at HP Pavilion .
" Obviously , he 's in the zone right now , " San Jose coach Todd McLellan said .
" Anything he touches seems to go in the net .
( He had ) 11 shots on goal .
He feels very comfortable .
But he 's earned that right .
He works very hard every shift .
Pav is a catalyst right now .
" Pavelski , a seventh - round draft choice in 2003 , erased a 1 - 0 deficit when he scored on the power play 9:01 into the first period .
Playing the point on the man advantage , the Wisconsin native ripped a slap shot from the point past Wings goalie Jimmy Howard .
The roar from the capacity crowd of 17,562 was deafening as Pavelski was announced as the goal scorer , as he continues to gain rock - star status in the Bay Area .
" This is what you think about when you 're lying in bed a lot of times and you can't sleep , " Pavelski said .
" You want to score points and you do n't know if they 're going to keep coming like that .
You can't really worry about that .
When somebody tells you that you should n't be doing it , that 's when you 're going to stop .
It 's just shift by shift right now .
Hopefully we can keep scoring .
" Pavelski continued his incredible output just 91 seconds later , when he sent a slick pass from along the left wall to the goal mouth , where Ryane Clowe collected the puck and backhanded it past Howard to give San Jose a 2 - 1 lead .
" I think he was hungry coming into these playoffs , " said Clowe , who along with Pavelski and Devin Setoguchi forms the Sharks ' second line .
" He 's stepped up , for sure .
" With his team desperately needing a goal in the third period , Pavelski stepped up again .
Trailing by one , the Sharks notched the equalizer when Pavelski crashed the net and poked a loose puck in the crease past Howard to make it 3 - 3 .
It was his second power - play goal of the night .
" I saw it was on the goal line , " Pavelski said .
" You 're just going there and you 're watching it bounce .
I think I got a little piece of it .
You 've got to score on special teams when you get the chances , especially now .
It definitely got the crowd going again .
" Pavelski's output this postseason certainly defies logic .
Sure , he 's a talented player with a bright career ahead of him .
But the first since Lemieux in ' 92 to enjoy three straight multi- goal games ?
The first since former Colorado Avalanche captain Joe Sakic in ' 96 to notch three points in three straight contests ?
( By the way , both of those players went on to win the Stanley Cup in those respective years . )
How do you explain what is going on ?
" Who knows what it is ? " Pavelski said .
" Confidence always helps .
It 's good to see pucks going in the net .
It 's good to work hard and get rewarded .
It feels good to chip in .
" It probably feels better to make everyone around you better .
That 's what Pavelski is doing this postseason .
" He 's making things happen for himself and his line , " Sharks forward Manny Malhotra said .
" When you can get him in those key spots , you want him to have the puck .
" With two wins in the bag already , it 's hard to imagine the Sharks not advancing to the Western Conference Finals if they continue to receive this type of production from their U.S. Olympian .
But Pavelski refuses to look past Tuesday night , when Game 3 of this series will take place at Joe Louis Arena .
" You 've got to win four … it 's still a long ways to go , " No. 8 said .
" We realize we 're a long ways away .
It 's a hard climb and there 's some great opponents out there , especially the one on the other side right now .
You can't take a break .
You know they 're not going to .
" Spoken like a true leader .
This is a guest post by an abortion doctor .
Her name has been removed to protect her and her family .
I ’d like to share some of my thoughts with you regarding abortion .
I ’m a doctor who does both 1st and 2nd trimester abortions .
Although most of my practice is general OB / GYN , I ’m something of an abortion “ specialist ” because most folks in my profession do n’t want to be involved in abortions .
I work for a large group where abortions are sent to those of us who will do them , so I perform literally hundreds of abortions a year .
First of all , I and most of my abortionist colleagues are women .
Most of us are Jews , atheists , and other non-Christians .
Almost all of us are mothers .
I continued to perform abortions late into my own pregnancies , and you could literally see the appreciation in the eyes of my patients , knowing that I accepted and supported their reproductive choice .
I rarely tell anyone but my closest friends and family that I do abortions because I do n’t want to risk myself or my family .
Those crazies out there scare me .
We all know that anti-abortionists are n’t really “ pro-life , ” they are “ pro-forced birth . ”
They make huge assumptions about who the women are who actually have abortions .
They think that all the women who have abortions are just young flaky women who have no concern for the life of the embryo / fetus they are aborting .
They could n’t be more wrong .
Most of the women seeking early abortion are either very young or in the late part of their reproductive life .
The youngsters are often coerced into unwanted pregnancies by their partners , or they did n’t think or know that they could get pregnant .
Some of the older women think they could n’t get pregnant because they were “ too old .
” The decision to have an abortion is an agonizing decision , that few women choose lightly .
They will be criticized for whatever decision they make .
What kind of terrible mother could kill her own child ?
What kind of terrible mother could give her child away to strangers ?
What kind of terrible mother would keep a child she ca n’t afford to care for ?
Did you know that half of the abortions done in this country are done because of birth control failure ?
The “ pro-coerced birthers ” think that these are immoral women who should be punished for their ( sex ) sins with an innocent child .
Then they complain about “ welfare mothers ” who need money to support their children .
Those “ precious babies ” become children who they do n’t want to feed .
Are n’t Christians supposed to provide charity for those who need it ?
Worse then that , they do n’t want to use federal funds to provide effective contraception or abortions for poor women .
They just want to keep punishing women .
Of course , if it ’s one of their own , she just “ made a mistake , she ’s really a good girl . ”
Abortions happen in the fundie community too , don’tcha know .
Did you know that 1/3 of women who have abortions had a partner who sabotaged their birth control method ?
This is true domestic violence .
Women who have abortions come from all walks of life .
This is not a phenomenon of only the inner city .
Many are educated , and most of them are just plain middle class people .
The 1st trimester and early 2nd trimester abortions are most frequently done as elective abortions for unwanted pregnancies .
I do n’t like to do elective terminations after 22 weeks because of the viability issue .
Late 2nd trimester pregnancies are very different .
Virtually all of the late 2nd trimester abortions I do are for fetal anomalies , fetal deaths , and for maternal health reasons .
These poor souls really wanted their babies .
They are in deep mourning because of the loss of their children .
They come in deep grief , many times feeling guilty because they are “ killing ” their loved and wanted children .
They worry if the baby will feel the abortion , and they do n’t want their child to suffer .
Many folks wonder what it ’s like to perform abortions .
First trimester abortions ( dilation and curettage , D&C ) are very unremarkable .
Our patients are awake but sedated .
The procedure is performed with a suction curette ( hard plastic tube ) , and in the hands of an experienced abortionist , suctioning out the pregnancy lasts less than a minute .
The “ products of conception ” come out as just a mass of undefined tissue about the size of a golf ball .
No thunder and lightning .
Most patients have worked themselves up to have it be a long , grueling process , but are shocked at how short the procedure is .
2nd trimester abortions are very different .
The later procedure is much more difficult and riskier for the mom , hence the limited number of us who actually do them .
They are also unpleasant , because the procedure ( dilation and evacuation , D&E ) involves pulling out the baby in pieces .
That all being said , the procedure ( in the hands of an expert ) is much safer than inducing the delivery , and has a much lower complication rate that the induction does .
Many of these poor parents do n’t want to be awake for the birth of the child they are going to lose , and just prefer to lose the child under general anesthesia .
I ’ve never done the famous “ D&X ” ( dilation and extraction , “ partial birth abortion ” ) procedure .
This was the one that was outlawed because opponents thought it was too horrible of a procedure .
The concept was to try to deliver the baby intact , but the brain matter was suctioned out to allow the delivery of the head through the cervix .
This procedure was designed so that the parents of the child could hold an intact baby , back of the head covered up , after a surgical abortion .
Not because we horrible abortionists love to torture babies and then kill them .
I would be the happiest person in the world to never do another abortion again .
So why do I do them ?
Because pregnant women with unwanted pregnancies are willing to risk just about anything , including almost killing themselves , in order to try to end unwanted pregnancies .
I remember reading some statistics comparing abortions in the U.S. and Mexico , before they were legal there .
About the same number of abortions were done in each country , just over 1 million abortions a year .
In the U.S. about 10 women died as a result of legal abortion .
In Mexico , about 10,000 women per year died as a result of illegal abortions .
10,000 women who were mothers , sisters , daughters , wives .
Not pre-viable fetuses .
There ’s excellent evidence that in countries where women control their reproduction , the families are more prosperous .
Funny that , women knowing when it ’s a good or a bad time to add a child to their family .
You would never pick out an abortionist in the crowd .
We would probably be the last people you would figure .
We are the kindest , most compassionate people you would wish to meet .
We are , however , very passionate about protecting the lives and reproductive rights of our patients .
Last time I checked , abortion was legal in this country .
But I can tell you that the people who oppose abortion have no feelings of any kind for the poor women who have to make the terrible decision to end a pregnancy for whatever reason .
They want to end abortion because they love those theoretical innocent children .
Oh , yeah , forgot that we are all born sinners .
Maybe they are n’t such great babies after all .

CUPERTINO , Calif . --
Leaders from the Army 's technology command visited Apple , Inc. here to discuss the use of Apple products in Army business and battlefield operations .
Maj. Gen. Nick Justice , Research , Development and Engineering Command commanding general and key members of his staff traveled to Apple headquarters March 5 .
Apple officials gave the Army group tours of its laboratories and other facilities and talked about some examples of where the military is already using Apple technology .
The Army 's research and development command is evaluating commercial hand - held solutions such as iPad , iPhone , iPod , iMac , and MacBook platforms .
" The Army is moving away from big - green - box solutions and toward those that will adapt along with our warfighters on the battlefield , " Justice said .
Justice said the Army recognized the billions of dollars invested by industry to develop its devices .
"
We 're continuing to leverage commercial technology for battlefield uses ; we can't ignore that kind of existing knowledge , " he said .
" Our job , as stewards of the taxpayer 's dollar , is to adopt and adapt appropriate commercial technology and offer the best possible solution to the warfighter .
"
The meeting was part of the Army 's efforts to support " Connecting Soldiers to Digital Applications , " an initiative to demonstrate the technical capabilities of hand - held devices and applications to the Army and gathering warfighter .
The working group is tasked with looking at how commercial cellular technology - including devices , applications and networks - could be utilized in a tactical environment .
The RDECOM communication and electronics center advises on applications and new equipment training and support application delivery to pilot programs in its role as the lead for CSDA applications development .
Within RDECOM , the Communications - Electronics Research and Development Center has developed numerous handheld command and control solutions and is supporting the development and transition of two iPhone applications : COIN Collector , a counter - insurgency information collection tool , and MilSpace , a combined planning and social networking environment .
The Army 's official science and technology blog , Army Technology Live , released a public iPhone application last month .
The app puts
Army technology news , updates and media , such as images and video , in one location .
The Army Technology Live iPhone application is available as a free download from the Apple iTunes Store .
" Apple technologies offer unique and proven solutions with intuitive designs that allow users to learn quickly without a training manual , " said Ron Szymanski , CERDEC 's lead computer scientist on the project .
" The Army would like to leverage Apple 's experience when designing military applications .
" Engaging companies such as Apple allows the Army research and development community to leverage commercial business models as well , said Dr. Gerardo J. Melendez , director , CERDEC Command and Control Directorate .
"
As we push to develop more commercial capabilities to meet Army information and knowledge management needs , it 's important that we engage companies such as Apple because we stand to benefit just as much from their lessons learned and best practices , " Melendez said .
" Eliminating unnecessary processes or degrees of trial and error can only help us as we transition applications that can be deployed to numerous tactical levels throughout the Army .
" The meeting ended with plans for future technical discussions between the organizations . < p align= " center " >< a href = " http://www.facebook.com/usarmyrdecom " >< img src= "

Court documents unsealed as part of a lawsuit against drug giant Pfizer reveal how drug companies used deception and fear to manipulate women into taking dangerous hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) drugs .
"
The information coming out in litigation helps us understand how a belief in a ' protective benefit ' of estrogens on the heart was able to spread like wildfire through the medical community , " said Jerome L. Avorn of Harvard Medical School .
Pfizer , which purchased Wyeth in October 2009 , is being sued by more than 13,000 people who claim that they developed cancer and other health problems after taking HRT drugs .
The plaintiffs claim that Wyeth knew of these risks all along , and downplayed them even as it exaggerated the drugs ' benefits .
The saga began with the 1966 book , in which a male gynecologist argued that menopause should be viewed as a degenerative disease and not a natural life phase .
Rather than becoming " flabby , " " dull - minded " and " desexed " through " the horror of this living decay , " wrote Robert A. Wilson , women should be treated with hormones .
HRT drugs became popular until the FDA concluded in 1975 that they might cause cancer of the uterus .
They were reintroduced in the mid-1990s , billed as newer and safer .
Court documents show that at this point , Wyeth began a campaign to promote the drugs for effects that had never been proven , such as the prevention of heart disease and Alzheimer's .
The company used tactics such as ghostwriting journal articles , paying doctors to function as spokespeople , and sponsoring company - written " continuing education " for doctors .
" My doctor said if you do n't replace estrogen that you lose at menopause , your risk for certain age - related diseases could increase , " said model Lauren Hutton in one Wyeth commercial .
A narrator then told viewers that researchers were investigating the connection between menopause and memory loss , sight loss and cardiovascular disease .
HRT drugs were only ever approved for treating symptoms of menopause , such as hot flashes and mood swings .
Studies eventually linked them to an increased risk of breast cancer , heart disease and dementia .

The International Space Station , set to be all but abandoned by NASA under the Vision for Space Exploration , has found new life , and perhaps new purpose , under NASA ’s new plans .
( credit : NASA )
The next logical step becomes logical The International Space Station ’s future and the ghost of the space station Mir
For a generation , NASA struggled to get approval to build an Earth - orbiting space station as the “ next logical step ” in human exploration of outer space .
The 1969 Space Task Force report contained plans for two space stations , one orbiting the Earth and one in lunar orbit .
These space stations were envisioned as building blocks for a long - term human space exploration program that would eventually end up at Mars before leaving for the outer planets .
Unfortunately , NASA ’s appetite for massive future funding clearly stretched beyond the bounds of acceptable domestic politics ; President Richard Nixon effectively rejected such grandiose schemes with the consolation prize for NASA becoming the space shuttle .
Building the post - Apollo human spaceflight program Keeping the space shuttle as a tool was critical for NASA ’s aspirations since its primary purpose was to support the space station when that was finally built .
In fact , the shuttle payload bay was considered critical and had to be of a certain size so it could carry station modules to orbit during construction while also accommodating US Air Force payloads .
The shuttle became operational in the early 1980s but that program became locked into a merry - go - round where repeated trips to orbit proved productive but the physical limitations inherent in shuttle - only missions meant long - duration space research was impossible .
Placing objects in orbit and then returning to retrieve them proved less useful than originally envisioned .
The Long Duration Exposure Facility , for example , was deployed in 1984 and retrieved in 1990 .
However , NASA made lemonade out of the shuttle by extending its mission time in orbit and devising payloads that would require the shuttle ’s heavy - lift capability .
The effects upon the space science program proved debilitating , though , as all payloads had to be rated safe enough to travel with humans , an added burden in terms of project cost and complexity .
The effect was to reduce the number of space science missions and increase their complexity .
For a generation , NASA struggled to get approval to build an Earth - orbiting space station as the “ next logical step ” in human exploration of outer space .
On a parallel track , the agency aggressively pursued approval of an Earth - orbiting space station , a quest that remained a futile one for over a decade .
For the United States , the embarrassing part was that the Soviets from the 1970s forward pushed aggressively to orbit a series of space stations , culminating in the Mir Space Station , whose core element was launched in 1986 and remained in space until 2001 .
The earlier space station effort , in the form of the US Skylab missions , had effectively ended in 1974 with that space station plunging into the Pacific Ocean in 1979 , the last vestige of the Apollo program and its dreams of expanded space exploration .
Space station approval and the future
In January 1984 , after much discussion and strife within the Reagan Administration , the President announced his support for an Earth - orbiting space station in his State of the Union address .
This approval had come after multiple meetings and against the unified opposition of the president ’s staff , whose expressed concerns about cost and schedule .
After the shuttle development process in the 1970s , there was considerable skepticism in policy circles outside NASA regarding the agency ’s ability to even honestly estimate likely costs and to keep to the original developmental schedule .
NASA ’s mantra was that the space station was the “ next logical step ” in the human space exploration progression leading inevitably to arrival on other celestial bodies beyond the Moon .
Despite its political weakness , the space station was ultimately approved by Congress even with active animosity in some congressional circles .
In some cases , these arguments were vestiges of the earlier 1960s debates over whether the Apollo program was worth the cost given the social and economic problems existing on Earth , echoes of which are heard today .
In 1984 , President Reagan ’s personal commitment was sufficient to override opposition in the administration but the program became de facto an orphan politically with no executive branch champion outside NASA itself .
The original concept was for a space station to be operating in orbit by 1992 at a cost of $ 8 billion ; a number that deliberately ignored critical costs such as launching the station components on the space shuttle .
Within the Reagan Administration , the space station competed for scarce attention and support with the Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) ( aka “ Star Wars ” program ) , which was always much closer to the president ’s heart .
NASA now had its space station and was left largely alone in making its way through the political thickets of Washington .
Unfortunately , the result was a program best characterized as bloated and unfocused ; program budget projections continued to rise while the expected completion date slipped farther away .
As a result , the space station entered a series of redesigns , the ultimate outcome of which was to raise total costs and reduce station capabilities .
In that process , the station acquired international partners — the Europeans , Canadians , and Japanese — and a new name , Space Station Freedom .
The Challenger space shuttle accident in January 1986 further stressed the agency and its programs with shuttle return to flight not accomplished until September 1988 .
President George H.W. Bush ’s abortive Space Exploration Initiative , announced in 1989 , came and went without any real impact on the space station program .
As usual , the United States made its choices effectively alone , informing partners rather than negotiating what was to occur or pursue alternative paths involving using the space station .
By 1993 , the space station was in danger of cancellation with projected operating costs for the space station and shuttle programs rising to consume effectively the entire usable NASA budget , wiping out space science .
In a series of dramatic congressional showdowns , the space station in its Space Station Alpha configuration survived termination in the House of Representatives by a one - vote margin .
Its big budget science project competitor , the Superconducting Supercollider , was cancelled in a frenzy of congressional budget cutting .
The political solution became redesigning the station again and incorporating the Russians into the space station program , now called the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The Russians arrived both as a partner and a contractor .
The US bought station hardware from the Russians in order to provide employment for Russian engineers and designers who otherwise it was feared would move to potentially dangerous states with their high quality technical knowledge .
The Missile Technology Control Regime established in 1987 had heightened concerns about the dissemination of missile technology to what are now labeled “ rogue states ” or “ states of concern . ”
The other virtue was that Russian space technologies are world class .
As part of this new start , NASA embarked on a series of astronaut stays on the Mir space station , known as the Shuttle - Mir Program .
This allowed NASA astronauts to acquire long - duration space experience and , through payment of funds , to continue economic support for the financially stressed Russian space program .
However , the ISS continued to confront the same budget overruns and schedule slips as before , so that by 1998 , when first in - orbit construction began , the program continued to confront major cost overruns that NASA appeared unable to fix .
What was different was that some of the delays were the product of international partner problems , especially the Russians , who were struggling financially .
Why did not matter , for the problem remained the same : cost overruns and budget issues .
In March 2001 , the new George W. Bush administration made its mark by scaling back the ISS program further to “ Station Complete ” while cancelling the X - 33 and X - 34 programs .
The former was envisioned as a precursor for a reusable flight vehicle replacing the space shuttle but was deemed too expensive , too erratic in schedule , and somewhat hazardous for human spaceflight .
At this point , the Bush Administration did not have a distinct space program approach rather a determination to reduce the fiscal hemorrhaging characteristic of NASA ’s programs .
The GAO had released several studies demonstrating that NASA ’s programs across the board were poorly managed fiscally for a variety of reasons , many related to the agency ’s desire to push forward without clearly specifying what must be accomplished and consistently underestimating costs in order to sustain the program from outsiders .
( A 2009 study on this can is : “ NASA : Assessments of Large Scale Projects ” . )
In fact , in 1993 , the Congressional Budget Office suggested dismantling NASA for these reasons and , in 2009 , still found NASA budget estimates unrealistic , as discussed in the report “ The Budgetary Implications of NASA ’s Current Plans for Space Exploration ” .
With the loss of Columbia during reentry in 2003 , the Bush Administration began consideration of a fresh approach to the existing space effort that was tied to Earth orbit .
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( CAIB ) final report redesignated the shuttle as an experimental test vehicle , reversing over twenty years of expectations that the space shuttle was an operational vehicle .
This clearly reversed the earlier view that the shuttle was in fact a commercial vehicle , a venture that ended in 1986 with the loss of space shuttle Challenger .
January 14 , 2004 saw the announcement by President Bush of a complete restructuring of the US space program even while NASA awaited its second return to flight in July 2005 , when Discovery reprised its earlier 1988 return to flight after Challenger .
The new program envisioned exploration beyond Earth orbit with the ISS and space shuttle effectively discarded : the shuttle in 2010 , when ISS construction should be finished , and the ISS about five years later , depending on when completion occurred .
The ISS went in the new Vision for Space Exploration from the next logical step to a dead end , one to be discarded as quickly as possible .
The shuttle ’s purpose would be completed when the space station construction was completed by about 2010 .
As usual , the United States made its choices effectively alone , informing partners rather than negotiating what was to occur or pursue alternative paths involving using the space station .
The US position regarding the ISS was particularly galling to the long - term partners , the Europeans and Japanese , whose research lab modules had yet to be launched to the station when the Vision was annoucned .
The US plan would basically end the ISS just as the station went to full crew status ( from three to six people ) , meaning that significant research could be conducted .
The smaller three - person crew spent much of its energies on station maintenance and operations .
The logical partner for the United States was China , which envisions a scaled - up space program , albeit at a more modest pace than the driven US - Soviet space race in the 1960s .
The new US program , Constellation , would proceed back to the Moon , bypassing the ISS , which was to be deorbited about the time when the first flights of the new Ares 1 launch vehicle were to occur .
A larger vehicle , the Ares 5 , would launch a transfer stage and lunar module to dock with the Orion capsule , which was originally projected to carry a crew of up to six members to the ISS and four to the lunar surface .
The ultimate objective — time indefinite — was to travel to Mars and other celestial bodies .
NASA Administrator Mike Griffin proclaimed the Orion was “ Apollo on Steroids , ” signaling abandonment of winged crewed vehicle , at least by NASA .
The international partners were to say the least not charmed by yet another American decision to go its own way .
The reality was once the US set off on its own path , with or without international partners ; the partners were freed to pursue their own interests .
Their interests in the immediate term were getting the maximum mileage possible out of their proportionately large investment in the ISS .
The US attempted to interest the partners in joining Constellation but their response was not negative as much as disinterest at least in the short term given the realities of their budgets .
In fact , the logical partner for the United States was China , which envisions a scaled - up space program , albeit at a more modest pace than the driven US - Soviet space race in the 1960s .
Given the skepticism with which each party viewed the other , US - Chinese active cooperation in space was unlikely in the short term , especially after the Chinese shot down their own satellite in January 2007 in a demonstration of their military space technological capabilities .
US concerns about Chinese space ambitions meant that cooperation became a political non-starter at best .
Despite the rhetoric from NASA leadership , there was concern whether the Constellation program was in fact doable given budget constraints and possible technological issues , especially with the Ares 1 launch vehicle and weight issues with the Orion capsule .
NASA protests that these issues were normal and would be wrung out during the developmental process were not persuasive to a large segment of the space community .
Those questions or warnings play into the next stage in the development of the US human spaceflight program .

This is Black Current III , a naughty - looking VW Beetle that 's officially the fastest electric dragster in Europe .
It recorded an 11.24sec ¼- mile run at Santa Pod recently , beating a Tesla Roadster by more than 1.5secs in the process .
Black Current III is the work of brothers Olly and Sam Young and is a 1960s Beetle powered by two forklift truck motors and 60 12 - volt batteries .
This is good for 1200 lb ft of torque , a 0 - 60 time of around 3.0secs and a terminal velocity at the end of quarter - mile of 114mph .
The project started six years ago when the brothers got hold of an abandoned milk float and mated its motor to an engine - less Beetle .

Note : Everything said here is true about Australia also , but I ’ve never been to Australia , and this is a New Zealand blog .
So I do n’t talk about Australia .
New Zealand has an interesting option available to international travellers under the age of 30 to help them live , work and play in the country for a year or longer .
I ’m talking about the temporary work visa , but temporary work visas are n’t unique to New Zealand .
You can get a temporary work visa to most countries .
The problem is finding a job once you get there .
Job hunting in a country you do n’t know anything about is an intimidating task especially if you ’re doing it while going through the throws of culture shock .
If you ’re dedicated and resourceful you can work in pretty much any country , but most people do n’t have the world traveling experience and grit to navigate all the obstacles to working in a foreign country .
New Zealand offers an easy way to sidestep most of the hassle of finding temporary work : by doing seasonal farm work .
You do n’t need experience or a resume to do most seasonal farm work .
You do n’t need an interview , and you do n’t have to comb through the classifieds section of the Sunday paper to find job vacancies .
There are job boards you can access on the internet that will help you find work , and some of them may require resumes , but these jobs boards are pretty easy to use :
http://www.bbh.co.nz/travellers/billboards.asp?b=7
http://www.backpackerboard.co.nz/
http://www.picknz.co.nz
The absolute easiest way to find seasonal work in New Zealand though is by staying at a working backpacker hostel , and there ’s a lot of good reasons to stay at these places anyway .
Firstly , they ’re cheap , costing between $ 15 - $ 40 per night or $ 100 - $ 160 per week , and there are often discounts for paying by the month or having a BBH club card .
Since most of the other guests are travelers you get to meet people from all over the world , and since you ’ll be staying there working for weeks or months you have plenty of time to make close friends you may keep for the rest of your life .
It ’s not uncommon for backpackers to make new friends and then end up traveling all over the country with them .
Some even pair up to travel to other countries .
It ’s also worth mentioning that a lot of them have sex , and some of them get married .
None of that would be possible if the hostels did n’t find their guests jobs .
The way they find work for their guests is by building working relationships with the contractors and farmers in their local area .
So when farms need workers they call the hostel to recruit workers or the hostel will go through their Rolodex and call every farmer within 50 miles until they find work for their guests .
But the guests do n’t care how they get a job .
All they have to do is check in , let the manager know they ’re looking for work and wait for a job to fall in their lap .
Before you can start work though you ’ll need a copy of your passport , valid temporary work visa , I.R.D. number and a New Zealand bank account .
If you ’re missing any of those documents the hostel manager should be able to help you get them .
Below is a list of working backpacker hostels in New Zealand .
If anyone knows of any that are missing from this list feel free to leave a comment .

Depending on the region these hostels can help you find work picking apples , grapes , peaches , plums , pears , cherries , kiwi fruit and blue berries .
The work is hard .
It will make your body hurt , but it will make you grow as a person , and it ’ll teach you the value of a hard day ’s work .
If you ’re not physically fit you can try to find work in a pack house where you just stand at a conveyor belt and sort / pack all the fruit your mates picked in the orchards .
Sometimes you can also find work in wine factories doing things like putting labels on bottles .
Some of these jobs pay minimum wage , and some of them pay “ by contract , ” which means you get paid by how many bins you fill with fruit or by how many plants you clear .
Farmers will tell you that you can make up to $ 200 per day on contract , but that ’s assumes you ’re in peak physical condition and there ’s plenty of fruit in the orchards / vineyards .
It does happen , but as a general rule $ 120 per day is a more realistic average .
If you make less than minimum wage you ’re still supposed to get paid minimum wage , but your farmer probably wo n’t give minimum wage to a contract worker unless you report them to the labor department .
If you find yourself working for a dishonest farmer you can always just quit and go work somewhere else .
Since seasonal employers do n’t ask for resumes they wo n’t care why you left your last job .
They ’ll just be glad you have fruit picking experience .
Once you ’ve worked and played in one region of New Zealand for a few months you can move to another region , do more work and save your money until you ’re ready to spend a few months traveling around New Zealand with the backpackers you ’ve met along the way .
Doing seasonal work in New Zealand is a wild experience , but be aware that you can only get one temporary work visa to New Zealand ( though you can extend your work visa a few months ) .
If you want to get your permanent residency in New Zealand you ’ll have to secure a job .
You ca n’t secure a job without a work visa .
If you ’ve already used your temporary work visa doing seasonal work you wo n’t be able to use it to find a permanent job when you go for your permanent residency .
So be aware of that .

Christina Aguilera visited Haiti earlier this week to spend time with families displaced by the 7.0 magnitude quake , serve meals at a school and even sing for some Port - au - Prince children .
“ I was so moved by the devastation in Haiti but also by the spirit of its people , ” the singer , 29 , who traveled to the country with husband Jordan Bratman , said in a statement Thursday .
“ [ The children ] have such joy and are eager to learn despite the destruction around them . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Aguilera , an Ambassador Against Hunger for the World Food Programme , toured the country with WFP aid workers and served rice and beans to children at two schools in the Haitian capital .
“ The children deserve a chance and I want to make sure they get a chance , ” says Aguilera , who also met with mothers and children who have been living in refugee camps since the January earthquake .

The Grammy Award - winning star also sang “ Happy Birthday Haiti ” to a class in Port - au - Prince , highlighting how reconstruction efforts have given the country a new start .
“ I urge everyone to go to www.wfp.org/christina and donate so we can bring food to these mothers and children and help them rebuild their lives , ” says Aguilera .
The idea for this post came to me in field immediately after I got instantly blown out of a set .
A wing and I were in a small bar in Soho , London ’s West End on a Friday night .
It was still early , and there were only two sets in the entire place : one large group of 20 some - things sat on sofas at the back , and a mixed group of about 8 people in the middle in the middle of the bar who ’s average age looked to be about 17 ( under age drinking ; do n’t do it kids ! ) .
I was leant up against the bar chatting to my wing , when two Eastern European looking girls entered .
I did n’t really notice them until the stood next to me at the bar and ordered drinks .
I turned my head to look at them , and opened them casually over my shoulder as body remained in place , “ Hi guys ” .
One of them turns her head to look at me .
She ’s a 7 , maybe an 8 .
“ Do you know what time it gets busy in here ? ” .
She turns her head away from me and looks forward , completely ignoring my question .
I know she heard it .
Blow out .
There ’s a slightly uncomfortable burn in my stomach , the type of thing you get were something that is slightly socially embarrassing happens .
I continue chatting to my wing .
“ Wow , it ’s rare my opener is completely ignored like that ” .
My wing shrugs , “ It does n’t matter , you opened , that ’s the main thing .
It happens occasionally ” .
I think about it for a few more seconds and feel a bit bad .
Getting totally blanked can make you feel fairly low value .
Then I go into analytical mode .
Did I not speak loudly enough ?
Did I not properly make eye contact ?
Next time I open I will have to speak louder and make more of an effort not to be ignored .
It ’s then I realised that it was my approach , and not myself that just got rejected .
The bad feelings are gone now ( this entire thought process has only taken like 5 seconds ) , and I start chatting to my wing about 3D films , with some quick glances around the bar for more sets .
I never realised that 3D porn , while sounding great , includes the prospect of being faced by a giant erect penis , pointing out at you from the screen .
Thanks to my wing for ruining something I ’ve been looking forward to for a long time .
So I got blown out .
It was n’t as bad as blow outs get , sort of just an average blow out .
It lead me to think about how blow outs suck so much .
When thinking about it , I had a minor epiphany .
Blow outs suck so little they barely suck at all
That ’s right .
If a blow out was a blow job you ’d be asking the girl to put more effort in because you can barely feel the sucking .
The worst you can expect from 90 % of all blow outs is a few seconds worth of negative feelings .
This is nothing compared to the hours I have spent feeling like a failure because I let my approach anxiety get the better of me and made far to few approaches .
This is very important to people like myself who are suffering from approach anxiety .
The sense of dread you get from approach anxiety , when viewed logically is completely disproportionate to any reasonably likely negative outcome of opening a set .
In other words the fear of approaching is completely illogical .
It ’s not like your in the trenches during the Battle of the Somme and about to go over the top .
A reasonably expected outcome in that scenario is death so extreme fear is very understandable .
Approach anxiety therefore comes down to a battle , the beast vs the man .
It is our reptilian brain ( the beast ) telling us approaching can lead to bad things happening .
We must force ourselves to think logically , and let the man ( the logical part of our brain telling us nothing bad will happen ) win the fight .
Not approaching has negative consequences
We often think that approaching may have a bad outcome , but not approaching wo n’t have any outcome , negative or otherwise , since not approaching is inaction , and we are less likely to think of inaction as having any consequences .
This is not true .
Not approaching has worse consequences than approaching , and we feel the effects of those consequences for longer .
The long term consequences of not opening are horrific : lack of sex , low self esteem , no relationships with women , possibly no family and kids .
Things do n’t just happen on their own .
You have to make them happen .
Remember this next time you ’re contemplating an approach , but you think it ’s better to just do nothing .
So , dear reader , I ’ll leave you with a quote which I think is very relevent to the topic of approach anxiety vs getting blown out .
Some cleaver bloke said it so it must be true :
The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake

What you ’re seeing to your left is VillageTelco ’s Mesh Potato , the prototype for a lightweight , low - cost , and low - power unit that is a building block for rolling your very own decentralized P2P phone network .
We ’re thrilled to announce that this month ’s Awesome Fellowship from Boston goes to Paul Gardner - Stephen , post - doctoral fellow at Flinders University in Adelaide , Australia .
Paul ’s perhaps most known worldwide for his creation of the much - touted innovation of the shoe phone , and for this project , he ’s turning his formidable skills to a new project .
Specifically , the plan is to get the mesh potato to work with mobile telephones so that so that mobile telecoms can be deployed rapidly , cheaply and robustly into disasters , developing and remote areas , and plain old remote places where the huge cost of mobile telephone towers makes it too expensive to provide coverage .
A neat hack that Paul ’s building into the plan is that these P2P phone networks will work with your regular old phone number , without requiring access to the internet ( seriously ) .
The entire thing will be prototyped over Android , and step - by - step instructions will be made available so you can start up a mobile telcom right in the comfort of your own home ( some assembly required ) .
If you ’re around Boston , we ’ll also be holding a demonstration of the technology in late July , with a special presentation from Paul .
So , stay tuned !

Federal agents were investigating the late San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and the late mayor of San Francisco George Moscone for alleged political corruption when both men were murdered in November 1978 , according to Federal Bureau of Investigation files .
The man convicted of killing both men , then - Supervisor Dan White , was also the subject of a separate FBI political corruption probe before he gunned down Moscone and Milk at San Francisco ’s City Hall .

Agents in the FBI ’s San Francisco bureau were looking into whether Moscone and Milk had collaborated to “ defraud the federally sponsored San Francisco Community Development Fund , ” according to documents obtained by San Francisco blogger and gay rights activist Michael Petrelis .
( The relevant pages from those documents can be seen here . )
FBI officials were also investigating whether Moscone had received $ 10,000 “ for favorable treatment in the building of a controversial McDonald ’s restaurant , ” according to the files .
White was being investigated for allegedly securing favorable treatment for an unnamed party in exchange for a deal involving San Francisco ’s Pier 39 , a popular tourist venue where White leased space to operate a fast - food restaurant .
The memo obtained by Petrelis that discusses the investigations is stamped November 30 , 1978 , three days after White shot the two men .
It notes that the “ investigations should not be discussed outside the bureau . ”
Danny Nicoletta , who worked with Milk in a San Francisco camera store frequently shown in the 2008 movie Milk , said he was n’t surprised to hear the FBI had been investigating all three men .

“ In terms of what the political climate was at that time , one would assume the FBI had looked into all of those gentleman , ” Nicoletta said , adding that Milk , the first openly gay elected official , was “ basically a political maverick ” who held office in a place and time when people were “ antagonistic towards the government . ”
Tim Wilson , a librarian with the Gay and Lesbian Center at the San Francisco Public Library , noted there was division within the gay rights movement as well in the 1970s .
“ Harvey was more grassroots , whereas others who were prominent , politically active gay men were part of the ‘ machine , ' ” Wilson said .
“ Their ways of getting political backing were more similar to the political establishment .
Harvey , from what I understand , was more coming from the hippie side — not necessarily establishment , trying to give a voice to unvoiced folks .
Within the gay movement there were different camps about how decisions should be made and who should get the nod for political endorsements . ”

Nicoletta added that he thought the White House “ would have been highly curious about what was going on with LGBT issues in San Francisco at that time . ”
“ I also think they would have been very happy to find something to destabilize [ Milk ] , ” Nicoletta continued , “ but as I remember it he was pretty squeaky clean . ”

Special Agent Joseph Schadler , who works in the FBI ’s San Francisco bureau , said public corruption probes are one of the agency ’s “ highest priorities , ” but cautioned that an investigation does not mean a crime was committed .
“ At any point in time , in any major city , we have public corruption investigations , ” Schadler said .
“ Whether there ’s anything there is another matter . ”
Patti Hansen , a public affairs specialist with the FBI ’s San Francisco Bureau , said she could not speak to the outcome of the more than 30 - year - old investigations , but said the FBI does not usually pursue investigations after the main subjects of probes have died .

“ If they ’re dead , then there ’s nobody for us to prosecute , ” Hansen said .
Blogger Petrelis is still seeking additional files from the FBI about the probes .
The files he has now , however , contain a document signed by Milk suggesting he lived on Henry Street around the time he was murdered , not above the camera store on Castro Street as the movie indicates .
The files also contain a statement ( which can be seen here ) made in 1983 by an unidentified person who said he had contacted White after reading a comment he made in newspaper articles in early 1978 and was invited by White to visit him in City Hall .
The person says he told White he wanted to pursue the possibility of recalling Moscone from office and White said not to worry because by the end of the year he would “ get rid of three bastards , ” mentioning Milk , Moscone and a third person whose name was redacted in the document .

Roughly eight months later and several days before the murders , the witness reports having heard that “ Dan White had gone mad . ”
“ I could n’t sleep that Sunday night , November 26 , ” he said , adding that he approached police officers at City Hall to tell them to “ watch for Dan White and search him very carefully . ”
“ All laughed at my statement , saying , ‘ Dan was a good cop and he ’s not going to hurt anyone , ' ” the witness said .
The person left the building after stopping by the mayor ’s office and seeing “ enough people there ” that he or she believed the mayor would be safe .
Shortly after leaving the building , the witness , who claimed to be friends with the San Francisco Fire Chief and Assistant District Attorney , said they saw emergency vehicles racing to City Hall and learned of the shootings .

The FBI documents indicate the witness also claimed to be friends with the mayor of Jersey City , the U.S. Attorney for Northern California and others .
The agents interviewing the person concluded he would not be a good witness in any court cases .

Afghan farmers claim US , British troops spraying chemicals on world ’s largest opium supply
As the pink poppy fields of southern Afghanistan yield their sticky harvest , opium production in the country that supplies the world with heroin is set to fall , farmers and officials say .
That ’s good news for the fight against the multi-billion - dollar drugs trade but it could be bad news for Afghan farmers struggling to feed their families as the war against Taliban insurgents and drugs gangs escalates .

“ This year we had less poppy cultivation , which I think was because of our public awareness campaign which we launched before cultivation started , ” said Gul Mohammad , head of the counter - narcotics department of Kandahar province .
Farmers in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand , the source of around 90 percent of the world ’s opium , agreed the harvest will fall this year .
The farmers and other experts cited high rainfall in some areas , drought in others , free seeds for alternatives such as wheat and good prices for food crops , and a mysterious disease withering poppies in some areas .
While some farmers have reportedly accused the United States and Britain of spraying their crops with chemicals , the UN ’s Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) said disease was the likely culprit .
Tests by the interior ministry were inconclusive and more were being carried out , said the agency ’s representative in Kabul , Jean - Luc Lemahieu , adding that “ plagues , pests , blight ” had hit Afghanistan ’s poppy crop in 2002 and 2006 .

“ Natural phenomenon cannot be excluded , as happens to wheat , corn , apples .
It is part of nature , ” Lemahieu said .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UNODC , told the BBC that Afghanistan ’s 2010 opium output could fall by up to 25 percent , thanks to the disease , a fungus that could have infected about half of the total poppy crop .
Bilal , a farmer in Helmand ’s Nad Ali district , said the disease had drastically cut his opium output .
“ We are in the very last days of the harvest , maybe in two or three more days we ’ll be done .
We ’ll have less output this year , ” he told AFP .
“ I do n’t know what the disease is but we ’ll have little output ( as a result ) . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
UNODC said opium output was down by 10 percent in 2009 to 6,900 tonnes , but yield rose 15 percent because farmers extracted more opium per bulb .
Production far outstripped annual world demand of 5,000 tonnes , it said , with stockpiles of opium estimated at 10,000 tonnes as cartels hoarded in an effort to push up prices that had fallen by 30 percent in a year .
ADVERTISEMENT
Stockpiles were equal to two years ’ supply of heroin for addicts , or three years of morphine for medical use , it said .
Lemahieu said it was too early to say if 2010 output would be lower than last year ’s — making it the third consecutive annual fall — but yields were likely to be affected .
Stockpiles had kept opium and heroin prices artificially high , which could encourage Afghan farmers to continue to plant poppies , he said , adding that the price of alternative cash crops , from almonds to wheat , would also be a factor .
ADVERTISEMENT
The impact of the conflict between insurgents — who often work with drugs gangs to protect crops and distribution routes — and Western - backed government forces would also influence farmers , he said .
Afghans would plant whatever earned most and the instability of war could see them favour the “ one sure way of safe - guarding against an insecure future , ” he said .
Marjah , a major poppy - producing region in Helmand , was targeted in a military campaign in February that aimed to push out the Taliban , who were acting as enforcers for the drugs gangs .
Afghanistan ’s opium industry is worth up to three billion dollars a year , supplying Russia , where authorities say it kills between 30,000 and 40,000 addicts a year , and Europe .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lemahieu said about 150 million dollars funds the insurgency , widely seen as based on ideology but fast becoming a militia for the cartels with tenuous links to the religious extremists who founded the Taliban .
A recent report by the independent Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit said the Taliban were “ increasingly seen as synonymous with drug traffickers ” .
But it added : “ There is a growing belief in the south that those working for the government are more actively involved in the trade in narcotics than the Taliban . ”

A leading Russian federal judge has been shot dead as he was leaving his apartment building in central Moscow , court officials have said .
Eduard Chuvashov was leaving for work on Monday morning when he was shot by an unknown gunman who fled the scene .
He had presided over several cases involving nationalist organisations and had received death threats .
In February , he sentenced nine members of a neo -Nazi skinhead group called the White Wolves to up to 23 years in jail .
The group was behind a series of racist murders .
He also worked on cases involving Russian officials accused of corruption and embezzlement .
No bodyguard
" An unidentified person shot Mr Chuvashov in the entrance to an apartment block and then fled , " a police source was quoted by Ria Novosti as saying , adding that investigators were at the scene .
There were reports that CCTV cameras recorded the shooting , by a man who appeared to be in his 20s .
The judge is reported to have died instantly after being hit in the head and chest .
Just last week Mr Chuvashov had convicted the teenage leader of the most notorious skinhead gang in Russia for the murder of three more immigrants , says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
The teenager was already serving a long sentence for killing 20 people .
There are reports that despite receiving death threats , Mr Chuvashov had refused to have bodyguards .
BOSTON --
There were still 20 seconds left in the game when Paul Pierce decided he did n't need to see any more and headed to the locker room .
In the hallway , he repeated aloud : " One more .
One more . "
Pierce helped the Celtics open a 16 - point , first - quarter lead , then watched as Rajon Rondo and Glen " Big Baby " Davis helped Boston coast to a 94 - 71 victory over the Orlando Magic and take a 3 - 0 lead in the best - of - seven Eastern Conference finals .
The most - decorated team in NBA history , the Celtics are one win away from their second trip to the finals in three years -- and their 21st in all .
No NBA team has ever lost a playoff series after winning the first three games .
" We 're motivated for what 's at stake .
We see the big picture , " said Pierce , who was the finals MVP when Boston won its record 17th NBA title in 2008 .
" We were coming home for two games on our home court .
We 're motivated .
We can feel it .
Guys know what its like to win a championship and play for a championship . "
The Magic have to win Game 4 on Monday night to avoid a sweep and force the series back to Orlando .
They 'll need a better effort than in Game 3 , when they fell behind early for the third straight game .
This time , they did n't even mount a late charge to make it close .
" The most disappointing to me was that I did n't have our team better ready to play , " said Magic coach Stan Van Gundy , who was himself knocked over late in the game when Kevin Garnett was pushed into the Orlando bench going after a loose ball .
" It starts with me .
It 's my job .
I 'm the coach of this team .
It starts with me and I 'm not happy with where we had our team tonight or anything I did . "
Pierce had 15 points and nine rebounds , Ray Allen scored 14 and Garnett added 10 points in just 24 minutes .
But this time it was n't the Celtics ' aging all - stars that did the damage -- it was the two youngest players on the roster , Davis and Rondo , who were born in 1986 , the year that Larry Bird and the original Big Three won the last of their three NBA titles .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Almost three - quarters of Britons have considered emigrating this year , with Australia as the most popular destination , according to a new survey .
The survey carried out by foreign exchange broker Currency UK found that 31 percent of respondents cited the poor state of the British economy as the reason for wanting to leave , while 23 percent blamed the lack of job prospects and 19 percent said they are worried about the outcome of last week ’s election .
“ Our survey highlights that many Brits are concerned by the prospect of a hung Parliament and that the next four years will be dominated by huge tax rises , cuts in public service and inflation , ” Currency UK senior account manager Adrian Jacob said .
The numbers have dramatically risen compared to Currency UK ’s last survey on emigration in 2005 , when only 25 percent of respondents said they had considered leaving Britain .
About one in 10 of the 1,029 people surveyed said that a change in the pace of life was the main reason they wanted to emigrate .
The survey also found that Canada was the next most popular destination after Australia , followed by the United States , New Zealand , Spain , France and Thailand .
Chart topping rapper “ Soulja Boy ” has been accused of flagrantly ripping off the Death Note OST in one of his latest releases , imaginatively called “ Death Note . ”
He is but the latest in a series of minor American celebrities caught plagiarising the works of Japanese artists with the evidently misplaced hope that nobody will notice , a practice since termed “ Simmonsing ” in honour of its foremost and most shameless practicioner
The track in question , “ Long Journey , ” which listeners should be warned is exceptionally bad even by contemporary rap standards :
Player 1
The track from the Death Note OST he is alleged to have flagrantly ripped off , the “ Near Theme ” :
Player 2
Whilst liberally “ sampling ” the music of others is an accepted staple of hiphop , generally it does not extend to stealing entire songs , series names and even fonts , all without credit .
Presumably the rapper , a barely literate 19 - year - old who came to fame through such sites as YouTube , thought nobody would notice .
He has previously been sued for allegedly stealing the name “ Soulja Boy ” from another performer , and even amongst other rappers has been dismissed as “ garbage . ”
As the album in question is merely a freely released “ mixtape ” it may escape any legal sanction , but this hardly makes it any less ethically dubious .
Global IP Solutions announced that it has been selected by LG Mobile to provide HD voice for its Fixed Mobile Convergence solution .
FMC allows telecom operators to combine fixed telephony , cellular telephony and broadband into unified end - user services .
The aim is to provide both services with a single phone , which could switch between networks ad hoc .
Several industry standardisation activities have been completed in this area such as the Voice call continuity ( VCC ) specifications defined by the 3GPP .
Typically , these services rely on Dual Mode Handsets , where the customers ’ mobile terminal can support both the wide - area ( cellular ) access and the local - area technology ( for VoIP ) .
However , an alternative approach achieves FMC over 3G mobile networks – eliminating the requirement for Dual Mode .
Last month LG announced the KH3900 JoyPop , the company ’s first FMC phone .
LG Electronics added HD Voice capabilities to its FMC application by integrating GIPS VoiceEngine Mobile , which includes advanced acoustic echo cancellation ( AEC ) technology .
“ Good AEC implementation is critical to improve quality of voice calls on mobile devices , ” according to LG .
The company also said that GIPS ’ strong local support and expertise team in South Korea ensured a smooth implementation of voice processing technology in their smartphone model SU210 / KU2100 / LU2100 for FMC solution .
LG will be initially selling this product to service providers , starting with the South Korea market .
According to GIPS ’ CEO Emerick Woods , implementing GIPS
HD voice technology offers service providers assurances that network , bandwidth and delay issues will be overcome .
GIPS has already enabled HD Voice and Video Chat to the iPad , iPhone as well as to the Android mobiles .

MWC 2010 : Interview with John Hermansen of Global IP Solutions
The summer blockbuster season has officially kicked off with Iron Man 2 , an action - packed superhero flick that had the fifth - highest - grossing opening weekend in Hollywood 's history .
Whether you like the movie or not , at least one thing about it rings true — the plot and the characters provide a striking reflection of today 's tech security industry .
More : 2010 ' Geek and Tech ' Summer Movie Preview
Spoiler alert :
We do discuss major plot points in this article .
If you have n't seen the movie , keep reading at your own risk .
Marvel 's metallic superhero was first portrayed on the silver screen by Robert Downey Jr. in 2008 's Iron Man .
In that film , playboy industrialist Tony Stark has a crisis of conscience and brings the manufacture of weapons at his defense company to a halt .
To chase down terrorists who have misappropriated his munitions , Stark builds himself an armored , weaponized exoskeleton suit ( that can fly ! ) and becomes Iron Man , making his invention an object of desire to military profiteers .
The sequel is much the same , with more villains , more conniving and more suits .
A montage catches us up on what 's happened since the previous movie :
With no country 's military able to match Iron Man 's technological superiority , Stark 's vigilante action and deterrent policy have brought about a worldwide détente .
IT at the Movies :
Since Stark is the only person who knows what makes Iron Man tick , the world 's security rests entirely in his hands .
Not surprisingly , the U.S. government wants to reproduce the Iron Man suit for its own militaristic purposes ; the debate over private vs. public security forms one of the movie 's core conflicts .
Meet the Villains : Hacker , Security Vendor
The scarier of Iron Man 2's two major villains , Ivan Vanko ( Mickey Rourke ) vows on his father 's deathbed to kill Tony Stark for the sins of Tony 's father , Howard Stark , who did n't share credit with the elder Vanko for inventing the " arc reactor " power generator .
In many ways , Ivan Vanko is Tony Stark 's evil twin : a brilliant engineer able to craft the most wondrous of devices from the most rudimentary of materials .
Described as a physicist , Vanko also demonstrates a mastery of computer programming , mechanical engineering and martial arts .
His creativity under captivity closely parallels that of Tony Stark 's in the first film , though their motivations and values set the two apart .
From an IT security perspective , it 's easy see the Russian Vanko as a symbol of today 's cybercriminals , many of whom are former Soviet computer code writers who now write malware for criminal organizations for fast cash .
Vanko's motives are different from those of the typical cyber bad guy , but the comparison is hard to resist .
Vanko's partner in crime is Justin Hammer ( Sam Rockwell ) , who , in contrast , shows no aptitude for even basic technology .
A rival defense contractor whose products are notoriously unreliable , Hammer will do anything to run Stark Industries into bankruptcy .
His petulant , demanding conduct is a caricature of spoiled billionaire behavior , making us wonder how he ever built Hammer Industries .
His social awkwardness also fits the negative stereotype of geeks :
In a scene where he takes the stage at an expo , dancing awkwardly and using strangled metaphors , we could n't help but imagine him bounding across the theater shouting , " Developers ! Developers ! Developers ! "
Hammer 's overconfidence is symbolic of the security vendor community .
To be fair , many vendors do develop technologies that have made a huge difference in the security fight .
But many more have been slammed by security practitioners for claiming that their technologies solve all of a company 's defensive challenges .
It 's fun to watch Hammer show off his cigar - sized Ex -Wife Missile , which turns out to be a dud later in the film , and think of antivirus vendors whose signature updates can't keep up with fast - evolving malware .
Cutting - Edge IT
Balancing the appearance of two new villains is a partner for Iron Man .
The trailers have made no secret of this film 's debut of War Machine : U.S. Air Force Lt. Colonel James Rhodes ( Don Cheadle ) in a suit comparable to Iron Man's .
Even though Stark insists , " I am the armor , " he must have anticipated Rhodes ' new role , as the War Machine suit comes equipped with its own power source .
( Stark 's suit , on the other hand , is powered by the arc reactor that Stark inserts into his own chest to keep his damaged heart working , indirectly making Stark the power source for his own armor . )
And when Rhodes first appears as War Machine , he seems at ease with the suit 's functions and interface , suggesting that this is n't his virgin flight .
Rounding out the cast is Gwyneth Paltrow as the frazzled Pepper Potts , personal - assistant - turned - CEO of Stark Industries , and Scarlett Johansson as Potts ' replacement , the versatile Natalie Rushman .
More than just eye candy , Johansson pulls jaw - dropping moves in Iron Man 2 that will come as a surprise to anyone who still thinks of her as the rather mousy Charlotte from 2003's Lost in Translation .
From the get - go , Stark is a man with cutting - edge IT , even when he 's not playing superhero .
At the Senate Armed Services Committee 's Weaponized Suit Defense Program hearings , Stark whips out an impressive see - through smartphone - like device and in a matter of seconds hacks into the room 's digital display screen , to which he then wirelessly streams his own video .
The digital interfaces with which Stark 's laboratory was equipped in the first film have evolved even more fantastic capabilities .
Instead of projecting a 3D interface above a Microsoft Surface - like display , Stark 's computers now project into and accept input from the entire room , much like Star Trek 's holo - emitters .
With gesture - based commands , Stark can expand and collapse images on all three axes or even toss files into the trash as easily as an NBA star makes a hook shot .
Jarvis , the voice - recognition - equipped AI assistant , has been excised from Iron Man 's suit and is restricted to the laboratory , where he performs three - dimensional scans of physical objects to produce wireframe digital representations , much as Microsoft 's Project Natal promises to do .
Iron Man 2 is n't the first film to portray futuristic technology in today 's world , but with the possible exception of the suit itself ( and perhaps the particle accelerator Stark builds in his basement ) , there is little in Stark 's repertoire that defies credulity .
The movie takes existing concepts and extends them along their logical evolution , while offering some subtle commentary on the IT celebrities who may someday bring this technology to life .
Art Reflects Reality
One of the more interesting threads of the Stark story is his personal growth .
When he appears before the Senate committee early in the movie , he mocks the proceedings throughout .
Not only does he hack the video feed , he also refuses to share his technology with the government .
Stark tells the senators " you 're welcome " because he has " privatized world peace " and insists that no one else in the world is anywhere close to duplicating his technology .
Of course , he 's proven wrong in short order , and as the film progresses he comes to realize he can't act alone .
This is an ongoing theme in the security industry .
White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt constantly pushes the view that public - private partnerships are essential if we 're to have any chance at achieving meaningful security .
Schmidt says the information security community is right to be spooked by massive , coordinated attacks that targeted Google and other large corporations in December 2009 , and he believes the best defense against this sort of thing remains in the hands of the private sector -- with help from the government .
" You guys have been carrying the water , " Schmidt told attendees at CSO Perspectives 2010 in April .
The government can do a lot to improve the nation 's cyberdefenses , he said , but ultimately , the key to warding off attacks like the one Google experienced remains private - sector vigilance .
That does n't mean the private sector can go it alone , which is why Schmidt 's cybersecurity coordinator position was created last year .
Looking at this in reverse , the private sector needs to help save government from itself much of the time .
Government agencies still make plenty of mistakes in their own IT security , just as the military in Iron Man 2 made a mess of things by doing business with a hack ( pun intended ) like Hammer .
Now , we 're not suggesting that the producers of Iron Man 2 set out to make a mockumentary about the security industry as it exists today .
But for anyone in the security business watching the film , it 's impossible to avoid the comparisons .
On the positive side , if these comparisons are to be taken literally , the movie suggests that there 's hope for the security industry .
Stark learns that he can't act alone and must treat the government as more of a partner -- or at least there 's a suggestion of this newfound attitude .
And the message of the Hammer story line is that if you push junky security technology on the buyer , you will pay the price .

Hackers may be able to seize control of a driving car ( Image : erbag / Stock Xchng )
The idea of hackers breaking into your personal computer is alarming enough .
But what if they could seize control of your car ’s control systems while you are driving ?
Using a laptop and custom - written software , security researchers have hacked into the control systems of a family car , disabled the brakes and turned off the engine while the vehicle was moving .
Fortunately , the hack is technically difficult and the risk to drivers is low – for now .
But the benign hackers , led by Tadayoshi Kohno at the University of Washington in Seattle and Stefan Savage at the University of California , San Diego , have revealed the details to encourage car makers to make future vehicles more secure .
Computers help control many systems in modern vehicles , from anti-lock braking systems to the timing of ignition .
Each system typically has its own dedicated computer controller , which is connected to a network that can be accessed by mechanics via a socket under the dashboard .

Disabled brakes
Kohno and Savage ’s team tested two 2009 sedans of the same make and model , which they decline to name .
In a paper to be presented next week at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in Oakland , California , they describe how they plugged a laptop into the control socket and used software called CarShark to send signals into the car ’s networks .
By sending random commands and observing the effect of each , they were able to decipher the language used by the control systems .
In tests on a disused airfield in Washington state , with the laptop plugged into a control network , the researchers were able to kill the engine and disable the brakes of a car moving at 65 kilometres per hour .
They were also able to instantaneously lock the brakes .
Clearly , drivers would notice a laptop plugged into their car ’s control systems .
But it would be possible to achieve the same result with less obtrusive hardware that could be controlled remotely .
Still more alarmingly , the researchers say they also took control of a car using wireless signals and operated it via the internet , but would not provide further details of this part of the study .
‘ Car tuning ’
Although the attacks sound alarming , they require a high level of knowledge to carry out .
“ Car tuning ” enthusiasts have similarly discovered how to control many of the systems the researchers compromised – although there is no evidence of anyone using these methods to malicious ends .
Industry experts say they have never seen such attacks being used outside of the new experiment .
Savage says that the car industry ’s attitude to system security is similar to that of the computer industry prior to the internet – which exposed computers to attack and revealed many vulnerabilities .
“ This industry has n’t had to deal with adversarial pressure , so its defences have n’t had to be that strong , ” Savage says .
He hopes that industry and regulators will come together to develop a consensus on how to protect cars before such attacks are attempted .
Building On Conviction : Inside Ubisoft Toronto
By Mathew Kumar
Ubisoft Toronto was announced just under a year ago , and since then -- other than announcing that Assassin 's Creed producer Jade Raymond is to lead it -- the studio has been quiet on its progress .
Today Ubisoft has announced that one of its flagship franchises , Splinter Cell , is to have its next installment produced entirely within the Toronto studio , with a second , unannounced title to be produced in co-production with Ubisoft Montreal .
Gamasutra visited the still - growing studio and its in - development workspace to discuss the studio's plans for its future , with input from the studio's core team including managing director Jade Raymond , senior producer Alex Parizeau , and head of the company 's new Toronto - based extension of its Technology Group , Rima Brek .
Location , Location , Location
The location for Ubisoft 's new Toronto studio was subject to a lot of speculation , and with Ubisoft 's Montreal studio situated on the trendy street of Saint Laurent , many imagined the studio could perhaps be placed on one of Toronto's " hip " neighborhoods such as west Queen West or in a location that features easily converted factory - space , such as the Distillery district .
It makes the studio's location , in the Bloor / Lansdowne region , almost surprising .
Not quite far west enough to be in the cool Roncevalles or Junction neighborhoods , nor quite east enough to be in the Annex ( the location that forms the major backdrop to significant sections of the Scott Pilgrim series of books and upcoming film )
Bloor and Lansdowne is a quiet , largely residential area that offers easy access to the rest of the city .
Top row , left to right : Lesley Phord - Toy , Alexandre Parizeau , Maxime Béland .
Bottom row : Rima Brek , Jade Raymond
In particular , it also offers a large ex-factory location that strongly compares to that of Ubisoft Montreal 's , with red bricks , large windows , skylights , and swathes of open floor space .
Yet unlike Ubisoft Montreal , the company 's windows look out onto a neighborhood of ordinary homes ; those homes , too , seem to have a surprisingly good view of the studio .
" All of the core team has relocated with me from Montreal , " said Raymond during an informal round - table chat in one of the new studio's conference rooms .
" We 're all kind of getting used to it , but it 's pretty cool to be in this big building just across the street from regular houses . "
The location currently features one main production floor that can seat roughly 180 people , with circular areas set out as " brainstorm spaces " to feature whiteboard walls and monitors to give teams the ability to play , view and discuss daily builds without needing to set aside time in a conference room .
Though the space is similar to Ubisoft Montreal 's offices in style , when we visited there was still swathes of " raw " space still being worked on by builders .
Raymond discussed plans to double the current production floor space by removing some walls , while also making sure the space kept some individual features -- from walls featuring art not only from Ubisoft 's internal artists but local artists , and that they were " pricing out building a real kitchen , " to provide crunching teams with the ability to eat more than just microwave meals .
Triple - A Plans
Strikingly , Raymond has a no- nonsense , take - charge approach , with a clear and focused plan for the studio that would doubtlessly surprise many of the detractors of her often high - profile position as a producer at the Montreal studio .
Acknowledging the investment from the government of Ontario -- $ 263 million CAD across ten years -- and the company 's own commitment to invest over half a billion dollars over the same period of time , she admitted it was a " luxurious amount of investment " , but that the company was committed to using it in the most efficient fashion .
" It 's a really nice position to be in , " she explained .
" Instead of starting a studio and working on small projects , Nintendo DS or portables , we 're starting out of the gate with triple - A only . "
" The reason that I think that 's the right strategy is that it allows us to attract the best talent right off the bat .
When you have the ambition to grow a studio from zero to 800 in 10 years , you have to get good people in the door from the start ; people with a lot of experience .
In my mind , that 's what 's going to allow you to make sure that the junior people that you bring in are trained properly , and if you want the right start I think that 's the only way to be successful . "
Bringing the next title in the Splinter Cell franchise to Toronto was key to that decision to bring in the " right people , " Raymond continued .
" In video games , most people are motivated , and passionate , about the project .
I think that can be even more important than salary or other perks ... but a lot of people did think we'd be working on Assassin 's Creed when I moved here ! "
In the attempt to attract those right people , Raymond was steadfast in her belief that beginning with triple - A projects was " one - hundred percent " the correct decision for the continued growth and aims of the studio , arguing that portable or so - called " smaller " projects such as on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network are not best used as " stepping - stones " for forming larger developers .
" There is a lot of great stuff on portable , on Xbox Live , on PSN .
A lot of great indie games .
It 's a discussion I think that 's very worthy to have , which is , who is the best at making those kind of games ?
I think maybe more of the coolest stuff there is coming out of indie development , " Raymond said .
" We , by which I mean Ubisoft , put a lot of thought into what to move to Toronto .
We had several criteria , but one of them was what would be a good match for the city .
Where you develop a game does have an impact on who it appeals to .
" A lot of the games that come out of the Montreal studio , or the European studios , have much more of that ' continental ' flair ; Beyond Good and Evil , for example , could n't have been produced other than in France .
It 's a very European - feeling game .
When you think of it like that , I think the Splinter Cell franchise fits Toronto . "
Due to the flexible team sizes needed in triple - A game production ( most triple - A teams start small , swell during production , and return to a steady level afterward )
Raymond announced that the studio would also be working on another " major franchise " with a second , smaller team in a shared development program with Ubisoft Montreal .
This second team will be headed by Lesley Phord - Toy , a recent hire from Montreal Studio A2M ( the studio responsible for 2009 's third - person action shooter Wet. )
Phord - Toy said , " We want to work towards a smoother growth so we 're not putting all the pressure on the studio to immediately build two triple - A teams at the same time .
It gives us the chance to focus not only on bringing the right people in at the beginning , but putting them in the right place either to train or for training .
When we look to grow this second team into a full team , we 'll have the core team . "
Splinter Group
Alex Parizeau is a five - year veteran of Ubisoft Montreal , beginning with Tom Clancy 's Rainbow Six Vegas and most recently serving as producer on Splinter Cell : Conviction .
Joining the Ubisoft Toronto team shortly before our visit ( " I 'm still sleeping on an inflatable mattress , " he laughed ) Parizeau is to head up the production of the next Splinter Cell in Toronto .
" I'm excited , " Parizeau said .
" We have very high ambitions for the project , and it's a great opportunity , because Splinter Cell has a lot of visibility , and we 're really hoping to attract a lot of senior talent and people who have a lot of experience in the industry .
We we want to build the studio around that , a really strong core team , and that [ Splinter Cell ] is going to provide us with a really good platform to do that .
I think we have a really special chance to build something strong from the start . "
" What makes sense for me for Splinter Cell in Toronto is the three axes of the project , " Parizeau continued .
" You need the team , the tech , the design .
When we started Splinter Cell : Conviction , it was difficult , because we were working on new hardware , changing tech , and wanted to rejuvenate and innovate with the design .
" With so many risks , some are going to pay off and some are n't , and I think that 's why we stumbled for a while during the development cycle .
But here in Toronto we have a strong tech platform , a strong platform for the design , and we have a core team in place that we can focus on growing , and on creating a project based on the pillars we put in place creating Splinter Cell : Conviction . "
Raymond added that the Toronto studio would also be in the best position to focus on polish :
" Developers always try to re-do things , take a ' clean slate ' approach ; however , there 's a lot to be said about recognizing when you have a solid base and then making sure you have the time for polish .
I think when you look at the big console games that are successful these days , the things that distinguish them is the polish ; the teams that have taken the time for real playtesting .
It 's a really good position to be in , to have a solid base and not have to be reinventing . "
Parizeau is joined on the Splinter Cell project by Maxime Béland , Ubisoft Toronto's new creative director , who began as a game tester at Ubisoft Montreal over a decade ago , " working his way up slowly " to game designer on Rainbow Six : Raven Shield .
" You can not underestimate how much easier it is to build a game when you have your tools and design in place from day one , " said Béland .
" I 'm not saying all the tools would be perfect or you 're not going to change some things , but to have a really strong base .
Conviction is doing very well , and I think that with the proper time and people , we 've got a great base to build on .
I do n't think we 're going to be shipping the sequel in six months , because we are building the studio , but Ubisoft is known to prioritize quality . "
Béland spoke from a position of a Ubisoft developer who had gained a reputation as a " fixer , " joining Assassin 's Creed and Splinter Cell : Conviction teams during the project .
As Béland explained , " I worked on Conviction for more than two years and [ with Alex ] changed the direction -- whether that 's ' fixing ' it depends on who you ask . "
" What really excites me about Toronto is that , well , I was reading Clint Hocking 's blog and one of the reasons he chose to leave Ubisoft Montreal was he was too comfortable and wanted to shake things up .
It 's interesting for me , because it 's exactly the same thing .
Doing something less comfortable ; having that feeling of being at a smaller company but still with the back - up of Ubisoft .
" It 's something I 've never done , building a company from scratch , and it 's really exciting .
The headaches are new and different , and as game developers we thrive on the headaches , the challenges .
Every little problem is something new that we can enjoy solving , so adding the challenge of building a studio is really exciting . "
However , the aim of gaining new staff for Ubisoft Toronto is not , the team argued , simply to gain ' warm bodies ' for indoctrination into Ubisoft 's ' way ' of making games .
" Something I 'm looking forward to on working on a big game like the next Splinter Cell is that we 'll be able to get really experienced people from outside Ubisoft , " Béland said .
" It 's going to allow us to learn from different mentalities .
Having been at Ubisoft for eleven years , I know exactly how Ubisoft makes games , but I want to surround myself with new people that bring in new ways of making games .
I think that 's going to be very interesting : as much to teach and mentor new people , but also for us to mature and grow as developers . "
Parizeau added , " The cool thing is that as a start - up company we 'll be able to grow the company , at least , along a structure we 've already experience before .
For me we 're growing the team , but we 're growing it around a structure that we know and can thus tweak and adapt .
It 's very different form a company that has to learn how to structure itself as it grows .
I think that 's something that 's going to help us a lot and make us very strong and solid from the start .
We 're really starting with a level of risk that is n't the same as other start - ups .
" We have a great opportunity to build a culture of our own ; something that reflects me , Max , Rima , Leslie , and Jade , and that 's an opportunity that you do n't often get in your career and that 's what I 'm excited about . "
Employee Number ...
No matter the backing , the task of staffing up a start - up to 800 employees while also working on two projects ( one a confirmed AAA sequel ) seems like it would be a major challenge .
Yet Raymond revealed that even without extensive media coverage outside of the original announcement of the studio in July ( though the company does have " Ubisoft Employee Number 1 " keeping interested parties up - to - date via Facebook and Twitter ) the company has received over 2000 resumes .
" It 's not a question of getting the numbers , " she said .
" The numbers are there .
Ubisoft has been lucky and has n't faced the kind of layoffs that have affected other companies , and there are quite a few really senior industry people looking for jobs now .
It 's more a question of making sure we choose the right people , not just in terms of their experience level and talent , but also their personality and how they would fit with that team to make sure we can build that culture that we want . "
But what is the aim for the Toronto studio's culture ?
Raymond said , " From Ubisoft culture I really appreciate the multicultural aspect .
People are recruited from all over the world , and Toronto is a very diverse city and it's a great place to make sure we have a culture where we can tap into people 's different backgrounds .
I think the challenge is more just in not going too quickly , instead making sure that even though we have these grand ambitions we make sure to choose the right people . "
And if the right people come along , Ubisoft Toronto will be available .
" I 've spent quite a bit of time talking to people in the industry , and the studios that have been successful , and I think the difference between the successful studios and not are those that hire when there is a good person available , not just to fill specific roles .
I think if the best animator in the world walked in the door , though we 're not looking for an animator , we 're going to hire them .
The worst thing we could ever do is wait for the day we need someone and hire the first person that comes along . "
Second Team , First Up
The second team also allows Ubisoft Toronto more flexibility in hiring , Phord - Toy said .
" As we 've been doing the recruiting , the kinds of people that we 're looking for on Alex 's team do n't necessarily match up to the kind of people I 'm looking for .
We 're not competing for the same resources , and from a strategy point of view it forms an interesting opportunity to bring another group of people into the studio . "
Raymond agreed .
" Leslie 's team is going to go into production before the Splinter Cell team , and it allows us to hire production people faster .
" Splinter Cell is focusing on conception , with a small team of highly focused veterans on the creative side , and Leslie 's team has those people too , but there will also be a production team .
So what 's really cool is that Leslie is going to be the first person hiring juniors .
" The studio portfolio strategy is something else we 're trying to do right , " she continued .
" What are we going to do after these two projects ship , how are we preparing for the production ramp - up for Splinter Cell is going to have ?
Within a year and a bit her team is going to have gone through a couple of major milestones , and she 's going to have some staff that can branch off and be another whole team .
" It 's kind of how we are not only going to plan the studio's growth and training intelligently , but how we keep things fresh .
So people working on one thing are going to be able to work on something different and cool later ; it 's the situation where you do n't have people working on the same things or brand for the next five iterations just because we 're starting up . "
Béland added , " Also technology .
People will be learning different tools and tech on each team , which is very important for the Toronto studio to be flexible ; jump in and work on any engine . "
Technologically Sound
Rima Brek 's experience at Ubisoft outpaces even Béland 's , having served twelve years -- beginning as a programmer before transitioning into working outside of the production stream in Ubisoft 's Montreal - based Technology Group .
The group acts as a hub for Ubisoft 's international teams -- working on internal tech , middleware , and tools .
Brek said , " If a project has a certain need , they can consult with the Technology Group and we can direct them to another project , propose an internal option ( middleware or tool ) , or give them feedback on external tools .
It 's super important that the Technology Group is aware of everything that 's going on . "
As a result , Brek 's new role as Head of the Toronto Technology Group is somewhat of a " dual role . "
" I 'm partly building an extension of the technology group here in Toronto , but I 'm also getting involved in helping build the studio and dealing with any technology issues the production team -- or just the studio in general -- might face . "
Raymond said , " I 'm really excited about having Rima form a group here in Toronto , as one of the things Ubisoft said when we formed the studio here is that we 're interested in leveraging the film talent that already exists in Toronto , and taking advantage of that base .
" It 's really tough to get someone straight from the film industry and put them on a game project and have them be effective .
You can have someone who is the best animator , or a tools programmer , but you ask them to work in a real - time environment where the story is being controlled by the player , there 's a lot of learning there .
" The technology group will be a way to make those people immediately useful in a games environment .
Rima can have people on her team who can be working on real tools , useful to everyone , but also work closely with the production teams and start to see how that works .
It allows us to most effectively tap into the talent pool . "
However , Raymond stated that they were not sure what size the Technology Group will reach at this stage .
" It depends on a lot on the opportunity .
One of our strategies is attracting the best talent , and if a lot of the people who we attract that are superstars want to work with Rima , we may end up growing the tech group much bigger than we anticipated , but likewise the inverse is true .
" We have a bit of a flexible plan right how ; the most important thing is finding the talent , rather than saying we have a set number of places here or there .
Our hiring is very opportunistic ; if you 're great , we want to hire you . "

People with Williams syndrome have a genetic deletion that has a wide range of effects , including narrowed blood vessels , developmental delays and -- oddly -- love of music and extreme friendliness .
The extreme friendliness of this small population -- about 1 in 8,000 U.S. babies is thought to have the genetic anomaly -- has always interested personality psychologists and neuroscientists .
The remarkable regularity of Williams kids ' trusting personalities and social fearlessness has prompted many researchers to wonder how the known deletion of 25 genes in the massively complex human genome could relate to the uniformly predictable appearance of a personality trait -- extraversion -- that helps make us who we are .
In a study reported in the journal Current Biology and published Monday , German and French researchers report on a heretofore undiscovered behavior pattern that also unites people with Williams syndrome :
They do not seem inclined to stereotype those of minority ethnic or racial groups in the insidious and generally unacknowledged ways that most of the rest of us do .
The researchers took a group of 20 children with Williams syndrome and a matched - group of normal - development children and had the subjects look at a series of people -- some with brown skin , others white -- engaged in a range of daily activities .
The kids were asked to describe the pictured person and to characterize that person using one of a range of positive and negative prompts .
While the normal - development kids followed long - established patterns of viewing the pictured person with the skin color different from their own in a less favorable light , children with Williams syndrome were far less likely to make any such distinctions .
The researchers relate the absence of the impulse to racially stereotype to the hallmark personality trait of those with Williams syndrome : the same lack of social fear or wariness that makes individuals belonging to this special population sometimes unnervingly friendly to strangers .
And the researchers suggest that this says something interesting about racial stereotyping : that it is based in fear and is a primitive impulse that helps us hold those who are identifiably different from us -- the " outgroup " -- at arm 's length .
Interestingly , the Williams syndrome kids -- half male , half female -- did engage in gender stereotyping .
To author Andreas Meyer - Lindenberg of the University of Heidelberg 's Central Institute of Mental Health in Germany , this suggests that gender stereotyping springs from a different source than racial stereotyping .
Unlike even the most subtle forms of racism , gender stereotyping serves no deep - seated fear impulse , Meyer - Lindenberg suggests .
Rather , the impulse to make assumptions on the basis of sex is learned behavior -- " social imitative learning and over - generalization " -- not fear .
( For if it were fear , it too would have been extinguished in Williams syndrome . )
It 's at moments like this that neuroscience has the potential to change -- or at least explain -- the things we do .
Past studies of kids with Williams syndrome have shown that those who are most socially fearless have an amygdala -- the primitive nugget deep in the brain from which the sensation of fear springs -- that does n't function properly .
For the rest of us , the amygdala does perform normally .
And the primitive fear it pumps out at the sight of a member of an " outgroup " representative can be extinguished only if our prefrontal cortex -- the seat of reason -- steps in and overrides it .
It makes you wonder who is the most " evolved " -- someone with normal development or the one with the genetic deletion ?

Posted May 27 , 2010 , at 8:53 a.m. CSTNovozymes , a bioinnovation company , COFCO , a producer and supplier of process agricultural products and Sinopec , the world 's third - largest oil refinery , signed a memorandum of understanding on May 27 covering the next steps towards commercialization of cellulosic biofuel in China .
As part of the agreement , COFCO and Sinopec will build a cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant and Novozymes will supply with enzymes .
The new plant comes on line in the third quarter of 2011 and will produce 3 MMgy of bioethanol made from corn stover .
In February , Novozymes launched new Cellic CTec2 , an enzyme product enabling the biofuel industry to produce cellulosic ethanol at a price competitive with gasoline and conventional ethanol .
"
In 2009 , we forged this partnership in China to develop biofuel from agricultural waste ; today , we are one step closer to producing commercial quantities , " said Michael Christiansen , president , Novozymes China .
" With gasoline prices hovering around $ 4 per gallon in China , companies across the country are reaffirming their commitment to investing in development of clean , alternative fuel sources .
"
The new plant will be the largest demonstration facility converting agricultural waste into biofuel in China .
China has an adequate supply of biomass , and agricultural residues alone exceed 700 million metric tons ( 772 million tons ) annually .
A 2009 study by Novozymes and McKinsey showed that by converting agricultural residues into fuel ethanol , China can reduce its gasoline consumption by 31 million tons in 2020 , thereby reducing its dependence on imported petroleum by 10 percent and abating 90 million tons of CO2 emissions .
By doing so , this industry will create 6 million direct jobs , resulting in an RMB 32 billion ( Chinese currency ) - around $ 4.7 billion - income increase annually .
By 2020 , the number of cars in China is expected to exceed 200 million , up from 130 million today , which will lead to substantial growth in the demand for vehicle fuels .
To meet these rising demands the Chinese government has launched an ambitious bioenergy development target that will boost the production of cellulosic biofuels .

Another glorious chapter in the incredible story that is the miracle of Villarreal CF was written on Sunday with an unprecedented invasion of Barcelona by over 10,000 of the Villarreal Yellow hordes .
Spanish football fans do n’t do away games , even the top clubs rarely muster as many as 1,000 travelling supporters for even the most important games .
Last month several hundred Villarreal fans made a similar length of journey to Murcia .
That was , rightly , seen at the time as an amazing act of community support and involvement , by Spanish standards .
Yet Sunday ’s events totally rewrote the template of what is possible .
Villarreal as they have shown consistently for the last 14 years live by different rules and Sunday 2nd June saw something unprecedented in the history of Spanish football .
A major football citadel , Barcelona , was overrun and transformed into a home base by over 20 % of the population of another town .
Spain had seen nothing like this since April 2004 when 10,000 Celtic supporters invaded Villarreal and captivated the whole town with their wonderful attitude and behaviour .
( See the side panel for details of the book “ Celtic Submari ” that describes that invasion and how it led to a New Model of Football relationships ) .
Almost 200 buses left Vila - real and drove in convoy to Barcelona .
Over 10,000 Villarreal supporters , almost all wearing yellow tops , made the incredible journey .
They took over the Mini-Stadium and transformed it into a sea of passionate yellow .
A football stadium in Barcelona .
The home team in their famous red and blue strip .
The visitors the last La Liga team to split Barcelona and Real Madrid and claim 2nd place in La Liga .
A totally unforgettable carnival atmosphere , and amazingly over 80 % of the noisy crowd are wearing yellow and supporting the away team .
Villarreal went into the game , against Barcelona B , the reserve team filled with the highly talented fruits of Barcelona ’s vaunted youth policy , as the second top team in the Spanish Second Division .
They knew if they won their last two games , away to Barca B then home to third placed Almeria , then automatic promotion back to La Liga would be guaranteed .
The Yellow Hordes inspired their team to play their best football of the season .
Villarreal won 3 - 0 with a breath - taking display of attractive football that leaves Barcelona outclassed in their own midden .
OK so it was the Mini Stadium rather than the Camp Nou , and a Second Division game rather than a La Liga clash , but it was still a miracle in action , a remarkable day that will never be forgotten by any of the over 10,000 yellow clad invaders .
Any Celtic supporters watching the game on the internet will have been able to spot a fair number of Celtic tops dotted among the hordes of yellow ones .
The Villarreal Celtic Submari were well represented , as by far the the biggest of all the Villarreal Penyas , and many of them wore their green and white tops .
The whole day was carried out in the excellent spirit required by the new model of football relationships pioneered by the Villarreal Celtic Submari , based on respect and affection .
10,000 invaders but not a single arrest , no aggression or drunkenness , only good spirited camaraderie .
an amazing performance by amazing people , on e that has impressed and captivated all Spain
The invasion was the brainchild of Villarreal CF President Fernando Roig , who previously had his mental health questioned for being the only man in the world to believe a team from a town of 50,000 could have 20,000 season ticket holders .
That impossible dream became a reality in 2008 and has been repeated several times since .
In his latest miracle , Roig conceived of and subsidised the invasion , at a cost reliably estimated to be around 150,000 euros .
At 15 euros a head it was a magnificent investment in his continuous dream of producing a club ‘ owned ’ emotionally if not financially , by the community .
Not one of that 10,000 army are ever likely to desert Villarreal .
In a stroke all the damage , despair and disillusion caused by last year ’s avoidable relegation was wiped away to be replaced by a burning sense of “ our special team ” are doing it again
In June 2011 Villarreal had finished 4th in La Liga , qualifying for the Champions League for the third time .
They also were semi-finalists in the Europa League making it a hat - trick of semi-final appearances in an amazing 8 consecutive seasons in European club football .
They had a squad packed with talented world class players and a young manager of great intelligence and ability .
Twelve long months later , in June 2012 , Villarreal CF were out of La Liga , relegated after a season of disaster and maladministration .
The whole poignant story of how that eminently avoidable relegation happened , when they were only in the relegation positions for the last 180 seconds of the season , is available in a GGW special report that makes sad and sorry reading .
Was that relegation the end of the Villarreal miracle ?
And would the Yellow Submarine do as bitter Burriana supporters had been predicting for years , and sink swiftly down through the lower ranks of Spanish football back to the natural level of 5th tier football appropriate for the size of their population ?
Sunday ’s invasion of Barcelona was the second last confirmation that the resounding answer to both these questions is that the miracle of Villarreal CF is still on - going .
The Villarreal supporters stayed true to their own club .
If 20,000 season ticket holders for a club in La Liga from a town of 50,000 population was indeed one of the true miracles of world football , then for a Second Division club to have around half as many is in many ways an even greater and more impossible miracle .
But they did it .
All season the motto has been “ Tornarem ” – They will return .
The Miracle requires nothing less .
To have a manager like Pellegrini was a major ingredient in the Villarreal miracle .
And he showed with Malaga , taking them to within 2 minutes of a Champions League semi-final , just how much of a miracle worker he is in his own right .
The Villarreal Holy Trinity of Fernando Roig , Llaneza and Fernando Roig Negueroles lost the plot after Pellegrini ’s departure and made a series of disastrous and often inexplicable appointments , before and after relegation , including swinging bizarrely from a too old manager to a too young manager within days of relegation .
But finally they resorted to their first principles and got it right with Marcelino Garcia , a manager in the Pellegrini Villarreal mould , a top class manager and a top class man .
He has taken a squad that is , frankly , poor by recent Villarreal standards , to a position where they are 90 minutes from an automatic return at the first attempt , an essential requirement for keeping the Villarreal miracle alive .
Many clubs from towns almost as small as Vila - real have had their moment in the sun , a season or two in La Liga .
None have managed to return immediately after the inevitable relegation .
Yet once again Villarreal are about to break the mould .
Saturday 8th June is going to be another exhilarating chapter in the story of the Villarreal CF miracle .
The Madrigal Stadium will be filled to its capacity as the whole population of the town gather to witness the third promotion in their recent history .
A victory against third in the table Almeria will guarantee promotion .
Even a low score draw , 0 - 0 or 1 - 1 , will see Villarreal promoted .
Even if they fail to achieve that , there will be a promotion play - off contest involving Girona , Alcorcon and Las Palmas that Villarreal would be strongly favoured to win .
But the logic of the Villarreal miracle is that Saturday will see promotion confirmed and celebrated .
On Sunday GGW will provide a full report on the Almeria game and the aftermath , which will surely be joyous celebration of a return to La Liga .
After the emotional excitement and consolidation of last Sunday it is surely unthinkable that the script can produce anything other than further confirmation that the Villarreal miracle is still in full play , and that for season 2013 - 2014 , a town of 50,000 happy inhabitants will once again have over 20,000 season ticket holders welcoming the big Spanish clubs as equals .
Once the euphoria of confirmed promotion is over , there will be a time for a more sober consideration of whether Villarreal back in the La Liga can repeat the glorious achievements of the ten magic years from 2002 - 2011 when Villarreal were the 4th most successful club in Spain and the 12th most successful club in Europe .
But for now , for Saturday 8th June it will be enough to be a part of another glorious and unforgettable chapter in the Villarreal CF miracle .
TORNAREM

A Lebanese - American woman has beaten 50 other contestants to be crowned Miss USA .
Rima Fakih is the first Muslim and immigrant to win the coveted beauty pageant title .
The 24 - year - old was selected by a panel of celebrity judges including real estate entrepreneur Donald Trump , who also is one of the organisers of the annual event , which was held in Las Vegas , Nevada .
According to US news reports , Fakih 's family moved to America while she was a baby .
She was raised in New York City where she attended a Catholic school .
In 2003 her family moved to Michigan .
She told pageant organisers her family celebrates both Muslim and Christian faiths .
Fakih nudged out first runner - up Miss Oklahoma to claim the title .
She will represent the US in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Las Vegas later this year .
The Detroit Free Press newspaper reported that a large crowd gathered at a restaurant in Dearborn , which has a large Arab - American community , to watch the contest and cheer on Fakih .
" This is historic , " Imad Hamad , regional director of the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee , was quoted as saying .
" This shows the greatness of America , how everyone can have a chance to make it . "
Another Dearborn resident , Zouheir Alawieh , told the Free Press : " This is the real face of Arab - Americans , not the stereotypes you hear about .
" We have culture .
We have beauty .
We have history - and today we made history . "

" If you want a nigger for neighbour , vote Labour " was the 1964 slogan of Tory candidate Peter Griffiths .
Griffiths won his election by a 7.2 % margin .
The British National Party later used it themselves .
The message resonated with many voters because the sudden influx of immigrants was quickly changing the character of the nation and some felt their Anglo - Saxon culture was threatened by immigrants .
What 's changed today ?
The obviousness of the message .
These days , the BNP web page features smiling white people with the slogan " Putting Britain FIRST ! "
If you check the essays , you 'll find a justification for stopping immigration — " we should n't be taking doctors away from the third world because it 's unethical . "
Convenient .
The more things change , the more they stay the same .
Before you call me a racist , remember — it 's worth making record of because it shows how many Britons were thinking at the time .
Hiding history is a terrible idea .
Node hate .
There was a strange moment last week during President Obama 's speech at Cooper Union .
There he was , groveling before a cast of Wall Street villains including Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein , begging them to " Look into your heart ! " like John Turturro 's character in Miller 's Crossing ... when out of the blue , the POTUS dropped this bombshell : " The only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we 're proposing are those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny . "
The Big Secret , of course , is that every living creature within a 100 - mile radius of Cooper Union would fail " this scrutiny " -- or that scrutiny , or any scrutiny , period .
Not just in a 100 - mile radius , but wherever there are still signs of economic life beating in these 50 United States , the mere whiff of scrutiny would work like nerve gas on what 's left of the economy .
Because in the 21st century , fraud is as American as baseball , apple pie and Chevrolet Volts -- fraud 's all we got left , Doc. Scare off the fraud with Obama 's " scrutiny , " and the entire pyramid scheme collapses in a heap of smoldering savings accounts .
That 's how an acquaintance of mine , a partner in a private equity firm , put it : " Whoever pops this fraud bubble is going to have to escape on the next flight out , faster than the Bin Laden Bunch fled Kentucky in their chartered jets after 9/11 . "
And that 's why this SEC suit accusing Goldman Sachs of fraud is really just a negotiating bluff to give Obama 's people some leverage -- or it 's supposed to be , anyway - - according to the PE guy .
He dismissed all the speculation that the fraud investigations would turn on other obvious villains like Deutsche , Merrill , Paulson & Co. , the Rahm Emmanuel - linked Magnetar and so on .
" You do n't get it , Ames .
Even Khuzami , the SEC guy in charge of the Goldman case , is a fraud ; the fucker was Deutsche 's general counsel when they pulled the same CDO scam as Goldman .
You have no idea how deep this goes . "
And it 's clear that a lot more people here are aware of how fundamentally rotten things are but they 're not willing to face the big fraudonomics bummer yet , preferring instead to stick with specific accusations .
My position on this was , " Good , throw the book at those crooks too , I do n't see what the problem is here . "
This was exactly what I argued a week ago , during a verbal slapfight with that acquaintance of mine .
We were making a scene in a Midtown yuppie restaurant , arguing over just how much damage Wall Street had caused , and what to do about it .
His position was indefensible , and he knew it , so he switched tactics :
" OK Ames , which bankers would you throw the book at ?
Because you 're arguing that they 're all guilty .
So which ones do you go after ?
Two of them ?
Three ?
Half of them ? "
" Every last one of them .
Lock 'em up in one of their private prisons . "
" Not gonna happen , Che . "
" Che ? Me? Listen , Scarface , I 'm about law and order .
Do n't any of you PE degenerates believe in that anymore ? "
" OK , here 's the deal , Che .
I 'm going to walk you through this nice and slow so that even an agave - sweetened hippie like you can understand this .
Stick with me , this is gonna be a little complicated .
Ready ? "
And so he began .
" Let 's say the government decides one day , ' You know , we oughta listen to Che here , let 's throw the book at every firm and every executive that our people can make a case against .
Because you know , gosh , it 's all about rule of law and blind justice , just like Che says . '
OK , so now this means indicting just about every serious player in finance , so they take down Goldman Sachs , they take down Citigroup , JP Morgan , BofA ... and they also serve all the big funds who are at least as guilty , if not more .
So they shut down Pimco , Blackrock , Citadel ... maybe they indict Geithner and Summers , haul in some of Bush 's crooks ... right ? "
" Too bad they do n’t serve popcorn here , this is getting good . "
" OK , now guess what you 've just done ?
You 've just caused the markets to completely tank .
Remember what happened after the Lehman collapse ?
Remember how popular that made every politician in Washington ?
Still wondering why they coughed up a trillion bucks ?
They were scared for their lives ; that 's why they voted for that bailout .
You 'd have done the same goddamn thing .
But if we go after everyone guilty of fraud and theft , the market crash this country would see would make 2008 look like Sesame Street .
Open that can of worms labeled ' Fraud ' and the whole fucking economy collapses .
You may as well prosecute people for masturbating .
No one will know where the fraud investigation stops and who will be charged next -- everyone will try to cash out , and the markets will tank to zero .
And guess what happens when the markets tank to zero ?
Every fucking American with a retirement plan , or an investment portfolio , or a 401k - - every state pension plan in the country , every teacher 's pension fund , every fireman 's pension -- every last one of them will be wiped out .
That 's what the Lehman collapse taught us . "
" Us ?
It did n't teach anything but that this country is run by maniacs . ”
" Jesus H. Christ , Ames– you 're even more clueless than the idiots who managed the Lehman collapse .
I mean , did n't everyone get it how badly those idiots screwed up with Lehman ?
It was the biggest screw - up this hemisphere has ever seen .
You had Secretary Paulson and Fed Chief Bernanke scratching their asses not knowing what to do , so then they go , ' OK , we 're supposed to be a free market economy , and we 're supposed to be the Republicans -- let 's try something different for a change since nothing else is working .
Let 's go out on a limb and actually give this " free market " thing a whirl .
Who knows ?
Maybe the " free market " really works the way we always say it does .
Nothing else seems to work , let 's let the free market decide Lehman 's fate .
Maybe corporate - socialism is n't the answer . '
So they hung Lehman out in the free - market , and BAM !
The .
Shit. Hit. The . Fan .
No shit , dudes -- the free market is for suckers , did n't your daddy teach you idiots that ?
Not only did Lehman collapse -- everything collapsed ; confidence in the entire system collapsed .
And here 's what I 'm trying to explain to simpletons like you :
Our economy is just a confidence game .
Do n't ask me how it got this way , do n't care . "
I tried saying something insulting to him , but he just talked right over me , lurching forward baring his laser - whitened teeth .
" I 'm sure you have the answer , you and Ron Paul and all the other pot-smoking libertarian do - gooders have it all figured out .
But what I 'm saying is , no confidence means end of the confidence game .
That 's what Lehman showed .
Every single player in finance suddenly had to face the fundamental problem -- this whole fucking economy is built on fraud and lies and garbage .
So when Lehman collapsed , every single player panicked , going , ' If Lehman was nothing but a Ponzi scheme -- and I know what I 'm running is a Ponzi scheme -- holy shit , that means everyone else is running a Ponzi scheme too !
Run for the exits !'
No one trusted anyone else , everyone pulled out , and the entire global economy collapsed just like that .
And that meant your parents , my parents , every teacher , every fireman , every person in the country going into retirement , every price on every asset -- wiped out .
" And here 's what I 'm trying to get you to understand :
In the grown - up world , when an entire country 's savings accounts are wiped out because of some do - gooder and his law books and his Thomas Jefferson ' What about free and fair markets ? ' crap , that is a big problem -- people do n't give a fuck about Jefferson and ' free and fair markets , ' they just want their savings to be worth something .
And people are right : Jefferson was an imbecile .
He should have been a folk singer , not a Founding fucking Father .
But that 's another issue that 's over your head -- the point is , the guy who destroys this economy because it's ' the right thing to do ' will have to flee for his life , and whatever president or political party was in power when that decision was made will be out of power for the next 200 years .
That 's why Washington panicked and passed ' the bailout , ' they did n't want to be the fools whom all the Ponzi victims blame for tanking the Ponzi scheme , so they broke the glass and pumped up a newer , bigger Ponzi scheme .
It was an expensive 14 trillion dollar lesson in , ' Stay the fuck away from free - market experiments , assholes ! '
How naive are you people to actually believe that ' free market ' crap ?
The problem is when people in power are stupid enough to listen to guys like you : all the do - gooder libertarians and the do - gooder free - market Republicans who forgot that they 're supposed to lie .
Hello ! "
" Libertarian , me ?
Since when was I ever a libertarian ? "
" That 's my point : Fools like you do n't even know who you are anymore .
They forgot that they 're supposed to lie about all that libertarian free - market shit , keep it far the fuck out of policy .
But instead of just lying about free - markets while secretly propping up Lehman , the idiots actually tried pulling off a ' free - market ' miracle , and we had to pay $ 14 trillion just to find out what I could have told them for no fee at all , which is : ' Hey , assholes , you 're supposed to be hypocrites , OK ?
You 're supposed to be two - faced free - market liars , not libertarian Quakers !
You 're not supposed to believe in anything -- your job is to get up in front of the public and lie about free markets and the rest .
Period .'
" That 's it , how fucking hard is it ?
Look , watch my face :
Say one thing out of one side … and do the other out of the other side .
Got that ?
Let everyone else whine and cry about , ' Ooh , that 's not fair , ooh , that 's a bailout , that 's socialism , that 's corruption . '
That 's what losers do -- they whine .
You , for example , Che - - you whine all the time , and look at you …
Can you pay the bill for this meal ?
Is there a libertarian on earth who can afford to buy a decent meal in Manhattan ?
And now , look at me : I 'm a hypocrite .
Hell yes I am !
I lie every day of my life , I lie to myself in my sleep .
Hell , I 'm lying to you right now , in fact I do n't even know what the fuck I 'm saying anymore because I 'm so used to lying .
And yet -- who 's the guy with the black card ?
Who 's the one who 's going to pick up the check tonight ?
Guys with power , guys like me , we lie .
You got that ?
' Lie ' as in ' My Lai ' the massacre -- as in , ' My Lai you long time , me so free - markety . '
You distract the dumbshits with free - market B.S. because hey , for whatever reason , that 's what the public likes to hear , it does n't really matter what lie you feed them so long as it's the lie that puts them in a trance .
And then behind the scenes , you do the very opposite :
You fix the game , you cover up this problem here with those funds there , you move shit around , you skim budgets and you subsidize the system , you cover up the bad shit and once in a while throw a has - been to the wolves to keep the public entertained -- that 's the way the system works , and anyone who 's an adult understands that .
And everyone who does n't understand that can go form an online libertarian chat group and complain with all their little libertarian friends about free markets and Jekyll Island and ' Wahhh !
It 's not not fair , waahhhh ! ' "
" What 's with the libertarian accusation ? "
" It 's just that you all sound the same to me .
Libertarians , hippies -- is there really a difference ?
You all whine alike : ' It 's not fair , man !
Ooh !
You can't do that , it 's fraud , it 's corruption , ooh no ! '
Or : ' It 's the income inequality , man ; Goldman Sachs controls us all man ; it 's socialism for the rich ; it 's all too scary for my retarded 5 - year - old libertarian brain ! '
Seriously , anytime I meet libertarians like you --"
" Listen - - I 'm not a fucking libertarian , OK ?
I want free handouts .
How clear do I have to make this ?
Me--handouts .
Me--Big Government .
I want to collectivize your productive cash , because I am a resentful parasite .
Are you capable of processing a single word of what I 'm saying to you , Spaz ? "
" Uh - huh , sure , whatever .
Here 's the thing : I think it 's great that you and your friends memorized Road to Serfdom in between Star Trek episodes -- no really , I 'm happy for you .
Yeah , we 're all so proud .
But here 's the thing :
We grown - ups are really , really busy now trying to sort out the free - market mess you made with that Lehman move of yours .
Yeah , so why do n't you run along to your libertarian chat rooms and have your little debates about Jekyll Island and the gold standard , because it really means a lot to us .
And report back to me as soon as you have it all figured out , m'kay ?
Just get the fuck out of my face and leave the adults alone . "
It got a lot more vicious and personal than this , but when our verbal slap - fight ended -- and he paid the bill - - I thought about what he said , and it made a lot more sense .
Fraud has become so endemic in this country that it 's woven its way into America 's DNA , forming a symbiotic relationship that can't be undone without killing off the host .
If they push it just a little too hard , the entire American economy could crash , asset values could tank , and that means tens of millions of extremely pissed off retirees and Baby Boomers .
As the Wall Streeter put it : " Whoever is responsible for bursting this latest bubble by exposing all the fraud -- and tanking all the markets -- will not only be out of power for at least a generation , but they 'll all have to get radical reconstructive surgery on their faces and seek political asylum somewhere remote .
No one wants to be that guy , and that 's why it 's not going to happen . "
That may be true , but all bubbles to eventually burst , all Ponzi schemes do collapse .
The only question is when .
For those of us not on the verge of retiring , the sooner we have this day of reckoning and get it over with , the better .
Fraudonomics : 10 Fun Fraud Facts
Ever since I got kicked out of Russia and forced back home , I 've been collecting all kinds of news articles about fraud , in a document file titled " America Is Russia . "
Here 's a little taste of the wonderful world of American Fraud :
1 ) . Accounting Fraud : Last year , America 's leading banks were insolvent .
They had tens or hundreds of billions in losses on their books , and the only way to wipe those losses out would be to either a ) own up to the mess , raise enormous amounts of money on top of all the bailout money ; or b ) get out a big fat eraser , and wipe those losses off the books as if they never existed .
The first option was nice and all , but a real hassle .
So Geithner and Larry Summers chose Door Number Two : Accounting Fraud .
They forced the FASB to accept a rule - change in the accounting methodology called " mark - to - model " which let banks decide how much their assets were worth , rather than letting the markets decide .
So if for example a BofA owned a complex security called " Orion Butt Fungus " that was worth 5 pesos on the open market , but BofA was too broke to go out and raise 5 pesos to cover that loss , under the new accounting rules , the government told BofA that rather than pricing " Orion Butt Fungus " at what the market will actually pay for it , why not first ask , " How much would BofA like ' Orion Butt Fungus ' to be worth , in a perfect world ? ' "
If BofA answers , " Doyee , gee I dunno , how about $ 500 million ? " then under the " mark - to - model " accounting rules , BofA could now value " Orion Butt Fungus " at $ 500 million , and voila !
Their problems are over .
That was n't so hard , was it ?
Suddenly , BofA looks like it knows how to pick winners !
And no one 's going to second - guess them , because everyone else is mark - to - modeling their " Orion Butt Fungi " too !
The end result : under the old rules , BofA would have had to raise money just to cover its debts , sort of like you and me have to do , and that 's just a lot of money going to waste .
But now that its portfolio is so profitable , BofA has a much easier time raising money , which it uses to pay ginormous bonuses to its executives .
2 ) . Big Pharma Fraud .
Remember that scene early in Fight Club , when Edward Norton explained his job , when it was more profitable to let a car defect go and pay whatever lawsuit settlements come from the deaths , and when it 's better to recall the cars because the number of deaths will result in too many lawsuits ?
This is humanitarian do - gooder stuff compared to the savage real - world fraud - for - profit model that drives America 's drug companies .
It 's really simple and it goes like this : the more fraud a drug company commits , so long as it's off - the - scale fraud with the most horrible consequences for the victims , the drug company 's profits always outdo the criminal fines and lawsuits by factors of 20 , 30 , 100 ...
It 's as simple as that .
Because the billion in penalties here or the two billion in class action lawsuit settlements there are always far less than the tens of billions you earn from pushing harmful drugs on unsuspecting idiots .
To wit : Between May 2004 and March 2010 , a handful of top drug companies like Pfizer , Eli Lilly and Bristol - Myers paid over $ 7 billion in criminal penalties for bribing doctors to prescribe drugs for unapproved uses , with sometimes deadly consequences .
However , as a Bloomberg report noted , the fines are always a fraction of the profits -- Pfizer alone paid almost $ 3 billion in criminal fines since 2004 , yet that was just one percent of their total revenues ; Eli Lilly got busted bribing doctors to prescribe a schizophrenia drug , Zyprexa , to elderly patients suffering from dementia , even though company - run clinical trials showed an alarming death rate of 31 people out of 1,184 participants ( double the placebo rate ) .
Whatever -- the market for elderly dementia patients meant billions in extra revenues .
So Eli Lilly continued pushing Zyprexa on the elderly for another four years until it the Feds busted them .
Eli Lilly got hit with $ 1.42 billion fine , but that was peanuts compared to the $ 36 billion it earned on Zyprexa sales from 2000 - 2008 .
To make it happen , the drug companies buy off all the checks and balances : lawsuits revealed the enormous bribes they pay to doctors , and even America 's medical journals are so corrupted by drug company influence that they 're no longer reliable as much more than hidden advertisements , according to a recent UCSF study .
Medical journals are 5 times more likely to publish " positive " drug reviews than negative reviews , and one - quarter of all clinical trials are never published at all , leading doctors to prescribe drugs assuming they have all the information .
The result : prescription drugs kill one American every five minutes ... while Americans pay more for drugs than anyone in the world , spending a total of $ 12 billion on drugs in 1980 to spending $ 291 billion in 2008 - - a 1,700 % increase .
America is ranked only 17th in the world in life expectancy .
3 ) . Alan Greenspan : Fraudonomics Maestro .
America 's central banker from 1987 - 2006 once told a do - gooder regulator not to fuck with the bankers ' fraud schemes , because in Greenspan 's mind , fraud was not a crime and did n't need to be regulated .
Then Greenspan forced the regulator , Brooksley Born , to resign .
Just in time for his next and final act as Central Bank chief : from 2001 - 2004 , Greenspan pumped up the biggest housing bubble in human history by holding rates down to nothing , while touring the country promoting the glories of subprime and Alt - A mortgages .
Then in late 2005 , when the bubble was ready to burst , Greenspan tendered his resignation and switched over to the other side , signing lucrative contracts with three investment firms all of which bet big against gullible American homeowners , and reaped billions .
First , Greenspan signed up to work for Deutsche Bank , which is being sued for securities fraud for selling an Abacus - like CDO to a Warren Buffett - owned bank , M&T ; Greenspan also worked for Pimco , which earned $ 2 billion in a single day in September 2008 , when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized with Greenspan 's lobbying help ; and lastly , Greenspan went to work for Paulson & Co. , the hedge fund that raked in $ 1 billion off the same Abacus CDO deal that brought the SEC fraud suit against Goldman Sachs .
It 's an unusually perfect record for Greenspan , given his atrocious forecasting record at the Fed .
It recalls the old Greenspan circa 1984 - 5 , when he worked as a lobbyist for Charles Keating trying to push regulators off his back and vouching on the record for Keating 's character ... Keating was eventually jailed for fraud in the worst savings and loan collapse of all .
4 ) . Municipal Debt Fraud .
America's $ 2.8 trillion municipal bond market is rife with fraud of the sort you 'd expect in an emerging tinpot economy : opacity rather than transparency , plenty of corruption and kickbacks , resulting in decimated budgets and services cutbacks in communities across the country .
The problem all stems from way the bonds are issued these days : instead of holding open tenders , nearly all are the result of backroom deals .
Back in 1970 , only 15 percent of municipal bond contracts were awarded through no -bid contracts ; last year , 85 % of muni bond deals were assigned in no -bid , non-transparent agreements .
Studies show that no -bid bonds invariably cost municipalities more than bonds resulting from open tenders .
So far , fraud and corruption charges have been leveled against state employees and city councilors in Florida , New York , New Mexico , Alabama and California , to name a few .
Muni bond defaults soared from just $ 348 million in 2007 to $ 7.4 billion in 2008 -- that 's an increase of 20 times– with growing numbers of cities , counties and states on the verge of bankruptcy .
5 ) . Journalism fraud .
The Washington Post got caught whoring out their venerable editorial staff to corporate lobbyists for anywhere from $ 25,000 to $ 250,000 a date , depending on the access .
The Atlantic Monthly admitted to TalkingPoints Memo that it routinely sold access to its editorial staff for cash .
As for business journalism , all sorts of articles and studies have asked the obvious question : " How did every mainstream business outlet miss the financial collapse of 2008 ? "
Among all the self - flagellating mea- kinda - culpas , you wo n't find the word " fraud " in their answer .
Speaking of business journalism and fraud , The Business Insider , one of the top business news blogs , published a pair of articles defending Goldman Sachs against the SEC fraud charges .
The author of the articles defending Goldman Sachs is Business Insider 's co-founder and editor , Henry Blodget .
In 2003 , Blodget himself was charged with securities fraud by the SEC for repeatedly misleading clients into buying stocks of companies that in private emails Blodget referred to as " piece of shit . "
Under the terms of Blodget 's settlement with the SEC , he agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry , and he paid $ 4 million in fines and disgorgements .
Since he is not barred from the world of business journalism , Blodget was able to post an article last Friday headlined : " HOLD EVERYTHING : The SEC ’s Fraud Case Against Goldman Seems VERY Weak . "
6 ) . Fraudonomics K - 12 .
If you want your kid to grow up to succeed in a fraud - based economy , you need to teach him the ABC 's of cheating starting at a young age .
This is one area where America 's schools are n't failing their students .
Cheating is so rampant in schools that nowadays if the student does n't cheat on his exam , chances are his teacher or administrator will cheat on his test for him .
One in five elementary schools in Georgia are currently being investigated for tampering with the students ' standardized test scores -- although suspicious patterns of erasing and remarking answers showed up in half of the state 's elementary schools .
In California , as many as two - thirds of its public schools admitted to fudging its students ' standardized test scores .
A survey of graduate school students found that 53 percent of business school grad students admitted to cheating , more than any other grad school discipline .
Overall , up to 98 percent of college students today admit to cheating , compared to just 20 percent who cheated in 1940 .
7 ) . Boardroom Fraud .
Corporate America 's boardrooms are stacked up these days in tight , intertwined relationships that turn public companies into crime scenes , plundering money from unsuspecting shareholders and divvying up the loot among the directors and top executives .
In 2008 , Chesapeake Energy 's stock price collapsed from $ 74 per share to $ 9.84 , wiping out $ 33 billion in shareholder value .
The CEO , Aubrey McClendon , gambled and lost 94 % of his stock in the company on a margin call , personally losing about $ 2 billion .
So what did the board of directors do ?
They voted to award McClendon $ 112 million for 2008 , the highest of any CEO in America .
Shareholders were outraged , calling it a " bailout , " and several pension funds tried suing Chesapeake , but the courts in Oklahoma blocked the lawsuits .
That 's because Aubrey McClendon is sort of the George Bush of Oklahoma - - a spoiled fuck - up with a rich and powerful granddaddy -- Robert Kerr , former governor and senator , and founder of Kerr - McGee -- meaning plenty of VIP connections for the loser grandkid .
So on Chesapeake 's board , you had Aubrey 's cousin , Breene Kerr ; Frank Keating , Republican ex-governor of Oklahoma whose son Chip ( and Chip 's wife ) works for Chesapeake ; Don Nickles , Republican ex-Senator of Oklahoma who co-funded with Aubrey the Republican anti-gay marriage campaign in 2004 ; Richard Davidson , the former head of Union Pacific , whose corrupt board of directors lavished Davidson with tens of millions in bonuses and a $ 2.7 million per year pension when he retired ...
Now multiply a board of directors like this by the sum total of " Corporate America " and you get …a corrupt , tin-pot corporate culture masquerading as a civilized First World corporate culture .
That 's us .
( You can read about this problem in an excellent new book Money For Nothing : How The Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions . )
8 ) . Corrupt credit rating agencies .
The only way big institutional investors like pension funds could justify buying a piece of the Orion Butt Fungus CDO pie was if ratings agencies like S&P or Moody 's gave it a top - notch seal of approval : AAA rated , with a little star on the forehead for good behavior .
And in the world of fraudonomics , good behavior looks like this email from a Standard & Poor ratings analyst in December 2006 :
“ Rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monster _ the CDO market .
Let ’s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters . ”
The happy ending to this story is that a huge percentage of thieving scum like this emailer saw their hopes become reality : they got wealthy and retired before the CDO market crashed in a trillion - plus dollar heap of shit .
And if they did n't retire , even better -- because bonuses in 2009 were soaring , thanks to the always - gullible American taxpayer .
9 ) . Regulatory Fraud :
In the OTS , OCC , Fed , pension benefit guaranty agency and of course the SEC , where whistleblowers were routinely ignored because the regulators were too busy painting their monitors while surfing sites like www.fuck-my-wife.com.
10 ) .
Judicial Fraud : Juvenile court judges in Pennsylvania took millions of dollars in kickbacks from privately run prisons in exchange for sentencing thousands of innocent kids to juvenile prison terms .
Chronic on - the - bench masturbation is running rampant : an Oklahoma judge was accused of using a penis pump on the bench , while nearby in Texas , a Harris County judge masturbated and ejaculated on a defendant 's hand .
Speaking of Texas , the entire juvenile prison system there was turned into a sex abuse racket involving Texas state officials–over 750 official complaints about prison administrators molesting or raping underaged inmates in all 13 juvenile facilities had been officially logged between 2000 and 2007 .
The list goes on and on .
Hell , even our literature was corrupted with fraud : James Frey 's addiction " memoir " A Million Little Pieces turned out to be A Million Pieces of Bullshit , the biggest literary fraud of our time .
Fooled readers sued , Oprah chewed him out and Frey is now a bestelling " fiction " author .
This is just scratching the surface , but you get the point .
We ’re way past the point of redemption .
No wonder everyone ’s dreaming of a violent apocalypse to wipe the slate clean , and take us away to another plane where everything would be better .
Anything but this .

Lawyers vs. Pirates
Somali pirates have not exactly had a banner month .
Last week , 11 pirates charged with firing on two U.S. Navy warships were hauled into a U.S. federal court in Norfolk , Virginia , where they could be sentenced to life imprisonment .
Other Navies have also captured their share of buccaneers , including the French , who nabbed six , and the Spanish , who took another eight .
Dozens of ships from various countries are currently patrolling the Gulf of Aden and parts of the Indian Ocean , looking to round up marauders .
Unfortunately though , better ( albeit still very imperfect ) enforcement is leading to its own headaches .
Yes , it looks great for the United States and other countries to be tossing more and more pirates into the brig .
But the problem of what to do when the pirates land there is turning every pirate - hunter into a scholar of international law , and may make all the heightened security look a bit useless .
At least in theory , there should be no legal ambiguity about putting pirates behind bars .
Pirates , after all , have been regarded from time immemorial by the Law of Nations ( jus gentium ) as enemies of the entire human race , subject to the universal jurisdiction of any state that could get its hands on them .
That spirit was codified in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea , which has been ratified by 160 countries ( albeit not by the United States ) .
And the U.N. Security Council has worked to shore up the international legal framework even further .
Two years ago , a resolution authorized states cooperating with Somalia ’s largely moribund Transitional Federal Government to " enter the territorial waters of Somalia for the purpose of repressing acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea , in a manner consistent with such action permitted on the high seas with respect to piracy . "
But the devil is in the details .
Many countries either lack the right legal code to dub piracy a criminal offense or the procedural provisions to do so .
Even in countries with the right laws are on the books , conducting successful prosecutions can be extremely difficult .
There are few lawyers skilled in the minutiae of piracy law , gathering evidence at sea is logistically very hard , and transporting witnesses from the Gulf of Aden is no small task .
The United States is about to learn this lesson now with the trial of Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse , the sole survivor of the four - man pirate gang who attacked the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009 and held Captain Richard Phillips hostage for nearly four days .
In fact , to avoid a complicated trial , prosecutors may allow him plead guilty to a lesser offense .
Up until now , Kenya and the Seychelles have taken the majority of the caught pirates , thanks to memoranda of understanding they signed with the anti-piracy fleet .
But over the last year , they have simply reached their limit .
Their judicial systems are overburdened as it is .
It ’s not just a matter of funding , although that has been one hold up :
The two countries simply do n’t have enough local prosecutors and defense counsels capable of handling these complicated cases .
And in the case of Kenya , the country ’s own restive ethnic Somali and Muslim populations were growing antagonized by a seemingly endless parade of Muslim Somali prisoners captured by Western warships .
All the legal hoopla meant that very few pirates actually made it to court .
According to one U.S. tally , some 706 individual pirates were encountered by naval vessels of the ad hoc counter - piracy coalition between August 2008 and December 2009 .
Eleven of these were killed resisting arrest and another 269 turned over for prosecution .
Just 46 have been convicted so far and 23 acquitted .
All together , that means that nearly 60 percent of the pirates encountered were simply released .
This week , the U.N. Security Council stepped in once again , unanimously adopting a Russian - sponsored resolution on the matter .
The resolution requires the secretary - general to report back with options for prosecuting and imprisoning pirates , including the creation of special international piracy courts .
If countries ca n’t or wo n’t try the pirates , then darn it , the U.N. will .
The United Nations proposal is well - meant , but it may never come to fruition — or if it does , it may be too late for the current crop of pirate - hunters to take advantage .
The secretary - general ’s recommendations are still three months away and their implementation is still further in the horizon .
And if past internationalized criminal proceedings are any indication , the courts will take several years to actually set up — and that ’s assuming that the political will and money can be found to do so .
( The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , for example , cost $ 376 million just for 2008 and 2009 . )
Meanwhile , despite all the international community ’s efforts , the pirates are still plying their trade .
Just last week , they pulled one of their most daring heists to date , sailing some 1,200 nautical miles from the Somali coast — right past the naval task forces led by the United States , the European Union , and NATO , as well as the independently commanded Chinese , Russian , and Indian flotillas — to seize three Thai fishing boats along with their 77 crew members .
In terms of distance offshore and sheer number of hostages taken , the raid broke all previous records .
For the buccaneers , the equation still works out in their favor : exceptionally high rewards — in January , a Greek - flagged tanker , the MV Maran Centaurus , was ransomed for a record $ 7 million — traded for an extremely low probability of ever being prosecuted , much less convicted and sentenced .
No wonder the pirates just keep on coming .
Back in the year 2000 , then - Devils coach Larry Robinson came into the locker room , hot - headed and pissed off with the way his team played .
The Devils , down 3 - 1 to the Flyers in the Eastern Conference Finals , were one step away from elimination .
Wanting to make his point known , Robinson kicked a garbage can across the locker room , hammering home his point that the Devils were better than their played showed .
That moment became a famous one in Devils history , as the team turned its play around and won three straight , becoming the first team since the NHL expanded to come back from a 3 - 1 series deficit .
Ten years later , the Devils face the same situation .
The Flyers are leading the series , 3 - 1 , and the Devils have been outplayed in three of the four contests .
Coming into tonight , the team needs to find a spark .
That may have come from general manager Lou Lamoriello .
According to Star - Ledger reporter Steve Politi , Lamoriello went down to the visiting locker room after the Devils ’ uninspiring 4 - 1 loss Tuesday night .
The general manager , angry at his teams play , lit into the coaching staff .
He got so angry , he picked up a jar of jelly and threw it at the wall .
The jelly jar smashed , with its contents covering the locker room .
While none of the players were in the room , it got Lamoriello ’s message across – this is a team built for a deep playoff run , not a one - and - done playoff surprise .
It ’s these moments of frustration we have n’t seen from any of the players .
And , while they ’ve remained largely positive , it ’s refreshing to see someone in the organization get just as angry as the rest of us .
But the incident differs from Robinson .
Remember , Robinson did this in front of the players , getting their attention .
Lamoriello did this only in front of the coaches , so it ’s a smaller audience .
But I think it had the same meaning .
This is the head of the team .
Lamoriello controls what players sit in that locker room next season .
When the head man is n’t happy , no one should feel particularly comfortable .
While it did n’t have the shock factor for all of the players , this should still get the players fired up .
As I said , this is the guy who controls the contracts of the players in the locker room .
He expects results , and these players are n’t delivering .
The Devils should make a mental note with this .
Lamoriello ’s anger not only affects the coaches , but it has a trickle - down effect .
I would expect this to be a contributing factor to a more spirited performance tonight .
Hell , maybe if the Devils win the series , we can bookmark the “ Jelly Jar ” incident as another great locker - room outburst in Devils ’ history .
President Hugo Chavez threatened once again today to expropriate Venezuela ’s privately owned banks if they do not start immediately to cooperate with the country ’s development by financing the regime ’s social works .
“ Either give credit or give me the bank .
I will pay you later , I will see how I pay you , ” the president said during a live transmission via state - owned VTV broadcast from the Tuy IV aqueduct project .
Chavez told Environment Minister Alejandro Hitcher that he should accelerate the Tuy IV project by securing a credit from state - owned banco de Venezuela to finance the purchase of more construction machinery .
But immediately Chavez reversed course and told Hitcher to secure the loan from a private bank .
“ If the banks wo n’t give you a loan , tell me and I ’ll take charge , ” he added .
Yesterday , Chavez threatened to “ infiltrate ” the Internet to “ capture ” the “ speculators ” that he claims are responsible for weakening the parallel market bolivar to BsF 8.20 per dollar for buyers as of 12 May , the day that the legal “ permuta ” ( swap ) market shut down .
Chavez also deployed security forces last night including , reportedly , national intelligence service ( Sebin ) agents on raids against what regime officials described as “ illegal ” currency brokers .
At least one person was arrested .
The security sweep was looking for the bloggers who publish the parallel market ’s price online , which technically is illegal and punishable with jail time .
Hugo “ It ’s Not My Fault ” Chavez apparently believes that a handful of bloggers are responsible for the currency ’s plunge in the parallel market .
LOOOOL !!
The “ permuta ” market stopped operations on 12 May because the National Assembly was rushing to approve reforms to the Ley de Ilicitos Cambiarios on 13 May .
Normally it takes 48 hours to settle currency trades in the “ permuta ” market , which means that any trades made on Wednesday 12 May would not have been settled until Friday 14 May , one day after legislators were expected to reform the law .
Any trades settled on 14 May would have been illegal .
What happens now ?
Monday is a bank holiday in Venezuela .
But the coming week should be interesting .
The reforms approved by the assembly technically have put the grey market ( i.e. brokers who were getting their forex from Pdvsa or directly from the Central Bank ) out of business , unless they ’re friends of Central Bank President Nelson Merentes .
The reforms approved on 13 May also say that the Central Bank now will manage a swap market trading between a floor of BsF 5 and a ceiling of BsF 7 per dollar .
Good luck with that .
Holding the BsF within this band will require the Central Bank to sell beaucoup dollars that it does not have because the regime has been looting the country ’s foreign exchange reserves since it took control of the bank .
But the fight within the regime continues between Merentes and Planning , Economy & Finance Minister Jorge Giordani .
Merentes argues that any legitimately constituted brokerage firm with a minimum paid - in capital of BsF 15 million ( almost $ 3.5 million at the BsF 4.30 / $ official FX rate ) should be authorized to operate in the “ permuta ” market .
But Giordani is urging Chavez to take a radical approach that includes shutting down the “ permuta ” market completely , zero banks and brokers , and centralizing all forex trading in the regime .
Is Giordani crazy ?
“ Yes , ” says one of the very few real bankers in Venezuela , without an instant ’s hesitation .
The reforms approved last week weres less stringent than many feared , so it appears that Merentes won the first round .
But the bout between Merentes and Giordani may just be warming up , and given the president ’s propensity for always taking the more radical approach whenever he can get away with it , there is substantial cause for concern .
Chavez said just hours ago that in his “ humble opinion ” Venezuela does n’t need any private financial brokerage firms because they ’re all owned by rich people who manipulate the currency speculatively and cheat the poor .
The president also pledged that in a few days more he would produce the “ mathematical proof ” that Venezuela does n’t need any financial brokerages at all .
But no matter how Chavez distorts the numbers , they wo n’t add up .
The problem is that there are n’t enough dollars in the market at present to satisfy normal demand on a daily basis .
It takes between $ 60 million and $ 80 million per day to sustain the economy ’s basic , normal needs , says former Central Bank chief economist Jose Guerra .
That ’s $ 300 million to $ 400 million per week , or $ 15.6 billion to $ 20.8 billion per year .
In a healthy economy with a robust private sector , a well - managed oil industry and other strategic industries ( steel , aluminum , etc. ) operating efficiently , there would be more than enough hard currency flowing into Venezuela to do away completely with the official multi-tier exchange rate system , dissolve Cadivi and thereby make the “ permuta ” market unnecessary .
But this is Bolivarian Venezuela , where everything that the regime intervenes collapses within a year of being seized , whether it ’s a state - owned or privately owned asset .
Pdvsa ’s crude production and refining capacity have collapsed .
The basic industries in Guayana look more every day like the rusting pile of scrap called Planta Centro near Puerto Cabello .
Over 50 % of the private manufacturing sector has disappeared in the past decade .
The expropriation of millions of hectares has destroyed the country ’s capacity to feed itself .
At least 1 million Venezuelans with the means , talents and skills needed to prosper and grow elsewhere have left the country .
What ’s left ?
Only the much - diminished Bolivarian petro-state that depends on oil export revenues from abroad and tax revenues from within , but oil exports have collapsed and Seniat ’s tax revenues are dropping steadily because the regime has destroyed the private tax - paying bases of the economy .
However , the regime also is running out of hard currency , even though oil prices have risen considerably since their lows in 2008 - 2009 .
Since nothing bad that happens to Venezuela is ever the fault of Hugo ’s Robolution , it means that the innocent must be punished : brokerage firms , the banks , the Venezuelan people …
multiple versions of this comic happened , and I guess nothing really good came out of it , oh well .
Germany Bans Naked CDS Against Euro - Zone Government Bonds : Tentative First Steps in Europe ’s Self - Defense Against Zombie Bankers and Hedge Fund Hyenas
Webster G. Tarpley
TARPLEY.net
May 19 , 2010
Germany and Europe have now made some promising initial steps in the direction of their necessary self - defense against the depredations of those zombie banks and hedge fund hyenas who have been organizing a massive speculative attack on Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Italy with a view to destabilizing the euro and perpetuating the world hegemony of the troubled US dollar .
The most significant of these moves is the ban imposed unilaterally by the Merkel - Schäubele Christian Democratic - Liberal German coalition government to outlaw the use of high risk derivatives , specifically credit default swaps ( CDS ) , for the naked shorting of government bonds which are denominated in euros .
This means that Europe ’s largest economy and the Frankfurt financial center – the biggest in continental Europe – will be off limits for speculators using these toxic CDS , which are issued by entities which have not fulfilled the legal requirements for underwriting insurance .
This website has repeatedly urged a ban on credit default swaps .
Germany Activates Ban On Naked Credit Default Swaps On Euro - Denominated Government Bonds , Naked Shorting of Financial Stocks
According to wire dispatches , the details of the German move are as follows .
“ Germany ’s securities market regulator Bafin … banned naked short sales of certain securities , in particular the government bonds of the 16 countries that use the euro , ” according to AFP .
Bloomberg specified : ‘ Germany … prohibited naked short - selling and speculating on European government bonds with credit - default swaps … .
The German ban , which lasts until March 31 , 2011 , also applies to the shares of 10 banks and insurers including Allianz SE and Deutsche Bank AG , financial regulator BaFin said ….
The step was needed because of “ exceptional volatility ” in euro - area bonds , BaFin said . ’1
The German measure takes aim at the type of derivative which has been massively used by hedge funds and banks to speculate against the bonds of Greece and the other countries of the European Union ’s Southern tier .
Naked shorting of these bonds using credit default swaps occurs when a speculator places a derivatives bet against such bonds without simultaneously owning the bonds .
Speculators using naked credit default swaps thus cannot plead that they are merely hedging or protecting themselves against the risk on bonds which they own .
The ban unquestionably blunts one of the sharpest weapons in the speculative armory currently being used in the massive assault on Greece and the other Mediterranean EU states .
Also banned is the traditional form of naked short sales of the stocks of a list of German financial and insurance institutions .
This needs to be expanded to a blanket ban on naked short sales in Germany , and generalized to the rest of the EU , with the appropriate additions in each country .
The goal must be to deter speculation , break the back of the hedge fund assault , and obtain a period of stability for the implementation of further reforms , including a Tobin tax on financial turnover and an economic recovery strategy not dependent on savage austerity and budget cutting measures , but rather on infrastructure , credit creation , and the creation of tens of millions of productive jobs .
It is now imperative that the German ban on naked CDS speculation be imitated and if possible outdone by the other European states , and especially those under immediate attack by international speculators , including Greece , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Iceland , Latvia , and others .
If Merkel and Schäubele can take these measures , then surely any government can .
France must also recognize that failure to outlaw CDS will constitute a crippling handicap for their national economy going forward , and therefore match or go beyond the German ban .
One way to do this would be to extend the ban to all credit default swaps without exception , since these always amount to the illegal issuance of insurance policies in contravention of the existing legislation on this point .
CDS were the key to the failure of AIG , and have cost US taxpayers some $ 180 billion and counting .
Another type of derivative which has proven itself extremely toxic and dangerous over recent years is the collateralized debt obligation or CDO .
In particular , synthetic CDOs – meaning CDOs – which contain other CDOs –have played a central role ( along with CDS ) in the ongoing Goldman Sachs - Abacus scandal and are prominent candidates for prohibition .
French President Sarkozy has repeatedly strutted and postured as the great enemy of international financial speculators , but his pathetic response to the German CDS ban was initially to stress that France would not join in the ban .
Sarkozy thus cuts the sorry figure of a euro - wimp .
The British hastened to reassure the hedge fund pirates that they would continue to be welcome in the City of London .
Portugal , by contrast , reiterated their own ban again short sales , which they intend to maintain .
Other European countries are doubtless observing developments with a view to joining the winning side .
During the first day that the German ban was in place , the euro first declined as a result of short covering by speculators , and then rose by about two US cents , thus indicating a temporary stabilization .
Several weeks will be needed to evaluate how much the Germans have obtained by means of the current ban .
It is already clear that , once embarked on the road to be regulation , Germany and Europe must quickly strike further blows against derivatives and against hedge funds to prevent the speculators from regrouping .
German Government Demands Tobin Tax As Price of Greek Bailout
Having made the foolish decision to support the $ 1 trillion bailout of the euro and the euro - zone banks , the Merkel government now feels impelled to shift part of the cost of this effort onto the banks which are responsible for creating a crisis in the first place .
Merkel also needs the CDS ban as cover when she requests that the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) join in voting for the trillion dollar bank bailout .
Merkel and Sarkozy would have been much better advised to steer clear of the bailout , and rather escalate counterattacks against the zombie banks and the hedge fund hyenas mounting the speculative assault on Greece , Southern Europe , and the euro itself .
Even so , the idea of a financial transaction tax or Tobin tax is unquestionably valid and should be instituted immediately .
If this is done with sufficient energy , it will soon become clear that there is no need for the bailout as such since the loan guarantees in the bailout will not be needed .
Aggressive regulation , in short , is far cheaper than bailouts .
According to wire dispatches from Berlin :
The financial sector must contribute to the euro - zone sovereign - debt rescue if Germany ’s share of the € 750 billion ( $ 924.6 billion ) package is to be approved in the lower house of parliament , the ruling coalition said Tuesday .
‘ We have agreed in the coalition committee that the government will be asked to campaign for a European , global contribution of the financial markets — this means a financial - transaction tax or financial - activities tax , ’ said Volker Kauder , parliamentary floor leader of the conservative coalition .
2
Of these two types of taxes , it is the financial turnover tax which is truly indispensable , although it could be supplemented by an additional tax on banks .
Here again , Merkel is trying to placate the strongly anti-bank sentiment of the German public and the Bundestag .
An effective financial turnover tax needs to be at least 1 % of all sales of stocks , bonds , foreign exchange , and derivatives , with the tax being calculated on the notional value of derivatives .
The Tobin tax should be instituted as a strictly national measure , so as to provide revenue for cash - strapped national budgets , and must on no account be transferred to the International Monetary Fund , World Bank , or European Commission .
European Finance Ministers Want Regulation of Hedge Funds
Given the obvious role of wolf packs of predatory hedge funds in creating the Greek crisis , the necessity of cracking down on these corsairs is also too obvious for the European authorities to ignore .
The European finance ministers have now approved new measures to regulate and limit hedge fund operations in the EU .
According to wire service reports :
in addition to disclosure obligations and leverage limits , new requirements in the EU legislation include restrictions on compensation for fund executives .
Perhaps the most contentious provision is an EU plan to put up hurdles to marketing of so - called third - country funds doing business in the EU .
Under one version of the legislation , non-EU hedge funds would need to get permission from each country in which they want to operate .
Under another version , third - country funds could get a ‘ passport ’ for access to all 27 EU nations , but only if they met requirements , such as voluntarily complying with the EU ’s risk and compensation restrictions .
3
The approval of these measures was an important defeat for the new Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , whose attempt to sabotage these minimal steps proved futile .
Osborne is motivated by the fact that 80 % of European hedge funds , including some of those leading the charge against Greece , are based in London .
Many hedge funds which are controlled from the United States are nominally based in the Cayman Islands , a notorious offshore paradise of money laundering and shady finance .
European Parliament Approves Hedge Fund Rules
Parallel to this action by the European finance ministers , the European Parliament has also approved its own regulations for hedge funds .
According to published accounts ,
the European Parliament approved new , tighter regulations for hedge funds and private - equity firms , rejecting complaints that the legislation would make it too difficult to offer offshore funds to European investors .
European Union finance ministers at the European Council are expected to approve their version of the legislation Tuesday night , kicking off what will likely be months of talks between the council , the parliament and the European Commission , the EU ’s executive arm , to hammer out a final version that will become law .
4
As a result of the ponderous and Byzantine EU bureaucracy , the approach of the finance ministers will have to be merged with that of the European Parliament , a process which urgently needs to be accelerated .
On Wednesday , CNBC showed hysterical London speculators warning that the German ban will mean a loss of liquidity and of the wonderful creativity of credit derivatives .
Later , a parade of hedge fund hyenas speaking from their conference in Las Vegas lamented the German government ’s moves , while conceding that they were all scrambling to reduce their risk exposure because of the public blowback against the looting of the world economy by hedge funds .

A great bit from the World - Herald :
“ I 've never used an ATM , so I do n't know what the fees are , ” Nelson said , adding that he gets his cash from bank tellers , just not automatic ones .
“ It 's true , I do n't know how to use one .
“ But I could learn how to do it just like I 've . . .
I swipe to get my own gas , buy groceries .
I know about the holograms . ”
By “ holograms , ” Nelson clarified that he meant the bar codes on products read by automatic scanners in the checkout lanes at stores such as Lowe 's and Menard's .
“ I go and get my own seating assignment on an airplane , ” Nelson said .
“ I mean , I 'm not without some skills .
I just have n't had the need to use an ATM . ”

The ancient squid hunted using its two long tentacles
The ancestors of modern squid may have existed half a billion years ago - a lot earlier than previously thought .
In a new study , Canadian researchers identified a previously unclassifiable fossil that was long believed to belong perhaps to the shrimp family .
They called it Nectocaris pteryx - a small soft - bodied cephalopod with two tentacles rather than the eight or 10 seen in today 's octopuses .
The new survey 's results were presented in the journal Nature .
The findings make the ancestors of modern squid and octopuses at least 30 million years older .
Evolutionary biologist Martin Smith , the main author of the study , told PA news agency that the findings bring cephalopods much closer to the first appearance of complex animals .
" We go from very simple pre-Cambrian life - forms to something as complex as a cephalopod in the geological blink of an eye , which illustrates just how quickly evolution can produce complexity , " said Mr Smith .
The authors described Nectocaris as a kite - shaped creature that was flattened from top to bottom .
They say it was between two and five cm long and had large , stalked eyes .
The tiny animal is believed to have been a carnivore that hunted for prey with two long grasping tentacles .
It used a nozzle - like funnel under its eyes that could " swivel like a pivoted cannon " to jet itself around the ocean - just like modern squids and octopuses .
' Unclassified ' creature
Image caption Nectocaris was a small , kite - shaped creature
The fossil is n't a new find - it was discovered decades ago in the Burgess Shale deposits atop a mountain in Yoho National Park in British Columbia , Canada .
The Burgess Shale Formation is one of the world 's most famous fossil fields .
Scientists tried to describe the fossil for the first time in 1976 - but back then , they just were n't sure where it belonged on the evolutionary tree .
They dubbed it " unclassified " .
According to Jean - Bernard Caron , Mr Smith 's co-author , researchers originally thought the mystery creature could have been a relative of anything from a lobster to a fish .
But after Mr Smith , a University of Toronto PhD student , decided to re-examine the fossil together with 91 new specimens collected in recent years , scientists were finally able to give the animal its proper place in history .
Jeremy Roenick admitted harboring some lingering resentment over being traded by the Chicago Blackhawks almost 14 years ago , and that 's why -- if forced -- he would pull for the Philadelphia Flyers in a Stanley Cup finals series against the Hawks .
But he also admits that he thinks the Hawks will in fact win it all this season .
Roenick played the first eight of his 20 NHL seasons in Chicago before being traded on Aug. 16 , 1996 to the Phoenix Coyotes for Alexei Zhamnov and Craig Mills .
He said recently on a Philadelphia radio station that if forced , he'd root for the Flyers .
" I said if you had a gun to my head , I said I did have to [ root for the Flyers ] , " Roenick said on " The Waddle & Silvy Show " on ESPN 1000 .
" I did n't want to leave in 1996 .
If I have to choose , then I have to choose , that 's just what it is . "
Roenick currently is an analyst for NBC .
" I love Flyer fans , I love Chicago fans , " he said .
" Chicago was great to me .
Philly was great to me .
" I 'm not choosing anybody unless you put a gun to my head , and then I 'd have to have a little bit of a choice . "
The Hawks lead the San Jose Sharks 2 - 0 in the Western Conference finals .
The Sharks were the last of five teams for whom Roenick played .
Roenick said he'd also root for the Sharks against the Hawks .
" If you put a gun to my head , I got to go with the Sharks , " Roenick said .
" [ Sharks GM ]
Doug Wilson gave me the most unbelievable opportunity at the end of my career , to revitalize and finish on a high note .
" When the fans heard I was going to San Jose , they were like what are you crazy ?
What 's he going to do for us ?
And then I got there and they treated me like I was their second son . "

An artist 's impression of Velociraptor scavenging Protoceratops
A predatory Velociraptor has been caught in the act of eating another larger plant - eating dinosaur .
Palaeontologists have uncovered fossil fragments of Velociraptor teeth alongside scarred bones of the large horned herbivore Protoceratops .
The teeth of the predator match marks on the herbivore 's bones , suggesting Velociraptor scavenged its carcass .
The discovery is further evidence that predatory dinosaurs both hunted and scavenged their plant - eating relatives .
The find also helps validate another famous fossil discovery unearthed in 1971 .
This looks like scavenging as the animal would be feeding on the haunches and guts first , not the cheeks
Fossil co-discoverer Dr David Hone Known as the " fighting dinosaurs " , that fossil shows a Velociraptor and Protoceratops apparently locked in combat , with both dinosaurs having died at the same time .
Evidence of feeding by theropod dinosaurs , such as Velociraptor or Tyrannosaurus rex , are scarce in the fossil record and the fighting dinosaurs is the most dramatic example known potentially illustrating such behaviour .
Palaeontologists continue to debate the fossil and many still consider it possible that the two animals killed each other - the Velociraptor 's raptor - like claw is preserved lodged in the throat region of the much larger Protoceratops , which appears at the same time to be biting down on the predatory dinosaur 's right arm .
However , it is also possible that Velociraptor did not regularly eat Protoceratops .
Bite marks on Protoceratops bone Instead , the fighting dinosaurs could represent a chance encounter between the two species that escalated into a fight .
However , the new fossil discovery , published in the journal Palaeogeography , Palaeoclimatology , Palaeoecology , suggests that is less likely .
It provides further evidence that Velociraptor did regularly eat Protoceratops , either by scavenging those that had already died or by actively hunting them .
Dr David Hone of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing made the new discovery in Upper Cretaceous deposits at Bayan Mandahu , in Inner Mongolia , China .
Colleague Dr Jonah Choiniere originally found a mass of badly eroded Protoceratops bones .
Among them lay two Velociraptor - like teeth .
Velociraptor teeth match the bite marks Together with Dr Hone and colleagues Dr Corwin Sullivan and Dr Mike Pittman , Dr Choiniere analysed the fossils for bite marks .
The team found the Protoceratops bones were scarred in this way , and the bite marks matched the teeth found alongside .
The Velociraptor found at the site likely scavenged this particular Protoceratops , rather than hunted it .
" The marks were on and around bits of the jaw , " Dr Hone told the BBC .
" Protoceratops probably weighed many times what a Velociraptor did , with lots of muscle to eat .
Why scrape away at the jaws , where there 's obviously not much muscle , so heavily that you scratch the bone and lose teeth unless there was not much else there .
" In short , this looks like scavenging as the animal would be feeding on the haunches and guts first , not the cheeks .
DINO DISCOVERIES
Dr Hone and colleagues earlier this month announced the discovery of a close relative of the swift , predatory dinosaur Velociraptor Last week they also revealed a fossil " roadrunner dinosaur " , one of the smallest and most agile dinosaurs yet known
Last year , the oldest dinosaur burrows were found " The fighting dinosaurs suggests predation .
Combine the two and we have good evidence for both behaviours , " says Dr Hone .
" Animals like Velociraptor were probably feeding on animals like Protoceratops regularly , probably including both predation and scavenging . "
That is in line with the behaviour of many modern predators , as almost all living carnivores such as lions and jackals do both .
" It 's a question of degree , " says Dr Hone .
" Lions mostly predate , jackals mostly scavenge . "
In that regard , the new fossil find confirms what many researchers have long suspected about how predatory dinosaurs such as Velociraptor interacted with plant - eating dinosaurs .
" Even the most dedicated predator wo n't turn down a free meal if they chance across a dead animal with a few bits of meat still attached , and this looks like the case here , " says Dr Hone .

You could carry your iPad in a bag like a normal person .
But it'd be so far from your body !
Luckily , these new suits feature an iPad pocket inside the jacket , keeping it nice and close to your heart .

The suits , by Mohan Custom Tailors in New York , actually look pretty nice .
And according to their photos , you can't really see the iPad tugging half the jacket down when its inside , which is surprising ( and possibly a product of convenient positioning in the photos ) .
But still , you 'll be feeling that pound - and - a - half tablet flapping against your side all day as you walk , and that 'll get annoying fast .
Really , you can get a bag for it .
It 'll be OK in there , I promise !

Facebook 's latest privacy problem should raise a few eyebrows .
Facebook sharing " private " data in unexpected ( and occasionally unwelcome ) ways is nothing new , but this newest problem is unusual , in that it does something that Facebook 's lengthy ( and oft - updated ) privacy policy explicitly says should not happen : it shares private user information with advertisers .
The research originally describing the problem looked at more than just Facebook .
Many social networking sites , including LinkedIn , Digg , and Twitter , suffered the same leakage of personal data .
Of the twelve sites looked at by the researchers , the only one that did n't leak data to advertisers was the one already owned by an advertising company —
Orkut .
The private information was leaked to advertisers in a couple ways .
The most widespread problem was the HTTP Referer ( sic ) .
In general , every time a Web browser requests a page from a Web server , it sends the Web server the URL of the current webpage — the " referer " — in addition to the name of the new page .
This information is used for a number of purposes .
It 's useful to website owners as it allows them to know , for example , which search engines are providing most of their traffic , and which internal links within the site are being followed ( and by implication , which are n't ) .
This lets site owners know which parts of their design are useful , the kind of communities that are interested in their content , the search terms that people are using to find their pages , and so on .
Another popular usage scenario is to block certain requests if the referral comes from a different domain , to prevent bandwidth leeching .
If a Web server sees a request for an image but the HTTP Referer refers to a different site , indicating that the image has been linked or embedded on someone else 's webpage , it can block the request .
Generally , this information is harmless , because usually the referring URL is not personally identifying .
That 's because most URLs are n't customized for individual users .
Everyone performing the same search in Google will get the same URL for the results page ; everyone visiting a page here on Ars will visit the same URL , and so on .
The problem this causes with social networking sites is that often , their referring URLs do contain identifying information , such as the ID or username .
This makes sense — the entire point of these sites is that they are personalized and contain user - specific data — but it means that referring URLs become a whole lot more valuable .
To respond to this , Facebook uses — and has used for a long time — a redirect system for any link that takes users away from Facebook .
Instead of going directly to the page you want ( and hence using your profile URL as the referer ) , you are first directed to Facebook 's redirect page , with the URL http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=address-of-page-you're-going-to.
The redirect page them immediately forwards you to the intended page .
By doing this , Facebook ensures that the target site only sees the URL of the redirect page , and not the URL of your profile .
In this way , private data is stripped out .
Unfortunately , though Facebook does this for external links , the company was n't doing anything equivalent for ads embedded within Facebook pages .
Facebook contains third - party advertising , and each request for these ads included with it the referring URL of the page containing the ad .
The company has since modified the way ads are embedded and linked within Facebook , so they should no longer see a meaningful referer .
Facebook 's URLs also appear to be constructed differently than was the case in the past ; they place most information after a hash ( # ) symbol .
The portion of the URL after the # is meant to indicate an internal reference on the page , and these internal references are not sent as part of an HTTP Referer in any case .
This restructuring of URLs should provide a robust defense against data leakage through the HTTP Referer .
Twitter and Digg
The report described a similar problem on Twitter , but this one seems less clear - cut , and is arguably not a problem at all .
Twitter uses Google Analytics for tracking usage data , and as part of this , Twitter embeds an image hosted by Google Analytics , hence providing to Google the address of each page used .
However , Twitter URLs tend not to be personally identifying anyway .
Normally , the URL Twitter users look at is either just http://twitter.com/.
Though Twitter does have profile pages , these are usually visited by other people who are looking at what the profile page 's owner has tweeted .
In other words , I do n't normally look at ( or click links on ) http://twitter.com/DrPizza.
Other people might , but their name does n't get put into the URL , only mine .
As such , though the report criticized this as a source of data leakage , it 's hard to see why .
The only slight issue is that any links from private Twitter streams will include the Twitter username in the referral ; the privacy leakage in this seems to be negligible .
That said , Google Analytics is widely used , and it 's possible that other sites do use it in such a way as to cause a problem — but no problematic usage was actually described in the report .
The third problem concerned Digg .
Again , this was an area where there was the potential for a problem , but where the example provided in the report failed to actually demonstrate this .
The concern here was the way Digg used cookies .
Digg 's cookies store , among other things , the username of the logged - in user .
Any request made to digg.com will include that username cookie .

This can be done in two ways ; they can be linked to a single , specific domain name ( by specifying the full domain name in the cookie ) , or they can be linked to a domain and any subdomains .
Digg uses both types of cookie ; some tied to " digg.com " specifically , and some tied to " .digg.com , " meaning that any sub -domain can read the cookie .
This was a concern , because Digg uses a digg.com subdomain for certain tracking features .
z.digg.com is a third - party tracking server , but because it uses a subdomain of digg.com , it can see any cookies tied to " .digg.com . "
However , the cookie containing the username is specific to digg.com .
The z.digg.com tracking server hence has no access to it , so there is no information leakage .
The report appeared to be misleading on this point .
The example cited does have a URL that includes a Digg username , but it got there through visiting a user page — it 's there not because it 's leaking private details of the current user , but rather it 's reflecting the page they 're visiting , and as such mirrors the information found in the HTTP Referer anyway .
Again , there is the potential for a mistake to be made — if the digg.com cookie allowed subdomain access then the identity of the viewer would indeed be leaked — but that 's not a mistake that Digg actually makes .
So , the initial claims of the paper seem somewhat overblown .
The situation may be muddied somewhat by third - party applications ( which could potentially do things " wrong " even if Facebook et al. get them right ) , but it appears that in general , the social networking sites are n't routinely leaking personally identifying information to advertisers .
A number of sites are reported to be looking into ways to stop the more minor leakage — the data that , for example , the personal page being visited contains a link to a site — but this is a minor issue compared to the ability to track users directly .
One claim does look to have had some merit : Facebook probably was leaking information to advertisers , but does n't seem to be any more .
The Wall Street Journal 's writers contacted Facebook , and state that the company acknowledged the potential for leakage and has taken protective measures in response .
What makes this disquieting is that the way the HTTP Referer works — and the data leakage it can cause — is well - known .
Facebook has used redirections for off - site links for a long time , so it was certainly aware of the problem ; it just failed to apply a solution across the board .
Unlike other decisions the company has made , this almost certainly was n't deliberate , but it definitely shows a kind of recklessness .
Given the amount of data Facebook and other social networking sites contain about us , this kind of reckless behavior is distressing , and will no doubt fuel the small — but growing — trend of deleting your profile to put an end to privacy concerns .
Privacy is about more than having a bunch of checkboxes you can tick : it needs to be considered for every piece of development , or else these accidental problems will continue to arise .
Examples
In this example , we 'll create a small C program using tup .
The program itself will be completely useless , but hopefully you can use your imagination to see how you might use tup in a real project .
Let 's start with a typical " Hello , world ! " in C .
Since we 're using tup , you 'll want to create a Tupfile .ini file or run tup init at the top of the project , which in this example will be the tup_test directory .
Tup handles dependencies a little differently from other build systems .
In this example , we 'll show how the dependencies that you specify in a Tupfile work together with the dependencies determined automatically during the program 's execution .
Here we will show how to write a Tupfile to handle a fairly common use - case : an automatically generated header file .
Now our program grows beyond the confines of a single directory .
Here we 'll see how Tupfiles can share variables and :- rules .

Seven leading scientists have sent a letter to the United Kingdom 's Health Secretary , Andy Burnham , urging him to ban the use of the endocrine - disrupting chemical bisphenol - A ( BPA ) in products intended for use in feeding infants .
" We urge you now to adopt a standpoint consistent with the approach taken by other governments who have ended the use of BPA in food contact products marketed at children , " they wrote .
BPA is used to make hard , clear plastics for products such as baby bottles , food containers and water bottles .
It is also used to make resins that line cans of food and infant formula .
Numerous studies have linked the chemical to reproductive harm , especially in fetuses and infants .
It has also been shown to increase the risk of heart disease , diabetes and cancer , and to cause cognitive damage and abnormal behavior .
The Canadian government has banned its use in baby bottles , a number of retailers throughout North America have pledged to stop carrying infant products that contain it , and some North American manufacturers have voluntarily ceased using it .
Like the U.S. FDA , however , the U.K. 's Food Standards Agency continues to insist that BPA is safe .
" Keeping BPA baby bottles on the shelves is not an option , " said Clare Dimmer of Breast Cancer UK .
" It should be very simple , if there is serious scientific evidence that a chemical in baby bottles could increase the risk of life - limiting illness , it should n't be used .
It is time government stepped in to ban the bottle .
" According to a recent poll , two - thirds of U.K. residents believe that the use of BPA in baby bottles should be prohibited .
" As a medically qualified pathologist and parent to an eight - month - old baby boy , I feel that it is essential for the government to heed our call for precautionary measures to limit exposure of BPA to very young children , " said Vyvyan Howard of Ulster University , one of the letter 's signatories .

It was not entirely clear how the ruling might affect detention policies for terrorism suspects caught outside Afghanistan or Iraq .
While the Obama administration has stepped up the use of Predator drone strikes to kill terrorism suspects and has relied on other countries , like Pakistan , to hold and interrogate suspects who are captured alive , it is not known whether the United States has directly captured anyone outside Afghanistan or Iraq recently — and , if so , where it has taken them .
A Justice Department spokesman , Dean Boyd , would not comment on the decision .
David Rivkin , who filed a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of the Special Forces Association urging the court to side with the government , said the ruling would have broad significance by removing doubts over whether the United States could capture and interrogate terrorism suspects without worrying about having to collect , in dangerous situations , evidence that would later stand up in court .
“ This is an excellent decision , ” said Mr. Rivkin , who was a White House lawyer in the administration of the first President Bush .
“ It has restored a considerable degree of sanity to what threatened to be a crazy legal regime that would have deprived the United States , for the first time in history , of the opportunity to capture and detain — outside of the United States , in theaters of war — high - value combatants .
That has been solved , and it will apply to many other situations in the future . ”
The case was brought on behalf of a Tunisian man who says he was captured in Pakistan in 2002 , a Yemeni man who says he was captured in Thailand in 2002 , and another Yemeni man who says he was captured in 2003 at another location outside Afghanistan that has not been disclosed .
( The government has disputed the second Yemeni ’s claim . )
The men ’s case was originally heard by Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court , an appointee of former President George W. Bush .
The Bush and Obama administrations had both urged Judge Bates not to extend habeas corpus rights beyond Guantánamo , arguing that courts should not interfere with military operations inside active combat zones .
But in April 2009 , Judge Bates ruled that there was no difference between the three men who had filed suit and Guantánamo prisoners .
His decision was limited to non-Afghans captured outside Afghanistan — a category that fits only about a dozen of the roughly 800 detainees at Bagram , officials have said .
In urging the appeals court to let Judge Bates ’s decision stand , lawyers for the detainees argued that reversing it would mean that the government would be able “ to evade judicial review of executive detention decisions by transferring detainees into active combat zones , thereby granting the executive the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will . ”
The Oregon Trail , well known road crossing the Rocky Mountains used by the settlers in the 19th century .
MECC made an educational game based on this memorable part on the USA story .
The player must cross the oregon trail and fight against the difficulties the settlers had .
Hunting for food , trading supplies , survive LOTS of possible deaths ( snakes , typhoid , dysentry ... ) .
Should you succeed in your journey , your points will be based on your profession , the number of settlers still alive , your remaining cash and much more .
Oregon Trail was played by a lot of American people born in the eighties and the game stay into memory as one hard , unforgiving and unbeatable game .
Some family would eventually play the game together and children in school would even make competition over who got the farthest before dying in the game !
Who remembers games they played as a kid ?
I for one remember the only one we played in elementary school , Oregon Trail .
It was choppy and by today 's standards is something an elementary school student could create , but when I was playing it , it was the most entertaining game available .
Now today 40 years after the game was created , kids are still playing it .
It was actually created to be an educational experience of how people migrated to the west to settle .
Me being on the west myself , found this very significant .
I personally would recommend this game to any child as a fun way to get education .
This is an awesome game I just wish they would make a remake .
This game is still pretty popular so a remake would probably do pretty well !
I 'm imagining the hunting only with mechanics more like a cabelas game only with muskets and with next gen graphics and complex colony building systems , allowing Sim City style colony building , all with next gen graphics on a pc , think about it ...
And with a free modding tool it would become classic , like ratchet and clank , with mods allowing you to make so that you just farm for food and the hunting mechanics are used for combat with the british or it could be totally remoded to make it a halo colonizing game on different planets instead of to America with the combat i mentioned earlier
Some local club owners appeared unlikely to comply .
One of them , Oleg Proskokov , told the same newspaper that he planned to hold a number of rock events in the near future and that any officials who tried to interfere would get a " punch in the face . "

Cloppenburg Betrunkener rast in Gruppe von Mai-Wanderern
Ihn störten die Feiernden auf der Straße , also trat er aufs Gaspedal : Im Landkreis Cloppenburg hat ein junger Mann seinen Wagen mutwillig in eine Gruppe gelenkt , die auf dem Weg zu einem Volksfest waren .
Mehrere Menschen wurden teils schwer verletzt .
Isolate recent values on the First American index of property values and a national fall is not difficult to anticipate .
Since I began in August to forecast a continuation of falling values , frequently I met with anger , disbelief , myopia .
This week I wanted to take a closer look .
So I pulled out one of the best number sets , and applied my crude math in exactly the same way I always do , but I did a close up on five years of data before and after the peak .
The result is the chart you see below .
Rorschach has his own interpretation , but I see a fall of either nine percent ( Z ) or 19 percent ( Y ) if you go by crude trends ( see Z & Y above ) .
Either one is plausible .
Values could also take off the other way and shoot up to the moon , but the chart is more a downer than an upper .
Recently the trend is again down , although it would be almost impossible to learn this from media coverage .
Values have fallen in five of the last six months by this index .
If values fall , it hurts the finances of current owners , but it makes housing cheaper .
This is not an afterthought .
Very few would deny that a competitive economy may need cheap houses to create affordable workers who can live well on lower wages .
I tell you without question :
We need cheap housing to improve our competitive advantage .
***
Everybody thinks rising home prices are good , but rising property prices may make many of us unnecessarily poorer by making it harder for future buyers and renters to pay the bills .
I wonder if the poor are hurt most by a policy which artificially supports housing prices ?
If true , then the Fed and the Treasury are taking dramatic action against the most vulnerable .
The affordable housing people arguing in favor of foreclosure prevention are arguing against their own goals .
The crisis in Greece points to the problems which arise when there is too much debt .
The back story on Greece is that national bankruptcy may be unavoidable .
If they have too much national debt , they will not pay it back , even with a heroic bailout and radical cuts .
We have the same crisis here , but in housing and mortgage debt , and we have been lying about our own bankruptcy .
Values bubbled irrationally in a pattern far worse than any of the last 120 years ( see above ) .
Massive unaffordable mortgage debt financed a flim - flam scheme .
A national fall in prices of 31 % proves that the housing market was a lie .
Yet mortgage balances are only two percent less than their peak .
What makes sense : A fall in home prices of 31 % or a fall in mortgage balances of 2 % ? ( see above ) ?
There is probably no greater lie in our economy today than the divergence in values of homes and mortgage balances .
Our economy is not fixed until this is fixed , and yet nobody talks about fixing it because nobody sees it or considers it .
***
The key is uniting the value of real estate and the income of property owners and renters .
What we need is a rational capitalist market .
We need a market price driven by private actors .
The Fed , the Treasury , and Fannie & Freddie have destroyed the free market in housing and by doing so they are orchestrating poverty and misery for any person who needs a place to sleep at night .
Real estate has an established price over time .
That has been proven by Case Shiller .
Their study of 120 years of data offers obvious evidence .
They are on record saying housing is a stable asset with no change in value from 1890 to 1990 .
And all the other screamers who say pricing is different now simply argue based upon imagination and prejudice .
I say go with the hard data .
I say Case Shiller is right .
I say return to the trend lost in 1990 .
Values must fall .
I estimate by an additional 22 percent .
***
We should all be cognizant of the positive value of falling prices .
If unemployment is high , and demand for labor requires a reduction in pay , then make housing cheap and we kill three birds with one stone :
We reduce the cost of labor , put labor to work , and maintain the material standing of the wage earner .
Who argues against this ?
By their actions , all of the powers that be in Washington D.C .
As you think about this you may come to embrace a fall in prices as the right thing to do on so many levels .
For 20 years the most difficult bill we pay every month has been made much more difficult .
And in case you had n’t noticed , we ’re having a problem competing against cheap labor all over the world .
There ’s no end in sight to the stupidity of government actions meant to stop prices from falling .
Such is the folly and consequence of men and women with power playing games they do not understand .
Go ahead and hang the bankers , but make sure to burn the economists at the stake .
They are safe because they can calculate in their head if the heat of the fire is deadly .

Prominent Muslim scholars have recast a famous medieval fatwa on jihad , arguing the religious edict radical Islamists often cite to justify killing cannot be used in a globalized world that respects faith and civil rights .
A conference in Mardin in southeastern Turkey declared the fatwa by 14th century scholar Ibn Taymiyya rules out militant violence and the medieval Muslim division of the world into a “ house of Islam ” and “ house of unbelief ” no longer applies .
Osama bin Laden has quoted Ibn Taymiyya ’s “ Mardin fatwa ” repeatedly in his calls for Muslims to overthrow the Saudi monarchy and wage jihad against the United States .
Referring to that historic document , the weekend conference said : “ Anyone who seeks support from this fatwa for killing Muslims or non-Muslims has erred in his interpretation .
“ It is not for a Muslim individual or a Muslim group to announce and declare war or engage in combative jihad … on their own , ” said the declaration .
Click here for my full report on it .
The declaration is the latest bid by mainstream scholars to use age - old Muslim texts to refute current - day religious arguments by Islamist groups .
A leading Pakistani scholar issued a 600 - page fatwa against terrorism in London early this month .
Another declaration in Dubai this month challenged the religious justification for violence used by Islamist rebels in Somalia and calling for peace and reconciliation there ( more on that here ) .
Fatwas may not convince militants , but they can help keep undecided Muslims from supporting them , the scholars say .
Because Islam has no central authority to define the faith in all its details , militants who hijack it by twisting texts for their own purposes need to be confronted by moderates who cite chapter and verse to refute them .
Outside the Muslim world , declarations like these risk the fate of trees that fall in the forest when nobody ’s listening .
This conference was held in Mardin , a medieval town near the Syrian border , and the media present were mostly Turkish and Arabic speakers .
It got good coverage in the Turkish press and Al - Jazeera television ran extensive footage in Arabic .
But getting the message out to the rest of the world , including the majority of Muslim who speak neither Arabic nor Turkish , means getting it out in English .
Mustafa Akyol , an Istanbul journalist and blogger known to readers of this blog , was there writing in English for the Hürriyet Daily News .
And one of the main speakers was Aref Ali Nayed , another name regular FaithWorld readers will recognise , whose Kalam Research & Media theological think tank provided the quick English translation of the final declaration .
They helped complement the basic information provided by the conference organisers .
Akyol explained the significance of Ibn Taymiyya ’s famous fatwa like this :
“ The way Ibn Taymiyya denounced the Mongol rulers of his time , who claimed to be Muslim but fell short of implementing the Islamic Shariah , has provided justification for some radical groups to denounce Muslims they view as less strict as ‘ apostates ’ .
“ The jurist ’s division of the world into the ‘ Abode of Islam ’ and the ‘ Abode of War ’ – and his view that a place is not really a part of former unless it implements Shariah – have also inspired fundamentalists dedicated to establishing ‘ Islamic states ’ in predominantly Muslim countries . ”
He also quoted Mustafa Ceric , the grand mufti of Bosnia , on the conference theme of the need for a new interpretation of old texts .
“ Most ulema [ Islamic scholars ] have a problem , ” he said .
“ They know the classical texts very well , but they do n’t know the contemporary world that much . ”
During Ibn Taymiyya ’s time , there was no concept of international law based on human rights .
“ Today the world is so different .
The Bosnian Muslims who took refuge in European countries such as Sweden found there the rights and privileges that they would not exactly find in Muslim countries …
There is no such thing as an Islamic state .
There are only states that provide justice , freedom and security and those that do not . ”
Nayed , who like Ceric is a leading voice in the Common Word group for Muslim - Christian dialogue , developed this theme of the new world context for Islam in his address “ Duties of Proximity : Towards a Theology of Neighbourliness ” ( PDF here ) .
It ‘s an eloquent refutation to militants who dream of Islamising western countries or recreating a caliphate : “ Islam must never be conceived of merely geographically , because it is beyond geography …
We must never reduce the abode of peace to a worldly dar al - Islam , conceived of as merely a geographically distinct empire or state . ”
Rather than vilifying life in the West , Nayed said , Muslims must realise that “ it is a fact that today many liberal environments are actually more conducive to Muslim living and worshiping than many so - called ‘ Muslim countries ’ .
As a matter of fact many Muslims today are actually forced to move to non-Muslim countries because of political or economic insecurity .
At least up to 9/11 , and in many places , even after it , many ‘ non- Muslim ’ countries fare quite better than many so - called ‘ Muslim countries ’ , and even ‘ Muslim states ’ , in allowing Muslim living . ”
“ We must not see secular liberalism as hostile to Islam .
We must help secularisms mature to become more and more accepting of religious values in life .
Much has been lost because of the lumping together of all sorts of secularism under the negative generic rubric of ‘ almaniyya ’ ( Arabic for secularism ) .
A great deal of discernment and wisdom is called for in this regard . ”
What do you think of this declaration ?
Will it make a difference ?

Current law restricts health claims to drugs only
The FDA thinks walnuts are drugs

The Free Speech About Science Act
Help end FDA tyranny against food and supplement companies
( Natural News ) The Alliance for Natural Health , a nonprofit organization committed to protecting access to natural and integrative medicine , has recently come up with a Congressional bill designed to stop government censorship of truthful , scientific health claims about natural foods and herbs , and restore free speech to natural health .
The ( FSAS ) , also known as HR 4913 , will allow manufacturers and producers to reference peer - reviewed , scientific studies that highlight the health benefits of a particular food or herb that they grow or sell .
For too long , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) have blatantly censored the truth about food , herbs and dietary supplements .
These government agencies are supposed to be protecting public health and well - being , but they accomplish precisely the opposite by actively censoring the truth about natural products and working to keep the public ignorant about the health benefits of nutritional products .
It 's all part of the plan to prop up the profits of Big Pharma by eliminating the competition .
The FDA says , ridiculously , that only pharmaceutical drugs are capable of preventing or treating disease .
Even though this is scientifically false , the agency has structured the rules to categorize anything that treats or prevents disease as .
So if you eat walnuts , and those walnuts lower high cholesterol ( which they do ) , the FDA declares your walnuts to be " drugs .
" Existing law dictates that if anything is advertised as providing health benefits without the FDA 's approval , it 's automatically considered to be an " unapproved drug " , even if it 's a common , everyday food like walnuts , cherries , grapes or oranges .
Amazingly , references to peer - reviewed scientific studies are not allowed to be made by companies without permission from the FDA because the agency considers this to be an illegal health claim .
So if you sell walnuts , and your website merelyto published scientific studies that describe the cholesterol - lowering benefits of walnuts , then you can be threatened , arrested , imprisoned and fined millions of dollars by the FDA for selling " unapproved drugs .
"
If you flee the country , you can be then be listed on INTERPOL as an international fugitive wanted for " drug offenses . "
This is exactly what happened to Greg Caton , who was recently kidnapped from Ecuador by U.S. agents working on behalf of the FDA ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027750_Greg_Caton... ) , brought back to the USA against his will , and sentenced to federal prison where he remains to this day .
If you 're skeptical that what I 'm saying here is true , take a look at the warning letter the FDA sent to Diamond Food , Inc. back in February concerning the health claims the company had been making about its walnuts .
Diamond Food , Inc. , a large producer of nuts and nut products , had put some information on its website about the health benefits of walnuts ( which are rich in omega - 3 fatty acids ) .
Some of this information included the following statements ( all of which are verifiably true ) : 1 ) " Studies indicate that the omega - 3 fatty acids found in walnuts may help lower cholesterol ; protect against heart disease , stroke and some cancers ; ease arthritis and other inflammatory diseases ; and even fight depression and other mental illnesses .
" 2 ) " [ O ] mega - 3 fatty acids inhibit tumor growth that is promoted by the acids found in other fats ... " 3 ) " [ I ] n treating major depression , for example , omega - 3s seem to work by making it easier for brain cell receptors to process mood - related signals from neighboring neurons .
" 4 ) " The omega - 3s found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for the significantly lower incidence of breast cancer in Japanese women as compared to women in the United States .
" All of these statements are true and have been demonstrated in various scientific studies about omega - 3s .
In fact , the University of Maryland has a complete reference page about the benefits of omega - 3s that verifies the statements made by Diamond Food .
Sixty - five different scientific studies are cited on that reference page alone !
But apparently , because the agency wrote in its warning letter to Diamond that , " [ b ] ecause of these intended uses , your walnut products are drugs ... they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced conditions . "
It goes on to say that , " they may not be legally marketed with the above claims in the United States without an approved new drug application .
" When all was said and done , Diamond was essentially coerced into removing virtually all the truthful information about the health benefits of walnuts from its website in order to stay in compliance with the FDA 's ridiculous demands .
So when science discovers the amazing health - promoting and healing abilities of natural , whole foods , you are not allowed to actually tell people about it .
If you do , those foods automatically become unapproved drugs , according to the FDA , and they are subject to seizure .
This is how .
The agency is actually an ANTI - EDUCATION group ofwho want the American people to remain ignorant of the health benefits of natural foods and supplements .
What 's interesting about this recent Diamond walnut case is that , back in 2004 , the FDA ( sort of ) approved a request made on behalf of the California Walnut Commission to include information about the benefits of walnuts for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease
The petition to the FDA included references to scientific information that backs these claims ( which were largely rejected by the agency ) , but it did allow a modified version of the claim to be made that included the phrase " Supportive but not conclusive research shows ... " .
Some other details included a reference to eating a diet low in saturated fat .
But in the Diamond case , the FDA decided to launch an all - out attack on true health claims about walnuts , despite comprehensive evidence that they are extremely beneficial to your health in many scientifically - proven ways .
It 's important to note here that .
Sadly , this outrageously ridiculous and indefensible position has become the law of the land in the USA . , the FDA claims .
And the vitamins , minerals and phytochemicals in those foods haveon your body .
This impossible belief is what the FDA continues to maintain as " scientific " fact .
But it 's obvious to anyone with a couple of brain neurons still firing that the FDA 's position is .
Of course foods have beneficial health effects on the human body !
Foods contain more than mere calories ... they are storehouses of phytochemicals and nutrients that haveon the body .
It 's important to note that a new drug application is not the only way certain health claims can be made .
Similar to how the California Walnut Commission issued its request , producers and manufacturers can request permission from the FDA to make certain health claims about products , and the agency makes it sound as if it is more than willing to approve such claims as long as proper evidence is given .
But in reality , no matter how much evidence is provided to back a set of claims , it 's almost never enough for the FDA to actually approve them .
Omega - 3s are one of the most studied nutrients in recent years , but the FDA apparently considers all this research useless .
It hides behind all kinds of legal mumbo jumbo in defending its position to reject credible science about the health benefits of omega - 3s .
To anyone paying attention , it 's becoming abundantly clear that the agency is completely irrational in the way it approaches the regulation of health claims and the definition of a " drug .
" Based on its track record of how it handles truthful health claims , it 's also clear that the FDA does n't actually care about the truth .
The agency has decided that , and that 's the end of it .
So only those companies that complete its expensive drug application process will be granted permission to make health claims -- and the only organizations with the funding to do this are drug companies !
It 's sort of like the old :
Throw the suspected witch in a pond .
If she floats , she 's a witch and gets burned at the stake .
If she sinks , she was n't a witch ... may she rest in peace after drowning .
The test is rigged for failure by the " authorities . "
And yes , the FDA 's assault on dietary supplements is a metaphorical witch hunt .
Of course this is n't the first time the FDA has gone on a witch hunt to stop health claims from being made about healing foods .
Back in 2006 , the FDA demanded that 29 companies cease making claims about the health benefits of cherries
Of course all the claims were true and backed by scientific studies , but this did n't matter to the FDA or the FTC , which acts as the enforcement arm of the FDA .
The agencies threatened to take action against these companies if they did n't comply with removing the health claims , indicating that they would even go so far as to seek a court order to seize the products that were in violation .
An interesting fact about this case is that many of the scientific studies that supported the health claims being made were , another arm of the U.S. federal government .
Talk about a bureaucratic failure !
All of this seems almost too crazy to actually be true , but it 's all quite real , I assure you .
It happens all the time .
Millions of taxpayer dollars are spent trying to reclassify food as drugs , censor truthful health claims and rid the market of safe , healthy items like raw dairy products .
Meanwhile , drug companies are fraudulently marketing dangerous chemical medications that injure and kill milliosn of people every year around the world .
But these chemicals are , of course , " generally recognized as safe and effective " by the FDA .
Cherries and walnuts , in other words , are dangerous .
But statin drugs , antidepressants and rat poison blood thinners are all backed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Like almost everything else the FDA does , there 's a double standard in the enforcement of health claims .
Over at the Frito - Lay website , there are a whole lot of ridiculous health claims being made about Frito - Lay snack foods that the FDA does n't seem too concerned about .
Statements include the following , which are in reference to " how much good stuff goes into your favorite snack " : " Good stuff like potatoes , which naturally contain vitamin C and essential minerals .
Or corn , one of the world 's most popular grains , packed with Thiamin , vitamin B6 , and phosphorus - all necessary for healthy bones , teeth , nerves and muscles .
" Too bad all these ingredients areand can't be considered " healthy " by any stretch of the imagination .
The page goes on to claim that its frying oils are filled with " good fats " that help to lower cholesterol ( seriously , I 'm not making this up ) .
Somehow Frito - Lay , a division of PepsiCo , gets away with marketing its junk food snack products as healthy , making all kinds of ludicrous claims about them , but walnut and cherry growers are the target of FDA investigations about labeling fraud .
The message ?
Raw natural foods and non-processed fruits and nuts are bad for you , but fried snack foods , dead foods and processed foods are incredibly healthy .
In opposition to all common sense , this is the position the FDA now maintains .
Things are seriously out of control .
Thehas also written about the madness of this situation .

There is some good news , though .
My friends over at the Alliance for Natural Health have come up with a solution to take back our freedom to tell the truth about the health benefits of natural products .
It 's called the , orYou can read the entire legislative text of the bill at the following link :
The bill is only seven pages long , and you can read it fairly quickly if you want to .
Here 's a quick summary of its primary objectives with some added commentary :
1 ) Food producers and manufacturers , dietary supplement makers , and any others who sell or market natural health products will no longer be restricted from referencing and citing independent and respected scientific research that highlights the health benefits of natural products .
( Current FDA guidelines are in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution , which prohibits government restrictions on free speech , even those that relate to natural health .
) 2 )
Referencing valid research will no longer convert food and dietary supplements into " unapproved drugs " in the eyes of the FDA.3 )
Only legitimate research may be referenced , and guidelines for what is considered legitimate include studies that are conducted in accordance with sound scientific principles ( because natural health is not in opposition to science ; science actually supports the healing properties of foods and supplements ) .
4 ) The FDA and FTC will still be permitted to go after fraudulent claims , but they will no longer be able to censor the truth about healing foods and supplements .
As it currently stands , most Americans are unable to make responsible , informed lifestyle decisions about foods and supplements because truthful information is restricted by agencies like the FDA and FTC .
Mainstream society is flooded with drug advertising making all sorts of false claims , but true claims about natural products are routinely censored . , and one way to go about that is to support the .
Every American deserves access to the truth so that he or she can make informed lifestyle choices , and you can help make that happen by supporting this bill .
The Alliance for Natural Health has created a convenient legislative portal by which you can contact your Congressman and urge support for the bill .
Access the portal here : ( https://secure3.convio.net/aahf/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=529)To learn more about the bill itself , visit the following link :
In the mean time , keep on buying ( and consuming ) natural foods , medicinal herbs and truly natural supplements , because that 's where the real medicine in our world is found .
The FDA can try to censor theabout healing foods , but they cannot stop your body 's own innate healing process from being activated by those foods .
Eating healing foods , in other words , helps your body heal whether the FDA approves or not .

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre underwent arthroscopic surgery on his injured left ankle Friday morning .
Noted orthopedic specialist Dr. James Andrews operated on Favre at the Andrews Institute in Gulf Breeze , Fla. , where Favre and his agent Bus Cook were spotted by a handful of people .
Favre confirmed the procedure on his website .
" This is to confirm that I did have a procedure to remove some scar tissue and bone spurs from my ankle which had been bothering me for a period of time .
I appreciate your concerns , " Favre 's statement read .
Lars Vilks , a Swedish cartoonist whose sketch of the Prophet Mohammad enraged many Muslims , was head - butted while giving a lecture about freedom of speech , he said .
Mr Vilks , who depicted the Prophet Mohammad with the body of a dog in 2007 , said he was assaulted by a man sitting in the front row as he spoke at the University of Uppsala , about 70 kilometres from Stockholm .
" He head - butted me and I fell into the wall and lost my glasses , " Mr Vilks was quoted by news agency TT as saying .
He added he was unharmed .
A spokesman for Uppsala police said about 20 people tried to attack Mr Vilks after interrupting his lecture , adding that the police had to intervene to stop them .
Two people were detained .
Mr Vilks was not immediately available to comment further .
He says he has received death threats since his Prophet sketch .
In March an American who called herself Jihad Jane was charged with plotting to kill the Swede and using the internet to enlist co-conspirators .
In January , a Somali man was indicted for terrorism and attempted murder for breaking into the home of Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard and threatening him with an axe .
A cartoon by Mr Westergaard in 2005 which depicted the Prophet Mohammad with a turban shaped like a bomb sparked outrage across the Muslim world , with at least 50 people killed in riots in the Middle East , Africa and Asia .
Most Muslims consider any depiction of the founder of Islam as offensive .

Home Astronomy / The Big Bang Was an Explosion OF Space , Not IN Space
This is my fourth post for Just Science Week .
I think the thing that trips up most people when they think about the Big Bang , is thinking about it in terms of an explosion , like a supernova or a nuclear bomb .
This leads to some typical inaccurate assumptions .
Since the Big Bang , the universe has expanded from a central point .
The universe must be expanding into something , what ?
There was a time BEFORE the Big Bang .
These assumptions come from thinking about the Big Bang as a typical explosion , one originating from a single point and spewing matter out concentrically from there .
That ’s not what the Big Bang was .

The Big Bang was not an explosion of matter into space , rather it was an explosion of space ITSELF , and since space and time are interconnected , we really have to say it was an explosion of space AND time , or space - time .
So , the Big Bang was n’t an explosion of stuff like atoms or molecules , it was an explosion of a place and instance , it was the creation of when and where .
Before the Big Bang there was simply nothing , there was no ‘ where ’ nor was there a ‘ when ’ .
It does n’t even make sense to say ‘ before the Big Bang ’ .
I know , that ’s pretty trippy , so let me try stretch my writing skills to the absolute max and see if I can make this sound reasonably coherent .
To begin , clear your mind of any notion of an explosion .
The Big Bang was not an explosion , not of matter anyway .
The Big Bang occured , and at this moment , space and time are created .
Now , we can talk about where and when .
The notion of moment was born .
Next something really strange happens , the inflationary period .
In the smallest fraction of a second , the universe gets very big , very fast .
Driven by vacuum energy .
space and time are being stretched like a rubber sheet , there is no center .
Space and time and simply being created everywhere all at once within the boundary between where space and time is and where it is n’t .
That boundary is increasing .
The incredibly short inflationary period ends as the vacuum energy is converted to heat .
Driven by the inflation , the universe is set on its expansion .
The universe begins to cool , atoms and regular matter are created from what ’s left over when all matter - antimatter particles have wiped each other out .
All that remains in the stuff that will become the stars , galaxies , MacBooks and iPods .
By now , only 100 seconds have elapsed .
As the universe gets older and larger , things cool down enough so that stars , galaxies and the stuff we ’re all familiar with can form .
Read this for a little more detail .
This is incredibly simplistic , but what I want you to take away from this is that at no point was matter spewing forth from anything .
Space and time itself was being created first .
Ordinary matter ( atoms , molecules etc ) was created out of tiny imbalances of energy left over from the inflationary period .
It ’s a little humbling to think that everything we can experience , everything that makes us who we are , is a cosmic afterthought made possible by infinitesimal imbalances of energy from the greatest of all natural events .
No imbalances , no us .
If the number of matter - antimatter particles created by the vacuum energy that pushed the universe outward had been identical , the universe would be completely empty .
If anti-matter particles has outnumbered normal matter , we would be living in a completely different house .
So any universal boundary that exists ( an edge to the universe ) , is between place and time , and nothing .
Of existence and non-existence .
Of laws of nature and no laws of nature .
It is that boundary which is expanding and has no center .
It is the “ when ” and “ where ” that things can occur that is getting bigger all the time .
Imagine pulling a large rubber sheet with white dots on it from every direction .
All of the dots are spreading apart from each other everywhere , not from some central point .
From the perspective of each dot , all the other dots are moving away from it .
Outside of the sheet , nothing can happen , you ca n’t put stuff in there because there is no ‘ in there ’ to put it .
< Pause for a moment so you can smoke a doobie >
If everything in the universe is flying apart from everything else , this begs the question , Why are n’t the galaxies , stars , planets , the atoms in my body , also flying apart ?
Should n’t we all be slowly disintegrating as space and time expands ?
After all , there is space and time in between protons and electrons , is n’t that space increasing all the time as well ?
The answer is yes , but there are other forces at work at closer distances that fight against the expansion of the cosmos .
If those forces did n’t exist ( things like gravity and the strong and weak nuclear forces ) , then nothing could form to begin with .
It is those forces that create structure and beauty , and us .
For example , gravity keep atoms in a star together so they can shine , it also keeps stars clumped together in galaxies .
On a local level , other forces can counteract the expansion of the universe .
Chemical bonding and gravity keeps us alive .
These forces can’t hold out forever though .
Eventually the universe will win .
But for now , we have the upper hand .

FIVE female news presenters at the pan-Arab Al - Jazeera satellite television channel have resigned over conflicts with management over dress code and other issues , a journalist there has said .
" This collective resignation is not motivated just by the growing pressure on the presenters concerning their dress code , which was evoked by the media , " said the journalist , who asked not to be identified .
" The conflicts run much deeper , " the journalist added .
The news presenters who have reportedly quit are Jumana Namur , Lina Zahreddin , Lona al - Shibel , Julnar Mussa and Nofar Afli .
The Al - Hayat daily reported they had resigned in the past few days after petitioning management in January over repeated criticism from a top company official for allegedly not being conservative enough in their dress .
Management of the Doha - based channel said it would issue a response later .
Established in 1996 by the government of Qatar , Al - Jazeera has revamped the Arab media scene by departing from the traditional government - mouthpiece news style and providing wide news coverage , and becoming a trailblazer for many subsequent channels .
But its editorial line has been strongly criticised by Washington , which has accused the channel of becoming a podium for Islamist extremists , mainly in Iraq , where it has been banned from operating since 2004 .
The network has several channels , including Al - Jazeera English .
Western governments risk creating a new generation of Islamist extremists if they continue to support repressive regimes in the Middle East , the former head of the UN nuclear watchdog , Mohamed ElBaradei , has told the Guardian .
In his first English - language interview since returning to Cairo in February , the Nobel peace prize - winner said the strategy of supporting authoritarian rulers in an effort to combat the threat of Islamic extremism had been a failure , with potentially disastrous consequences .
" There is a need for re-evaluation … the idea that the only alternative to authoritarian regimes is [ Osama ] Bin Laden and co is a fake one , yet continuation of current policies will make that prophecy come true , " he said .
" I see increasing radicalisation in this area of the world , and I understand the reason .
People feel repressed by their own governments , they feel unfairly treated by the outside world , they wake up in the morning and who do they see – they see people being shot and killed , all Muslims from Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , Sudan , Darfur . "
ElBaradei said he felt vindicated in his cautious approach while head of the International Atomic Energy Authority .
He revealed that all his reports in the runup to the Iraq war were designed to be " immune from being abused " by governments .
" I would hope that the lessons of Iraq , both in London and in the US , have started to sink in , " he said .
" Sure , there are dictators , but are you ready every time you want to get rid of a dictator to sacrifice a million innocent civilians ?
All the indications coming out of [ the Chilcot inquiry ] are that Iraq was not really about weapons of mass destruction but rather about regime change , and I keep asking the same question – where do you find this regime change in international law ?
And if it is a violation of international law , who is accountable for that ? "
ElBaradei , who has emerged as a potential challenger to the three - decade rule of Egypt 's president , Hosni Mubarak , said western governments must withdraw the unstinting support for autocrats who were seen to be a bulwark against extremism .
" Western policy towards this part of the world has been a total failure , in my view .
It has not been based on dialogue , understanding , supporting civil society and empowering people , but rather it 's been based on supporting authoritarian systems as long as the oil keeps pumping . "
The 67 - year - old added : " If you bet on individuals , instead of the people , you are going to fail .
And western policy so far has been to bet on individuals , individuals who are not supported by their people and who are being discredited every day . "
The popularity in the Middle East of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the Hezbollah leader , Hassan Nasrallah , he said , should be seen as message to the west that its " policy is not reaching out to the people .
The policy should be : ' We care about you , we care about your welfare , we care about your human rights . ' "
On his return to Egypt , ElBaradei was greeted at Cairo airport by more than 1,000 supporters , despite a ban on political gatherings .
He has not yet announced whether he will stand in next year 's elections against Mubarak , a key US ally who has ruled the Arab world 's largest country for 28 years .
ElBaradei said western governments needed to open their eyes to the realities of Egypt 's " sham " democracy , or risk losing all credibility in the battle against extremism .
" The west talks a lot about elections in Iran , for example , but at least there were elections – yet where are the elections in the Arab world ?
If the west does n't talk about that , then how can it have any credibility ?
" Only if you empower the liberals , if you empower the moderate socialists , if you empower all factions of society , only then will extremists be marginalised . "
George Bush made the spread of democracy in the Middle East the centrepiece of US foreign policy , but the Iraq invasion largely discredited the initiative in the region .
In a landmark speech in Cairo last June Barack Obama appeared to back away from his predecessor 's aspirations .
" America does not presume to know what is best for everyone , " Obama said .
" No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other . "
The speech was largely welcomed in the Arab world at the time as a retreat from the neoconservative agenda , but some democracy activistsvoiced concern that it heralded the US backing away from the cause of human rights in the region .
Current Egyptian law effectively prohibits independent candidates from getting their name on the ballot paper , which has fuelled ElBaradei 's demands for a " constitutional revolution " to make the poll free and fair .
Analysts believe Mubarak , who is 81 and currently recovering from a gall bladder operation , is planning to engineer a succession of power to his youngest son , Gamal .
ElBaradei said he was not afraid of intimidation by Egypt 's vast security apparatus , but revealed that several foreign governments had expressed concern about his safety in the country , following recent reports of his followers being arrested and tortured by police .
Speaking at his home , he said : " I hear that from so many different governments , people coming to me and saying ' you should be careful ' .
But I do n't want to go around with bodyguards … people who are extremely poor and deprived are coalescing around me in the streets saying ' we need change ' , and I want to listen . "
As it turns out , Nvidia ’s GeForce GTX 470 and 480 graphics cards pose no great threat to AMD ’s Radeon HD 5800 series .
AMD might be reticent to enact price cuts as a result , but according to Fudzilla , the company ’s card - selling partners may take care of that on their own .
Fudzilla claims to have it on good authority that " key people at AMD " are waiting to gauge the GeForce GTX 400 family ’s success before making any moves .
Although price - slashing card partners would n’t receive backing from AMD , some of them " might slightly adjust their 5800 series pricing , and get the prices slightly down , " the site adds .
Such cuts would come directly out of those partners ’ profit margins .
For those who have n’t been keeping track , Nvidia ’s GeForce GTX 470 and 480 will become available next week at prices of around $ 349 and $ 499 , respectively .
The Radeon HD 5850 and 5870 currently start at $ 299.99 and $ 414.99 , respectively , at Newegg , so AMD already has an advantage .
Further cuts would likely push Nvidia to follow suit .
Considering the size of the GF100 graphics processor and recent reports of poor yields , any kind of price war probably wo n’t help Nvidia make a profit on these products .

Today , I was at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco as soon as it was open ( as I blogged about it several hours before ) .
Upon walking around the exhibit floor , I quickly found Adobe .
Oddly , they were displaying all smartphones such as Google ’s Android phone like Nexus One , Droid and the Palm Pre but nowhere was an iPhone nor iPad to be found .
( Sorry , Apple , no free lunch for you at Adobe ’s booth this time ! )
Upon closer look , I found Adobe had one of the Google Android Tablet prototype running Android OS 2.1 ( I believe ) .
The Google Android Tablet was in its real “ prototype ” shape with acrylic used as its enclosure .
The best part about the Google Android Tablet ?
It runs Adobe ’s Flash and Air apps flawlessly .
That was the first time I saw Adobe ’s Air apps running on a tablet and totally impressed by how it ran .
And now I can understand why Apple wants to ban Flash and other Adobe products completely from their iPhones and iPads , because it ’s rather incredible technology .
The prototype that was demo-ed at the Web 2.0 Expo show was showing the current workings of the Wired magazine ’s Google Tablet app .
Certainly , it looks like Google Android tablet will make a big impact on worldwide tablet sales .
I , for one , want to get one of these over an iPad , simply because I need the choice of having “ flash ” on my tablet computer .
What ’s the point of carry a 10 - inch slab of technology if it does n’t give you the best of both worlds ?
According to Mike at Adobe , there will be a slew of Android Tablets at the end of this year ( maybe November / December ) that will flood the iPad market .
Although Mike could n’t tell me which companies were working on this ( other than NVidia ) , it seemed to me that like a LOT of companies will be launching various different versions of the Android Multi - touch tablets at the end of this year .
For those of you who have successfully held out on buying an iPad , it might be a smart idea to wait until the Android multi - touch tablets come out to the market as they will probably be cheaper plus you will be able to use Adobe ’s flash and air applications .
This certainly means that you could possibly use all your regular desktop Adobe air applications ( such as Twitter clients ) right on the new Android Tablet device .

Android users know that you get an error message if an app crashes , I know because I have a Nexus One .

But here 's where it all goes haywire , and dangerously so .
First , his legislation is not just aimed at " terrorists " or their supporters ; it would strip away citizenship ( by finding that one had intended to surrender it ) even if one had no intention of doing so .
For example , if one were to work with a " terrorist " organization to push it to renounce the use of violence and adopt the peaceful pursuit of its goals .
Or if one were to provide support for the building of a hospital or a child - care center for an organization that has been labeled " terrorist " but is not in conflict with the United States .
An individual who contributes to a fund to repair a medical facility in Gaza might thus fall into the category of persons Mr. Lieberman 's legislation would construe as having chosen to renounce their American citizenship .
This determination of intent to surrender one 's citizenship would not be made in a court of law but ( a ) by a bureaucrat in the State Department and ( b ) on the basis of " suspicion , " the suspicion needing only to exist in the mind of the bureaucrat .
Given the political pressure to be proactive in safeguarding the homeland , one can easily imagine that it would be easier , and safer , to determine that one intended to revoke one 's citizenship than to correctly note the tenuous nature of a contention that one was engaged in an assault on the security and liberties of fellow Americans .
But it 's still better to be cautious , right ?
Better to inconvenience one person than to put the rest of us at risk ?
But we 're not talking about inconvenience here : the triggering suspicion is not like a local policeman making an arrest and a local district attorney filing charges .
In that case , the accused could avail himself of the opportunity to prove that he had no desire to harm Americans and no interest in furthering the bloody ambitions of America 's enemies .
The government 's evidence could be weighed .
The grounds for the suspicion could be evaluated .
People who are as patriotic and as committed to our safety as the State Department bureaucrat would judge whether to kick the guy out of the country , demote him to the status of non-citizen , with the attendant loss of a citizen 's rights and privileges ( including those citizens enjoy when accused of a crime ) , or conclude that he is innocent .
Remember , the goal must be to take the passports of those who are actually guilty of having placed themselves in the ranks of our enemies .
When one determines " guilt " merely by dint of the suspicions of a government agent , one raises worrisome specters of Stalinist apparatchiks .
I am pretty much like the rest of you : if somebody is plotting to blow up a car in Times Square or plant a bomb on a subway , the only " country " he is entitled to is a small cell behind stout iron bars .
If he succeeds in killing , I 'm ready to send him to the same fate .
But only if he , as an American citizen , has been found guilty in an American court of law under American rules of justice ; we do n't punish , by death or by exile , the innocent .

In March I debated drug policy with Ron Brooks , president of the National Narcotics Officers Association , on John Stossel 's Fox Business show .
When Stossel asked Brooks about the violence fostered by drug prohibition , he replied , " Well , there certainly is some of that . "
Then he quickly moved on to another topic .
I thought of Brooks ' blithe response as I read about one March weekend 's horrific violence in Mexico , which included the murders of three people tied to the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez : a pregnant consular employee and her husband , both U.S. citizens , and the Mexican husband of another consulate worker .
All were shot dead in their cars shortly after leaving a birthday party with their children .
The motive for the attacks remains unclear , but Mexican police believe they were carried out by a gang linked to the Juarez drug cartel , which has been fighting the Sinaloa cartel for control of the city .
The murders , which elicited outraged responses from Washington , were just a small part of the bloody ordeal that our government is inflicting on Mexico by insisting that it stop drugs destined for American lungs , noses , and veins .
The same weekend those three people were killed in their cars as their children screamed in the back seat , nearly 50 more died in Mexico from violence related to the drug trade .
In Ciudad Juarez , which is important to traffickers because it sits right across the border from El Paso , more than 2,000 people were killed last year , giving the city one of the world 's highest homicide rates .
Since Mexican President Felipe Calderon launched a literal war against the country 's drug cartels in December 2006 , Reuters reports , some 19,000 people have died .
Mexican and American drug warriors are unfazed , saying the staggering death toll is a sign of their success .
" Mexico lives with the violent consequences of an American dilemma , " writes former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda .
" It is because of American demand that Mexico is ' forced ' to wage a war on drugs that otherwise it would not have to fight . "
It is not simply American demand for drugs that creates this situation ; it is our government 's refusal to let legal businesses meet that demand .
Just as it did during alcohol prohibition , that refusal creates a black market in which suppliers violently contend for territory instead of peacefully competing for customers .
" As long as criminalization , its hypocrisy , and serious discussions of the alternatives are banned from public discussion , " says Castaneda , " U.S. drug policy will remain … a supply - side , foreign - policy , nickel - and - dime war waged beyond U.S. borders .
… The only conceivable alternative lies in a change in U.S. drug policy : not demand reduction , or supply interdiction , but decriminalization , harm reduction , adjusting laws to reality instead of uselessly attempting the opposite . "
To address the violence , decriminalization has to encompass not just possession for personal use ( a policy that Mexico and several U.S. states have adopted in limited ways ) but production and distribution as well .
During alcohol prohibition — when the U.S. homicide rate rose by 43 percent , peaking the year of repeal — there were no criminal penalties for drinking .
Yet by making it illegal to manufacture and sell alcohol , the government invited the likes of Al Capone to vie for control of a lucrative black market , with predictably violent results .
Once alcohol was legalized , the business was no longer run by criminals , and liquor suppliers stopped shooting at each other .
" We will continue to work with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his government to break the power of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Mexico and far too often target and kill the innocent , " the White House declared after the headline - grabbing murders in Ciudad Juarez .
If the U.S. government were serious about breaking the power of the brutal gangs that profit from prohibition , it would rethink its war on drugs .

As the spring season gets underway , many Americans will be looking to take advantage of the lower real estate prices , attractive mortgage rates , and federal tax credit by purchasing a home .
But remember :
Not all of the costs associated with homeownership are reflected in the listed price .
Indeed , many buyers — particularly first - time buyers — may be surprised by the amount of cash they 'll need to set aside for housing - related expenses that they had n't previously considered .
These often - overlooked expenses can include everything from title insurance to lawn mowing .
To give would - be home buyers a better sense of the budget they 'll need to buy and maintain a home , U.S. News spoke with a handful of real estate experts and compiled a list of 12 hidden costs of homeownership :
1. Home inspection .
Since a home purchase is likely to be the largest financial investment of your life , it 's a good idea to have it professionally inspected beforehand .
A home inspector can point out areas of the property that may need repairs .
Buyers can use this information as leverage during home - price negotiations or simply to determine whether or not the property is worth purchasing .
" It 's not required , but certainly I recommend it to buyers , " says Judy Moore of Re / Max Landmark Realtors in Lexington , Mass .
" It is actually very helpful in that [ buyers ] learn about the property and how to maintain it and it also alerts them to any potential issues that may be coming up in the near future or need to be taken care of . "
The cost of a home inspection , which can run several hundred dollars or more , is typically incurred by the buyers before they go to closing , Moore says .
2. Pest inspection .
Buyers should consider obtaining a separate inspection for wood - destroying insects , such as termites .
Although no laws mandate pre-transaction pest inspections and not all lenders require them , Greg Baumann , senior scientist for the National Pest Management Association , says buyers would be smart to have the procedure done prior to closing .
" If you buy a house and you do n't have an inspection and the house is riddled [ with termites ] , you go to closing and now the house is yours , " Baumann says .
" It happens at a time in their lives when [ homeowners ] can least afford repairs . "
Termite inspections typically cost between $ 50 and $ 200 , Baumann says .
3. Appraisal fees .
Before you can purchase a home , your lender will require you to have the property valued by a professional real estate appraiser .
Lenders use such appraisals when determining the amount of money to offer mortgage borrowers .
In years past , appraisal costs were often rolled into the fees that borrowers paid at closing , says Tom Vanderwell , a mortgage officer for Fifth Third Bank in Michigan .
Today , however , he makes sure to collect this fee up front .
" We 've got to pay the appraiser whether the deal goes through or not , " he says .
" And with the way that the market has been , there is certainly a substantial percentage of deals that are not going through . "
After buyers pay the fee — which typically ranges between $ 350 and $ 400 — it appears as a credit on their closing statement , Vanderwell says .
4. Closing costs .
When you arrive to sign your closing documents , be prepared to pay thousands of dollars in assorted fees .
Such expenses — known as closing costs — can include processing fees , underwriting fees , recording fees , survey fees , and title insurance fees .
" This industry has done a bad job of explaining to people that there are legitimate fees which must be paid in order to grant you a mortgage loan , " says Keith Gumbinger , of HSH.com .
" There are various service providers who are involved in this process — they have their costs and [ lenders ] have some of [ their ] own administrative costs as well . "
But savvy consumers can limit these expenses .
Gumbinger recommends that would - be buyers ask several different lenders for so - called good faith estimates , which outline closing costs in detail .
( Lenders , however , are under no obligation to offer you such information before you apply , he says . )
" If lender A charges a document preparation fee and lender B does n't , that might be one of the considerations , " Gumbinger says .
Closing costs vary , but they usually range between 2 to 3 percent of the mortgage loan amount , he says .
5. Moving expenses .
Buyers face an additional wave of costs once their home purchase is complete .
Take moving expenses .
Unless your new house is around the corner or you have a large group of helpful friends , you 'll likely need some professional help to transport your belongings .
Such expenses can reach several thousand dollars or more , depending on the distance of the move .
" Moving is a significant expense — particularly across the country , " says Gail Cunningham of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling .
For those moving on account of a job , Cunningham recommends asking your new employer to chip in for some of the costs associated with the transition .
" I know that people are probably so excited to get the job that they do n't want to rock the boat , but that 's a pretty normal question , " Cunningham says .
" A lot of these companies have standing contracts so it is certainly a question worth posing because you do n't want to have to cough up that out - of - pocket expense unnecessarily . "
6. Furniture .
Once you 've lugged all of your furniture into your new property , you may find that your old sofa and dining room table are n't nearly enough to fill out the house .
" Maybe [ the buyers ] came from a one - bedroom apartment and they are buying a three - bedroom house , " Cunningham says .
" They are really going to have some major expenses just to furnish the house with the basics . "
The beds , lamps , and tables often needed to furnish additional rooms can add up quickly .
" The expense of that can really catch you by surprise , " Gumbinger says .
7. Property taxes and homeowners insurance .
If you have never had a mortgage , be aware that your monthly bill wo n't simply reflect the loan amount plus interest .
It will also reflect property taxes and premiums for homeowners insurance , which all mortgage borrowers are required to obtain .
For that reason , housing experts encourage buyers to think of their baseline monthly mortgage payment as encompassing " PITI , " or principal , interest , taxes , and insurance .
Annual homeowners insurance premiums typically range between 0.5 to 1 percent of the mortgage loan amount , Gumbinger says .
Property taxes will vary a great deal , but can run several thousand dollars a year or more .
8. Supplemental insurance .
Consumers who buy homes in areas exposed to flooding may have to purchase a supplemental insurance policy , says Guy Cecala , the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance .
" [ For ] just about any mortgage you get now that 's in the 100 - year flood plain , you have to get flood insurance , " Cecala says .
Buyers can use online tools to determine if the property they are considering is located in such an area .
" There is no real cheap private alternative .
You really have to get into the federal flood insurance program , and it 's relatively affordable , " he says .
Premiums on such policies will cost most homeowners less than $ 20 a month , he says .
9 . Homeowners association / condo fees .
Consumers who buy into certain developments will have to pay an additional monthly fee on top of their payments for principal , interest , taxes , and insurance .
Condominium and single - family developments often charge residents for services that benefit the community , like lawn mowing or employing a front - desk attendant .
" Condo fees are specifically for condominiums .
Home association fees can also be for single - family home developments , " Moore says .
" They are essentially the same thing but different variations . "
Such fees will vary , but can total more than $ 100 a month .
10 . Utilities .
You may be surprised by how much you 'll need to budget to keep your house warm and the water running .
" You might have been renting an apartment and you [ were ] paying some portion of your utilities or maybe all of them , but the first cold winter you are in your house , you [ might ] say , ' Wow , look at these power bills , ' " Gumbinger says .
" That 's one of the costs I think you really do n't think about . "
Utility costs will vary by region and consumption .
To get a sense of the costs , home buyers should ask sellers for monthly utilities estimates before they close the transaction .
11 . Ongoing maintenance .
Although that big backyard might be a great place to grill burgers , it 's also an expense .
As a homeowner , it 's your responsibility to keep your property maintained .
That means raking the leaves , mowing the lawn , trimming the hedges , and clearing out the gutters , among other tasks .
( Unless , of course , you live in a development that handles these chores for you . )
To maintain the exterior property , you may have to buy a lawnmower , a hedge trimmer , or other equipment that you did n't need when you lived in an apartment .
" If you are a first - time buyer , you may fail to appreciate just how much stuff you need to buy in order to manage your home , " Gumbinger says .
New Ad Debuts On April 20 On The CBS Super Screen
Washington , DC : The NORML Foundation , the educational arm of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , will debut its second - ever digital ad this Tuesday , April 20 , on the CBS Super Screen in New York City ’s Times Square .
The animated billboard advertisement will highlight the dramatic increase in New York City ’s rate of marijuana possession arrests , which increased from fewer than 1,000 annually in 1992 to more than 46,000 in 2009 .
According to a 2008 study released by the New York Civil Liberties Union , City police have made an estimated 400,000 marijuana possession arrests over the past decade .
The majority of citizens arrested for marijuana possession offenses are either African American or Hispanic .
The ad concludes : " Legalize marijuana .
Stop arrests . "
NORML Foundation Executive Director Allen St. Pierre called the City ’s marijuana - centric arrest practices ‘ shameful ’ and ‘ fiscally irresponsible . ’
He said : " Under state law , minor marijuana possession offenses are categorized as a violation , not a criminal offense .
Yet New York City police officers are effectively circumventing state law by charging tens of thousands of young adults each year with unnecessary criminal misdemeanors by claiming that the marijuana was possessed ‘ in plain view . ’
This is a shameful and fiscally irresponsible policy that disproportionately targets minorities and does nothing to improve public safety .
It is time for City law enforcement to stop wasting taxpayers ’ dollars and to abide by the state ’s longstanding decriminalization law . "
The NORML Foundation ’s new ad will appear eighteen times per day on the CBS ’s digital billboard , located on 42nd Street , between 7th and 8th Avenues .
Approximately 1.5 million people walk by the billboard each day .
In March , NORML launched a 15 - second digital ad trumpeting the cost savings and tax revenue that could be generated by regulating and taxing adult marijuana use .
That ad , available online at : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeH5HrG7IfM, will continue to air until Monday , April 19 .
NORML ’s forthcoming advertisement will air through May 2010 .
Founded in 1970 , NORML is the nation ’s oldest and largest grassroots organization advocating on behalf of marijuana law reform .
The NORML Foundation was founded in 1997 to support public education , research , stake holder organizing and impact litigation .
In 2009 , NORML Foundation launched the first - ever nationwide television ad campaign calling for the regulation of marijuana by adults .

Over the last few days , a sizeable number of articles have been published about Conservative Party candidate , Philippa Stroud , which contain a error of material fact .
As Ms Stroud has , seen fit , through her lawyers , to contact a number of media organisations and invoke the provisions of s106 of the Representation of the People Act , under which it an offence to knowingly publish an untrue statement about the character or conduct of a parliamentary candidate during an election period , we feel compelled to issue the following correction on behalf of the blogosphere .
It has been suggested , by numerous sources , that in 1999 , Ms Stroud ‘ wrote ’ a book entitled ‘ God ’s Heart for the Poor ’ in which she allegedly explains how to deal with people showing signs of ‘ demonic possession ’ .
Further inquiries indicate that although Ms Stroud is , indeed , listed as one of two co-authors by Amazon , this is , in fact , incorrect , as indicated by the following statement , which appears on the personal website of the books ’ other listed author , Christine Leonard :
God ’s Heart for the Poor , ghosted biography / how to for Philippa Stroud .
Kingsway , Aug 1999
Out of print
It would appear , therefore , that Ms Stroud ‘ wrote ’ this particular book only in the same sense that Wayne Rooney is the ‘ author ’ of an ‘ autobiography ’ and Katie Price is a successful ‘ novelist ’ ; and so , on behalf of the blogosphere , we unreservedly withdraw the claim that Ms Stroud is a published author .
Any further correspondance on this matter will , as matter of course , be referred to the response provided to the plaintiff in the case of Arkell vs Pressdram .
INDIANAPOLIS --
One lap to go , running on empty and someone bearing down on his tail .
After having the dominant car and the perfect game plan , Dario Franchitti still needed more Sunday -- one break to win his second Indianapolis 500 .
He got it in the form of a spectacular , airborne crash that brought out a yellow flag and allowed him to cross the line with a scant 1.6 gallons of fuel left .
That 1.6 gallons left him holding a quart of milk , a winner at the Brickyard for the second time in four years .
" Still running , " the winner told his crew over the radio as he crossed the finish line , while wreckers were moving out to scoop up debris from an accident that sent Mike Conway into the wall and to the hospital with a broken left leg .
The victory made Franchitti's boss , Chip Ganassi , the first owner to win Indy and NASCAR 's Daytona 500 in the same year .
" All he wants to do is win , " Franchitti said .
This win validated the Scottish driver 's return to the IndyCar circuit two years after celebrating his 2007 Indy victory by making an unsuccessful move with Ganassi to NASCAR .
It also made Franchitti and crew look like the master tacticians they were on this day -- working the gas pedal perfectly to stretch their final fill - up for the last 37 laps and edge out 2005 champion Dan Wheldon of England .
" You have to be prepared for all eventualities there , " Ganassi said .
" We had to play that game being the leader to keep those guys behind us , but also stay in front of them to make it to the finish . "
Dario Franchitti got a victory kiss from his wife Ashley Judd after winning his second Indy 500 .
Mark J. Rebilas / US Presswire
Franchitti was holding off Wheldon when Ryan Hunter - Reay ran out of gas and slowed suddenly with Conway coming up alongside him .
Conway went airborne , flipped upside down and flew into the wall , nearly landing on top of Hunter - Reay .
That brought out the caution flag for the final lap .
" That car should have come down on my head , " Hunter - Reay said .
" I do n't know how it did n't . "
And so , Franchitti's second victory turned out to be the story instead of Helio Castroneves ' fourth .
Spiderman 's quest to tie A.J. Foyt , Al Unser Sr. , and Rick Mears for most wins ever at the Brickyard essentially ended with an uncharacteristic mistake -- stalling out while leaving the pits on the 146th lap .
It left Castroneves in need of a yellow - flag miracle at the end that never came , and he finished ninth after one last pit stop on the 192nd lap .
" Unfortunately , silly mistakes put us in the back , " Castroneves said .
" I 'm very disappointed .
I 'm more disappointed with the mistake . "
Danica Patrick made no such mistakes .
After being booed during qualifying for complaining about a balky car , she picked and poked her way from 23rd to sixth .
Patrick never found her comfort zone in the 88 - degree weather -- at one point saying she wished she could make up as much time on the track as in the pits -- but she was patient and disciplined and now has five top - 10 finishes in six years .
Marco Andretti was third , followed by England 's Alex Lloyd and Scott Dixon .
" I 'm very happy with the result , and the reasons we got it were that our pit stops rocked and we had a perfect strategy , " Patrick said .
Not so for Tony Kanaan , who finished 11th after starting last in the 33 - car field and moving as high as second , less than half a second behind .
His bid to become the first driver in 94 years of Indys to go from worst to first ended when he had to go to the pits for a splash of fuel with four laps to go .
Radical Islamist insurgents in Somalia seized one of the country ’s most notorious pirate dens on Sunday , raising questions about whether rebels with connections to Al Qaeda will now have a pipeline to tens of millions of dollars — and a new ability to threaten global trade .
Dozens of insurgents stormed into Xarardheere , a pirate cove on the central Somali coast , around noon , but instead of putting up a fight , the pirates sped off .
According to witnesses , several pirate bosses raced out of town in luxury four - by - four trucks , with TVs packed in the back and mattresses strapped on top .
Islamist fighters in a fleet of heavily armed pickup trucks then occupied the strategic points in town , including the defunct police station and several crossroads .
What will happen next is not clear .
Two of Somalia ’s biggest problems and its most troubling exports — Islamist extremism and piracy — seem to be crashing into each other .
For several years , an intense civil war has raged in the country between a weak United States - backed government and radical Islamist groups that are trying to overthrow it .
The ensuing lawlessness has given rise to a thriving piracy trade , in which Somali thugs in small skiffs have commandeered some of the biggest vessels on the sea , including a 1,000 - foot - long oil tanker .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - China ’s Internet “ firewall ” is a trade barrier and needs to be tackled within the framework of the World Trade Organization , Neelie Kroes , vice - president of the European Commission , told reporters in Shanghai on Monday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Dutch - born Kroes , who is also in charge of Europe ’s digital agenda , said the firewall was a trade barrier as long as it blocked communication for Internet users , preventing the free flow of information .
“ It is one of those issues that needs to be tackled within the WTO , ” said Kroes , who served as European Commissioner for competition until 2009 .
Kroes spoke at the China headquarters of video - sharing company Tudou , a rival of Google ’s internationally popular video - sharing platform YouTube that is blocked in China .
Chinese law requires Internet companies to block or remove objectionable content , including pornography and any information deemed sensitive by the ruling Communist Party .
Social media platforms popular overseas , including Facebook , YouTube , Twitter and Flickr , are all blocked in China for fear they will provide a platform to organize or share illicit information .
“ I am pushing wherever I can just to get European enterprises a level playing field in China and the other way around .
It should be reciprocal , ” she said , adding that the amount of disruption from the firewall varied for each business .
The U.S. has also explored taking China ’s Internet restrictions to the WTO .
In the past , the WTO has upheld China ’s right to censor printed and audiovisual content .
China ’s more than 400 million Internet users , many of them young and educated , increasingly spend time online for entertainment .
Despite censorship , the Internet can be a potent public forum in China , with bloggers and amorphous online groups hectoring the government over pollution and corruption .
Kroes said it was significant that companies such as Tudou , which uploads user videos , show that the younger generation is taking an active role in tackling censorship .
Tudou , which adheres to government censorship regulations , said it deletes 100,000 videos every month for content that involves pornography or politics .

NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. engaged in the " same type of fraudulent conduct " that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was accused of committing by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in a lawsuit on Friday , a Dutch bank said Friday .
In a letter filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Friday , lawyers for Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen - Boerenleenbank BA , or Rabobank , said Merrill Lynch committed a similar fraud in the structuring of a $ 1.5 billion collateralized debt obligation , known as Norma CDO Ltd .
" The ...
George W. Bush ’s political adviser Karl Rove claims “ one of the biggest mistakes ” of that presidency was not aggressively challenging critics who charged that Bush “ lied ” to the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War , an accusation that Rove insists was false and unfair .
In his forthcoming book , Courage and Consequence , Rove calls the “ lie ” charge “ a poison - tipped dagger aimed at the heart of the Bush presidency ” and blames himself for “ a weak response ” that underestimated “ how damaging this assault was . ”
But the problem with Rove ’s account is that not only did Bush oversee the twisting of intelligence to justify invading Iraq in March 2003 but he subsequently lied – and lied repeatedly – about how Iraq had responded to United Nations inspection demands .
So , while it may be impossible to say for certain what Bush believed about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction , it ca n’t be argued that Bush did n’t know that Iraq declared that it had destroyed its WMD stockpiles and let U.N. inspectors in to see for themselves in the months before the invasion .
Nevertheless , Bush followed up his false pre-war claims about Iraq ’s WMD with a post- invasion insistence that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had barred U.N. inspectors from his country , a decision that Bush said left him no choice but to invade .
Bush began reciting this faux history just months after the invasion and continued the tall tale until the end of his presidency more than five years later .
Tellingly , throughout that period , as Bush blithely lied about the Iraq War history , he was never challenged to his face by the mainstream U.S. journalists who politely listened to the lies .
Indeed , some big - name journalists even adopted Bush ’s false narrative as their own .
Now , it appears Rove is intent on rehabilitating Bush ’s record by insisting that the ex-President never lied at all .
The historical record , however , is clear : Hussein and other Iraqi officials did say they no longer possessed WMD and they did let UN arms inspectors into Iraq in the fall of 2002 to search any site of their choosing .
The inspectors in their white vans drove around Iraq for months , with their excursions covered daily by the international news media .
In trip after trip , guided by the best available U.S. intelligence , the inspectors came up empty .
Hussein and his government also backed up their claims to be WMD - free by providing the United Nations a 12,000 - page declaration on Dec. 7 , 2002 , explaining how Iraq ’s stocks of chemical and biological weapons had been destroyed in the 1990s .
Though the Bush administration mocked these Iraqi disclosures , U.S. intelligence had its own independent facts supporting the Iraqi statements , including information from Hussein ’s son - in - law Hussein Kamel al - Majid who defected and described his work destroying the stockpiles after the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s .
[ When he returned to Iraq , he was killed . ]
Top - Level Intelligence
With the help of French intelligence , the CIA also had “ turned ” Hussein ’s foreign minister , Naji Sabri , who conveyed real - time intelligence to the U.S. government , passing along information in September 2002 about the absence of Iraqi WMD .
Here is how author Ron Suskind described that intelligence in his 2008 book , The Way of the World :
“ The upshot of Sabri ’s account was that Saddam neither possessed WMD nor was trying very hard to procure or develop them .
If Saddam was eager for a nuclear weapon , he was as far as ever from having one and was making no progress on that front ; any vestige of a bio - weapons program was negligible ; and if any chemical weapons remained in Iraq , they were no longer in the hands of either Saddam Hussein or his military .
“ [ CIA Paris station chief Bill ]
Murray flew down to Washington to deliver the news and briefed John McLaughlin , CIA ’s deputy director .
McLaughlin was enthusiastic about the intelligence but pointed out that it was contradicted by information from Curveball , the best source on Iraqi WMD to that point .
Sabri ’s account was relayed to [ CIA Director George ]
Tenet , who delivered it personally to Bush the following day .
“ But the administration quickly lost interest in Sabri when it heard what he had to say .
Bush dismissed the intelligence as disinformation , and the White House said it would be interested in Sabri only if he chose to defect . ”
Though the CIA found additional information to corroborate Sabri ’s story and regarded Curveball as a highly unreliable source , Bush pressed forward on his course to war .
Suskind further reported that the written report on Sabri ’s intelligence was distorted to lend greater credence to the WMD suspicions , “ almost certainly altered under pressure from Washington . ”
Yet , it may never be fully known whether Bush did n’t care about the truth or simply chose to believe the “ stove - piped ” intelligence that was coming from neoconservatives salted throughout the national security bureaucracy – and who were determined to go to war with Iraq .
What ca n’t be doubted is what happened next .
Set on invading , Bush forced the U.N. inspectors to wrap up their work and to leave Iraq in March 2003 , a departure that was followed within days by his “ shock and awe ” attack on Iraq , beginning March 19 .
Reinventing History
Several months later , with Hussein ’s government ousted and with the U.S. military coming up empty in its search for WMD caches , Bush began his historical revisionism by insisting publicly that he had no choice but to invade because Hussein supposedly had barred U.N. inspectors .
On July 14 , 2003 , Bush told reporters :
“ We gave him [ Saddam Hussein ] a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he would n’t let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power . ”
Facing no contradiction from the White House press corps , Bush continued repeating this lie again and again in varied forms .
On Jan. 27 , 2004 , for example , Bush said , “ We went to the United Nations , of course , and got an overwhelming resolution – 1441 – unanimous resolution , that said to Saddam , you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs , which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs .
He chose defiance .
It was his choice to make , and he did not let us in . ”
As the months and years went by , Bush ’s lie and its unchallenged retelling took on the color of truth .
At a March 21 , 2006 , news conference , Bush again blamed the war on Hussein ’s defiance of U.N. demands for unfettered inspections .
“ I was hoping to solve this [ Iraq ] problem diplomatically , ” Bush said .
“ The world said , ‘ Disarm , disclose or face serious consequences . ’ …
We worked to make sure that Saddam Hussein heard the message of the world .
And when he chose to deny the inspectors , when he chose not to disclose , then I had the difficult decision to make to remove him .
And we did . ”
At a press conference on May 24 , 2007 , Bush offered a short - hand version of the made - up tale , even inviting the journalists to remember the invented history .
“ As you might remember back then , we tried the diplomatic route : [ U.N. Resolution ] 1441 was a unanimous vote in the Security Council that said disclose , disarm or face serious consequences .
So the choice was his [ Hussein ’s ] to make .
And he made a choice that has subsequently caused him to lose his life . ”
In one of his White House exit interviews – on Dec. 1 , 2008 – Bush again revived his convenient version of history , that Hussein was responsible for the invasion because he would n’t let the U.N. inspectors in .
ABC News anchor Charles Gibson asked Bush , “ If the [ U.S. ] intelligence had been right [ and revealed no Iraq WMD ] , would there have been an Iraq War ? ”
Bush answered , “ Yes , because Saddam Hussein was unwilling to let the inspectors go in to determine whether or not the U.N. resolutions were being upheld . ”
In his frequent repetition of this claim , Bush never acknowledged the fact that Hussein did comply with Resolution 1441 by declaring accurately that he had disposed of his WMD stockpiles and by permitting U.N. inspectors to examine any site of their choosing .
Media Complicity
And never did mainstream reporters contradict Bush ’s false history to his face .
Indeed , some prominent Washington journalists even adopted Bush ’s lie as their own .
For instance , in a July 2004 interview , ABC ’s veteran newsman Ted Koppel used it to explain why he – Koppel – thought the invasion of Iraq was justified .
“ It did not make logical sense that Saddam Hussein , whose armies had been defeated once before by the United States and the Coalition , would be prepared to lose control over his country if all he had to do was say , ‘ All right , U.N. , come on in , check it out , ” Koppel told Amy Goodman , host of “ Democracy Now . ”
In the real history , Hussein did tell the U.N. to “ come on in , check it out . ”
But faux reality had become the trademark of the Bush presidency – and of its many supporters in the press corps .
Washington ’s conventional wisdom eventually embraced another fake belief , that Hussein provoked the war by misleading people into believing that he still possessed WMD .
The fact that Hussein and his government had declared they did n’t possess WMD was forgotten .
In line with the bogus version of history , “ 60 Minutes ” correspondent Scott Pelley asked FBI interrogator George Piro , who had debriefed Hussein in prison , why the dictator kept pretending that he had WMD even as U.S. troops massed on Iraq ’s borders , when a simple announcement that the WMD was gone would have prevented the war .
“ For a man who drew America into two wars and countless military engagements , we never knew what Saddam Hussein was thinking , ” Pelley said in introducing the segment on the interrogation of Hussein about his WMD stockpiles , which aired Jan. 27 , 2008 .
“ Why did he choose war with the United States ? ”
This “ 60 Minutes ” segment never mentioned the fact that Hussein and his government did disclose that the WMD had been eliminated .
Instead Pelley pressed Piro on the mystery of why Hussein supposedly was hiding that fact :
“ Why keep the secret ?
Why put your nation at risk , why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade ? ”
After Piro mentioned Hussein ’s lingering fear of neighboring Iran , Pelley felt he was close to an answer to the mystery : “ He believed that he could n’t survive without the perception that he had weapons of mass destruction ? ”
But , still , Pelley puzzled over why Hussein ’s continued in his miscalculation .
Pelley asked : “ As the U.S. marched toward war and we began massing troops on his border , why did n’t he stop it then ?
And say , ‘ Look , I have no weapons of mass destruction , ’ I mean , how could he have wanted his country to be invaded ? ”
Now , with the publication of Karl Rove ’s memoir , the American public can expect a reprise of the argument that it was unfair for anyone to accuse President Bush of lying about Iraq , that he simply believed mistaken intelligence and did what he thought was best for America .
In other words , Bush was the victim of mean critics , not a dishonest warmonger .
One also can expect that the mainstream U.S. news media will continue to forget its own role in perpetuating the lie that George W. Bush would never lie .

Here are some things I 've learned .
" Thinning " is a heartbreaking experience .
The first seeds I planted were herbs in a pot .
I planted lots of seeds and had to throw most of my seedlings out as they grew .
I now plant seeds individually , one per container ( or a couple in a pot , spaced appropriately ) , and plan for them all to sprout .
If they do n't , I can always plant a new seed .
But most seeds sprout .
Covering seedling trays with plastic is not something I do , because I do n't have plastic wrap lying around .
I 'm attentive to the soil moisture and have n't had any problems .
Seed starter mix holds water particularly well ( one of the reasons it 's worth buying ) , but do keep in mind that the smaller your container , the more often you 'll need to water it .
The mix is also easily compacted by the impact of a stream of water .
I 've found that the handiest way to water small containers without disturbing the soil is to make a SEEDLING WATERER as follows :
1 plastic water bottle with lid
something with which to poke a hole in the lid
Poke a hole in the lid .
Fill the bottle with water and put the lid on .
Squirt the water through the hole onto your seedling pot .
No soil disturbance !
I also do n't keep my seeds in the dark before they 've germinated .
I 'm sure people who insist on doing that have a good reason to do so , but I try to keep things simple and so all my guys are on the same table by my south - facing window .
I figure they 're under soil , so it 's pretty dark down there , and they seem to be doing fine and germinating in the appropriate time frame .
I do n't use grow lights - that would be way expensive - but I do turn my seedlings , sometimes more than once a day , and take them outside when the weather is good .
A note about parsley : parsley takes forever to germinate .
So long that , long after the other herbs I had planted the same day were sprouting their first and even second true leaves , I 'd yet to see any action from the parsley .
I finally planted something else on top , but the very next day they sprouted , and they continued to sprout for a couple of weeks .
Some seeds just require a lot of patience , and it never hurts to look them up with Google to get some extra info - seed packets can be frustratingly brief .
Finally , keep track of your planting dates by writing them on your seedling pots ( in ballpoint or something similar , which does n't bleed on cardboard , and sharpie on yogurt cups ) .
You 'll want this information for your own reference .
Also write down varieties , especially if you 've got seedlings that look similar ( all the nightshades look a like at first , and forget telling two kinds of tomatoes apart ) .
You can never have too much data .
I hope you 've enjoyed my instructable and feel inspired to start your own seeds for cheap .
I 'm entering the gardening contest , so if you liked it , please give me a good rating and vote for me .
Good luck !
The “ psychologically astute ” Larry Fink , photographed at BlackRock headquarters in February .
Considering the enormous power he is believed to wield , it ’s remarkable how few people have heard of Larry Fink .
In political and business circles — among the men who travel the now well - worn corridor between Washington and Wall Street — Fink , the chairman and C.E.O. of BlackRock , the giant asset - management firm , is described as possibly the most important man in finance today .
But mention his name to most people and they draw a blank .
Despite his considerable wealth , he is virtually unknown on the society circuit in Manhattan , where he has an apartment on the Upper East Side , or in Aspen , where he also has a home .
In North Salem , the affluent enclave north of New York City where he and Lori , his wife of 35 years , have a 26 - acre farm , he is perhaps slightly better known , if only because a number of Wall Street bankers have estates there .
But still — just a few months ago — when one of his neighbors , a prominent New York agent , furious that a popular horse path through the Fink estate had been blocked off , was told who owned the property , her response was : “ Who is Larry Fink ? ”
Yet among the men who run Wall Street , it would be hard to find anyone who is not at least a little bit in awe of Larry Fink .
While some — especially those who have known him the longest — snicker privately about how clearly the 57 - year - old seems to relish his “ transformation ” in the last year and a half “ into a Wall Street statesman , ” its top consigliere , and the leading member of the country ’s financial oligarchy , there is nothing but admiration for the vast power of BlackRock .
In December , when Fink ’s $ 13.5 billion acquisition of Barclays Global Investors was finalized , BlackRock , the company he founded 22 years ago , officially became the largest money - management firm in the world .
A global colossus — with $ 3.3 trillion in assets under its direct management and another $ 9 trillion it supports —
BlackRock manages about $ 1 trillion of pension and retirement funds for millions of Americans and oversees the investments of scores of institutions around the world : from state and local governments to college endowments , from Fortune 500 companies to the sovereign - wealth funds of , among others , Abu Dhabi and Singapore .
BlackRock ’s vast reach in the global markets is not , however , its only source of influence these days .
That Fink pulled off the Barclays deal in the aftermath of 2008 ’s financial meltdown is , in itself , impressive , but he did more than merely survive the wreckage unscathed .
Indeed , it is hard to argue that anyone , or any firm on Wall Street , gained as much stature from the economic crisis as did Fink and BlackRock .
At the height of the disaster , when the American economy was on the brink , it was to Fink that Wall Street ’s C.E.O. ’s — including J. P. Morgan Chase ’s Jamie Dimon , Morgan Stanley ’s John Mack , and A.I.G. ’s Robert Willumstad — turned for help and counsel .
As did the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , whose top officials turned to Fink for advice on the financial markets and assistance on the $ 30 billion financing of the sale of Bear Stearns to J. P. Morgan , the $ 180 billion bailout of A.I.G. , the $ 45 billion rescue of Citigroup , and those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at $ 112 billion and growing .
Today , through an array of government contracts , BlackRock has effectively become the leading manager of Washington ’s bailout of Wall Street .
The firm oversees the $ 130 billion of toxic assets that the U.S. government took on as part of the Bear Stearns sale and the rescue of A.I.G. ; it also monitors the balance sheets of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — which together amount to some $ 5 trillion — and provides daily risk evaluations to the New York Fed on the $ 1.2 trillion worth of mortgage - backed securities it has purchased in an effort to jump - start the country ’s housing market .
( CNN ) --
A video released Sunday by a Pakistan Taliban group features a statement from a speaker claiming to be leader Hakimullah Mehsud in his first appearance since reports of his death in a drone strike , according to IntelCenter , a think tank that tracks terrorist groups .
Mehsud , leader of Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan , vowed attacks on major U.S. cities in the nearly nine - minute video .
" The time is very near when our fedayeen ( fighters ) will attack the American states in their major cities , " the speaker in the video said .
" Our fedayeen have penetrated the terrorist America , we will give extremely painful blows to the fanatic America . "
The video came to light less than 24 hours after an attempted car bombing in New York 's Times Square .
" God willing , very soon in some days or a month 's time , the Muslim ummah ( worldwide community ) will see the fruits of most successful attacks of our fedayeen in USA , " said the video , which the speaker said was recorded on April 4 .
" God willing , in some days or a month , time will prove the success of our fedayeen attacks bringing joy and bliss to the hearts of Muslim ummah . "
In February , a U.S. intelligence official and three Taliban sources told CNN that Mehsud had been killed in the January drone strike .
But the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban , Azam Tariq , had always denied reports of Mehsud 's death .
The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media .
Taliban leaders have denied leaders ' deaths in the past .
When former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year , cell phone video of his body was aired on Pakistani TV .
A senior U.S. counterterrorism official who asked not to be identified said that if Hakimullah Mehsud is still alive , he should " prove it . "
Is Mehsud alive ?
Watch more
" He never had a problem going before the cameras , " the official said .
" But for the past few months , he 's nowhere to be seen .
His group is n't one that traditionally led from the cave in silence .
His absence is the Taliban 's problem , not ours .
It 's already been shown that he can be hit .
As Baitullah Mehsud learned to his peril , if you 're a terrorist figure in that part of the world , you have to be smart -- and lucky . "
Hakimullah Mehsud got Washington 's attention when he appeared in a video with Humam Al Balawi , the Jordanian doctor turned suicide bomber who killed seven CIA agents in eastern Afghanistan in December last year .
A video , featuring an audio message purported to be by Al Balawi , appeared on radical militant Islamist websites on Friday .
On - screen text in the video claimed the message was recorded the night before his attack against the agents .
Hakimullah and Baitullah Mehsud were members of the same clan in Pakistan .
Breaking : Ronnie James Dio Of Black Sabbath Dies
I got the call about 4 hours ago that Ronnie James Dio has passed away .
I was asked to wait on reporting it til most close family and friends were told .
Dio , 67 had been battling stomach cancer and it was even reported earlier today that he was beating it .
His wife last night denied his death but announcement was made this morning that he did die .
I was told last night to hold off on the announcement of his death til more family was told .
About 3 - 4 hours .
After Wendy Dio ’s message late last night that he was still alive , I took it to mean that not all family was aware of his passing and locked comments .
I was trying to get the word out of a legend passing but his fans thought I was lying when i was stating the truth .
Regardless , Ronnie James Dio , you will be missed .

One thing I use a lot of in this house is vanilla .
Since I bake zucchini bread every week , that ’s already a tablespoon per week … plus most of the cookies and other goodies I bake also use vanilla .
Throw in French toast from time to time and other breakfast goodies and that ’s even more vanilla .
And strangely enough , here in Germany you can only get vanilla sugar .
Which is ok … but just not quite the same .
So although our friends and family have been fantastic about sending and bringing vanilla to us all the time , I have always wanted to learn how to make vanilla extract .
I knew it was simple … but I never imagined it was this simple .
What I found really fantastic when I was learning how to make vanilla extract is that you can just keep using the vanilla beans over and over again .
Just pour out 80 % of the finished vanilla extract into another jar and leave the other 20 % behind in the original jar with the beans and vanilla pieces .
Add more vodka to fill the jar up again , let it sit for about four weeks , and you ’ll have a whole new batch of vanilla .
I ’ve heard this also works with rum but I ’d think the rum contributes more of its own flavor … if you ’ve ever tried it with rum , please let us know how it turned out .
When you make vanilla extract , do n’t worry about using expensive vodka .
Some say the finished product will have less of a vodka aroma if you use the really good stuff , but I think that in most cases you wo n’t notice the vodka - ness once you ’re using the extract and have it combined with other ingredients .
And although the vodka smell will be really strong when you start , after your extract has been steeping for two months , you ’ll mostly just smell vanilla which grows each day longer that it sits .
So if you ’re in no rush to use the extract and still have a strong vodka smell , just let the vanilla extract sit a bit longer .
If you ’ve cut open vanilla beans to harvest the vanilla out of them for another recipe , you can even use those beans to make vanilla extract .
That means a whole lot of extract from something you were fully prepared to throw away .
Or if you prefer , you can also stuff the beans down into a jar of sugar and make your own vanilla infused sugar .
Put it in coffee or use it for baking just like you would vanilla extract .
So I ordered about 2 dozen vanilla beans online for under 10 euros and decided to finally get started on a batch of vanilla extract at the beginning of April .
A day or so later it already looked like this .
After shaking you could really see all the vanilla particles floating around .
After two weeks , the vodka had taken on a nice caramel color and I knew we were making good progress .
Not quite two months have passed ( the usual amount of time you should let the extract sit ) , but I just could n’t wait any longer …and my other vanilla stockpiles had been depleted .
The vodka smell is nearly gone and I could n’t taste any alcohol at all when I used it for zucchini bread .
So far I have n’t used it in too many other things but I ’m not sure I will ever buy vanilla again now that I know how incredibly simple it is to make your own vanilla extract .
You ’ll notice that the color does n’t appear all that different versus a month ago although if you do n’t have the jar close to a light source , it really has gotten quite dark .
Here ’s the quick and easy recipe to make your own vanilla extract .
If you ’re wondering what in the world you would do with all that vanilla , why not start putting it aside for a rainy day — or give it to friends with other baking ingredients or homemade gifts in a nice basket ?
They probably wo n’t have a clue how easy it was for you to make and will be really impressed with your self - sufficiency skills !
As Britain prepares to go to the polls , a bakery has rustled up a way of predicting who will end up with the biggest bite of the action .

Protecting your privacy using Facebook 's settings is no longer enough
Facebook 's latest changes effectively mean that even if you change your settings to protect your privacy following the steps above , that the personal information you share on Facebook , the sequence of groups , organizations , locales and affiliations that in part make you who you are , are being commercialized to become the property of Facebook even if you set them to " private . "
Here 's two key paragraphs about the recent Facebook changes from Ryan Singel 's Wired editorial :
All the items you list as things you like must become public and linked to public profile pages .
If you do n’t want them linked and made public , then you do n’t get them — though Facebook nicely hangs onto them in its database in order to let advertisers target you .
This includes your music preferences , employment information , reading preferences , schools , etc .
All the things that make up your profile .
They all must be public — and linked to public pages for each of those bits of info — or you do n’t get them at all .
That ’s hardly a choice , and the whole system is maddeningly complex .
If you use Facebook , you can no longer share with your friends , for example , that you went to a certain college without having your profile linked to a centralized web page that Facebook controls about that college .
Facebook says :
Our goal is to make this Community Page the best collection of shared knowledge on this topic .
If you have a passion for " organization x , " sign up and we 'll let you know when we 're ready for your help .
That now goes for your hometown , your high school , your employers , your job titles , books you read , or any of a wide array of information that many folks routinely share in their information page on Facebook .
You should be very dubious of becoming a " worker bee " to help Facebook do this .
Especially since Facebook is now asking your consent to make these links in one fell swoop !
The critical piece here is that the " community pages " are " a page that Facebook controls . "
Even if you 've set the information to private and control who views it , Facebook wants to control the page that your profile links to .
You do n't own it , they do .
This is a big change .
You can't say you went to Central High School without Facebook creating and controlling a hyperlink in your profile and managing the community that you now " belong " to .
That 's a huge power grab , and in a short period of time , these changes will fundamentally alter what Facebook even means .
( As Sister Havana notes , we can expect more astroturf comments . )
::
user control versus corporate interest
The coolest thing about Facebook , and the most promising , was that it allowed people to create impromptu groups , even in some ways , de facto organizations , with people that they did not know .
What the latest changes are doing is changing who controls those organizations .
You do n't control them anymore .
More and more , Facebook does .
What 's more , the way Facebook has set this up , you are inevitably helping Facebook control and commodify your personal information ... and most people who do so wo n't even notice .
Your sharing of a simple piece of information about your degree from , say , the University of Minnesota , allows Facebook to link your profile to a centralized webpage about the University of Minnesota that has " you " in it .
Your right and ability to do something that is central to using Facebook ... sharing information about yourself with your friends , family and peers ... now means that your profile has to be linked to a webpage that Facebook can turn around and sell , promote and market to the world .
Facebook will be able to tell advertisers that Facebook is the single , centralized place where people who are into NASCAR , or White Water Rafting , or worked at 3 M , or attended Harvard ... congregate and can be marketed to .
And they are doing this with our help .
In fact , much of the information they want to use to create these web pages is information we 've already entered into Facebook .
( And as Windowdog notes , this process is not necessarily apparent .. )
Take a look at how Facebook promotes itself :
Facebook
Ads makes it easy and cost - effective to quickly set up and manage your campaign .
G5 found success setting up a series of Facebook Ad campaigns targeted to college students at 21 campuses prior to Summer break for StorQuest self service storage facilities .
Real - time suggested bids for our auction - based system provided guidance that enabled G5 to hone ad effectiveness based on their various targeting filters ( age , college level and location ) .
Original ad placed
The results from StorQuest 's Facebook ad campaign were one of their highest performing online advertising efforts : * Over 50 % increase in same store total rentals versus prior year .
* 10 % conversion rate from visits originating from Facebook Ads .
* On par with Google AdWords on a cost - per - lead and cost - per - customer basis .
* $ 1.25 CPC delivered $ 10.25 cost - per-lead .
* $ 100 average rentals ; $ 600 average life time value per customer .

now Facebook uses us
Instead of you using Facebook , the balance has tilted so that even to use the most basic features of Facebook you have to consent to let Facebook use you .
All this is happening in a way that fundamentally impinges on your freedom to associate without a massive corporation spying on you and then leveraging your life , your resume , your family and your friendships into their commercial enterprise .
That 's chilling .
This is no longer about privacy , it 's about Facebook winning the trust of millions of users and then leveraging that trust so that Facebook the corporation literally owns the links that make up our lives .
If Facebook succeeds in making these pages the central place for information about us ... then anyone using Facebook is working for Facebook the corporation for free .
And whoever owns Facebook , basically owns the keys .
What started on the premise that some fresh - faced college kids were helping people connect , has grown much more greedy and corporate .
We can do something about that .
At a minimum , Facebook users should change our settings to protect our privacy .
However , it seems to me that Facebook users should also consider delinking ourselves from any of these automatic Facebook communities that do n't make sense for us to keep and use .
Each of us will make that choice based on what makes sense for us .
But ultimately that begs the question .
If we can't share what is essentially private information ( the bundle of links and affiliations that make up our lives ) with our family and friends without the bulk of our time on Facebook essentially and increasingly serving the commercial priorities of Facebook the corporation , then why are we on Facebook to begin with ?

Relatives gather around the body of 16 - year - old Aysar Zaben during his funeral in the West Bank village of Almazraa Alsharqiyah near Ramallah May 14 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Mohamad Torokman
RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) -
The body of a Palestinian teenager was found in the occupied West Bank on Friday , and Palestinian police and witnesses said he had been shot dead by Jewish settlers after he threw rocks at their car .
The body of 16 - year - old Aysar Zaben was not found until after midnight , although the incident happened on Thursday on a road near the city of Ramallah , they said .
An Israeli police spokesman said the incident was being investigated but it was not clear exactly what took place or who was responsible .
Witnesses said a group of Palestinian teenagers threw rocks at a car carrying Jewish settlers as they drove past .
The armed settlers then fired at the stone throwers .
The death was the first on either side since Israel and the Palestinians began indirect peace talks on Saturday .
An Israeli army spokesman said that later on Friday , Palestinians had shot at a car belonging to Israelis traveling in the West Bank and that two people were slightly hurt when bullets shattered the car windows .
He said troops were searching the area for suspects .
A Palestinian security source told Reuters the shooting may have been prompted by the killing of the teenager , as it happened in the same area .
“ It appears as if this was a retaliation shooting , ” said the Palestinian source , who declined to be named .
Some 500,000 Jewish settlers and about 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and areas near Jerusalem annexed by Israel after its victory in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
Last week offered a chance to collectively gawp at the super - wealthy .
Mexico's Carlos Slim and the US 's Bill Gates were in a run-off to be the world 's richest billionaire in the Forbes list of the 1,011 people with personal wealth in excess of a billion dollars .
In the event Slim 's $ 53.5 bn just pipped Gates ' $ 53 bn .
It was a moment of symbolism , opined the global commentariat .
The economic baton was passing from the US to countries in Asia and Latin America .
And we all could relax ; the numbers of billionaires was growing again – proof positive that the global economic machine was picking up .
It is the ultimate degeneracy of the age .
There is little critical appraisal of billionairedom .
It is just accepted that loadsamoney , capitalism , jobs and economic progress are indissolubly linked .
More billionaires of any hue is a sign of economic vitality .
Lucky Mexico for coming up with the winner .
But wealth is not connected to economic progress in a linear way .
Wealth can come from productive or unproductive entrepreneurship .
Society wants the former and deplores the latter .
If you want to be seriously wealthy the message from the Forbes list is clear .
One way or another you need to have played the system , played the financial markets , been born to the right class or manipulated government to have got rich .
This is a list of expropriated wealth on a Midas - like scale .
Marx will be grimly smiling in his grave .
Too few of the world 's billionaires can claim to be honest - to - God productive entrepreneurs who have enlarged the economic pie by dint of hard work , imagination , risk taking and innovation – although thankfully a useful proportion do populate the list .
But a depressingly large number constitute a ragbag of monopolists , oligarchs gifted assets and profits by the state , mega - financial engineers or just family plutocrats .
And once on the list you tend to stay there ; there is little churn .
The arteries of capitalism are hardening .
Sixty - two of the 1,011 are Russian oligarchs .
Twenty eight are Turkish oligarchs .
Even Carlos
Slim made his fortune from being the monopolist who controls 90 % of Mexico 's telephone landlines and 80 % of its mobile phone subscribers .
The OECD notes that he charges among the highest usage fees in the world .
But hey !
He is a billionaire and what matters today are his riches – not the manner in which the money is made .
He may have started out as a productive entrepreneur .
Today he is using his power to expropriate wealth on a mega scale .
The contrast with his rival Bill Gates could hardly be greater .
Microsoft may have had its head - to - head confrontation with the EU Commission over anti-competitive practices , but Gates built his company by innovating around one of the great historic general purpose technologies .
Information and communication technology is like the railway , internal combustion engine or air travel – a technology with massive spill - overs and implications for society .
It is a classic example of productive entrepreneurship .
Gates may not deserve $ 53bn , he was lucky to be in the right place at the right time with a great university system around him , but he undoubtedly deserves to be rich .
Both Gates and Slim are exploiting their market position to get above average profits , but one is more overtly political than the other .
Put another way , Gates has grown the economic pie .
Slim represents a tax on it .
The good news for the US is that even if its share of global billionaires has fallen to 40 % , a disproportionately high share are still productive entrepreneurs .
There are figures on the list – like the Walton family riding high on Walmart – who have inherited their money , but most have made their fortunes from socially and economically useful activity and whose profits and market position are being actively challenged in the market place .
A large proportion of the Indian entrepreneurs are in a similar position , although the relationship with the Indian state is sometimes more murky .
Mukesh Ambani , complete with his 70 - storey home in Mumbai , may be extravagantly wealthy at number 4 in the list , but like the number 5 , Lakshmi Mittal ( who has British residence ) he has spawned an industrial empire that is generating jobs and wealth .
The productive entrepreneurship spells long - term good news for the US and India – less so for the countries whose billionaires are politicised oligarchs and monopolists .
But strangely not even Forbes magazine makes much of an effort to distinguish how the billions are made .
The great truth of capitalism is that it took off only once the European Enlightenment created the great institutions that kept it honest – the rule of law , a free press , accountability mechanisms , ways of forcing monopolists to give up their ill - gotten gains , creating competitive markets and elections .
Before that there was tax - farming and the buying and selling of monopolies – rather as in China today .
The Enlightenment offered the means , however imperfect , to challenge all that .
The great mistake of the free - market revolution was to argue that all that was needed to make capitalism work was free , lightly regulated and flexible markets – and that institutions imposing ethics , transparency , accountability got in the way .
We now know better .
Britain's representation in the Forbes list is particularly depressing .
Our members include a bunch of property developers , tax - avoiding retail magnates , the Duke of Westminster , a hedge fund manager and Richard Branson .
Branson is probably the closest we have to a billionaire productive entrepreneur , but his companies are hardly at the forefront of technological innovation or employment generation .
He glamorises – but does little to grow the economy .
We do not have one genuinely productive entrepreneur on the list .
In many respects this forms the heart of the British crisis .
Our political class bought the proposition that whatever the source of wealth economic progress would follow , celebrating the Mayfair hedge fund manager more than the genuine innovator .
Watch the British government now fight on behalf of hedge funds against EU regulation .
Only at the eleventh hour , with some of Lord Mandelson 's speeches and initiatives , together with David Cameron commissioning a useful report from the entrepreneur James Dyson , Ingenious Britain , is there any sign of change .
But it is a deathbed conversion .
The electorate , angry and bewildered , want a conversation about creating wealth and jobs , rewarding those that do rather than those that speculate and rig markets .
Instead they are offered platitudes and bromides .

We 've known for a couple of years or so that one of the impressive - sounding environmental promises that governments are signed up to - the pledge to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss significantly by 2010 - is n't going to be met .
Now , an analysis just published in the journal Science is giving us detail on some important dimensions of the problem .
It 's particularly timely , as we are now on the path towards October 's UN biodiversity convention summit in Nagoya , Japan .
There you can expect all of these bones to be picked over , and some new targets to be set .
If you 've been following the issue , the basic pattern should be familiar .
Numbers of species , size of populations , diversity within ecosystems : all these are going down .
Habitat loss , the spread of harmful alien species , depletion of fish stocks : all these are going up .
Joining the dots and concluding that the second batch of things causes the first is n't a leap of deduction likely gain you a Nobel Prize .
The Science paper , compiled by an impressive array of scientists across disciplines led by Stuart Butchart from the UN's World Conservation Monitoring Centre and BirdLife International , does three things that may prove useful .
• It sorts out what we know and what we do n't know , and in which regions
• It refines measurements of how the various threats are changing
• It puts all of this together in a global whole
As usual , the global picture that scientists would like to have is in reality a patchwork of local and regional pixels , with the added constraint that the time - line for measurements in many parts of the world starts only a few decades ago .
If the availability of good data on something as simple as temperature is patchy across the world , imagine how much patchier it is when it comes to issues such as the rate of nitrogen deposition or the changing abundance of birds .
Where things can be assessed from published data - for example , the size of protected areas declared by governments - you can obviously get a more precise figure than where you have to go out and do field measurements in 270 patches of forest with four day of hiking between them .
So , for example , the researchers concluded that the spread of invasive alien species can only really be assessed in Europe at this stage .
Some fisheries records are only usable from 1997 .
Just 16 countries submitted data on the extent of seagrass in their waters .
So you get the picture - a fragmented one , at best .
Nevertheless , some trends are clearly discernible , both downwards and upwards .
Picking out some examples , Dr Butchart tells the BBC's Science in Action programme :
" In my lifetime , the condition of coral reefs has declined by 40 % , animal populations have declined by a third , and we 've lost 20 % of the extent of mangroves and seagrasses . "
Arguably , the drivers of biodiversity loss are more important than the biodiversity trends themselves .
After all , society is not deliberately trying to send species extinct - it 's trying to clothe itself and feed itself and get itself around faster and so on - and as long as society continues trying to do these things faster and faster using the same technologies and materials , you 'd logically expect biodiversity loss to keep on going .
Of these drivers , the spread of alien species , the impacts of climatic change , loss of habitat and the over - exploitation of fish stocks are all trending inexorably upwards - the only exception is nitrogen deposition , which appeared to reach a plateau around 1990 , although some would argue it's on the way up again now .
Despite the limitations of the data available , governments are undoubtedly better informed about biodiversity decline and its causes than at any time in the past .
There 's no room left to claim " we do n't understand the problem " .
But the problem is closely tied to human development - the rising population , the rising use of resources , eating more food , building more roads , using more energy .
Halting these implies a cost : which is why there 's growing interest now in documenting the costs of not halting them - of totting up the value that intact ecosystems bring , and what it would cost to replace the services they provide .
There 'll be more on this along during the year .
But Dr Butchart has another , much simpler point :
" All nature has intrinsic value .
What right have we got to drive hundreds of thousands of species extinct and deny our children , grandchildren or future generations the opportunity to benefit from and appreciate the species around us ? "
Whether we have the right or not , it 's exactly what we are doing , as this Science paper shows us in greater detail than ever before .
Greetings fellow Sackboys !
With the announcement of LittleBigPlanet 2 last week , we know you have a ton of questions for us .
Add to that , all the new PLAY elements , CREATE tools and SHARE evolutions we want to tell you about .
So , we thought we ’d answer a lot of the repeating questions we ’ve seen on all the web comments out there .
In weeks to come , expect more and more detailed tid-bits , new LBP2 news , special announcements and other good stuff from our team …
Backwards Compatibility
Are the LittleBigPlanet DLC costumes going to be compatible with LBP2 ?
Yes , any LBP1 costumes purchased on the PlayStation Store will be compatible with LittleBigPlanet 2 –
We ca n’t wait to see you what you guys do with the various costumes combined with the new cinematic tools !
I hope this is on a FAQ – are the first LBP and GOTY edition levels going to be included with LBP2 ?
The wonderfully fun LBP1 story levels will remain unique to its Blu-ray disc , but you ’ll see familiar elements / tools / items as part of the foundation for LittleBigPlanet 2 .
And while the community levels will be unique to the GOTY edition – hopefully if you guys vote for us again , you ’ll see something similar in the future …
Will any of the new costume DLC that will be released after LBP2 is released be compatable with the first game ?
LittleBigPlanet 2 has been redesigned with a completely new graphics engine , so costumes and upcoming DLC designed for LittleBigPlanet 2 will not be compatible for LBP1 players .
Will all the costumes / stickers / decoration / DLC we collected in LBP1 be usable in LBP2 ?
We ’re working hard to ensure that everything you ’ve collected from LittleBigPlanet can be used in the new game .
Certainly anything you ’ve picked up from the PSN Store will be fully present and correct in LittleBigPlanet 2 , the only time something might not quite work perfectly is if it has been created by another player using a ‘ glitched ’ object of some kind .
Even then we ’re optimistic that all of the existing content you ’ve collected will continue to work .
DLC
Any idea when we ’ll be getting that Sephiroth skin ?
Nothing confirmed yet , but do n’t worry we still have this in our plans …
Whatever happened to the Marvel Comics themed costume pack that was supposed to come out a year or so ago ?
I REALLY wanted a Wolverine Sackboy and it ’s quite disheartening that something so cool was announced and shown and then never mentioned again .
We announced the partnership at Comic - Con last year ( but no release date ) .
It takes a bit of production time to get everything lined up , but hopefully you ’ll hear some announcements soon .
Will LBP2 include from launch day all the DLC of LBP1 ?
Including costumes level packs and all that good stuff ?
Because of the backwards compatibility for LBP1 DLC , all the costumes on the PlayStation Store will still be available for purchase .
Expect to see a ton more content in the next few months , including the eventual LittleBigPlanet 2 DLC .
Future Tech Will it be in 720 p or 1080 p ?
LittleBigPlanet 2 is getting a completely new graphical overhaul , so stay tuned for a future LittleBigPlanet 2 post , where we ’ll cover off on more specifics like this .
PLAY elements Sackboy , no matter what costumes he wears still looks like Sackboy in LBP1 , seeing the new costumes in LBP2 has this idea been lost ?
Some of the new costumes we ’ve shown for LittleBigPlanet 2 are certainly unconventional , but then Sackboy has an eclectic wardrobe taste .
At the end of the day however , he ’s still Sackboy and we ’ll be sticking close to making him look that way no matter what the costume .
Will Stephen
Fry be narrating it again ?
Yes , your ( and our ) favorite narrator will be back for LittleBigPlanet 2 .
Will this game have the 50 levels single player like the first game or is this just a big create kit ?
LittleBigPlanet 2 is a whole new game , so just like the original you get a full storyline for Sackboy to play thru .
Add to that the endless possibilities of the evolved Create and Share modes , where you ’ll see completely different gameplay experiences in the community levels .
CREATE tools Can I electrify / set things on fire using switches and logic ?
What has happened to emitters in LBP2 ?
Are they much easier to use ?
Has dissolve material changed ?
How many layers will there be and what different types ?
Expect some lots more details about CREATE mode at this year ’s E3 .
I heard of custom Voice Acting .
Confirm or Deny . Confirm !
Sackbots Does Sackbot have to look like a robot or can I change his form to any creature ?
Nope , Sackbots are totally customizable , from their reactions to their clothing / skins .
Just to double check , we ’ll be able to have evil Sackboys as bad guys ?
There ’s no such thing as an evil Sackboy – just some mischievious ones … Sackbots , on the other hand , can have a mind of their own .
Can you program Sackbots to activate swithces ?
* Example * giving them jobs on a pirate ship .
Stay tuned , we have a specific “ Sackbots ” feature planned in an upcoming LittleBigPlanet 2 post – we just hope you provide your Pirate Sackbots the proper minimum wages :)
General I just saw the LBP2 box art pop up on Twitter … Why did n’t you guys post it here ?
Glad you noticed , but do n’t get too attached to that piece of art –
It ’s something we put together from the artwork created for an exclusive EDGE Magazine cover article .
And while we love it , its definitely NOT final box art .
Are you guys going to be at E3 ?
I hope so , every gamer in the world needs to see LBP2 !
Of course we ’ll be at E3 , the bigger question is …will you ?
Will there be a Sackboy costume contest again ?
I sure hope so , we had so many great entries last time .
And now that we have more fans and more people familiar with what can be done , we ca n’t imagine how creative you guys can get .
Stay tuned .
Will there be any pre-order goodies ?
Yup .
Expect announcements later down the line .
We have to make sure all the “ i”s are dotted and “ t ”s are crossed .
What is the name of the song on the video .
I ca n’t get it out of my mind !
The song “ Sleepyhead ” is from the group Passion Pit .
And we ’re glad you all like it !
Hopefully this will answer a lot of questions out there , if not , feel free to ask and we ’ll start up another FAQ session …
I phoned Rami Elhanan the other day .
We had not spoken for six years and much has happened in Israel and Palestine .
Rami is an Israeli graphic designer who lives with his family in Jerusalem .
His father survived Auschwitz .
His grandparents and six aunts and uncles perished in the Holocaust .
Whenever I am asked about heroes , I say Rami and his wife , Nurit , without hesitation .
Soon after we met , Rami gave me a home videotape that was difficult to watch .
It shows his daughter Smadar , aged 14 , throwing her head back , laughing and playing the piano .
" She loved to dance , " he said .
On the afternoon of 4 September 1997 , Smadar and her best friend , Sivane , had auditions for admission to a dance school .
She had argued that morning with her mother , who was anxious about her going to the centre of Jerusalem .
" I did n't want to row , " said Nurit , " so I let her go . "
Rami was in his car when he turned on the radio to catch the three o'clock news .
There had been a suicide bombing in Ben Yehuda shopping precinct .
More than 200 people were injured and several were dead .
Within minutes , his mobile phone rang .
It was Nurit , crying .
They searched the hospitals in vain , then the morgue ; and so began , as Rami describes it , their " descent into darkness " .
Rami and Nurit are two of the founders of the Parents Circle , or Bereaved Families Forum , which brings together Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones .
" It 's painful to acknowledge , " he said , " but there is no basic moral difference between the [ Israeli ] soldier at the checkpoint who prevents a woman who is having a baby from going through , causing her to lose the baby , and the man who killed my daughter .
And just as my daughter was a victim [ of the occupation ] , so was he . "
Rami describes the Israeli occupation and the dispossession of Palestinians as a " cancer in our heart " .
Nothing changes , he says , until the occupation ends .
Open your eyes
Every " Jerusalem Day " - the day Israel celebrates its military conquest of the city - Rami has stood in the street with a photograph of Smadar and crossed Israeli and Palestinian flags , and people have spat at him and told him it is a pity he was not blown up , too .
And yet he and Nurit and their comrades have made ­extraordinary gains .
Rami goes to Israeli schools with a Palestinian member of the group , and they show maps of what ought to be Palestine , and they hug each other .
" This is like an earthquake to children who have been socialised and manipulated into hating , " he said .
" They say to us , ' You have opened my eyes . ' "
In October , Rami and Nurit sat in the Israeli high court as the state counsel , " stammering , unprepared and unkempt " , wrote Nurit , " stood like a platoon commander in charge of new recruits and refuted . . . allegations " .
Salwa and Bassam Aramin , Palestinian parents , were there , too .
Tears streaked Salwa 's face .
Their ten - year - old daughter , Abir Aramin , was killed by an Israeli soldier firing a rubber bullet point - blank at her small head as she stood beside a kiosk buying sweets with her sister .
The judges seemed bored and one of them remarked that Israeli soldiers were rarely indicted , so it would be best to forget it .
The state counsel laughed .
This was normal .
“ Our children , " said Nurit , at a rally last December to mark the first anniversary of the Israeli assault on Gaza , " have learned this year that all the disgusting qualities which anti-Semites attribute to Jews are actually manifested among our leaders : deceit , greed and the murder of children . . .
What values of beauty and goodness can we squeeze into such a sophisticated apparatus of brainwashing and reality distortion ? "
Rami now tells me the high court has decided to investigate the case of Abir Aramin after all .
This is not normal : it is a victory .
“ Where are the other victories ? " I asked him .
“ In America last year , a Palestinian and I spoke five times a day in front of thousands .
There is a big shift in American public opinion , and that 's where the hope lies .
It 's only pressure from outside Israel - from Jews especially - that will end this nightmare .
People in the west must know that while there is a silence , this looking away , this profane abuse of Israel 's critics as anti-Jew , they are no different from those who stood aside during the days of the Holocaust . "
Guilty silence
Since Israel 's onslaught on Lebanon in 2006 , its devastation of Gaza in 2008 - 2009 , and Mossad 's recent political murder in Dubai , the criminality of the Israeli state has been impossible to disguise .
On 11 February , the influential Reut Institute in Tel Aviv reported to the Israeli cabinet , which it advises , that violence had failed to achieve Israel 's ends and had produced worldwide revulsion instead .
“ In last year 's Gaza operation , " the report said , " our superior military power was offset by an offensive on Israel 's legitimacy that led to a significant setback in our international standing and will constrain future Israeli military planning and operations . "
In other words , proof of the murderous , racist toll of Zionism has been an epiphany for many people ; justice for the Palestinians , wrote the expatriate Israeli musician Gilad Atzmon , is now " at the heart of the battle for a better world " .
However , his fellow Jews in western countries , such as Britain and Australia , whose influence is critical , are still mostly silent , still looking away , still accepting , as Nurit said , the " brainwashing and reality distortion " .
And yet the responsibility to speak out could not be clearer , and the lessons of history - family history for many - ensure that it renders them culpable should their silence persist .
For inspiration , I recommend the moral courage of Rami and Nurit .
Children deserve a significant relationship with both of their fit and willing biological parents .

HOUSTON , May 28 ( Reuters ) - A one - year delay on new deepwater projects stemming from the Gulf of Mexico well rupture could cut world oil supply by 500,000 barrels per day between 2013 to 2017 , Bernstein Research said in a note to clients on Friday .
“ Although this may seem small in a global context , such a situation would decrease OPEC spare capacity , especially in the second half of the decade , which would lead to an increase in the oil price , ” the firm wrote .
Still , it is unclear if this is a likely scenario , Bernstein wrote .
The world consumes more than 80 million barrels per day of crude oil .
On Thursday , the U.S. government extended a moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits to six months and announced a safety crackdown that includes the temporary suspension of exploratory drilling on 33 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico .
[ ID : nLDE64R00P ]
Bernstein said delays and new regulatory costs could boost the marginal costs of new deepwater production by about 10 percent .
The moratorium extension will have “ a huge near term negative impact to the Gulf Coast deepwater oil service industry , ” Bernstein said .
The drilling ban was put in place after a BP Plc BP.LBP.N well ruptured in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 .
The accident sank the Deepwater Horizon rig , killed 11 workers and is estimated to be the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
New deepwater regulations are likely and the hit from the U.S. drilling moratorium will affect drilling worldwide , Bernstein said .
It is “ highly likely ” that deepwater rigs will have to adopt global standards to work in basins around the world , the firm said .

GLENWOOD SPRINGS —
A juvenile who was accused of selling his father ’s medical marijuana agreed to a plea deal Wednesday in Garfield County Court .
The juvenile pleaded guilty to possession of between 1 ounce and 8 ounces of marijuana , which prosecutors say belonged to the child ’s father , who has a prescription for medical marijuana .
Carbondale police arrested the juvenile after he allegedly sold an unspecified amount of the marijuana at Carbondale Middle School .
It was unclear whether the juvenile was a student at the middle school .
“ I think this is an unintentional consequence from the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes , ” said Deputy District Attorney Tony Hershey .
Hershey agreed to drop the original charges of distribution and possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana as part of the plea deal and recommended a deferred judgment in the case , saying that this kind of drug offense on the juvenile ’s record could affect his life in many ways for years to come .
“ This is a big break , ” Hershey said .
“ But it ’s a one - time break , and I hope ( they ) see that . ”
The student has been expelled from school and was placed on home detention after the arrest .
However , Garfield County Judge Paul Metzger agreed to release the juvenile from home detention after contacting the probation department .
Further specifics of the incident and subsequent arrest were not available because juvenile records are sealed .

Es ist Wahlkampf in NRW und mit Andreas Krautscheid hat Mr. Angriff das Generalsekretariat der CDU in Düsseldorf übernommen .
Kaum im
Amt folgt schon die erste Attacke in Sachen Miet - Mich - Rüttgers .
Es geht gegen die Presse .
Genauer , gegen zwei Blogs .
Genauer gegen Wir - in - nrw - blog .de und uns , die Ruhrbarone .
Mir wirft Krautscheid zum Beispiel öffentlich vor , geschrieben zu haben : Allerdings werde Hannelore Kraft im Wahlkampf auch NRW - Ministerpräsident Jürgen Rüttgers ( CDU ) helfen , „ dem im Wahlkampf noch jede Menge böser Enthüllungen drohen .
Allein in den kommenden zwei Wochen stehen dem Mann einige miese Überraschungen bevor , vor denen ich jetzt schon Angst hätte , wenn ich er wäre .
Nach Ansicht von Krautscheid ist das eine Drohung , die sich auf illegal beschaffte Daten beruft , die aus der CDU - Zentrale durchgestochen wurden .
Das steht heute so in zig Zeitungen .
Laut Handelsblatt sagte Krautscheid bespielsweise : Vor allem im Auge hat Krautscheid die Blogs " Wir in NRW " und " Ruhrbarone " , die in der Vergangenheit aus internem CDU - Material berichtet hatten .
" Ruhrbarone " habe mit weiteren Enthüllungen gedroht , so Krautscheid .
" Es ist eine neue Qualität , dass ein Blog mit geklauten E - Mails arbeitet " , sagte der CDU - Mann .
Ähnliche Töne in der WAZ und sonst wo .
Die FAZ fügte noch die falsche Information hinzu , ich hätte den entscheidenden Satz hier bei den Ruhrbaronen gelöscht .
Was ein Unfug .
Natürlich lösche ich den Satz nicht .
Es wird Zeit , den “ Joseph Fouché ” der Landesregierung über uns aufzuklären .

Ähnliche Töne in der WAZ und sonst wo .
Die FAZ fügte noch die falsche Information hinzu , ich hätte den entscheidenden Satz hier bei den Ruhrbaronen gelöscht .
Was ein Unfug .
Natürlich lösche ich den Satz nicht .
Es wird Zeit , den “ Joseph Fouché ” der Landesregierung über uns aufzuklären .
Wir arbeiten hier bei den Ruhrbaronen mit allen Informationen , die es wert sind veröffentlicht zu werden .
Unabhängig vom Ansehen der Person .
Wenn Hannelore Kraft ( SPD )
Mist macht , berichten wir das .
Wenn Silvana Koch - Mehrin ( FDP ) zu faul für ihr Mandat ist , schreiben wir das auf .
Wir halten es da mit der Freiheit .
Und dazu gehört es eben auch , Sachen zu bringen , die den Herrschenden nicht gefallen .
Es ist geradezu unsere Aufgabe Verborgenes zu enthüllen .
Krautscheid hat nun Anzeige gegen unbekannt erstattet , um gegen die Enthüllungen vorzugehen .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft soll im Auftrag von Rüttgers die Quellen der Informationen herausfinden und verstopfen .
Das lässt mich kalt .
Mich hat mal der Stromkonzern RWE verklagt , weil ich eine geheimes Schriftstück des Energieriesen aus dem Aufsichtsrat veröffentlicht habe .
Auch da war der Vorwurf „ Beihilfe zum Geheimnisverrat “ .
Ich habe vor dem Hamburger Landgericht gewonnen .
Selbstverständlich hätten wir auch die Emails aus der CDU - Landeszentrale gebracht , die den Miet - Mich - Rüttgers - Skandal enthüllt hätten .
Wir wären stolz darauf , dieses Geheimnis der Allgemeinheit zugänglich zu machen .
Allein , wir waren es nicht , das war der Spiegel .
Will Krautscheid eine neue Spiegel - Affäre ?
Es ist nicht nur unsere Aufgabe als Blog , sondern die Aufgabe der ganzen freien Presse , geheime Emails zu veröffentlichen , wenn damit solche Skandale wie der um den Miet - Mich - Rüttgers aufgedeckt werden .
Krautscheid fordert von uns , keine Informationen im Sinne und zum Nutzen der Öffentlichkeit zu verwenden , die aus dubiosen Quellen kommen .
Wie bigott diese Argumentation ist , zeigt ein Beispiel :
Vor ein paar Tagen hat die CDU - Landesregierung eine CD gekauft , auf der Steuerdaten von Leuten sind , die ihr Geld in der Schweiz geparkt haben .
Wir wissen nicht mal , ob es dabei immer um Steuerhinterziehung geht .
Trotzdem hat die Landesregierung dem Dieb aus der Schweiz 2,5 Mio. Euro für die geklauten Informationen bezahlt .
Wir haben für unsere Informationen nichts bezahlt .
Keinen Pfennig .
Aber wir sind laut Krautscheid die Bösen .
Bigott .
Krautscheid fordert nicht weniger als das Ende des investigativen Journalismus .
Wie glaubt Krautscheid eigentlich , soll Pressearbeit oder Blog - Öffentlichkeit aussehen ?
So handzahm und devot wie der klare - kante - blog ?
Sollen wir nur noch berichten , was er nächtens im Scheine seiner Schreibtischlampe genehmigt hat ?
Nein , Herr Krautscheid , das wird nicht passieren .
Wir berichten , was es sich in unseren Augen lohnt zu berichten und nicht das , was Ihnen in den Kram passt .
Ich hatte geschrieben , dass Rüttgers Angst haben muss , vor den drohenden Enthüllungen , die sicher kommen werden .
Und offensichtlich habe ich mit diesem Pfeil genau das Auge des Bullen getroffen .
Rüttgers und seine Wahlkampfzentrale haben Angst vor uns Blogs .
Weil wir nicht einzunorden sind .
Weil wir unabhängig sind und bleiben .
Aber nicht nur vor uns haben Rüttgers und Kumpels Bange .
Sie fürchten ihre eigenen Untergebenen .
Die Leute , die sie jahrelang unterdrückt , die sie gemobbt , die sie am Ende gefeuert haben .
Denn diese Menschen aus dem Innersten der CDU sind es , die heute die Informationen unter großer persönlicher Gefahr nach draußen tragen .
Das sind die fast durchweg aufrechte und wertkonservative Menschen , die Angst haben vor einer Regierung , die in ihrem Kern nur noch aus Rüttgers , Krautscheid und dem Ex-Militär Boris Berger besteht .
Das sind Menschen , die nicht wollen , dass die Regierung ihre Macht zum persönlichen Vorteil nutzt .
Das sind Bürger , die sich Gedanken machen um die Presse in NRW .
Das sind Demokraten , die im Dienste des Volkes persönliche Nachteile in Kauf nehmen .
Das sind keine Verräter .
In meinen Augen ist es absurd , diese Menschen mit Dieben zu vergleichen und mit der Polizei zu hetzen .
Die Anzeigen von Rüttgers und Co zeigen nur wieder , wie weit die Regierung unter diesem Ministerpräsidenten bereit ist , zu gehen .
Im Dienste der Macht wird mitten im Wahlkampf die Strafverfolgung als Staatswaffe eingesetzt , um die eigene Position abzusichern .
Diese Methode zeigt deutlich , wie moralisch zweifelhaft Rüttgers und Co agieren .
Krautscheid sagt laut eigener Pressemitteilung wörtlich :
Wir wollen mit Hilfe der Staatsanwaltschaft lediglich verhindern , dass illegal ausgespähte Daten zum Gegenstand von Wahlkampfauseinandersetzungen zwischen Parteien werden .
Warum ist es nicht das Problem , dass ich mir Rüttgers für ein Tete - a- Tete mieten könnte , wenn ich wollte .
Warum ist es das Problem , dass jemand diesen Miet - Service enthüllt ?
Uahhh .
Ich muss mich schütteln .
Mit seinen Vorwürfen will Fouché - Krautscheid nur ablenken .
Denn er weiß , dass da noch was kommt .
Dass da noch was Böses kommt .
Krautscheid will vorab diffamieren , um sich nachher nicht rechtfertigen zu müssen .
Das ist seine Kommunikationsstrategie .
Er will die Überbringer der Nachrichten in ein schlechtes Licht rücken .
Mehr hat er nicht mehr in der Hand .
Er will , dass sich WAZ , FAZ und Co nicht auf Blogs als Quellen berufen .
Mehr nicht .
Dabei übersieht Krautscheid leider , dass die bösen Stories nicht nur beim Wir - in - nrw - blog oder bei uns erscheinen .
Sondern in allen möglichen Medien .
Wer weiß , wo der nächste Schlag herkommt .
Ich hab keine Ahnung .
Ich bin mir nur sicher , dass was kommt .
Denn Wahlen sind das in der Demokratie vorgesehen Regulativ für mieses Verhalten .
Wann also wenn nicht jetzt , sollte jemand seine Meinung über Rüttgers kundtun .
Jetzt könnten diese Informationen Gewicht haben .
Darüber sollten der Ministerpräsident , sein Offizier Berger und sein Fouché Krautscheid nachdenken .
Wir jedenfalls werden nicht klein bei geben .
Das haben wir noch nie getan .
Wir bleiben unbequem .
Deswegen hat uns NRW - Umwelt - und Märchenminister Eckhard Uhlenberg in Sachen PFT - Skandal ja auch schon mal vor dem Landtag angegriffen .
Hier zur Erinnerung seine Tirade gegen die Ruhrbarone im Film .

( CNN ) --
The deaths of at least 25 workers in a West Virginia coal mine this week have turned a harsh spotlight on the safety record of the mine 's owner , which has paid record fines for safety and environmental violations .
Virginia - based Massey Energy Co. has racked up millions of dollars in penalties in recent years .
The Montcoal , West Virginia , mine where Monday 's fatal explosion took place received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009 , and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected , according to federal mine safety records .
The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration hit the company with nearly $ 900,000 in fines in 2009 and has sought more than $ 100,000 in the first quarter of 2010 .
Inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010 , including six times for " unwarrantable failure " to correct violations .
" They had a doubling of the number of site citations from 2008 to 2009 and a doubling or a tripling of the penalties , " said Davitt McAteer , who led the Mine Safety and Health Administration during the Clinton administration .
" What that suggests to you is ... that there are problems here and that those problems are not being addressed . "
Massey Energy has paid less than $ 200,000 of the penalties assessed at the Upper Big Branch South Mine in Montcoal and is challenging some of the penalties .
Its CEO , Don Blankenship , told CNN that his company 's facilities are " typically in better shape than others in the area or in the country . "
" We would take great exception to the fact that someone would claim Massey 's mines are n't generally safer than competitor coal mines , " he said .
He said the company was " uncomfortable " with the number of violations reported , but said tighter enforcement has driven up the numbers of violations across the industry since the Sago Mine disaster that killed 12 men in 2006 in Tallmansville , West Virginia .
" Certainly violations are a bad indicator , but they 're not a sole source for judging safety performance , " Blankenship said .
Massey Energy is the fourth - largest American coal producer and the largest mine operator in central Appalachia .
It churned out 38 million tons of coal in 2009 , 1.2 million tons of which came from the Upper Big Branch South Mine , and reported earnings of $ 497 million .
Its annual corporate " social responsibility report " says that safety is its No. 1 concern and that its employees " are the best - trained , most productive , and safest miners in the world . "
But McAteer said on CNN's " American Morning " that " some companies , and this appears to be one , take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it 's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people 's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes , comply with the laws . "
Monday 's explosion at the Upper Big Branch South Mine was the fourth fatal accident there in 12 years .
In addition , a 2006 fire killed two miners in the Alma Mine No. 1 , operated by Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal Co. Aracoma pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges in connection with the fire and paid a record $ 4.2 million in fines and civil penalties .
In January 2008 , Massey paid $ 20 million in fines for Clean Water Act violations at coal mines in West Virginia and Kentucky .
Federal regulators accused the company of violating its Clean Water Act permits more than 4,500 times between January 2000 and December 2006 , sometimes discharging more than 10 times the allowable amounts of metals , sediment and acids into rivers and lakes in those states .
And another Massey subsidiary paid more than $ 3.5 million in state and federal penalties after about 250 million gallons of coal sludge spilled into rivers and streams around Inez , Kentucky , in 2000 .
Federal investigators determined that the company could have prevented the spill .
Industry analyst Ellen Smith said the safety record of Massey mines has improved " as a whole " over the past few years , and three installations won safety awards in 2009 .
" That said , there are troubling issues here at this particular mine where the explosion happened , " said Smith , managing editor of the trade publication Mine Safety and Health News .
Smith said that what raises the biggest red flags at the Upper Big Branch South Mine , which employs about 200 miners , are " unwarrantable failure " violations , which include citations involving escape routes for miners and air quality ventilation , according to Mine Safety and Health Administration records .
" One mine that we looked at for comparison purposes had two unwarrantable failure violations last year , but it had 500 miners underground .
It was working a lot of hours , " Smith said .
" Another mine we looked at was a West Virginia mine , and I think they had six unwarrantable failure violations in one year , where this particular mine -- not Massey in general , but this particular mine -- had six unwarrantable failures since January . "
Massey operates 44 underground and surface mines , and controls 2.2 billion tons of coal reserves in West Virginia , Kentucky , Virginia and Tennessee .
A post on its
Web site touts the company 's 2009 safety record , saying it " marked the sixth consecutive year and the 17th year out of the past 20 years in which Massey 's safety performance was stronger than the industry average . "
CNN 's Scott Bronstein contributed to this report .
Lindsay Lohan started another fight in a club — this time with New York Ranger skaters Aaron Voros and Sean Avery at 1Oak .
The troubled starlet threw a drink over Voros ’ model girlfriend , Jessica Stam , and then tried to get all three thrown out of the Wildfox fall - collection party the other night .
A spy relates , “ Lindsay threw a fit because she wanted to be at their table near the DJ .
But she claimed she did n’t want to sit with Aaron and said , ‘ He ’s my ex-boyfriend .
I do n’t want him anywhere near me . ’
Voros denied knowing her .
A drink then flew in Jessica ’s face , and Lindsay demanded their table be moved out .
Club bosses refused and tried to calm her down .
Stam , Voros and Avery were shocked but did n’t retaliate , and Lindsay left shortly afterward . ”
We await Lohan ’s inevitable denial , but we have multiple witnesses .
A different source said “ Lindsay threw a fit .
There was total drama for absolutely no reason . ”
This is the first post in my daily journal about growing CBD rich strain “ ACDC “ .
ACDC is reported as being a 20:1 CBD to THC ration strain .
This simply means if your CBD gross weight of dried flower is 20 % , your THC percentage should be around 1 % .
CBD is the healing and “ Non - head high ” cannabinoid found in the marijuana flower , THC obviously is the “ Heady ” high part of the high or medicating effect of medical marijuana .
ACDC is supposedly comprised of 2 Old - School strains – G13 and MKUltra .
ACDC is also reported to be a pure 50/50 Indica sativa hybrid too .
I donated for this somewhat hard to find cbd clone locally in the san fernando valley and I got it a little early with no roots showing past the bottom of the rockwool cube .
This is the first picture i’m posting of “ Baby ACDC ”
For the past four years , the founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) has been doing battle with a Christian subculture that , he believes , is trying to Christianize the U.S. armed forces with the help of a complicit Pentagon brass .
He calls it the " fundamentalist Christian parachurch - military - corporate - proselytizing complex , " a mouthful by which he means holy warriors in contempt of the constitutional barrier between church and state .
The root of the problem , Weinstein believes , is a cluster of well - funded groups dedicated to Christianizing the military and proselytizing abroad .
Today is Memorial Day in the U.S. , a day to honor the men and women who have given their lives in our military .
I want to do something a bit different for Memorial Day this year and honor an Air Force veteran who is still with us : , a true hero .
Weinstein founded the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) four years ago and has been the most influential defender of church - state separation in the U.S. military since that time .
His organization has often worked alongside groups such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State on cases involving military personnel .
wrote an excellent piece on Weinstein forlast week , and I cannot recommend it enough for those who may have missed it .
Not only does it describe how Weinstein became interested in this form of activism and highlight some of his recent accomplishments , but it serves as a wake - up call to those who are still reluctant to acknowledge the well organized efforts to Christianize the U.S. armed forces .
I have praised Weinstein and the MRFF here many times , as he often seems to be the only thing standing in the way of a Christian extremist military .
Glain quotes Weinstein as saying that the scariest part of the efforts to remake the U.S. military as a Christian extremist force is that it " is it 's going on not with the blind eye of the Pentagon but with its full and totally enthusiastic support . "
From what I 've read in , this certainly seems to be the case .
Weinstein and his organization helped in Spc. 's suit over being forced to participate in public prayer sessions , were key in getting Trijicon to stop engraving bible references on the rifle scopes they were selling to the U.S. military , and persuaded the Pentagon to rescind an invitation to have Christian extremistspeak at a National Day of Prayer Task Force service .
He will likely next take up the case of , a Muslim at Fort Hood , TX , who says that he has been harassed and subjected to anti-Islamic bigotry since the on - base shooting .
One of the things I found most interesting about Glain 's profile was the revelation that most of Weinstein 's clients are Christian soldiers , Catholics and mainline Protestants , who are being harassed by evangelical superiors .
From Sharlet's , I can see the fingerprints of " The Family " all over this .
In fact , the names of the organizations Weinstein provides in the article are the same Family - affiliated groups Sharlet describes .
This is more than a little distressing , and it makes me appreciate Weinstein 's efforts all the more .
Every now and then , you see people arguing over whether atheism is a “ religion . ”
As I touch on elsewhere , in “ Purpose and Pragmatism , ” arguing over the meaning of a word nearly always means that you ’ve lost track of the original question .
1
How might this argument arise to begin with ?
An atheist is holding forth , blaming “ religion ” for the Inquisition , the Crusades , and various conflicts with or within Islam .
The religious one may reply , “ But atheism is also a religion , because you also have beliefs about God ; you believe God does n’t exist . ”
Then the atheist answers , “ If atheism is a religion , then not collecting stamps is a hobby , ” and the argument begins .
Or the one may reply , “ But horrors just as great were inflicted by Stalin , who was an atheist , and who suppressed churches in the name of atheism ; therefore you are wrong to blame the violence on religion . ”
Now the atheist may be tempted to reply , “ No true Scotsman , ” saying , “ Stalin ’s religion was Communism . ”
The religious one answers “ If Communism is a religion , then Star Wars fandom is a government , ” and the argument begins .
Should a “ religious ” person be defined as someone who has a definite opinion about the existence of at least one God , e.g. , assigning a probability lower than 10 % or higher than 90 % to the existence of Zeus ?
Or should a “ religious ” person be defined as someone who has a positive opinion ( say , a probability higher than 90 % ) on the existence of at least one God ?
In the former case , Stalin was “ religious ” ; in the latter case , Stalin was “ not religious . ”
But this is exactly the wrong way to look at the problem .
What you really want to know — what the argument was originally about — is why , at certain points in human history , large groups of people were slaughtered and tortured , ostensibly in the name of an idea .
Redefining a word wo n’t change the facts of history one way or the other .
Communism was a complex catastrophe , and there may be no single why , no single critical link in the chain of causality .
But if I had to suggest an ur - mistake , it would be . . . well , I ’ll let God say it for me :
If your brother , the son of your father or of your mother , or your son or daughter , or the spouse whom you embrace , or your most intimate friend , tries to secretly seduce you , saying , “ Let us go and serve other gods , ” unknown to you or your ancestors before you , gods of the peoples surrounding you , whether near you or far away , anywhere throughout the world , you must not consent , you must not listen to him ; you must show him no pity , you must not spare him or conceal his guilt .
No , you must kill him , your hand must strike the first blow in putting him to death and the hands of the rest of the people following .
You must stone him to death , since he has tried to divert you from Yahweh your God .
— Deuteronomy 13:7 –11 , emphasis added
This was likewise the rule which Stalin set for Communism , and Hitler for Nazism : if your brother tries to tell you why Marx is wrong , if your son tries to tell you the Jews are not planning world conquest , then do not debate him or set forth your own evidence ; do not perform replicable experiments or examine history ; but turn him in at once to the secret police .
I suggested that one key to resisting an affective death spiral is the principle of “ burdensome details ” — just remembering to question the specific details of each additional nice claim about the Great Idea .
2
This would n’t get rid of the halo effect , but it would hopefully reduce the resonance to below criticality , so that one nice - sounding claim triggers less than 1.0 additional nice - sounding claims , on average .
The diametric opposite of this advice , which sends the halo effect supercritical , is when it feels wrong to argue against any positive claim about the Great Idea .
Politics is the mind - killer .
Arguments are soldiers .
Once you know which side you ’re on , you must support all favorable claims , and argue against all unfavorable claims .
Otherwise it ’s like giving aid and comfort to the enemy , or stabbing your friends in the back .
If . . .
. . . you feel that contradicting someone else who makes a flawed nice claim in favor of evolution would be giving aid and comfort to the creationists ;
. . . you feel like you get spiritual credit for each nice thing you say about God , and arguing about it would interfere with your relationship with God ;
. . . you have the distinct sense that the other people in the room will dislike you for “ not supporting our troops ” if you argue against the latest war ;
. . . saying anything against Communism gets you stoned to death shot ;
. . . then the affective death spiral has gone supercritical .
It is now a Super Happy Death Spiral .
When it comes to our original question —
“ What makes the slaughter ? ” — the key category to pay attention to is n’t religion as such .
The best distinction I ’ve heard between “ supernatural ” and “ naturalistic ” worldviews is that a supernatural worldview asserts the existence of ontologically basic mental substances , like spirits , while a naturalistic worldview reduces mental phenomena to nonmental parts .
Focusing on this as the source of the problem buys into religious exceptionalism .
Supernaturalist claims are worth distinguishing , because they always turn out to be wrong for fairly fundamental reasons .
3
But it ’s still just one kind of mistake .
An affective death spiral can nucleate around supernatural beliefs — particularly monotheisms whose pinnacle is a Super Happy Agent , defined primarily by agreeing with any nice statement about it — and particularly meme complexes grown sophisticated enough to assert supernatural punishments for disbelief .
But the death spiral can also start around a political innovation , a charismatic leader , belief in racial destiny , or an economic hypothesis .
The lesson of history is that affective death spirals are dangerous whether or not they happen to involve supernaturalism .
Religion is n’t special enough , as a class of mistake , to be the key problem .
Sam Harris came closer when he put the accusing finger on faith .
If you do n’t place an appropriate burden of proof on each and every additional nice claim , the affective resonance gets started very easily .
Look at the poor New Agers .
Christianity developed defenses against criticism , arguing for the wonders of faith ; New Agers culturally inherit the cached thought that faith is positive , but lack Christianity ’s exclusionary scripture to keep out competing memes .
New Agers end up in happy death spirals around stars , trees , magnets , diets , spells , unicorns . . .
But the affective death spiral turns much deadlier after criticism becomes a sin , or a gaffe , or a crime .
There are things in this world that are worth praising greatly , and you ca n’t flatly say that praise beyond a certain point is forbidden .
But there is never an Idea so true that it ’s wrong to criticize any argument that supports it .
Never .
Never ever never for ever .
That is flat .
The vast majority of possible beliefs in a nontrivial answer space are false , and likewise , the vast majority of possible supporting arguments for a true belief are also false , and not even the happiest idea can change that .
And it is triple ultra forbidden to respond to criticism with violence .
There are a very few injunctions in the human art of rationality that have no ifs , ands , buts , or escape clauses .
This is one of them .
Bad argument gets counterargument .
Does not get bullet .
Never .
Never ever never for ever .
The last two decades of Portland police chiefs
Penny Harrington
1985 - 86
Mayor Bud Clark ( 1985 - 92 ) named Harrington the nation 's first woman to lead a major police department .
He asked her to resign 17 months later after a special commission concluded she demonstrated defects in her leadership .
Robert Tobin
1986 ( Interim )
Mayor Bud Clark
James Davis
1986 -87
Mayor Bud Clark appointed Davis chief , then fired him during a breakfast in Multnomah Village 's Fat City Cafe .
Davis had fought for more police and wanted to sue the city over it ; the mayor said Davis did not have the authority .
Richard Walker
1987-90
Mayor Bud Clark brought in Walker as a calming influence after the turbulent tenures of Harrington and Davis .
Walker preferred to stay out of the limelight and left after 3 1/2 years .
Tom Potter
1990 -93
Mayor Bud Clark selected Potter , then a 24 - year veteran of the force .
After 2 1/2 years ,
Potter retired , saying he would travel and pursue his hobby of archaeology .
Charles Moose
1993-99
Mayor Vera Katz ( 1993 -2004 ) hires Moose , Portland 's first African American police chief .
After a sometimes tumultuous tenure , Moose left in 1999 to become chief in Montgomery County , Md .
Lynnae C. Berg
( Interim )
1999 -99
Mayor Vera Katz
Mark Kroeker
1999 -2003
Mayor Vera Katz brought in Kroeker from Los Angeles .
As Portland 's first outside chief in 25 years , Kroeker had a style that critics considered as not well suited to Portland .
He resigned under pressure .
Derrick Foxworth
2003 to 2006
Mayor Vera Katz named him to step in following Kroeker 's forced resignation .
Mayor Tom Potter removed Foxworth after Foxworth 's sexually explicit e-mails to a police desk clerk became public .
Rosie Sizer
2006 - May 2010
Joined Portland Police Bureau in 1985 .
Sizer was Portland 's second female chief after Penny Harrington .
She was appointed acting chief by Potter in April 2006 and sworn in as chief three months later .
Two days after police Chief Rosie Sizer blasted the mayor 's proposed police budget , Mayor Sam Adams fired her and replaced her with Mike Reese , who recently served as East Precinct commander .
Adams also took control of the Portland Police Bureau from Commissioner Dan Saltzman .
The mayor said he wants to take the Portland Police Bureau in " a new and different direction . "
He said the relationship between the police and the city of Portland " is not what it should be . "
Adams also said Chief Rosie Sizer 's reforms came " in reaction and after failures in the bureau . "
Today 's announcement follows a tumultuous week , with the mayor and the chief publicly quarreling over the bureau 's budget on Monday followed the next day by an announcement that the city had agreed to pay
.
After Saltzman announced the settlement on Tuesday , Adams issued a press release saying it closed " a very troubling relationship " between the Police Bureau and city residents , but that " we need to be more proactive in making additional improvements . "
The bureau has been harshly criticized for taking so long to complete an internal investigation of Chasse 's death in custody which occurred five months after Sizer became chief .
»
The Oregonian 's columnist Anna Griffin offers her views on Rosie Sizer 's firing .
Sizer reacted to the settlement Tuesday , saying in a statement that she felt horrible about Chasse 's death and that the Chasse family deserved compensation .
But Sizer also said she 's been frustrated because she has n't been able to speak publicly about the Chasse case due to the lawsuit .
On Tuesday , she said the Police Bureau and officers involved had been " unfairly demonized " and called Chasse 's death a " horrible accident and not a beating death . "
Three officers arrested Chasse , 42 , in the Pearl District after one of the officers said Chasse appeared to be urinating in the street .
They chased him , knocked him to the ground and struggled to handcuff him .
Medics did not take him to a hospital , saying Chasse 's vital signs were normal .
But jail staff refused to book him because of his physical condition .
Chasse died while being taken to the hospital in a police car .
The medical examiner said he died of broad - based blunt - force trauma to the chest .
An autopsy revealed that he had 26 breaks to 16 ribs , some of which punctured a lung .
Saltzman said Tuesday that he hoped with the settlement that the city can " begin to heal . "
Moving the Police Bureau to the mayor 's portfolio is " a permanent reassignment to the mayor 's office . "
Today on the way to the news conference , Saltzman said he had enjoyed being police commissioner , " but I serve at the pleasure of the mayor . "
" I think this is a good time to make this change , " Adams said .
Asked if he was disappointed in Saltzman , Adams cited three historic changes under Saltzman :
Inviting federal officials to investigate bias .
Strengthening independent oversight of the bureau .
Staffing up despite budget woes .
The public dispute over the budget highlighted a widening gap between the bureau and mayor .
Sizer held a press conference Monday to blast Adam ’s proposed budget , saying it would result in the loss of 25 sworn officers and 12 non -sworn officers July 1 , when the new fiscal year begins .
Police Commissioner Dan Saltzman quickly sided with Sizer , saying he would not vote for the mayor ’s budget .
Adams said that Sizer had blindsided him with the press conference , saying she and her commanders had given him misleading information .
Sizer said Tuesday that she had kept Adams informed and did not know how he would avoid layoffs and still trim the bureau ’s budget by $ 5 million .
After taking office last year , Adams became the rare mayor to hand day - to - day oversight of the city ’s largest and most complicated bureau to another commissioner , Saltzman .
Adams also has kept a low profile on recent police shootings , leaving Saltzman to shoulder public anger .
Sizer joined the Portland Police Bureau in 1985 and was Portland 's second female chief after Penny Harrington , who served from 1985 - 86 .
Sizer was appointed acting chief by Mayor Tom Potter in April 2006 and sworn in as chief three months later , replacing Derrick Foxworth who was removed after his sexually explicit e-mails to a police desk clerk became public .

The world faces the nightmare possibility of fishless oceans by 2050 without fundamental restructuring of the fishing industry , UN experts said Monday .
“ If the various estimates we have received … come true , then we are in the situation where 40 years down the line we , effectively , are out of fish , ” Pavan Sukhdev , head of the UN Environment Program ’s green economy initiative , told journalists in New York .

A Green Economy report due later this year by UNEP and outside experts argues this disaster can be avoided if subsidies to fishing fleets are slashed and fish are given protected zones — ultimately resulting in a thriving industry .
The report , which was opened to preview Monday , also assesses how surging global demand in other key areas including energy and fresh water can be met while preventing ecological destruction around the planet .
UNEP director Achim Steiner said the world was “ drawing down to the very capital ” on which it relies .
However , “ our institutions , our governments are perfectly capable of changing course , as we have seen with the extraordinary uptake of interest .
Around , I think it is almost 30 countries now have engaged with us directly , and there are many others revising the policies on the green economy , ” he said .
Collapse of fish stocks is not only an environmental matter .

One billion people , mostly from poorer countries , rely on fish as their main animal protein source , according to the UN .
The Green Economy report estimates there are 35 million people fishing around the world on 20 million boats .
About 170 million jobs depend directly or indirectly on the sector , bringing the total web of people financially linked to 520 million .
According to the UN , 30 percent of fish stocks have already collapsed , meaning they yield less than 10 percent of their former potential , while virtually all fisheries risk running out of commercially viable catches by 2050 .

The main scourge , the UNEP report says , are government subsidies encouraging ever bigger fishing fleets chasing ever fewer fish — with little attempt to allow the fish populations to recover .
Fishing fleet capacity is “ 50 to 60 percent ” higher than it should be , Sukhdev said .

“ What is scarce here is fish , ” he said , calling for an increase in the stock of fish , not the stock of fishing capacity . ”
Creating marine preservation areas to allow female fish to grow to full size , thereby hugely increasing their fertility , is one vital solution , the report says .
Another is restructuring the fishing fleets to favor smaller boats that — once fish stocks recover — would be able to land bigger catches .

“ We believe solutions are on hand , but we believe political will and clear economics are required , ” Sukhdev said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A ferry that was involved in a deadly crash in 2003 slammed into a dock in New York ’s borough of Staten Island on Saturday , injuring dozens of passengers in an accident authorities blamed on a mechanical problem .
The Staten Island Ferry boat seemed to speed up as it approached the dock in a light rain , according to passengers and witnesses in the ferry terminal .
“ It looks like it was a mechanical problem , ” Janette Sadik - Khan , commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation , said at a news conference .
She said it appeared that the captain was unable to slow the boat as it approached the dock .
Sadik - Khan said 37 people were hurt in the accident , including 17 who were sent to the hospital .
But she said the injuries were not considered serious .
Passengers were put on stretchers or in wheelchairs after being taken off the ferry about 15 minutes after the accident .
The boat involved in the accident was the Andrew J. Barberi , which also crashed at the same terminal in St. George , Staten Island in October 2003 , killing 11 people .
The boat struck the pier at full speed in that incident .

The captain , who was taking painkillers at the time , pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 18 months in prison .
In the latest accident , Sadik - Khan said roughly 250 passengers and 18 crew members were on board when the crash occurred around 9:25 a.m .
The ferry can carry thousands of passengers .
“ It just slammed right into the dock , ” said Alex Gonzalez , who was on the ferry .
“ There was a young lady with her child that flew , literally ” on impact , he told NY 1 cable news station .
Another passenger told local radio he heard “ break , break ” on the loudspeaker just before impact .
“ There was chaos , pandemonium ” after the impact , Gonzalez said .
Another eyewitness who was waiting in the terminal to board said people panicked and ran as the boat hit .
Ferry service between Staten Island and Manhattan resumed after about 90 minutes .
The Staten Island Ferry transports 20 million people a year between Staten Island and lower Manhattan .
The free ferry service is popular with tourists , taking them past the Statue of Liberty and giving them views of downtown Manhattan .
Dan Brill Architects of the UK are among 12 international practices shortlisted to design a pedestrian footbridge for Trestles Beach , a surf spot in southern California .
The Safe Trestles design competition , organised by Architecture for Humanity , sought designs that give provide surfers access to the beach from the road on the bluff above , carrying them safely across a railway line while protecting the fragile dunes .
The competition winner will be announced on Friday 7 May .
See the shortlist and vote for your favourite here .
Here 's some info from Dan Brill Architects :
DAN BRILL ARCHITECTS SHORTLISTED AS ONLY UK PRACTICE IN INTERNATIONAL DESIGN COMPETITION
Winchester - based Dan Brill Architects are the only UK practice to have been shortlisted as one of 12 semi-finalists for the design of a pedestrian footbridge in southern California .
Hosted by Architecture for Humanity , the Safe Trestles international design competition received over 100 entries for the design of a safe and low - impact access route to Trestles Beach , home to one of North America ’s most prized surfing spots and the 6.0 Lowers Pro surf event .
Every year more than 100,000 people follow informal trails through marshlands and over active train tracks to access the beach , presenting a safety hazard with passing trains and a threat to the marine habitat that is home to a number of endangered animal species and important flora .
In delivering a safe and ADA compliant route between the existing parking lot and beach , Dan Brill Architect ’s proposal provides an inspirational and captivating design solution that preserves and enhances the co-existence of a delicate coastal ecology and a recreational surf spot .
Made of welded weathering steel plate , the structure is capable of spanning large distances , thereby requiring minimal foundations within the wetlands and safely clearing prevailing railway easements .
The weathered steel plate also provides a resilient and robust finish requiring minimal maintenance in the sea air .
In contrast with the steel plate , weathered timber decking provides a warm & tactile surface underfoot .
The proposal provides a new entrance to Trestles Beach from the existing parking lot , and incorporates elements of currently lacking infrastructure : toilets , showers , seating , drinking fountains , recycling bins , and a kiosk or information point .
The bridge varies between 3.5 to 7 metres in width , and incorporates two widened seating areas along its length , positioned to take in dramatic vistas across the wetlands and along the coastline .
Educational signage is also incorporated , raising public awareness of the habitat and its endangered species .
The route terminates at Trestles Beach , and incorporates a plinth of informal spectator seating with toilet facilities and bicycle parking below .
A lifeguard tower has also been incorporated into the design .
Competition finalists will be announced on Friday , May 7th .

As Papantonio pointed out and The Wall Street Journal reported , the Leaking Oil Well Lacked [ a ]
Safeguard Device :
The oil well spewing crude into the Gulf of Mexico did n't have a remote - control shut - off switch used in two other major oil - producing nations as last - resort protection against underwater spills .
The lack of the device , called an acoustic switch , could amplify concerns over the environmental impact of offshore drilling after the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig last week .
... U.S. regulators do n't mandate use of the remote - control device on offshore rigs , and the Deepwater Horizon , hired by oil giant BP PLC , did n't have one .
With the remote control , a crew can attempt to trigger an underwater valve that shuts down the well even if the oil rig itself is damaged or evacuated .
... The U.S. considered requiring a remote - controlled shut - off mechanism several years ago , but drilling companies questioned its cost and effectiveness , according to the agency overseeing offshore drilling .
The agency , the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , says it decided the remote device was n't needed because rigs had other back - up plans to cut off a well .
... An acoustic trigger costs about $ 500,000 , industry officials said .
The Deepwater Horizon had a replacement cost of about $ 560 million , and BP says it is spending $ 6 million a day to battle the oil spill .
On Wednesday , crews set fire to part of the oil spill in an attempt to limit environmental damage .
Some major oil companies , including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and France 's Total SA , sometimes use the device even where regulators do n't call for it .

Papantonio laid the blame squarely in Dick Cheney 's lap and said this was one of the deregulations of the energy industry that was negotiated during his secret meetings with oil industry and other energy executives during George Bush 's first term in office and called this the biggest under - reported aspect of this disaster .
It would be nice if the media would look into this and start asking some more questions about why these companies were allowed not to have this last resort safeguard .
I 'm not holding my breath with most of them but maybe we 'll see more information on this from the likes of Amy Goodman , Ed Schultz , Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow .
In the mean time most of the media is busy repeating the GOP talking point that this is " Obama 's Katrina " like Mrs. Greenspan and Grandpa Pat on MSNBC .

Iron Man 2 opens today !
Are you excited ?
Really ?
Huh .
Well , keep reading anyway .
You know someone ’s gonna drag you into a showing .
On screen , with all those suits whirling into place , you ’d probably assume that the “ costumes ” are merely virtual .
Actually , they ’re not :
Maybe the most cutting - edge facet of Iron Man 2 ‘s production was the real - life fabrication of the suits .
Using 3 - D printers , the film ’s production company , Legacy Effects , was able to have artists draw an art concept–and then physically make that concept in just four hours .
The “ Eden ” printers , which are made by Objet , work by using an inkjet cartridge to print a layer of powdered plastic , which is then fused with UV light .
Each layer is just microns thick , and the product gets printed from the bottom up .
Here ’s video of the process , though not an actual Iron Man costume :
The product emerges completely finished .
All you need is some paint .
Basically , if Tony Stark was real , he would n’t be sitting around in a tool shop .
He ’d be clicking on a CAD program , and then kicking his feet up as his suit was printed .
By George Friedman On Sunday , Israeli naval forces intercepted the ships of a Turkish nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) delivering humanitarian supplies to Gaza .
Israel had demanded that the vessels not go directly to Gaza but instead dock in Israeli ports , where the supplies would be offloaded and delivered to Gaza .
The Turkish NGO refused , insisting on going directly to Gaza .
Gunfire ensued when Israeli naval personnel boarded one of the vessels , and a significant number of the passengers and crew on the ship were killed or wounded .
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon charged that the mission was simply an attempt to provoke the Israelis .
That was certainly the case .
The mission was designed to demonstrate that the Israelis were unreasonable and brutal .
The hope was that Israel would be provoked to extreme action , further alienating Israel from the global community and possibly driving a wedge between Israel and the United States .
The operation 's planners also hoped this would trigger a political crisis in Israel .
A logical Israeli response would have been avoiding falling into the provocation trap and suffering the political repercussions the Turkish NGO was trying to trigger .
Instead , the Israelis decided to make a show of force .
The Israelis appear to have reasoned that backing down would demonstrate weakness and encourage further flotillas to Gaza , unraveling the Israeli position vis-à - vis Hamas .
In this thinking , a violent interception was a superior strategy to accommodation regardless of political consequences .
Thus , the Israelis accepted the bait and were provoked .
The ' Exodus ' Scenario
In the 1950s , an author named Leon Uris published a book called " Exodus . "
Later made into a major motion picture , Exodus told the story of a Zionist provocation against the British .
In the wake of World War II , the British — who controlled Palestine , as it was then known — maintained limits on Jewish immigration there .
Would - be immigrants captured trying to run the blockade were detained in camps in Cyprus .
In the book and movie , Zionists planned a propaganda exercise involving a breakout of Jews — mostly children — from the camp , who would then board a ship renamed the Exodus .
When the Royal Navy intercepted the ship , the passengers would mount a hunger strike .
The goal was to portray the British as brutes finishing the work of the Nazis .
The image of children potentially dying of hunger would force the British to permit the ship to go to Palestine , to reconsider British policy on immigration , and ultimately to decide to abandon Palestine and turn the matter over to the United Nations .
There was in fact a ship called Exodus , but the affair did not play out precisely as portrayed by Uris , who used an amalgam of incidents to display the propaganda war waged by the Jews .
Those carrying out this war had two goals .
The first was to create sympathy in Britain and throughout the world for Jews who , just a couple of years after German concentration camps , were now being held in British camps .
Second , they sought to portray their struggle as being against the British .
The British were portrayed as continuing Nazi policies toward the Jews in order to maintain their empire .
The Jews were portrayed as anti-imperialists , fighting the British much as the Americans had .
It was a brilliant strategy .
By focusing on Jewish victimhood and on the British , the Zionists defined the battle as being against the British , with the Arabs playing the role of people trying to create the second phase of the Holocaust .
The British were portrayed as pro-Arab for economic and imperial reasons , indifferent at best to the survivors of the Holocaust .
Rather than restraining the Arabs , the British were arming them .
The goal was not to vilify the Arabs but to villify the British , and to position the Jews with other nationalist groups whether in India or Egypt rising against the British .
The precise truth or falsehood of this portrayal did n't particularly matter .
For most of the world , the Palestine issue was poorly understood and not a matter of immediate concern .
The Zionists intended to shape the perceptions of a global public with limited interest in or understanding of the issues , filling in the blanks with their own narrative .
And they succeeded .
The success was rooted in a political reality .
Where knowledge is limited , and the desire to learn the complex reality does n't exist , public opinion can be shaped by whoever generates the most powerful symbols .
And on a matter of only tangential interest , governments tend to follow their publics ' wishes , however they originate .
There is little to be gained for governments in resisting public opinion and much to be gained by giving in .
By shaping the battlefield of public perception , it is thus possible to get governments to change positions .
In this way , the Zionists ' ability to shape global public perceptions of what was happening in Palestine — to demonize the British and turn the question of Palestine into a Jewish - British issue — shaped the political decisions of a range of governments .
It was not the truth or falsehood of the narrative that mattered .
What mattered was the ability to identify the victim and victimizer such that global opinion caused both London and governments not directly involved in the issue to adopt political stances advantageous to the Zionists .
It is in this context that we need to view the Turkish flotilla .
The Turkish Flotilla to Gaza The Palestinians have long argued that they are the victims of Israel , an invention of British and American imperialism .
Since 1967 , they have focused not so much on the existence of the state of Israel ( at least in messages geared toward the West ) as on the oppression of Palestinians in the occupied territories .
Since the split between Hamas and Fatah and the Gaza War , the focus has been on the plight of the citizens of Gaza , who have been portrayed as the dispossessed victims of Israeli violence .
The bid to shape global perceptions by portraying the Palestinians as victims of Israel was the first prong of a longtime two - part campaign .
The second part of this campaign involved armed resistance against the Israelis .
The way this resistance was carried out , from airplane hijackings to stone - throwing children to suicide bombers , interfered with the first part of the campaign , however .
The Israelis could point to suicide bombings or the use of children against soldiers as symbols of Palestinian inhumanity .
This in turn was used to justify conditions in Gaza .
While the Palestinians had made significant inroads in placing Israel on the defensive in global public opinion , they thus consistently gave the Israelis the opportunity to turn the tables .
And this is where the flotilla comes in .
The Turkish flotilla aimed to replicate the Exodus story or , more precisely , to define the global image of Israel in the same way the Zionists defined the image that they wanted to project .
As with the Zionist portrayal of the situation in 1947 , the Gaza situation is far more complicated than as portrayed by the Palestinians .
The moral question is also far more ambiguous .
But as in 1947 , when the Zionist portrayal was not intended to be a scholarly analysis of the situation but a political weapon designed to define perceptions , the Turkish flotilla was not designed to carry out a moral inquest .
Instead , the flotilla was designed to achieve two ends .
The first is to divide Israel and Western governments by shifting public opinion against Israel .
The second is to create a political crisis inside Israel between those who feel that Israel 's increasing isolation over the Gaza issue is dangerous versus those who think any weakening of resolve is dangerous .
The Geopolitical Fallout for Israel
It is vital that the Israelis succeed in portraying the flotilla as an extremist plot .
Whether extremist or not , the plot has generated an image of Israel quite damaging to Israeli political interests .
Israel is increasingly isolated internationally , with heavy pressure on its relationship with Europe and the United States .
In all of these countries , politicians are extremely sensitive to public opinion .
It is difficult to imagine circumstances under which public opinion will see Israel as the victim .
The general response in the Western public is likely to be that the Israelis probably should have allowed the ships to go to Gaza and offload rather than to precipitate bloodshed .
Israel 's enemies will fan these flames by arguing that the Israelis prefer bloodshed to reasonable accommodation .
And as Western public opinion shifts against Israel , Western political leaders will track with this shift .
The incident also wrecks Israeli relations with Turkey , historically an Israeli ally in the Muslim world with longstanding military cooperation with Israel .
The Turkish government undoubtedly has wanted to move away from this relationship , but it faced resistance within the Turkish military and among secularists .
The new Israeli action makes a break with Israel easy , and indeed almost necessary for Ankara .
With roughly the population of Houston , Texas , Israel is just not large enough to withstand extended isolation , meaning this event has profound geopolitical implications .
Public opinion matters where issues are not of fundamental interest to a nation .
Israel is not a fundamental interest to other nations .
The ability to generate public antipathy to Israel can therefore reshape Israeli relations with countries critical to Israel .
For example , a redefinition of U.S. - Israeli relations will have much less effect on the United States than on Israel .
The Obama administration , already irritated by the Israelis , might now see a shift in U.S. public opinion that will open the way to a new U.S. - Israeli relationship disadvantageous to Israel .
The Israelis will argue that this is all unfair , as they were provoked .
Like the British , they seem to think that the issue is whose logic is correct .
But the issue actually is , whose logic will be heard ?
As with a tank battle or an airstrike , this sort of warfare has nothing to do with fairness .
It has to do with controlling public perception and using that public perception to shape foreign policy around the world .
In this case , the issue will be whether the deaths were necessary .
The Israeli argument of provocation will have limited traction .
Internationally , there is little doubt that the incident will generate a firestorm .
Certainly , Turkey will break cooperation with Israel .
Opinion in Europe will likely harden .
And public opinion in the United States — by far the most important in the equation — might shift to a " plague - on - both - your - houses " position .
While the international reaction is predictable , the interesting question is whether this evolution will cause a political crisis in Israel .
Those in Israel who feel that international isolation is preferable to accommodation with the Palestinians are in control now .
Many in the opposition see Israel 's isolation as a strategic threat .
Economically and militarily , they argue , Israel cannot survive in isolation .
The current regime will respond that there will be no isolation .
The flotilla aimed to generate what the government has said would not happen .
The tougher Israel is , the more the flotilla 's narrative takes hold .
As the Zionists knew in 1947 and the Palestinians are learning , controlling public opinion requires subtlety , a selective narrative and cynicism .
As they also knew , losing the battle can be catastrophic .
It cost Britain the Mandate and allowed Israel to survive .
Israel 's enemies are now turning the tables .
This maneuver was far more effective than suicide bombings or the Intifada in challenging Israel 's public perception and therefore its geopolitical position ( though if the Palestinians return to some of their more distasteful tactics like suicide bombing , the Turkish strategy of portraying Israel as the instigator of violence will be undermined ) .
Israel is now in uncharted waters .
It does not know how to respond .
It is not clear that the Palestinians know how to take full advantage of the situation , either .
But even so , this places the battle on a new field , far more fluid and uncontrollable than what went before .
The next steps will involve calls for sanctions against Israel .
The Israeli threats against Iran will be seen in a different context , and Israeli portrayal of Iran will hold less sway over the world .
And this will cause a political crisis in Israel .
If this government survives , then Israel is locked into a course that gives it freedom of action but international isolation .
If the government falls , then Israel enters a period of domestic uncertainty .
In either case , the flotilla achieved its strategic mission .
It got Israel to take violent action against it .
In doing so , Israel ran into its own fist .
Google Inc. is attempting to answer the increasingly difficult question posed by television viewers faced with hundreds of programming choices :
What should I watch ?
At the company ’s developer conference Thursday in San Francisco , Google predicted it would “ change the future of television ” with an effort to bring order to programming chaos in the same way that it organized the fire hose of information on the Web .
Known as Google TV , the new television platform would allow viewers to access Internet content on their televisions in addition to traditional broadcast and cable programming .
Despite bringing even more choice to the mix , Google is pitching the initiative as an easier way for audiences to find television shows and Internet content through a single search box instead of fumbling with remotes and clumsy on - screen programming guides .
The first television sets , Blu-ray players and companion set - top boxes will go on sale this fall through partnerships with chipmaker Intel Corp. , electronics giant Sony Corp. and device - maker Logitech .

“ As other technologies have evolved and changed , TV has remained the same , ” Rishi Chandra , the project leader , told 5,000 developers gathered for the conference .
“ Video should be consumed on the biggest , best and brightest screen in the house , and that is a TV . ”
The heart of the platform is a single search box that would allow viewers to find what they are looking for on television and the Web , using a special remote control with a built - in keyboard .
A hunt for the show “ House ” displays not only episodes available on USA and Fox but those for purchase on Amazon Video on Demand .
But it remains to be seen whether consumers who have shown little interest in surfing the Web on their televisions would be persuaded to buy the new Google TV - equipped Sony Bravia televisions and Blu-ray players or to add a companion set - top box that connects to the Internet .
Google would also have to persuade other television manufacturers to follow Sony ’s lead .
“ Although Google has assembled an impressive array of partners , individually they represent only a fraction of their particular markets , ” wrote Colin Dixon , a senior partner for researcher the Diffusion Group .

Cost could also be a major stumbling block as recession - weary consumers avoid big purchases .
Google and its partners declined to disclose prices .
But Google is betting buyers will want to make the investment .
Best Buy Chief Executive Brian Dunn , who joined top executives from Google ’s other partners in Thursday ’s announcement , called Google TV the natural evolution of what ’s already happening in consumers ’ living rooms .
“ This is the first seamless experience that I ’ve see that actually allows the source to be agnostic , ” Dunn said .
“ It opens up an entirely new category . ”
Devices designed to bring the Web to TV have been less than rousing successes .
Advertisement
The earliest and best - known of these attempts , Web TV , which displayed Internet pages and e-mail on the television screen , got plenty of notice when it debuted in 1996 .
But few consumers showed a willingness to use a wireless keypad , rather than a remote , to control the living room TV , or the patience to wait for a website to appear via sluggish dial - up connections .
Powered by its lucrative online advertising business , Google is looking to expand into other areas .
It has broadened its reach into smart phones , and now it ’s aiming for television advertising , which it says is a $ 70 - billion opportunity .
For Sony , the alliance with Google is an opportunity to pull out of the broader tailspin in the television market , in which shoppers go for bargains and are far less loyal to established brands .

Eliminating Comments : the Road to Clarity
I used to think commenting my code was the responsible thing to do .
I used to think that I should have a comment for just about every line of code that I wrote .
After my first read of Code Complete , my views changed pretty drastically .
I began to value good names over comments .
As my experience has increased , I have realized more and more that comments are actually bad .
They indicate a failure .
In Clean Code Robert Martin says
“ The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express yourself in code .
Note that I used the word failure .
I meant it .
Comments are always failures . ”
Those are some pretty strong words .
You may be reeling back a bit after reading that .
It is a normal reaction , but if you ’ll drop your defenses for a second , I ’ll help you understand why .
Let ’s start with an example
Which is more clear to read ?
This :
int i = 5 ; // Start at 5 , since there are 5 widgets in our production system .
//
If the number of widgets is evenly divisible by the time , // and we have exactly 5 sockets we need a new one .
if ( ( i % this .t ) == 0 && s.Count ( ) == 5 ) { i++ }
Or :
int currentWidgetCount = DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_WIDGET_COUNT
; if ( ShouldCreateNewWidget( currentWidgetCount ) ) { currentWidgetCount++ } private bool ShouldCreateNewWidget ( int count ) { return CountEvenlyDivisibleByTime( count ) && SocketCountAtThreshold ( ) ; }
Even though the second example is more code , the code is self - documenting .
The names of the variables and methods themselves are telling you what the code is doing .?
They are also serving to abstract out the concepts so that you don?t have to think about the entire piece of logic at one time .?
This simplifies your code .
In the above example , you don?t have to look at the method ShouldCreateNewWidget .?
You can deduce that the flow of that logic checks to see if it should create a new widget based on the count , and if it should it does .
If you want to know how it is determined if a new widget should be created , then you drill into the method , and you can see that if the count is evenly divisible by time and the socket count is at the threshold , then the answer is true , otherwise it is false .
Consider again the first example .?
What happens if that logic changes , but the comments are n?t updated ??
When you read the comments , how do you know that they are even correct unless you read through and understand the logic anyway ?
Why are comments so bad ?
It is not that comments in and of themselves are bad .?
It ?s more that having comments in your code indicates that your code itself is not clear enough to express its intent .?
Elegant code should be able to express itself simply and completely .?
Comments are not code , they are metadata about the code .?
If you want to write elegant code , write elegant code , not elegant prose about code .
Here are some of the major reasons why comments are bad :
They do not change with the code .
If a refactor tool changes the code , it cannot change the semantics of the comments , it can only change the syntax where it can recognize keywords .
If a refactor tool changes the code , it cannot change the semantics of the comments , it can only change the syntax where it can recognize keywords .
A wrong comment is worse than horribly complex non-commented code .
A wrong comment can lead someone completely in the wrong direction .?
For that reason , a good developer always assumes comments are wrong .
A wrong comment can lead someone completely in the wrong direction .?
For that reason , A comment almost always expresses an absolute thing , where a well named variable or method can express an abstract concept .
Comments can actually tightly couple your code .?
Take the example above where int i = 5 had a comment stating that 5 was the default .?
DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_WIDGET_COUNT
communicates the same information , but at a higher level of abstraction .

Take the example above where int i = 5 had a comment stating that 5 was the default .?
DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_WIDGET_COUNT
communicates the same information , but at a higher level of abstraction .
Comments don?t show up in stack traces .
I have looked through many stack traces in my career , and I can tell you for a fact , that when you are looking at a stack trace , you would much prefer self - documenting method names , than good comments .

Reading comments is optional .
Reading code is mandatory .?
You can not count on anyone reading your comments .?
You cannot force them to do so , but they must read the code .
If you have something important to say , put it in the code .
NDoc and JavaDoc ( XML style comments )
I am moving more and more away from even liking comments on public methods using JavaDoc or NDoc . ?
Most of the time when we create NDoc style documentation , we end up just restating exactly what the parameter name is .?
How useful , really , is : cookieCount ?
the count of cookies ?
Does that actually help someone using your code ??
I would much rather make method names that have intuitive names and parameters than follow an arbitrary convention that adds no real value .
There is even a tool that auto creates NDoc comments for you .?
Seriously , I used to think that was cool , but really how stupid is that ??
Auto - generating comments ??
Before you disagree with me here , really think about if embedding XML into your source code is really adding any value .
I understand creating MSDN style documentation is pretty cool .?
I ?ve used NDoc and SandCastle myself .?
But , wouldn?t the effort be better spent creating more meaningful names and self - explanatory APIs ?
Exceptions
Sometimes , you will need to write comments .?
But , it should be the exception not the rule .?
Comments should only be used when they are expressing something that cannot be expressed in code .?
If you are using some mathematical equation , you might reference that equation in a comment , rather than trying to codifying it .
If you want to write elegant code , strive to eliminate comments and instead write self - documenting code .
Update : Just wanted to add this link to my original post on Elegant Code .
And the link to my main personal blog at http://simpleprogrammer.com, since some people were getting confused .?
Also , you can follow me on twitter here .
Alan Brinkley , a historian of the Depression , added : “ This is not the New Deal , but it ’s a significant series of achievements .
And given the difficulty of getting anything done under the gridlock of Congress , it ’s pretty surprising . ”
The last 16 months seem most similar in scope to three other periods in the last 80 years .
After World War II , the federal government helped build the modern middle class with the G.I.
Bill , housing subsidies , the highway system and incentives for employers to offer health insurance .
The 1960s — mostly under Mr. Johnson , but also Richard Nixon — brought civil rights legislation , Medicare , Medicaid and environmental laws .
Then Mr. Reagan ushered in a period that continued , more or less , until 2008 : tax cuts , less regulation and other attempts to unleash the competitive forces of the market .
Mr. Obama has been trying to reverse the Reagan thrust in some important ways .
Although the Reagan administration did not shrink the size of the federal government , it changed the ways that Washington collected and spent its money , by reducing taxes on the affluent , cutting some social programs and increasing military spending .
These policies ended up magnifying income inequality , which was already rising for other reasons .
Since 1980 , median household income has risen only 30 percent , adjusted for inflation , while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled .
Every major piece of the Obama agenda is meant , in part , to push back against inequality .
Government may grow , but the bigger change will be how the government is spending its money .
The health bill expanded insurance coverage largely for middle - class and poor families and paid some of the bill by taxing households making more than $ 250,000 a year .
Attached to the final health bill were also education provisions that cut subsidies to banks making student loans , and used much of the money for college financial aid instead .
The financial regulation bill , meanwhile , would take several steps likely to reduce Wall Street ’s profits — and Wall Street has created more multimillionaires in recent decades than any other industry .
To take one example , certain trades would be forced onto open exchanges .
This would hurt financial firms ’ ability to act as a middleman , much as Expedia and other travel Web sites have hurt travel agents .
For all these differences , though , there are also ways that Mr. Obama and today ’s Democrats have accepted , and are even furthering , the Reagan project .
They are not trying to raise tax rates on the affluent to anywhere near their pre-1981 levels .
Their health bill created new private insurance markets , rather than expanding Medicare .
BBC to take Daleks , Cybermen and more on a live tour of the UK

Doctor
Who is soon set to step out of his Tardis and onto a theatre stage near you .
The Doctor – plus assorted adversaries and creatures including Daleks , Cybermen and Oods – is to tour the UK this autumn with Doctor Who Live .
The tour follows a string of other TV shows which have developed stage versions :
The X Factor , Strictly Come Dancing , and even Coronation Street .
The new Doctor , Matt Smith , and assistant Karen Gillan , will not appear in the stage show , which is being developed by Doctor Who 's head writer Steven Moffat and will feature in " on-stage battles , pyrotechnics and special effects " .
The show , produced by the BBC 's commercial arm , BBC Worldwide , will open in wartime London and conclude with " an epic onstage battle " .
There will also be a live soundtrack , performed by a 16 - piece orchestra , by Doctor Who composer Murray Gold , responsible for the programme 's controversial new theme tune .
The television and music industries have discovered a lucrative new revenue stream through live performances , with ticket sales and merchandising .
Moffatt , who is also the executive producer of the TV series , said : " This is everything I ever wanted since I was eleven .
A live show , with all the coolest Doctor Who monsters , a proper story , and brand new screen material for Matt Smith 's Doctor .
I 'll be writing scenes for it , and probably attending every single night . "
The tour will cover nine cities with 25 performances , opening at London 's Wembley Arena on 8 October , and then Sheffield , Glasgow , Birmingham , Manchester , Nottingham , Cardiff , Liverpool and Belfast on 7 November .
Reality shows such as the X Factor have toured the UK to huge crowds who want to see the stars of the programme in the flesh .
Coronation Street Abridged Live ! will bring the entire history of the ITV soap to the stage to celebrate the 50th anniversary in August , written by Corrie scriptwriter Jonathan Harvey .
More than 7,000 episodes , 115 deaths and 86 marriages will be shoehorned into two hours , for the Lowry Theatre in Salford and then on a nationwide tour .
Details of the Doctor Who shows are available from doctorwholive.com .
M-Sport managing director Malcolm Wilson is confident of running private teams in Fiestas alongside the BP Ford Abu Dhabi World Rally Team in next season 's series .
Such a move will require regulation change from the FIA , which currently says that a WRC team may only participate using cars homologated prior to 2009 .
The regulation needs changing as the FIA has stipulated that current World Rally Cars -- including those homologated prior to 2009 - - will be outlawed in next year 's WRC .
Wilson is aiming to supply Fiesta RS WRCs to the WRC teams currently competing at the highest level in Focus RS WRCs , namely Stobart , Munchi's and Monster World Rally Teams .
Wilson said : “ We have n't really discussed this one yet , but our intention is to run with the Fiesta RS WRC for the M2 [ WRC ]
Teams .
We have no alternative -- as the regulation stands we would have to run a Focus for an M2 team , but when the current car is outlawed , we can't do that .
We 've already had a lot of interest , and discussions with teams like Monster are ongoing for next year .
But , like I said , nothing is finalized . ”
The first Fiesta RS WRC is expected to be running in its completed form in September .
Solberg and Mills will be back
Petter Solberg 's co-driver Phil Mills insists it 's a case of “ all systems go ” for Rally Portugal later this month despite the pair 's dramatic late exit from Rally New Zealand .
Solberg and Mills , the 2003 world rally champions , were heading for a podium finish on the Auckland - based event only to crash out on the very last stage of the world championship qualifier .
Their failure to score meant they slipped from second to fifth place in the title standings and triggered concerns that they would not have a car ready for their trip to the Algarve from May 27 - 30 .
However , Mills allayed those fears by confirming that the Petter Solberg World Rally Team would call up its second Citroën C4 WRC for the Faro contest .
“ We 've got two cars , so there are no issues at all on that front , ” said Mills .
“ But the car we had in New Zealand was n't that badly damaged any way [ despite striking an electricity pylon in the crash ] . ”
Although Mills complained of a stiff neck following the accident on the notorious Whaanga Coast stage , neither he nor Solberg suffered any serious injury .
Radnor returns to Britain
Rally Great Britain fans will be in for a treat this season with the introduction of an all - new Cardiff Bay superspecial stage and the return of Richard Burns 's favorite test , Radnor .
The superspecial is expected to run right next to the service park at the front of the Millennium Centre in Cardiff -- where the leading teams will work on their cars in the evening only , as remote services in Builth Wells are used on Friday and Saturday - - while Radnor is run twice on Saturday .
There is a third new test for this year , the 10.10 - kilometer Monument Hill test on the Epynt ranges .
For the first time in the modern history of the event , there will be a significant amount of asphalt in the Crychan stage on Saturday , utilizing 11 kilometers of the superfast and exciting Epynt military roads .
Radnor is best known as a stage where Burns was unbeaten in the World Rally Championship .
In the fog in 1997 , Burns was so quick that he took a minute out of his British rival Colin McRae in the stage .
The final day of the rally has been shortened slightly but remains a big challenge , with organizers running just five kilometers short of the maximum usage of 80 kilometers for the Pirelli control tire .
The crews will tackle Resolfen and Margam twice on one set of soft - compound Scorpion covers .
The route for this year 's Rally GB will be unveiled at the event 's official launch in Cardiff later today .
Ogier aims for podiums
Citroën Junior Team driver Sébastien Ogier says podium finishes are more important than his first victory in the WRC this season .
Ogier , 26 , almost broke through at Rally New Zealand , leading the event until a spin almost within sight of the finish cost him first place .
He ended the Auckland - based event just 2.4 seconds behind Ford 's Jari-Matti Latvala , who grabbed the win on the 21st and final stage .
Ogier has now scored points on all five rounds of this year 's series , including two podiums , to hold fourth place in the overall standings -- just one point behind Ford 's team leader Mikko Hirvonen .
Talking about when he thought his first world rally win will come , the former junior world rally champion said : “ It 's possible it can come before the end of this year , but that 's not really the target for me .
If I win [ before the end of the year ] then that 's great , but if not then it 's not so bad .
I would prefer to take five or some more podiums before the end of the year than just taking one victory . ”
Ogier has been tipped for a manufacturer seat next year by Citroën 's factory team manager Sven Smeets .
“ For the moment , Sébastien Ogier is progressing on a learning curve that is unbelievable , ” said Smeets .
“ Since the start of this year he has put himself up on the leaderboard with all the top drivers , which is very good for us .
But I think that he still has to make some learning progress on asphalt .
Then by the end of the year , we will have somebody who is maybe ready for a manufacturer team . ”
Japan rally to return ?
Rally Japan course manager Dimar Krivtsov has talked of his desire to keep the Hokkaido - based event running at an international level , despite it missing out on next year 's WRC .
Krivtsov said his team would continue to work towards a return to the WRC , but he added that the event would be looking at a possible return to the Intercontinental Rally Challenge .
“ We ran as an IRC supporter event last year , ” said Krivtsov .
“ But that 's gone for this year because we are in the WRC .
We 'll have to see how it goes .
We definitely want to be part of an international championship . ”
WRC promoter Simon Long said he was sorry Japan would n't be part of WRC in 2011 , but added that the door remained open between North One Sport and Japan .
Long said , “ Japan is another very , very good rally -- but this is the nature of a 14 - round calendar :
There are too many rallies for the spaces .
Japan came very close to the original calendar we proposed to World Motor Sport Council . ”
Sanremo goes asphalt - only
Rallye Sanremo will feature asphalt stages only when it runs as round 10 of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge , Sept. 23 -25 .
The organizers , Automobile Club Sanremo ( ACI ) , had planned to run a mixture of asphalt and gravel stages but cost implications have forced them to stick to an all - Tarmac format for the 52nd running of the famous rally .
Sergio Maiga , the ACS president , said : “ Maybe we could have carried out the idea to bring Rallye Sanremo back to [ the gravel stages of ]
Siena , but in order to do that we would have been obliged to reduce costs in sectors like safety , where we are not willing to accept any compromise .
“ Furthermore , we would n't be able to solve any of the economic problems that a race , like the one we had in mind , would have entailed for the teams that will take part in the event and , even more , for the several private drivers that are always showing their affection to our race .
A leg on gravel and another one on asphalt would have made necessary a change of car setup during the race and therefore an increase in costs . ”
Rally New Zealand also eyes return
Rally New Zealand boss Chris Carr is determined to return to the WRC , despite being out next year .
There had been speculation that the event 's 40th running last week could be its last in the top series but Carr says not .
He added : “ We 're working towards 2012 .
There 's talk of an extra event next year and there 's a bunch of people here who would like it to be NZ , but with rugby world cup , the logistics could be difficult .
We 're focused on the year after . ”
Ford says oil - rig disaster wo n't harm relationship with BP
Ford of Europe 's top motorsport manager Gerard Quinn says he does not expect the U.S. oil leak to harm the relationship between Ford and BP .
The British oil firm , Ford 's WRC title sponsor , could face a bill of up to $ 20 billion over the drilling - rig catastrophe .
Quinn said : “ We have a very close association and we have to make an assessment of what 's going on .
It 's too early to preempt anything , but I would like to think it wo n't affect our partnership . ”
Teenager Tom Cave preps for Wales
Teenager Tom Cave got his preparations for Rally d'Italia - Sardegna under way with a successful test in Wales recently .
Cave will contest at least six rounds of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge in a Proton Satria Neo Super 2000 , starting with the island event June 4 - 6 .
The 18 - year - old British driver covered approximately 80 kilometers during the test , which he described as “ constructive . ”
He added : “ The stage we used was a bit rough , dry and dusty so a reasonable start for Sardinia .
We started tweaking the settings to work towards a base setup for the rally and I did n't feel out of my depth in the car at all .
In fact , the harder you work it , the better it is . ”

Kick - off at Wembley is at 3 pm .
If you like , you can read David Hytner 's interview with Millwall striker Steve Morison here while you wait ...
Preamble : Hello !
So , the season 's second play - off final , a week after the first and , unlike the Championship final , with absolutely nobody in any danger of overheating .
So , what of the match ?
Five - time play - off losers Millwall are hoping to end their jinx against a Swindon side that won the first ever third division play - off in 1987 .
Swindon have 49 - goal attacking duo Billy Paynter and Charlie Austin but they do n't have their captain , Gordon Greer , who is suspended .
Millwall finished third in the league and finished the season in slightly better form , so go into the game as favourites .
But that 's all stats and logic , neither of which need have any influence today .
So let 's have a random poll , shall we ?
2.31 pm : Sky 's coverage kicks off with a few key figures giving mean looks to the camera .
Kenny Jackett is simply unable to deliver a mean look .
Millwall are basically managed by a teddy bear .
2.46 pm : News just in : 22 players have been picked .
Some others have not .
The lucky fellows are :
Millwall : Forde , Barron , Robinson , Ward , Craig , Schofield , Trotter , Abdou , Batt , Morison , Harris .
Subs : Sullivan , Frampton , Alexander , Hackett , Fuseini , Laird , Obika .
Swindon : Lucas , Amankwaah , Cuthbert , Jean - Francois , Sheehan , McGovern , Douglas , Ferry , Ward , Austin , Paynter .
Subs : Smith , Pericard , Easton , Timlin , Morrison , O'Brien , Darby .
Referee : Colin Webster .
2.54 pm : Millwall 's Jack Smith injured in training this week so unable to face one of his former clubs .
Otherwise as expected for Millwall .
Kevin Amankwaah comes in for Swindon at right - back .
2.59 pm : Before she started singing , the national anthem singing lady gave the camera the filthiest look .
3.01 pm : Jamie Jackson is at Wembley today – you can read a quick report online minutes after the final whistle and a full report later ( or in tomorrow 's Observer ) , but he 'll be sending me updates whenever he can think of something to say .
Anyway , Millwall in a huddle , almost time for kick - off .
1min : Peeeep !
We 're off !
1 min : Swindon in an all - white kit , apparently having chosen it ahead of their traditional red .
4mins : A bright enough opening , both sides working the ball through midfield well and having an attack each , both ending with the ball being hit out of play .
6 mins : Everything a bit hurried so far .
Morison and Harris have been offside once each for Millwall , while David Forde is enjoying some catching practise from Swindon 's overhit crosses .
8 mins : Harris shoots at the near post , trying to catch the keeper out when he'd have been better off crossing , really .
11 mins : The weather today makes a traditional English blood - and - thunder league encounter more likely .
When it 's hot on play - off final day players can sometimes be fooled into thinking they 're playing for England , and start strolling around the pitch spraying passes about , with varying degrees of accuracy .
Millwall having the better of a zippy opening to this one .
15 mins : Morison close to intercepting Scott Cuthbert 's underhit backpass , but David Lucas got there just in time and bootered the ball into the Millwall striker 's shins , whence it balloons out for a goal kick .
16 mins : Harris chips the ball from the left to the far post .
Alan Sheehan , defending , bizarrely heads the ball back across goal – and gets away with it .
17mins : Morison 's played in down the inside right channel .
He stretches his legs for the first time , then tries an audacious chip that scares Lucas but lands on the roof of the net .
A very strong start for the Lions .
21 mins :
The sun pokes his head out , and Harris batters a shot wide of goal from 20 yards .
23 mins : Sheehan , having passed a late fitness test yesterday to earn his place in the side , gets brought down , leading to extensive treatment and some convincing whincing .
26 mins : Swindon mount an attack , which just gives Millwall a chance to exhibit their counter - attacking skills – a decent move ends with a pretty rubbish shot from Shaun Batt .
29mins : GOAL !
NO !
NOT A GOAL AFTER ALL !
From a right - wing cross Kevin Amankwaah boshes the ball into the back of his own net , but the linesman was waving his flag , having quite rightly spotted an offside .
33 mins : Douglas and Batt have a bit of a set - to after the Swindon player 's rather overexuberant challenge .
The referee tells them both to grow up and sends them on their way .
37mins : Swindon 's Alan Sheehan has a good , flat , speedy , whippy left - foot delivery from set - pieces .
Hit from deep it does n't really work – the ball either speeds out of play or flies through to the keeper – but that could work well from wide , if he gets the chance .
38mins : GOAL !
A REAL ONE THIS TIME !
Swindon 0 Millwall 1 ( Robinson )
A corner from the left wing flicks off the head of Swindon 's Scott Cuthbert and flies into Paul Robinson 's stomach , and the defender turns the ball home from six yards .
41mins : Useful background info department : Kevin Amankwaah is being booed , according to Jamie Jackson , " because he teased Neil Harris over his testicular cancer during a game this season .
He apologised , i believe . "
42mins : A fine one - two plays Neil Harris through on goal , but an excellent block from Jean - François stops his shot .
The following minute , Morison is released down the right wing and we get our first Wembley slip – the linesman goes arse over tit , Millwall play on and eventually the ball is scrambled out of play for a throw - in .
43 mins : Actually , the linesman was totally taken out by Sheehan .
Millwall are forced into a substitution , Andy Frampton replacing a limping Tony Craig .
No idea when that injury happened .
45 mins : Millwall are defending excellently .
Paul Robinson and Darren Ward are the people behind their superiority this half – absolute dominance in the air .
Half - time : Not a contest , so far .
Millwall utterly dominant , but only one goal up .
Swindon can get back into this ( but only if they improve a lot )
4.05 pm : The players come back out .
Can Swindon turn this around ?
Millwall , given their history , must have some doubts , surely .
46mins : Peeeeep !
They 're off !
Again !
47mins : David Forde carries the ball out of his area , giving away a free - kick right on the corner .
No booking , though .
49 mins :
The least that can be said about Swindon is that so far this half they 're working much harder to disrupt Millwall .
51mins : Probably Swindon 's best move of the match ends with Darren Ward nipping ahead of , I think , Paynter to clear the ball , a few yards from his goal .
51mins : Moments later , the ball is chipped towards Austin and Ward again gets in front of his man at the vital moment .
53mins : Another corner for Swindon .
Though nothing comes of it , there 's certainly been more encouragement for them in eight minutes this half than in the preceding 45 .
We might have a game on our hands .
55 mins : Morison does really well down Millwall 's left wing , but there 's no support and the dogged Scott Cuthbert gets back to toe - poke the ball out of play .
55 mins : From the corner , Morison 's header is going wide but thunders off Sheehan 's knee .
It could have gone anywhere , and to anyone , but the ball bounces Swindon 's way .
57mins : The Rotherham team are here , soaking up the atmosphere ahead of tomorrow 's game with Dagenham and Redbridge .
58 mins : Two smart stops in a minute from Swindon 's David Lucas , the first from Danny Schofield and the second , better , save from Neil Harris ( set up by Schofield ) .
62mins : Another Swindon corner , their fifth ( at least ) this half .
For the first time , they win a clean header , but Jean - François is a long way from goal and Forde claims easily .
Millwall 's centre - back pairing are still looking impressive , but they 've got a lot more to do .
64mins : The best chance since the goal and it falls to Millwall .
Morison 's progress into the penalty area is a little ( well , a lot ) too easy , and suddenly he's all alone , on the ball , 12 yards from goal .
He shoots left - footed , but it 's really weak and the keeper picks it up .
66mins : Crampwatch !
Sheehan 's getting some treatment on the pitch .
He 's been quite impressive today for Swindon .
And so is Millwall 's Liam Trotter !
It 's contagious !
67mins : Sheehan duly comes off , replaced by Swindon 's semi-final penalty shoot - out - winning hero Stephen Darby .
Now both teams have been forced to take off their left - back .
70 mins : The other cramp - sufferer , Millwall 's Shaun Batt , comes off too , with Chris Hackett replacing him .
72mins : Terrible miss for Swindon !
Paul Robinson , so good all game , heads the ball straight to Austin 50 yards out and the striker 's away .
He cuts onto his right foot , the whole goal to aim at , just the keeper to beat , done everything right , and spoons the ball six yards wide of goal .
Horrible miss .
Was there a bobble ?
We await a replay ...
74mins : There was a bobble !
It 's the pitch wot done it !
76 mins : Millwall break , the ball worked to Millwall on the left corner of the penalty area .
He jinks inside and tries to curl the ball into the top corner .
It floats wide , but not by much .
78 mins : A lovely touch from Morison leaves two defenders on their arses .
Nothing comes of it , but still , a lovely touch .
80 mins : Jean - François is the first player in the book , for a pretty cynical foul on Morison , wide on the right .
From the free - kick , the keeper comes a long way , misses the ball and Cuthbert has to clear off the line .
Paynter comes off for former Juventus ace Vincent Pericard .
83 mins : Another great chance , this time for Millwall .
Morison is played down the right , cuts inside his man and toe - pokes goalwards from an acute angle , straight into the keeper .
84mins : He 's had a good game , Morison , but he clearly thinks he 's very one - footed .
With the ball on his right foot he 'll have a go from anywhere , normally a decent one .
On his left , he 'll hit half - hearted side - footers or just not shoot at all .
86 mins :
The game 's gone a little flat , weirdly given the stage we 've reached .
Millwall are defending their lead in depth , Swindon seem to feel their chance has passed them by .
87mins : Amankwaah does really well against Frampton , twisting one way , then the other .
On this Wembley pitch , and given the rainfall , twisting is n't so wise – eventually , he just falls over .
88mins : Swindon get numbers forward , Ward cuts inside from the left and shoots wide from 20 yards .
They 've been better this half , but they 've not been good enough today .
Millwall deserve the win .
90 mins : Four minutes of added time to be played .
90+1 mins : Added time starts with a Millwall corner .
They have not a single player in the box .
They play it short , and win another .
And then another .
90+2 mins : And then a throw - in .
90+3 mins : Swindon have the ball , but no ideas .
Millwall preparing a substitution .
90+4mins : Amankwaah crosses , the ball falls to Austin .
He slips , but still whips his leg around , lying on the pitch , and spears the ball goalwards .
Forde dives full length to save .
Full - time :
And that 's it !
Millwall are promoted !
4.57 pm : Given that it was n't a particularly close game , really , there 's scenes of massive dejection from Swindon 's players .
Charlie Austin , in the last game of an absolutely incredible season , has hidden his head in a towel .
He missed the best chance of the game and , bobble or no bobble , he 'll be feeling personally responsible .
4.58 pm : Millwall , on the other hand , seem absolutely controlled .
None of the mad celebrations that Blackpool produced a week ago .
" It 's been an excellent decision to push on this year , and we consciously made it , " says Kenny Jackett , puzzlingly .
5.00 pm : Serious blubbing from Swindon .
Good effort .
5.03 pm : Paul Robinson lifts the funny little trophy !
Each of the last 15 sides to be promoted to the Championship through the play - offs have stayed up , I 'm told .
Encouraging .
5.05 pm : Biggest cheer of all for Kenny Jackett .
He 's impossible to dislike , the cuddly little fella .
Anyway , congratulations to Millwall .
A thoroughly deserved win , really .
As I might have said .
The bodies were never found .
The presumed crime scene burned to the ground nearly 32 years ago .
One of the three suspects is dead .
But police in Newark , N.J. , said Tuesday that more than three decades after five teenage boys vanished on a sweltering summer night , they have charged two men with luring them into a home , locking them inside , and setting it on fire .
The alleged motive :
To punish the teens for apparently swiping marijuana from one of the suspects .
“ The mystery has now been solved , ” said Robert Laurino , acting prosecutor of Essex County , as he displayed two large , color photographs of the arrested men -- Lee Anthony Evans , 56 , and Philander Hampton , 53 .
Laurino said the two were “ very very quiet ” when police knocked on their doors Monday , cuffed them and led them into the rainy night to be jailed .
Each was held on $ 5 - million bail .
“ More than likely , they did believe this was behind them , ” Laurino said of the men .
The crime has long cast a cloud over a city that struggles with violent crime .
The disappearances mystified the city , frustrated the police and brought despair to relatives with each false lead .
No crime has hung “ as hard and as heavy ” on Newark , said Mayor Cory Booker .
The dead teens -- who had been friends for years -- were known as the Clinton Avenue Five , for the last place they were seen alive .
Laurino said they “ essentially disappeared off the face of the earth ” Aug. 20 , 1978 .
Randy Johnson , 16 ; Melvin Pittman , 17 , Ernest Taylor , 17 ; and Alvin Turner , 16 , all lived in Newark .
Michael McDowell , 16 , came from nearby East Orange .
The five would often gather to shoot hoops and sometimes took odd jobs with Evans , a local contractor .
Police said Evans had long been suspected of involvement in the case , because the boys were last seen getting into his pickup truck .
But there was no evidence , no corpses , and no witnesses to a crime -- until 18 months ago , when someone came forward .
The witness , whom police did not identify , cracked the case .
As the years went by , some family members submitted DNA samples in hopes they would match one of the tens of thousands of unidentified corpses that land in morgues each year .
Psychics were called in .
Fields were excavated .
The brick home now standing on Camden Street , where the boys allegedly met their fiery deaths , was scoured .
“ They were looking for bodies .
But they found none , ” said Mattie Williams , who lives there now .
Some lost hope .
“ I do n’t think that anyone will . . . get arrested or go to trial , because people who know this information are probably dead now , ” Michael McDowell ’s sister , Terry Lawson , told the Star - Ledger of Newark two years ago , on the 30th anniversary of her brother ’s disappearance .
On Tuesday , relatives appeared relieved that someone would face trial for the boys ’ deaths , but shaken by the brutality of the case .
“ If this is justice , justice is always empty in a situation like this , ” said Helen Simmons , Michael McDowell ’s aunt .
His uncle , William McDowell , who was at the Essex County courthouse Tuesday , said family members always suspected Evans , even though he had insisted to police that he dropped the teens off that night after they had done some work for him .
“ Once there is a trial and there is a conviction , I ’m sure there ’ll be closure , for me at least , anyway , ” he said .
Both men were charged with murder and arson , and police described the witness as highly credible .
But they also conceded that they have yet to find any bodies -- something that cold - case expert Joseph Pollini said makes the case highly unusual .
Pollini , a professor at New York ’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice , who was lieutenant commander of the New York Police Department ’s cold - case unit from 1996 to 2002 , said he had never had a case in which a body was missing , much less five .
“ It ’s a rare type of situation , ” said Pollini , adding that he could not think of a cold case involving this many victims , killed at one time , that had been solved after so long .

SUPERANNUATION savings are woefully inadequate and will leave Australians nearly $ 700 billion short of what is needed to live decently in retirement , according to new research .
The Investment and Financial Services Association has calculated that by the middle of 2008 Australians had a retirement '' savings gap ' ' of $ 695 billion , a dramatic increase on the $ 452 billion gap when the group last assessed super contributions .
The latest numbers do not include the worst of the global financial crisis , so the gap is likely to have grown .
More recent data was not available .
The figures mean the average savings gap is $ 73,000 a person , an increase of $ 26,000 over the previous four years .
The association used the data to back its campaign for the compulsory employer super contribution to be boosted to at least 12 per cent beyond the current 9 per cent .
It said some actuaries believed contributions as high as 20 per cent might be needed .
What is the average time to design a mobile app from start to finish ?
It is hard to put a number without looking at the detailed requirement and understanding your expectations .
If you have the complete requirement document , then we can create a design either for iOS or Android in 8 weeks flat , provided you approve the work within 24 hours .

NANCYELLE'S THIN AND CRISPY PIZZA CRUST
8 ounces mozzarella cheese , shredded
4 ounces cheddar cheese , shredded
3 eggs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon basil , optional
Toppings of your choice *
Mix the cheeses , eggs , garlic powder and basil well .
Line a 16 - inch pizza pan with parchment paper or nonstick foil .
Evenly spread the cheese mixture in the pan , almost to the edge , making it as thin as possible .
Bake at 450 º 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown .
I suggest checking it after about 10 minutes .
If it 's getting very dark on the edges and top , turn the oven down to 400 º and continue baking until brown all over and no longer pale on the bottom .
Pat off any excess grease then add your toppings .
Keeping the oven rack in the center position , put the pizza under the broiler until the toppings are hot and any cheese you added is melted and bubbly , about 4 - 5 minutes .
Makes 8 servings
Can be frozen
* You may want to sauté your mushrooms , peppers and other vegetable toppings before using because the pizza will only be baked briefly with the toppings on .
I also recommend pre-warming any meat toppings as well .
I put all of my toppings , except the sauce and cheese , in a big skillet and heated them up together .
Crust only :
Per Serving : 176 Calories ; 14g Fat ; 12g Protein ; 1g Carbohydrate ; trace Dietary Fiber ; 1g Net Carb
Topped with 1 /4 cup pizza sauce , 4 ounces mozzarella cheese , pepperoni , 1/ 2 cup cooked Italian sausage , 4 ounces mushrooms , 1/ 4 cup green peppers :
Per Serving : 271 Calories ; 21g Fat ; 18g Protein ; 3g Carbohydrate ; trace Dietary Fiber ; 2.5g Net Carbs
This is my new favorite low carb pizza crust and it's quick and easy to make .
It is crispy on the edges and nice and thin .
Even though it is very thin , you can easily pick this up and eat the pizza in your hand .
I went very light on the pizza sauce on mine because it gives me heartburn .
You could use more than I did but too much might make the crust turn soggy .
Although 1 / 4 cup is n't a lot of sauce , I was able to very thinly spread it over the entire surface of the crust .
It was just enough to suit me .
I also went light on the cheese topping because there was already 12 ounces of cheese in the crust .
Four ounces for the topping was just enough to help hold the other toppings in place .
Although one slice would have been plenty for me , I did n't have too much trouble eating two slices .
It is very filling and satisfying .
If you serve a salad along with this , one slice might be enough for all but the biggest appetites .

Somewhere in a rubbish skip outside Parliament House there are two boxes marked ' credibility ' - one from the Government and one from the Opposition .
Somewhere in the last couple of months the Government must have decided it was taking up too much room in the office and chucked it .
And watching as it happened , the Opposition must have decided it too needed a spring clean .
There does n't appear to be another explanation for what has been happening in Federal politics .
The Government started the trend with a pre-election clean out of problems .
It scrapped the insulation program and junked the election promise to build childcare centres .
Then , courtesy of the Prime Minister , the box of credibility went out too , as he put the emissions trading scheme in the deep freeze .
It was a move that brought Mr Rudd 's past back to haunt him with a recitation of the times when he 'd equated delaying action on climate change with denial and political cowardice .
The reason given for delaying the scheme beyond 2012 was that it would n't be clear until at least then what the rest of the world was doing .
This is despite the Government having built the Australian scheme around a 5 per cent cut in emissions not conditional on any other country signing up , and had factored in other countries not acting by compensating Australian industries that would have to compete with those in countries that had no ETS .
It was unsurprising when the opinion poll ratings for the Government and Mr Rudd began to head south .
Then there was the response to the Henry Review where the Government took up a tiny number of recommendations but in backing the Resources Super Profits
Tax bought a fight with people who have deep pockets .
The Government will need all its skills in salesmanship , which have not hitherto been on display , to win this one .
The budget disappeared , as budgets do these days , without leaving a forwarding number .
Now poll after poll shows the Government is in danger of losing the election , and Kevin Rudd has lost his gloss .
So what is an Opposition to do ?
Polls going well , Government on the back foot - perfect time to toss out it 's own credibility apparently and in some very odd ways .
Tony Abbott admitted that , " in the heat of discussion " , his words may not exactly be the " gospel truth " , which is something only guaranteed when his thoughts are pre-prepared ( by the act of writing them down ) .
as a speech or policy document .
Somewhat oddly , he was commended by some for his refreshing honesty about saying things that were n't completely true ( That interview on The 7.30 Report followed one on the same program by Kevin Rudd where some Labor MPs were relieved to see the Prime Minister showing a bit of passion on the ETS ... although it was pointed out to them that he was being passionate about abandoning a principle ) .
The Opposition has also chosen the last week to run a course in " What not to do " when you 're making a major economic statement .
And it managed to invent what came dangerously close to looking like an actual game of political football as Tony Abbott passed the task of detailing Coalition spending measures to Joe Hockey who then passed it to Andrew Robb .
Mr Abbott had , in a written down speech told the Parliament Mr Hockey would detail the savings at his Press Club address .
Mr Hockey did n't .
And the list of savings was n't available for the reporters to ask Mr Hockey about .
Mr Hockey says he did n't want his speech on the Coaltion 's economic principles to be overshadowed by the details of the spending cuts , and told the audience Andrew Robb would talk about the list .
But in doing that , the story was not only not about Mr Hockey 's principles nor about the details of the spending cuts , but the breaking of the promise Mr Abbott had made in Parliament and the failure to allow scrutiny of the proposals during Mr Hockey 's press club event .
Mr Robb copped the full force of journalistic dissatisfaction 45 minutes later , not helped by some hard questioning of the spending cut decisions especially on the inclusion of savings created by not proceeding with a mining tax that has n't started yet .
As a process designed to restore the Coalition 's economic credibility , the Budget Reply Reply Reply ( the Abbott version , the Hockey version and the Robb version ) was not a wildly successful affair .
It did seem though to be proof that in politics shooting yourself in the foot is actually a virus that can be passed from party to party .
And as autumn meanders towards winter , there in the skip outside Parliament , the two boxes of credibility lie .
And as anyone who 's tried to fish anything out of a skip knows , the throwing away is the easy party .
Getting it back is much harder .
SAGINAW —
In response to the new medical marijuana laws , Saginaw County sheriff ’s deputies will discontinue their policy of destroying grow equipment when they serve search warrants at the homes of medical marijuana patients or caretakers , Saginaw County Sheriff ’s Detective Randy P. Pfau said .
“ Instead of destroying property , we ’ll take everything in a forfeiture and let a judge make a decision on whether they ’re allowed to have that property back or not , ” Pfau said .
The second look at the policy is a response by the department to the public concern regarding action taken by deputies and federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents in the basement of the home owned by Edwyn W. Boyke Jr. , 64 , of Saginaw Township , Pfau said .
, because they say he violated drug laws , and destroyed his grow operations , which Boyke said cost him $ 7,000 .
“ It ’s so new to us , this new law , so we ’re acting on protocol that ’s been in place ... forever with manufacture of marijuana , ” Pfau said .
Pfau said the old norm was to take a portion of the grow equipment to present as evidence and document with rest with photographs and inventory sheets , so they did n’t need to confiscate sometimes large setups .
Because the possession and farming of marijuana is no longer inherently illegal , due to the new state medicinal laws , Pfau said deputies will adjust their procedures .
Documents unearthed by an American academic indicate Israel offered to sell nuclear weapons to South Africa in the 1970s .
Israel has never confirmed it has nuclear weapons despite a large amount of evidence that it has as many as 200 warheads .
The documents provide the first proof Israel not only has enough nuclear weapons for its own defence but has enough to sell elsewhere .
Like India , Pakistan and North Korea , Israel is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
In the 1980s , Mordechai Vanunu , a former technician who worked at Israel 's main nuclear facility , revealed the extent of the country 's arsenal .
Four years ago , former prime minister Ehud Olmert accidentally acknowledged the country 's nuclear capability on German television .
And now an American academic , Sacha Polokow - Suransky , has unearthed documents which appear to indicate Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons during the era of apartheid .
The deal between Israel and South Africa did not proceed .
But questions remain as to whether Israel helped South Africa develop nuclear weapons later on .
Dr Gil Merom , an international security expert from Sydney University , says Israel looked for alliances all over the world .
" Israel looked for any possible alliance and any possible support so South Africa could deliver to Israel mostly , I think , resources of the type of raw uranium , " he said .
The claims come as 190 nations are meeting in New York at the Nuclear Non-proliferation Review Treaty .
Experts say they are likely to add more pressure on Israel to declare itself a nuclear power .
Dr Andrew Davies , an expert on nuclear issues from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , says the news is unlikely to surprise anyone .
" Being found out as being a proliferator never helps anybody 's case for taking the higher moral ground on nuclear weapons , " he said .
" But I do n't think any new revelation about Israel is going to come as a terrible surprise to anyone . "
Israel has played a strong role in the effort to prevent Iran gaining nuclear weapons .
Dr Ron Huisken , an expert on nuclear weapons from the Australian National University , says the Iranians will use further proof Israel has nuclear weapons to justify its own program .
He also says the revelations could force the United States to ratchet up the pressure on Israel to admit having nuclear weapons .
" If Obama and co. were serious about a sustained process of nuclear diminution , an early part of that process has to be an Israel that comes out of the closet , and in the process of doing that , says yes , we 've got the bomb , " he said .
" We 've got it for these reasons , and then begin to talk to its neighbours about the motives behind it and ... what Israel thinks the neighbours need to do for Israel to consider giving the capability up . "
The NPT Review conference ends on Friday .
According to one of its biggest boosters , community - owned fiber networks open a door that " has remained shut due to the sleight - of - hand antics of many private telecom companies who talk the game of broadband but only offer embarrassing low levels of capability . "
But communities considering such a buildout need to know what they 're in for : lawsuits .
Lafayette , Louisiana has one of the largest and most successful fiber deployments in the country .
Right now , residents can pick up a 50 M bps symmetrical connection for only $ 57.95 a month .
In most cases , the prices are at least 20 percent less than phone and cable companies , and every subscriber gets 100 M bps access within the city 's network .
Street - level deployment should be complete by July 2010 , nine months ahead of schedule .
Getting to this point was n't easy , and Lafayette Director of Utilities Terry Huval used his entire statement last month before the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to blast the telecoms and cable companies for making his life a living hell since 2004 .
His history of Lafayette 's buildout is obviously one - sided , but it presents a detailed and useful look at what it 's like from a city perspective when contemplating a local fiber network build .
A reluctant fiber builder
The city did n't want to get into the ISP game .
It first went to the local telephone company ( BellSouth , now AT&T ) and the local cable operator ( Cox Communications ) and asked if either company would be willing to deploy a fiber - to - the - home network within Lafayette .
Both refused to do so , " stating that Lafayette was too small of a market to make such a large investment . "
The city decided to build a next - generation network itself .
Shortly after the city started a market survey to see if the community was actually interested in the service , " BellSouth orchestrated legislation which , while self - styled as a ' fairness ' bill , would have effectively prohibited any local government in Louisiana from offering telecommunications services . "
The result was the state 's Local Government Fair Competition Act ( LGFCA ) , and it made Huval furious .
" Lafayette certainly agrees that the playing field is not level , " Huval told the senators , " but all of the advantages go to the private providers . "
The city is forced to conduct all of its business , including decisions about deployment and rates , in the open ; competitors are not , and in fact have long resisted providing things like deployment plans to local municipalities across the country .
City - owned networks operate under strict limits regarding advertising ; private networks do not .
The list goes on .
As the city moved forward , opposition mounted .
Even after the new law was passed , the incumbents went after Lafayette .
The first lawsuit , from BellSouth , demanded a local referendum .
Lafayette complied , secured the endorsement of the local Republicans , the local Democrats , and the local Chamber of Commerce , then won over the local paper .
The referendum passed with 62 percent of the vote .
Once this was done , the city tried to raise money by issuing tax - exempt municipal bonds .
The incumbents sued over the bonds .
Lafayette first won , then lost on appeal and had to rework its offering .
It was then sued by two local citizens .
The case went all the way to the Louisiana Supreme Court , where the Chief Justice " asked the plaintiffs ' attorney if they were being paid by the telephone company . "
The Supreme Court eventually sided with the city 7 - 0 on the revised bond issue .
At the same time , Lafayette was dealing with the Louisiana Public Service Commission , which was crafting some of the rules that would affect the service .
In Huval 's view , " BellSouth and Cox used this additional opportunity to try to make the mandates of the LGFCA even more onerous for Lafayette . "
In the end , the process took three years and cost the city $ 4 million .
It also got nasty , with push - polls asking residents , " Since the city only allows you to water your lawn only three days per week , how do you feel about the city offering you cable TV service [ you could only watch ] three days per week ? "
On the other hand , the battle was n't a total loss .
" Interestingly enough , Cox Communications , which had been increasing its rates several times a year prior to Lafayette 's initial announcement to explore its offering of telecommunications services , decided to freeze its rates in Lafayette between 2004 and 2007 .
At the same time , Cox continued to increase its rates in other parts of the state .
" Estimates indicate that Lafayette citizens and businesses saved nearly $ 4 million due to these deferred cable rate increases , so in a roundabout way Lafayette 's citizens saved in reduced cable TV rates the amount the city spent defending itself in this extensive litigation process . "
In the end , Lafayette got permission to move forward , it raised $ 110 million , and it began building in 2008 .
It currently offers TV , phone , and Internet service to Lafayette residents and businesses , and its local electric utility ( also city - owned since 1896 ) plans to deploy smart electric meters that use the fiber network as backhaul .
A dismal pattern
While Huval 's testimony is certainly partisan , it does broadly echo the stories we 've seen in other communities that have attempted something similar .
For instance , we have followed for some time a similar saga in Monticello , Minnesota , which tried to deploy its own fiber network after saying that the local telco refused to do so .
The project was immediately tied up in court ( the city eventually won ) , and the local telco used that time to launch its own fiber deployment in town .
Cities hoping to go down this route need to be aware of the challenges they will face , including the laws of their own states .
And even after cities have built their own networks , the incumbents can lean on state lawmakers to make life more difficult for the cities — a process currently underway in North Carolina .
The incumbents always argue that the issue is about a " level playing field , " and it 's true that public ownership poses some tricky questions .
But broadband is the future , and it 's increasingly hard for residents to sit back and suffer because companies without much competition do n't see fit to give them what they need .
As a local North Carolina paper put it this week , " [ the town of ]
Wilson says it has the fastest residential Internet speed in the state — 100 megabits per second .
Time Warner 's residential customers there make do with 15 megabits per second ...
If Time Warner had been offering 100 megabit - per- second Internet speeds in the first place , Wilson might not have felt a need to go into the business . "
Despite all the hassles encountered in Lafayette , Huval believes the work was necessary .
" Lafayette , Louisiana is an oasis of major broadband connectivity through its successful fiber deployment , " he concluded .
" It is unfortunate that the national policies of the past have failed to even approach a world - class broadband system ...
Clearly , major policy changes need to be made in this country that will allow and encourage all possible participants in the construction and operation of major broadband infrastructure , preferably a fiber to the premise system . "

Here ’s a letter to the New York Times :
Criticizing libertarianism , you assert that “ It was only government power that ended slavery ” ( “ Limits of Libertarianism , ” May 22 ) .
You ’re mistaken .
Slavery was common throughout history until the age of industrial capitalism .
Only then did this heinous institution disappear .
Slavery was killed by capitalism because that institution puts a premium on creativity , initiative , and good judgment ( which even the mightiest slave - master ’s whip cannot extract from its victims ) , and because the ethos that gives life to capitalism – free - market liberalism – is hostile to the ownership of man by man .
That the first - to - industrialize English were the first abolitionists is no coincidence .
In North America , pressure brought by capitalism to end slavery was countered by the very agency that you praise as slaves ’ liberator : government .
From 17th and 18th century slave codes to the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and of 1850 , government in America actively deployed force on behalf of slaveholders .
Without this force , slavery would never have taken root as deeply as it did in the U.S. and would have died away sooner and with less bloodshed .
Sincerely ,
Donald J. Boudreaux
The Internet is full of cats that play keyboard and fat kids in love with Star Wars .
But of all the Internet ’s stars , no one has made such a lightning quick ascension to true success than the South - African zef - rap group Die Antwoord .
Made up of psychopathic rapper Ninja ( South African artist / hip - hopper Waddy Jones ) plus Yo- Landi Vi$$er and DJ Hi-Tek , their frighteningly awesome video for “ Enter The Ninja ” exploded so violently that just a month or so after the video hit the web , the group has signed to Interscope Records .
Not one to ever drop the act ( if it is one at this point ) , Ninja told BoingBoing .
net some of the most sagely wisdom you could ever find in this burgeoning age of Internet stars battling the mainstream record paradigm .
“ When we did the big meeting with Interscope , Jimmy Iovine [ the label ’s Chairman ] was telling me all about how badly their business has been harmed by the internet , ” Ninja said . ” I can understand that but I said , ‘ Jimmy , I want to give you a piece of samurai advice : Become the enemy . ' ”
But just because he ’s mastered the art of becoming a star via the World Wide Web does n’t mean he understands the process .
“ I do n’t understand how it happened any more than they do , but I understand how rare it is , ” he said .
“ The funniest thing has been the people on the Internet angry that we were ‘ fake . ’
The only people who thought we were some kind of hoax were from the U.S. and the EU .
This is just real , it ’s who we are . ”
The band , which lists its interests as William Gibson ’s Neuromancer , Eminem , and toys from Friends With You , will release five albums in total with Interscope .
Their first , $ O$ , is streaming on their official site right now .
According to BoingBoing.net , they ’ll also likely to be performing at this year ’s Coachella Music Festival , though this has yet to be confirmed .
If you happened to miss out on the boom , enjoy the video that started it all below .
And watch out for their Neil Blomkamp ( District 9 ) directed video coming to an Internet near you soon .
More than 100 people are now known to have been killed in a train crash in eastern India .
At least 145 people were injured - many critically - when two trains collided overnight in West Bengal .
Police said Maoist rebels sabotaged the track causing the Calcutta - Mumbai passenger train to derail , throwing five of its carriages into the path of an oncoming goods train .
But a spokesman for the Maoist rebels called the BBC to deny any involvement .
A railway spokesman said 78 bodies had been recovered , but that more than 30 remained trapped in three carriages that were crushed by the freight train .
Officials said rescue workers were still working to free survivors from the wreckage in the Jhargram area of West Midnapore , about 150 km ( 90 miles ) west of Calcutta .
The area is known to be a stronghold of Maoist rebels .
Maoist claim
The state police chief , Bhupinder Singh , said a 46 cm ( 1.5 ft ) portion of the train track was missing .
He said posters from a local group believed to have close ties to the Maoists were found at the scene , claiming it had carried out the attack .
ANALYSIS
Rail officials say the incident took place when it was still dark , so the driver of the Gyaneshwar Express failed to spot the damaged track .
This is the peak travel season and the train would have been packed with people going for summer holidays .
An investigation is yet to begin but local police say Maoist rebels left posters at the site saying they carried out the attack .
The site is in a remote part of West Bengal , close to the border with Jharkhand state - a known Maoist stronghold .
Maoists have targeted the Indian railways in the past , leading the authorities to deploy police patrols along the main railway lines .
The rebels have stepped up attacks in recent months , and have called for a " black week " beginning on Friday in the region .
Are Maoist rebels winning the war ?
But Maoist spokesman Comrade Khokan spoke to the BBC by telephone to deny any involvement .
He said the government " put the blame on us and put us on the defensive " .
Some analysts say that in this case the Maoist script may have gone awry .
Maoists frequently tamper with railway lines and often these lead to minor derailments ; there have been hijackings but no major attacks on civilian transport with such a death toll .
The rebels had called for observance of a " black week " of protests from Friday to Wednesday in five states - including West Bengal - where they wield considerable influence .
The incident happened at 0130 local time ( 2000 GMT ) when it was still dark , which meant the driver had failed to see the damaged track , rail officials said .
Rescue workers were still using sledgehammers and gas cutters to break into carriages where survivors were thought to be trapped , the BBC's Amitabha Bhattasali reported from the scene .
Bodies are still being removed from mangled carriages and helicopters are airlifting injured passengers to nearby hospitals .
Hundreds of police , troops and emergency workers are involved in the search and recovery effort .
INDIA'S MAOIST INSURGENCY
Violent rebellion began in 1967 in West Bengal village of Naxalbari and spread over rural areas of central and eastern India
Led by elusive military commander Kishenji , supported by between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters
More than 6,000 killed since rebellion began
Worst attacks include 76 killed in April 2010 ambushes in Dantewada ; 55 killed in attack on police outpost in 2007 Profile : India 's Maoist rebels
In pictures : India train collision
Railway spokesman Soumitra Majumdar said five coaches of the passenger train , the Gyaneshwar Express , had been derailed due to missing " fish plates " - which join rails together .
These coaches then fell on to the neighbouring track where they were rammed by the goods train , he said .
There were 13 carriages - including 10 sleeper coaches and a coach with unreserved seating - on the passenger train , the Times of India reported .
Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has visited the crash site .
The government has been under pressure following a wave of Maoist - led violence .
In April , 76 paramilitary troops were killed in an ambush - the single biggest attack on the Indian security forces by the rebels .
Maoist rebels have in recent months stepped up attacks in response to a government security push to flush them out of their jungle bases .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the insurgency as India 's biggest internal security challenge .
Post - Apocalyptic Cinematic : 15 Films Where Humanity Is n't Doing So Hot , Planet of the Apes , Matrix
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Science fiction is among the most creative of motion picture genres , where viewers are able to take flights of fancy into worlds of wonder … like , say , Pandora in " Avatar . "
That was cool , right ?
And , yet , there 's something equally intriguing about taking that dark left turn into areas that have n't happened and probably wo n't happen…and , yet , there 's this nagging sensation in the back of your brain that keeps reminding you that maybe , just maybe , they could happen .
The idea of a world where humanity is on its last legs is one which has floated through art and literature for hundreds of years , but such concepts increased exponentially with the advent of the atomic bomb , and once Hollywood special effects began to catch up to the imaginations of filmmakers , you could n't turn around without finding a new post - apocalyptic vision on the big screen .
Here 's a list of some of the most notable , along with a few of our personal favorites , but rest assured that there are many , many more where these came from .
Planet of the Apes ( 1968 )
Though this is n't actually a best - to - worst list , " Planet of the Apes " was always going to be sitting at the top .
Not only has it been the subject of countless pop culture parodies ( admit it , " Simpsons " geeks : you 've been singing " I hate every ape I see / From chimpan - A to chimpanzee " since you started reading ) and contains one of the greatest movie lines of all time ( " Take your stinking paws off me , you damn dirty ape ! " ) , but it was a defining moment in late ' 60s science fiction , leaving a legacy that even Tim Burton 's craptastic remake was n't able to taint …much .
Everyone knows the famous State of Liberty scene where Taylor ( Charlton Heston ) damns the maniacs all to hell for blowing up the planet , but Earth 's real problem started with the plague that hit in 1983 ( ! ) , which killed off the majority of the planet 's dogs and cats .
After a suitable period of mourning , humanity turned to monkeys and apes as pets , a regrettable decision which quickly led to simian slave labor and the inevitable uprising .
At this point , things get a little sketchy , but a nuclear exchange definitely took place , and it was all downhill for humanity after that …not that apekind did n't have its own troubles .
( See " Battle for the Planet of the Apes " for details . )
Good thing the mutants had the Alpha - Omega Bomb to serve as the great equalizer .
Of course , their version of leveling the playing field involved leveling the entire planet , but , hey , you can't argue with those kinds of results .

Five ( 1951 )
During the 1950s , when families were building fallout shelters in their backyards and kids were participating in " duck and cover " drills in public schools , you can imagine that the idea of a post - apocalyptic society was something that was being treated with deadly seriousness .
Although " Five " is n't necessarily the best of the motion pictures that came out of this concern ( that honor is better bestowed on 1959 's " The World , The Flesh , and The Devil , " starring Sidney Poitier , Inger Stevens , and Mel Ferrer ) , it 's generally cited as the first .
Written and directed by Arch Oboler , the film focuses on the survivors of an atomic bomb disaster …and , yes , there are just as many as you think there are .
Or , at least , that 's how it starts out , anyway .
There 's Roseanne ( Susan Douglas Rubes ) , a pregnant wife who needs first - hand confirmation of her husband 's fate before she 'll accept it , Michael ( William Phipps ) , the man she finds living in her aunt 's house , Oliver ( Earl Lee ) , an elderly bank clerk whose mind can't recognize the reality of the situation , Eric ( James Anderson ) , a mountain climber on his way back from Mount Everest who barely survives his plane running out of fuel , and Charles ( Charles Lampkin ) , an African - American man who provides the film with a message of racial tolerance rarely seen in that era .
" Five " is a stark look at a situation that , at the time , Americans feared they might well find themselves experiencing for real , and even after almost 60 years , it still remains a powerful film .

The Omega Man ( 1971 )
Richard Matheson 's 1954 novel , " I Am Legend , " has been adapted into film form three times , first in 1964 as " The Last Man on Earth , " starring Vincent Price , and most recently in 2007 , where it maintained its original title and found Will Smith in the leading role .
Your mileage on the matter may vary , but we 're partial to the ( omega ) man in the middle , where Charlton Heston plays U.S. Army Colonel Robert Neville , M.D. , one of the few humans left in Los Angeles who has n't succumbed to the effects of the biological warfare between the People 's Republic of China and the Soviet Union either by dying or falling victim to a strange pigmentation - affecting mutation .
That 's not quite how things went down in the book ( it was actually a plague that caused Earth 's issues ) , but the effect is approximately the same , with Neville – who used himself as a guinea pig for a vaccine that turned out to work just fine , thank you – living a life of isolation .
Soon , however , he finds a few uninfected folks , including Dutch ( Paul Koslo ) and Lisa ( Rosalind Cash ) , the latter dressed such that we presume she was on her way to the auditions for " Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song " when the warfare went down .
The skirmish against the Family … that 's what the united homicidal albino mutants call themselves … does n't go so well for Neville , but thanks to the serum he derived from his blood prior to the final battle , at least the future of humanity looks a little bit brighter .

A Boy and His Dog ( 1975 )
As the saying goes , if you need a friend in a post - nuclear wasteland , get a dog .
That 's especially true if you 're a sociopathic , horny teenage male in need of an intelligent , telepathic canine 's olfactory abilities for locating women .
Females are especially rare in this particular apocalypse and consent is , we 're sorry to say , a small matter to roving rapists growing up in the aftermath of World War IV -- ethics and compassion are n't exactly survival traits in this particular future .
In this blackly comic Hugo - winning film adaptation of a Hugo - winning novella by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison directed by veteran western actor L.Q. Jones ( " The Wild Bunch " ) , the boy is Vic ( Don Johnson , a few years away from " Miami Vice " ) and the dog is a scruffy genetically enhanced mutt -- voiced by Tim McIntyre -- who happens to be vastly smarter than Vic or any other human onscreen .
Billed as " a rather kinky tale of survival , " the movie was a failure on its initial release only to become a cult success later on , and then only to be somewhat forgotten in our own time .
Certainly , understandable accusations of misogyny -- even author Ellison claimed to be furious about the film 's jokey last line -- have n't helped it .
Still , let 's face it , in a real apocalypse , guys like Vic , with or without the humanizing influence of a super - intelligent canine , would be a lot more common than , say , cynical but essentially honorable near superheroes named , say , Max .

Damnation Alley ( 1977 )
After viewing a clip from this lost classic on YouTube , someone was moved to wonder , " Why are the good post - apocalyptic movies all from the ' 70s and ' 80s ? "
You may be surprised to learn that this comment did not appear to be a facetious one …nor , for that matter , was our earlier description of the film as a lost classic .
Released by 20th Century Fox in the wake of " Star Wars " after a disconcerting amount of post - production , " Damnation Alley " starts by revealing the path to Earth 's nuclear devastation , then fast - forwards two years to show a planet that 's been tilted off its axis and ravaged by radiation .
So , basically , not only do you get really crappy weather , but you also get a whole lot of mutated insects .
This means that the cast of the film – which , by the way , includes George Peppard , Jan-Michael Vincent , and Jackie Earle Haley – gets to ride around in an awesome - looking vehicle called the Landmaster .
What 's not to love ?
Well , possibly the fact that the budget can't possibly live up to the concepts set up in Roger Zelazny 's original novel , which results in some rather dodgy special effects .
Okay , so " Damnation Alley " is n't what you 'd call a great film .
It 's still a fun one ( we 've got five words for you : flesh - stripping Madagascar hissing cockroaches ) , and given that it was originally presented in Sound 360 , a high - impact surround sound process that was top of the line in the ' 70s , it 's certainly one ripe for re-appreciation on today 's home theater systems .

Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 )
If you 've ever looked around at the folks shuffling from shop to shop in your local mall , eyes glued to their iPhone screens between bouts of grazing the shop racks , and been reminded of brains - craving zombies , you can take it as a compliment that no less a zombie authority than George A. Romero himself had the same thought -- way back in 1978 , when he followed up " Night of the Living Dead " with this tar - black satire of consumer culture , decades before most people even knew what consumer culture was .
After the human race is devastated by a zombie plague , a small band of survivors takes refuge in a mall -- only to discover that not only are their flesh - eating pursuers annoyingly persistent , but that living in a shopping center is kind of a drag .
There 's some , ahem , meaty subtext in Romero 's " Dawn , " but even if none of that matters to you , it 's still one of the smarter -- and , zombies notwithstanding , more believable -- post - apocalyptic thrillers to come out of Hollywood .
And Romero did it all on a $ 500,000 budget , too !
Imagine what he could have done with the " I Am Legend " catering budget .
The saga continued with further " Dead " films , including " Day of the Dead " and " Land of the Dead , " but " Dawn " is rightfully held up as Romero 's zombie masterpiece .

The Road Warrior ( 1981 )
By the late seventies , post - nuclear apocalyptic landscapers were starting to become old hat , while the memory of the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and worldwide energy crisis that followed remained topical .
The original " Mad Max " posited a world that was literally running out of gas and becoming increasingly desperate and ultra-violent .
By the opening of George Miller 's classic sequel with roots in western epics and silent films , dystopia has given way to full - blown apocalypse .
Few seem to have survived the worldwide oil wars , save for groups of refugee pioneers attempting to deal with predatory punk - rock motorcycle gangs a bit closer to the hordes of Mordor than your standard Hell 's Angels .
Into this miasma comes Mel Gibson 's iconic " burnt out ... shell - of - a- man " who comes back into contact with the soul he lost in the prior film by going where countless reluctant screen heroes have gone before and helping the settlers in their attempt to reestablish something like civilization in the burnt - out outback , befriending a feral child ( Emil Minty ) and a dentally challenged autogyro pilot ( Bruce Spence ) in the process .
Like a cowboy or a master - less samurai , Max wanders on , but what the disaster of a dead civilization has taken away from him , it 's also given him to opportunity to partially reclaim .

Night of the Comet ( 1984 )
As a rule , rogue comets passing by our planet rarely result in anything good , but to have one turn almost everyone not under a steel - lined roof into red dust … ?
It was , as the film 's poster assured us , the last thing on earth that sisters Regina and Samantha Belmont ( Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelly Maroney ) ever expected .
" Night of the Comet " is generally thought of us as kitschy , and that 's not an entirely inaccurate perception ( cue the shopping montage set to " Girls Just Want To Have Fun " ) , but it 's aged far better than most of the low - budget sci- fi / horror films of the era , offering unexpectedly effective scares ( there 's a particularly fun bit involving a nightmare which turns out to be taking place within another nightmare ) and creating characters that end up far more fleshed out than the clichés they initially appear to be .
The best examples of the latter come with the character of Hector ( Robert Beltran ) , whose trip to check on the safety of his family is surprisingly touching , and through Mary Woronov 's surprising poignant performance as a scientist who tries to do the right thing before succumbing to…uh , what exactly was she infected with ?
The science of " Night of the Comet " is more than a little dodgy , never bothering to offer an explanation as to why some people turned to dust while others became zombies , but in the end , you 're provided with such an awesome artifact of the ' 80s that you find yourself forgiving the film its flaws .

When the Wind Blows ( 1986 )
Moving from the ridiculous to the sublime , let us look at possibly the most depressing animated film you 'll ever see .
Though it 's likely known more to Americans because of its soundtrack , which features contributions from David Bowie , Roger Waters , and Genesis , this adaptation of Raymond Briggs ' graphic novel offers a look at how an elderly couple deals with an impending nuclear war and its inevitable aftermath , focusing on how little hope that such survivors would likely have .
Sir John Mills and Dame Peggy Ashcroft provide the voices of the couple , who put their utmost faith in everything the government has told them about how to survive an attack , and having survived World War II , they manage to keep their spirits up even while preparing for the worst .
Alas , faith serves them poorly : promises of post - attack government assistance of food and fresh water come to naught , leaving them to collect rain water and ultimately succumb to the ravages of radiation sickness .
Director Jimmy Murakami does make time for flashback sequences to establish the longstanding love the couple have for each other ( you may find yourself reminded of the beginning of " Up " ) , but it only makes the excruciating trip to the finale of the film all the more harrowing .
No , it 's not a film for children … and not just because things move at a slow , studied pace that would put pre-teens to sleep .
The statement made by " When the Wind Blows " is one that still proves all too familiar today : war is Hell .

12 Monkeys ( 1995 )
The future looks pretty grim in Terry Gilliam 's sole foray into the realm of science fiction .
( No , " Brazil " is n't sci - fi ; it was satire , but these days it 's looking more and more like reality . )
The population of planet Earth has been nearly wiped out by a virus , and the few that have survived have moved underground ; it 's a hazily portrayed existence , yet there 's no question that life for humanity is bleak at best .
The surface of the planet remains as it was , only overrun by animals of all kinds ( which is given an explanation later in the movie ) .
The government and scientists have turned their efforts toward perfecting time travel , and have managed to cobble together a crude technique , which is where prisoner James Cole ( Bruce Willis ) enters the picture .
He 's sent to the past ( numerous times ) in order to find out more about the virus 's origins .
There he meets mental patient Jeffrey Goines ( Brad Pitt , in an Oscar - nominated performance ) , who may very well have something to do with the end of the world as we know it .
As the story moves forward , it becomes one of those time travel meditations that says nothing can be done to change the past , and no matter how hard you try , you 'll inevitably find yourself becoming part of the timeline .
The film , based on the 1962 short " La Jetée , " was dazzling in its day , and remains a potent concoction of sci - fi , memories and madness 15 years later .
It also unfortunately marks the last time Gilliam had a box office hit .

Six String Samurai ( 1998 )
What if the Soviet Union had launched a series of warheads at the United States in 1957 ?
That 's the intriguing question posed by " Six - String Samurai " – but the movie does n't stop there .
Instead , writer - director Lance Mungia adds another layer , using his vision of a shattered post - nuclear American landscape as the backdrop for an action thriller version of the battle between traditional music ( country , mariachi ) , rock & roll , and metal .
It sounds bizarre , and it is , but it works ; the " Six - String Samurai " in question , played by co-screenwriter Jeffrey Falcon , is a katana - wielding Buddy Holly lookalike ( aptly named Buddy ) who wages war against a Slash - resembling , metal - cranking warlord who 's bent on conquering " Last Vegas . "
A Sundance sensation in ' 98 , " Samurai " never really did the kind of business promised by all the hype surrounding the film , and Mungia did n't direct again until he helmed a " Crow " direct - to - video sequel in 2005 ( talk about your apocalypses ) .
Still , it 's a fun flick , and if your interests include the end of the world and rock ' n ' roll , you can hardly do better than this .

The Matrix ( 1999 )
The idea of mankind enslaved by some malevolent force or another is an old favorite with moviemakers ( Aliens ! Bugs !
Apes ! ) , as is the idea of people being , um , repurposed , as it were .
( Two words : Soylent Green . )
" The Matrix " is one of the only movies to combine the two concepts , though when the movie begins , neither of them is apparent .
Indeed , the world of Tom Anderson , a worker drone by day and uber - hacker Neo by night , seems pretty unremarkable .
It is only after hacker cult figure Morpheus agrees to show Tom " how deep the rabbit hole goes " that Tom , and we , learn The Ugly Truth : the surface of the earth has been uninhabitable for centuries , and all humans are spending their lives in a virtual reality construct , while a complex network of machines uses the electrical energy and body heat from their real bodies , which are stored in individual pods , as a fuel source .
Whoa .
Curiously , the film was so eager to show off its knowledge of philosophy , Hong Kong cinema and bullet - cam techniques that it spent very little time exploring one very simple question : what price freedom ?
Obviously no one wants to fuel the machines that enslaved humanity , but then again , choosing life outside of the Matrix is a lot like choosing life in " The Road , " minus the cannibals .
( For now , anyway . )
And after seeing the food that the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar ate , and the ratty conditions of the humans ' promised land of Zion , that imaginary steak Agent Smith " fed " Cypher would have looked damn good to us , too .

Children of Men ( 2006 )
What would happen to our world if we had everything we currently have , minus just one thing : a future ?
The answer portrayed in this involving , grimly violent , and hugely moving film by Alfonso Cuaron , based on a novel by P.D. James , is a bleak one indeed .
Fascism , vicious anti-immigration policies , poverty , and mindless warfare are just a few of the plagues visited upon humanity by itself after realizing that it has -- for no clear reason -- lost the ability to reproduce .
In the middle of all this is Theo Faron ( Clive Owen at his most Bogart - esque ) , a tragedy - scarred activist - turned - bureaucrat who would prefer not to stick his neck out for anyone but who nevertheless finds the courage to do the right thing .
In this case , that means helping a vulnerable young African immigrant ( Claire - Hope Ashitey ) who is the only known person to have become pregnant in eighteen years and who has therefore become a pawn in a political game being played by some extremely callous players .
It 's an increasingly deadly journey , including one of the most viscerally frightening battle sequences since " Saving Private Ryan . "
Still , it 's a battle that must be endured .
Apocalypses may come and go , but as long as there are children , there is hope .

Terminator Salvation ( 2009 )
The tales of the " Terminator " universe will give you a headache if you try to make sense of all the time travel shenanigans , but one thing 's for sure : the future definitely is n't looking too bright for humanity .
But why , you ask , have we gone with the least of the films as our designated selection when all the other entries in the franchise feature glimpses of a future involving the so - called " Rise of the Machines " ?
Simple : it 's the only one that takes place almost exclusively during that era .
" Salvation " is all about the human resistance forces fighting against the forces of Skynet , the computer system which took its artificial intelligence , said , " Screw this , " and revolted against its creators ( an event which would come to be known as Judgment Day ) .
It also gives us the first full - fledged look at resistance fighter John Connor in action as an adult and provides us with more details about the Terminators ' evolution , their shift away from pure robotics , and the incorporation of living tissue into their matrix .
Still , we can't very well ignore the preceding films , especially since they 're all about trying to keep the events in " Salvation " from coming to pass in the first place .
Although the ostensible purpose of " Salvation " was to fill a gap in the franchise 's history by showing more of the devastation caused by Skynet 's uprising , it 's arguable that we had a lot more dread about what was on the horizon when we were only seeing the future in small doses .

Battlefield : Earth ( 2000 )
Much as " Planet of the Apes " was always destined to sit atop this list , so was it secured long ago that " Battlefield Earth " would be at the bottom … because , really , where else would you put the film which took home the Razzie for Worst Picture of the Decade ?
There had been attempts to bring L. Ron Hubbard 's 1982 novel to the big screen since its publication , but it took the power of a post - " Pulp Fiction " John Travolta to finally make it happen … and once it did happen , all but the most diehard Scientologists likely wished that it had n't .
" Battlefield Earth " paints a picture of an Earth that 's been under alien rule for a millennium , but humanity finally battles back against the so - called Psychlos , thanks to the man known as Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ( Barry Pepper ) .
Y'see , Earth apparently is n't the greatest post , which is why the Psychlo charged with handling the security of the planet – Terl , played by Travolta – got his job as a form of punishment .
Frustrated with the situation , Terl devises a plan to buy his way out by getting human slaves to mine huge amounts of gold from a highly radioactive area , but he makes the mistake of selecting Jonnie as his foreman .
The next thing you know , there 's a major uprising , Terl ends up imprisoned in Fort Knox , and the humans are in charge again .
Yay , Earth !
Some say " Battlefield " failed at the box office because of an anti-Scientology backlash .
Do n't you believe them : it bombed because it 's terrible .

TRIPOLI ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ A Libyan plane arriving from South Africa crashed on landing at Tripoli airport Wednesday , killing more than 100 people but an eight - year - old Dutch boy was a miracle survivor , officials said .
Afriqiyah Airways listed 93 passengers and 11 crew members on board its flight 8U771 from Johannesburg .
“ I can confirm the crash but not the number of the dead , ” said Bongani Sithole , an official of the airline at Johannesburg airport .
“ We hear that it happened one metre ( yard ) away from the runway . ”

A Libyan security official earlier told AFP that all those on board the Airbus A330 had died but an airport official said in fact an eight - year - old boy from the Netherlands had survived and was rushed to hospital near Tripoli .
There was no immediate indication of the cause of the crash , which occurred as the Afriqiyah Airways plane was landing after a flight from Johannesburg at around 6 am ( 0400 GMT ) .
“ It exploded on landing and totally disintegrated , ” the security official told AFP , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The crew members were all Libyan nationals , the official added .
An AFP correspondent said the crash site had been sealed off by security officials and ambulances and emergency vehicles were seen rushing between the airport and the capital , about 50 kilometres ( 30 miles ) apart .

The wreckage could be seen in the distance but no plumes of smoke were evident .
Weather conditions were good at Tripoli on Wednesday morning , with only light clouds in the sky .
Afriqiyah Airways said on its website that it operates an Airbus fleet .
It started operations with five leased planes and signed a contract with Airbus at an exhibition in Paris in 2007 for the purchase of 11 new planes , the website said .

It was founded in April 2001 and at first fully owned by the Libyan state .
The company ?s capital was later divided into shares to be managed by the Libya - Africa Investment Portfolio .
On April 21 , the airline announced that flights were back to normal after disruptions due to the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland that grounded flights in Europe last month .

Last June , a 12 - year - old girl was the sole survivor of a Yemeni plane crash off the Comoros .
Wednesday ’s crash was the deadliest air accident in Libya since December 22 , 1992 when a Libyan Arab Airlines plane crashed near Tripoli airport killing 157 people .
Twenty - two people were killed in an oil company plane crash in January 2000 .

In other major accidents , 79 people were killed when a Korean Air crashed in Tripoli in July 1989 .
And 59 people died in a Balkan Bulgarian Airlines crash near Benghazi in December 1977 , while 36 passengers and crew died when a Central African Airways came down in August 1958 , also near Benghazi in eastern Libya .
Wins , losses , and the manner in which a professional record is compiled usually determine a fighter 's standing in mixed martial arts circles .
But these barometers fail to measure a fighter 's internal makeup .
For more than a year , UFC middleweight Dan Miller has battled difficulties few human beings will ever experience .
He and his wife , Kristen , lost their first child at birth last year .
It 's an emotional ordeal from which neither parent has yet recovered .
The death of their daughter came days before Miller was scheduled to face Chael Sonnen at UFC 98 in May 2009 .
Miller could have pulled out of the bout but opted to fulfill his contractual obligation and provide for his grieving wife .
He gave everything he had against Sonnen but lost by unanimous decision .
Nine months later , Miller would re-enter the Octagon against Demian Maia .
Tough break : Dan Miller , left , dislocated his thumb in the first round against Demian Maia at UFC 109 .
Dave Mandel / Sherdog.com
The fight with Maia at UFC 109 would take place a few weeks after the birth of the Miller 's second child , Daniel .
While most new fathers are filled with excitement over the birth of their child , Miller 's joy has been temperate .
Daniel has not had an easy transition into this world , and he is fighting for his life .
Caring for an ailing son and comforting his wife has been tough for Miller , who will face Michael Bisping in the co-featured bout Saturday night at UFC 114 in Las Vegas .
It 's been an emotionally draining year for Miller , who has lost two fights in a row during that span .
Despite his setbacks in the cage , Miller ( 11 - 3 - 0 , one no-contest ) wo n't point to difficulties at home as contributing factors .
He refuses take anything from his opponents ' successes .
" [ Sonnen and Maia ] were two good fights , " Miller told ESPN.com .
" Chael basically came out and mauled me .
He came out and just outwrestled me .
It was a close fight with Demian . "
If the death of one child and ongoing struggles of another were n't enough , Miller faced more adversity in Round 1 against Maia .
He dislocated the thumb on his right hand -- his power - punching hand .
With his power compromised , Miller turned to his younger brother , UFC lightweight Jim Miller , for help putting the thumb back in its socket .
Despite his efforts , Jim was unable to resolve the problem .
Dan was forced to fight the final two rounds of that bout basically one - handed .
The pain was excruciating , but at no time did Miller consider quitting .
There is no quit in Dan Miller .
Istanbul , Turkey ( CNN ) --
Turkish warplanes launched a series of cross - border air raids against suspected Kurdish separatist fighters in northern Iraq on Thursday , Turkey 's semi-official Anatolian News Agency reported .
A Turkish military source told CNN Turk , CNN 's sister network , that the military scrambled jets to carry out the attack after a group of suspected fighters were detected on Iraqi territory , approaching Turkey 's mountainous border with Iraq .
Residents of the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir , where a civilian airport doubles as an airbase for the Turkish Air Force , told CNN they heard the unmistakable roar of Turkish F - 16 warplanes taking off Thursday .
Meanwhile , the Firat News Agency , widely believed to be a media arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK , announced on its website that Turkish warplanes bombed three mountainous regions in northern Iraq on Thursday afternoon .
The Turkish security forces have been battling PKK guerrilla fighters in the predominantly Kurdish region of southeastern Turkey for more than 25 years .
More than 30,000 people , mostly ethnic Kurds , have been killed in the conflict .
Kurdish fighters appear to have recently stepped up their attacks on Turkish security forces , as often happens during the summer months .
Since April 26 , the Turkish military said , 12 of its soldiers have been killed in a series of attacks in the Turkish southeast .
Troops are currently conducting operations in a number of locations in this turbulent region .
For the past several years , Washington , which officially labels the PKK a terrorist agency , has shared " real - time intelligence " with its Turkish NATO allies about PKK activities in the mountains of northern Iraq .
Turkey has long pressured the Iraqi government to do more to rein in Kurdish separatists that operate in the border area .
On May 7 , the Turkish military said , it bombed suspected PKK targets in northern Iraq , after a unit of Turkish special forces troops came under fire from across the frontier .

Irish airspace will be shut until at least lunchtime tomorrow due to the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland , the Irish Aviation Authority has said .
Irish airports have been closed until 1 pm and the IAA said it will provide an update at 9 am .
Intending passengers are advised to check the websites of their airlines for further information .
The IAA said the decision was based on information from the Volcanic Ash Advice Centre that the concentration of ash particles in the atmosphere had exceeded engine manufactures ’ tolerance levels .
Eamon Brennan , IAA chief executive , said Ireland was the only country in which flight restrictions had been imposed and followed the pushing of volcanic ash over part of the centre of Ireland by north easterly winds .
" The decision is based on the safety risks to crews and passengers as a result of the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud , " the IAA said in a statement .
Donegal Airport closed earlier and two Aer Arann flights were cancelled .
Over -flights of Ireland from the UK and Europe will not be impacted , the IAA said , adding flights in mainland Europe will operate normally .
Travellers suffered six days of disruption last month after the plume of volcanic ash from Iceland 's Eyjafjallajökull volcano caused massive disruption to air traffic across Europe .
The cloud of ash forced the cancellation of over 60,000 flights in that period and left passengers stranded across the world .
... and then the cube explodes .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
The final score : David 6 , Goliath 3 .
" The Hurt Locker " earned six Oscars at the 82nd annual Academy Awards Sunday night , taking home the biggest prize -- best picture -- as well as honors for its director , original screenplay , sound editing , sound mixing and film editing .
The small - budget movie , one of the lowest - grossing films to be nominated in the post - " Star Wars " blockbuster era , defeated its primary competition , James Cameron 's " Avatar , " the big - budget , highest - grossing film of all time .
The groundbreaking " Avatar , " with its dazzling effects and creative presentation , won three Oscars , for cinematography , visual effects and art direction .
Both films led the pack with nine nominations each .
Complete list of winners
" The Hurt Locker , " a film about a bomb disposal unit in the early part of the Iraq War , developed its momentum slowly , winning notice at festivals in the latter part of 2008 before earning a national release in the summer of 2009 .
Despite fading quickly at the box office -- to date , it 's earned just $ 21 million worldwide , versus more than $ 2.6 billion for " Avatar " -- it was remembered by critics and peers at the end of the year , winning several awards .
" Locker " director Kathryn Bigelow made history by becoming the first woman to win the directing prize .
Presenter Barbra Streisand opened the envelope with , " Well , the time has come ! " as a loud standing ovation and lots of shrieks greeted Bigelow 's arrival on the stage .
" There 's no other way to describe it -- it 's the moment of a lifetime , " she said , accepting her directing prize .
She dedicated her honor " to the women and men in the military who risk their lives on a daily basis ... may they come home safe . "
Earlier , writer and producer Mark Boal , who based the script on his reporting from Iraq , paid tribute to director Bigelow , " all of the soldiers still over there and those who have died " and to his father , who passed away a month ago , he said in his acceptance speech .
The acting awards were divided between old favorites and rising newcomers .
Sandra Bullock won best actress for her performance as a forceful mother who brings a homeless teen into her well - off family in " The Blind Side . "
Bullock started her speech with jokes , paying tribute to her " lover , Meryl Streep " -- a fellow nominee -- and asking , " Did I really earn this or did I just wear you all down ? "
But her voice cracked with emotion as she dedicated her award to " the moms that take care of the babies and the children , no matter where they come from , " and then turned her attention to her own mother , whom Bullock described as firm but supportive .
Jeff Bridges won the best actor Oscar for his performance as an alcohol - soaked country singer in " Crazy Heart . "
" Thank you , Academy members ! " he exulted , raising his Oscar high .
" Thank you Mom and Dad for turning me on to such a groovy profession .
...
They loved showbiz so much , and I feel like an extension of them .
This is as much for them as it is for me . "
Bridges ' father was Lloyd Bridges , star of the TV show " Sea Hunt " and many movies , and his mother was actress Dorothy Bridges .
The nominated song from " Crazy Heart , " " The Weary Kind , " won best original song .
Get backstage with the Oscars on the Marquee Blog
Mo'Nique won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role as Mary Jones , an abusive mother in " Precious . "
In a fierce and memorable acceptance speech , she thanked the Oscar voters " for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics . "
" I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she did so I do n't have to , " Mo'Nique said .
McDaniel was the first African - American to win an Academy Award when she was given the best supporting actress Oscar for playing Mammy in the 1939 film " Gone with the Wind . "
Mo'Nique said before the show that she was wearing a gardenia in her hair in tribute to McDaniel , because she wore one for her acceptance speech 70 years ago .
She also thanked Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey , who helped director Lee Daniels land a distribution deal for the movie .
" Because you touched it , the whole world saw it , " Mo'Nique said .
Backstage , Mo'Nique was asked whether she still considered herself a stand - up comedian now that she is an Oscar - winning actress .
" I am a standup comedian who won an Oscar , " she said .
The success of her role " was so not about my acting career , " she said .
" This role was about my life , to teach me not to judge . "
Who was best dressed at the Oscars ?
The story of a downtrodden inner-city teenager also pulled off a mild upset earlier , winning best adapted screenplay over perceived front - runner " Up in the Air . "
" I do n't know what to say , " said visibly moved writer Geoffrey Fletcher , paying tribute to the filmmakers , his two brothers , his mother and father .
" I thank everyone , " said Fletcher , gasping emotionally .
Christoph Waltz won the first Oscar of the night , a best supporting actor award for " Inglourious Basterds . "
" This is your welcoming embrace , and there 's no way I can ever thank you enough , " Waltz said .
" But I can start right now , thank you . "
" Up " won best animated feature , yet another victory for the Pixar studios , which has dominated the category since its introduction for the 2002 awards .
Pixar has now won three straight animated feature Oscars and five of the nine overall .
Michael Giacchino 's music for the film won best score .
Best foreign language film went to " The Secret in Their Eyes , " from Argentina .
" The Cove " won best documentary feature .
Hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin kept the ceremony moving until the big - award slowdown at the end .
The two were lowered from the ceiling after an over - the - top opening number featuring a singing - and - dancing Neil Patrick Harris , and maintained a Bob Hope / Bing Crosby rhythm through much of the festivities , zinging one - liners at all and sundry .
And in a moving tribute , several stars of John Hughes movies -- including Molly Ringwald , Matthew Broderick , Jon Cryer , Judd Nelson , Ally Sheedy , Anthony Michael Hall and Macaulay Culkin -- came out to talk about the director of " The Breakfast Club " and " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off , " who died in 2009 .
Hughes ' family , which was sitting in the audience , received an ovation .
CNN 's Todd Leopold contributed to this story .
ALLENTOWN , Pa. —
A Pennsylvania school district that was at the center of a highly publicized "
sexting
" case was sued today by a teenager who claims her principal confiscated her cell phone , found nude images she had taken of herself and turned it over to prosecutors .
Tunkhannock Area High School Principal Gregory Ellsworth illegally searched the 17 - year - old 's phone in January 2009 , even though she intended the racy photos to be " seen only herself and , perhaps , her longtime boyfriend , " according to the federal lawsuit .
It says the principal gave the phone to George Skumanick Jr. , at the time the Wyoming County district attorney , who threatened to file felony child pornography charges against the girl unless she took a class on sexual violence .
In Perry County , student accounts and audio recordings of disciplinary hearings conducted by the Susquenita School Board show at least three district administrators viewed pornographic images on student cell phones during a sexting investigation last year .
State police and Perry County District Attorney Charles Chenot are looking into whether the district 's investigation was conducted improperly .
" I was absolutely horrified and humiliated to learn that school officials , men in ( the ) DA 's office , and police had seen naked pictures of me , " said the plaintiff in the Tunkhannock case , now 19 and identified in court documents only by the initials N.N.
She graduated in 2009 .
" Those pictures were extremely private and not meant for anyone else 's eyes .
What they did is the equivalent of spying on me through my bedroom window , " she said in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania , which is representing her .
The suit , filed in Scranton , seeks unspecified damages against Ellsworth , the district , the county , prosecutors and a detective .
It also seeks the destruction of any images still in the possession of law enforcement .
District Superintendent Michael J. Healey , the school district ’s lawyer and current District Attorney Jeff Mitchell all declined to comment Thursday , saying they had not seen the suit .
Ellsworth and Skumanick did not immediately return phone messages .
The district in rural northeastern Pennsylvania was at the center of the nation 's first criminal case involving sexting — the practice of sending explicit photos via text message — to reach a federal appeals court .
The court ruled in March that prosecutors could not criminally charge a teenage girl who appeared in a photo similar to the one involved in the latest lawsuit .

Premature ejaculation could be passed to men genetically , scientists say
It can leave men feeling like a failure in the bedroom and damage even the strongest marriages .
The problem of premature ejaculation has long been linked with psychological issues - but now scientists say it could be something that is inherited .
Researchers have found men for whom sex is over all too quickly are more likely to have a genetic abnormality .
Problems with premature ejaculation could be inherited : Scientists have found that a genetic abnormality can affect levels of a chemical in the brain .
( Posed by models )
These men carried a defect in a gene that controls the release of dopamine , a chemical ' neurotransmitter ' that plays a crucial role in everything from movement and attention span to the brain 's perception of pleasure and reward .
The researchers in Sweden and Finland believe drugs that boost dopamine levels in the brain could be a new way of treating a condition that affects one in four men in the UK .
As far back as the 1970s , researchers noted that dopamine - based drugs used to treat Parkinson 's disease had an aphrodisiac effect on some patients .
But until now , most experts agreed premature ejaculation was probably linked with psychological issues - such as difficulty relaxing during sex .
Treatments usually involve relaxation techniques , although doctors do sometimes prescribe anti-depressants to control anxiety .
The latest study , published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine , suggests the problem may be passed down through the generations .
Experts looked at almost 1,300 men aged between 18 and 45 and asked each one on how long they were usually able to last during sex .
They also took saliva samples to test for defects in a dopamine transporter gene , called DAT1 .
The results showed that men with a slightly different form of the gene were much more likely to suffer from premature ejaculation .
In a report on their findings , scientists said : ' The results of this study indicate that drugs directly affecting dopamine levels may be candidates for treatment . '
The media outlet that revealed New South Wales Labor MP David Campbell 's hidden sexuality is defending its decision to air the story .
Mr Campbell quit in dramatic circumstances on Thursday night , just minutes before he was shown on Channel Seven walking out of a gay sex club in Sydney 's east .
His resignation forced Premier Kristina Keneally to make a hasty Cabinet reshuffle .
Mr Campbell had not breached any of his ministerial responsibilities by visiting gay club Ken's at Kensington , although Ms Keneally said the fact that he used his ministerial car to get there was inappropriate .
Ms Keneally said Mr Campbell stepped down because he was backed into a corner .
" It 's a resignation I accepted on compassionate grounds , " Ms Keneally said .
" Clearly he needs time for himself and for his family to work through what is unquestionably a very difficult period for him personally , for his family .
" And can I say that I do think it is a matter for debate whether or not a person 's sexuality is of relevance to their role as a minister . "
Channel Seven said it was right to broadcast the story because the minister 's private conduct was at odds with his public persona .
Seven 's news director Peter Meakin says Mr Campbell has been hypocritical .
" I think you 've got to look at the aspects that apply in each case , " he said .
" In the case of Mr Campbell , here was a guy who had been minister for police , which is a very sensitive portfolio , who had been presenting himself and gaining re-election as a happy family man - sending out Christmas cards with his wife and sons pictured on the card and portraying himself as a loving father and husband .
" Now all this time and apparently for the last 25 years he has been acting otherwise .
I think the electorate have the right to know that . "
Christmas card
But Dr Simon Longstaff from the St James Ethics Centre says that is a weak argument because Mr Campbell did not make his political career campaigning on moral issues .
" It does n't seem to be true that it holds for David Campbell , who ... has done nothing more than be truthful about the fact that he has a family , " he said .
" I mean , you might think that using one 's family to promote a political career has all sorts of problems .
" But as far as I know , David Campbell is married , he does have a family and he has indicated that in his Christmas card because that is part of who he is .
" I mean he is obviously a complex person .
But to say that he has engaged in some kind of gross act of political hypocrisy is to make too great a statement in relation to this particular case . "
Mr Meakin says the story is best justified by its subject .
" But at the end of the day , if we want any endorsement for what we have done , I quote Mr David Campbell who says , ' I apologise to my wife , family , colleagues , staff and the community for letting them down ' , " he said .
Mr Campbell is not alone in his dilemma .
The Gay and Married Men's Association ( GAMMA ) says it receives tens of thousands of calls a year from men who are struggling with their sexuality .
GAMMA spokesman Greg Smith says the story is a sad reflection of the media at its worst and it will be a worry to people who are coming to terms with being gay .
" Many people come to organisations like GAMMA because it is discreet and private and the matters that are discussed in the organisation stay there , " he said .
" For these people to now know that somebody with a wandering camera could photograph them and then make it known to other people what is going on in their private life sends off a completely wrong message to these people who we are trying to encourage to come to grips with their own sexuality . "
Talkback views
Mr Campbell is a sitting member in the seat of Keira in Wollongong where talkback lines have been running hot .
Callers ' anger was directed at both the former minister and the media .
" I am seething with anger ; not at what David Campbell did but the way the people who were filming it had gone about it , " one caller said .
" I think if you are a member of parliament , do n't you have to be of good character , of good rapport and honest , which he in this instance has not been honest with his family , " another said .
" Basically it 's homophobia and I think the best thing for him and his family is to stand for Keira .
I do n't vote Labor but I will if he stands , " another caller said .
Mr Meakin insists Channel Seven has acted appropriately .
" When it comes to handing out Walkley Awards , we probably wo n't get one for this , " he said .
" Am I proud that we have done the story ?
Yes , I am . "
Ms Keneally says the media 's conduct will be the subject of debate , but it is important not to forget that there is a human toll in this story .
" Let 's just all have a deep breath and understand what has happened here , " she said .
" A man who has been living with a secret about his sexuality for over two decades has had it come out , not in the manner of his choosing and certainly in a way that is most devastating for his family .
" I think we all just need to recognise the complexity of this situation . "
An 8 - year - old
Jersey City second - grader
brought a knife to school Wednesday , district officials confirmed , apparently " to stab another student . "
The boy 's plan was thwarted , and a possible tragedy averted , when two classmates at
School 33
who were shown the knife , quickly alerted a security guard , a mother of one of the students told
The Jersey Journal .
She said her son told her the knife - wielding student " brought the knife to school to stab another student . "
Jersey City school district spokeswoman Paula Christen said she was unaware that a threat was made .
The boy with the knife has been suspended three days from the Union Street school and will spend 10 days in the district 's Zero Tolerance program , Christen said .
She added that the boy apparently was being bullied by another second - grader .
The classmate accused of bullying has also been suspended from school three days .
Jersey City police were not called , although that is the usual policy of the district involving students and weapons in schools , Christen said .
Since the incident involved a second - grader and the parents of both students quickly arrived at the school , police were not involved , she said .
Christen said the knife was actually a pen knife , although she did not specify how long it was .
" I 'm very proud of my son for telling the security guard -- something awful could have happened , " said the mom of one of the second - graders who reported the knife .
" He did the right thing . "
Christen said the students who alerted teachers to the possible tragic situation will be given " good citizenship " awards .
In startling enviro - technology news , it has been reported that an ordinary 1950s house in California has been given a " green renovation " which has apparently made it a " Zero Energy House " and won its builders an award from the state government .
Not some nasty cold , dark hut for unwashed primitives , oh no
This is pretty interesting stuff , as the US Department of Energy says ( pdf ) that a " Zero Energy " building is one " with greatly reduced energy needs through efficiency gains such that the balance of energy needs can be supplied with renewable technologies " .
In other words the Californian prototype house can supply all the energy it needs over time through its own renewable microgeneration equipment - if it uses external electricity supplies such as grid power at times , it compensates for this by providing surplus juice of its own back to the grid at others .
This sort of thing has always been possible , of course , but it generally means a dwelling without heating , hot water , cooking or air conditioning ( the latter often seen as essential to life in much of California ) and not a lot in the way of electrical appliances either .
But the Zero Energy ( " Zenergy " ) House Prototype , created by Residential Energy Assessment Services ( " Making Los Angeles Green " ) is no such primitive icebox / hothouse , suitable only for unwashed people in smelly clothes who eat their food raw and go to bed when it gets dark .
It has heating , air conditioning , hot water , cooking , plenty of lights and appliances .
Yet it is still " Zero Energy " .
Eco-design news hub Inhabitat ( " Green design will save the world " ! ) reported on the Zenergy House Protoype 's opening this week in gushing terms :
The Zenergy House is a 1950 ’s [ sic ] remodel that delivers high on sustainability and low on energy use — net zero to be exact — thanks to the use of super - efficient green building strategies and solar panels on the roof ...
The home is tricked out from head to toe with sustainable features and products , including a lot of the furnishings and accessories .
REAS themselves describe the remodelling process under the heading " Goal - Net Zero Energy " .
But how did the technical wizards of REAS manage to deliver net zero energy with heating , aircon and all the trimmings in a 1950s house with nothing more than a few solar panels to power it ?
We could n't imagine how , so we asked them and company vice - president Ron Schwolsky promptly and courteously answered our questions .
Unfortunately , the short answer as to how on Earth they made a house comfortable while using no energy from outside is that they did n't .
Aspiring Bond villains take note : there 's only one of these Nautilus VAS luxury submersibles on the market today , so if you do n't act fast you risk losing out on a $ 2.7 million submersible joyride like few others .

The VAS 's " military grade " construction ( which I 'm assuming means " bulletproof , " because life 's more fun that way , but in full disclosure it could well not be ) may leave it blimp - like in exterior appearance , but on the inside it 's all class : a restroom , a minibar , video / music players , even full size stairs !
It 's perfect for you yacht owners who are starting to get the feeling that being above water is for plebes .

The Nautilus VAS Mark III has room for five passengers and can travel up to six knots , and you can expect a total of up to four days underwater time without fear of drowning .
It also features a Diver Lockout , meaning you can enter and exit at whim for a fully formed life under the sea .

Smear campaign goes into overdrive with possibility of another Paul in office

Related : The Establishment Is In Full Blown Panic Over Rand Paul
Following his huge grass roots victory in the Kentucky primary , the establishment on both sides of the phony political paradigm have instituted a desperate and sustained smear campaign against would be Senator Rand Paul .
Neocons have uniformly attacked Paul as “ weak on defense ” because he does not support the illegal interventionist wars of aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan , which have cost trillions in taxpayer dollars to finance .
And while some neocons have attacked Paul as too overtly Libertarian , establishment neolibs are attacking him for not being Libertarian enough !
The primary reasons being because , as a medical doctor , he is against abortion and , secondly , he has yet to express an opinion on gay marriage .
By far the most ridiculous , conniving and abhorrent political attack , however , was put together by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow , who set aside a 20 minute segment of her show to attempt to convince her viewers that Rand Paul was in favour of racial segregation , as if he is some kind of klan member .
The talking point stemmed from an interview earlier in the day that Rand Paul had conducted with NPR , in addition to another previous interview with the Louisville Courier - Journal when Dr Paul was asked his views on the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
In both instances , Paul stressed that he abhorred all forms of racism and discrimination and that he broadly supported the legislation which he sees a major development in American history .
Sticking to his Libertarian and constitutional principles , Paul added a caveat that he felt where private businesses are concerned , the issue becomes more of a philosophical debate regarding the first amendment and how far the federal government should be involved in limiting free speech .
It was this comment that Maddow pounced upon as the centre piece of her attack .
In a blatant bait and switch tactic , Maddow proudly introduced Paul as the man who used her show as the venue to announce his decision to run for Senate last year .
She then launched into Paul for fifteen solid minutes , continually asking the same question :
“ Do you think that a private business has a right to say that ‘ We do n’t serve black people ? ' ”
“ How about desegregating lunch counters ? ” “ Should Woolworths lunch counters have been allowed to stay segregated ?
Sir , just yes or no ? ”
In a situation where many would have faltered and backed away , to his credit , Rand Paul continued to explain his stance in a calm and measured way , noting that seeking government intervention in every instance does not jive with the Constitution .
“ I ’m not in favor of any discrimination of any form , ” Paul replied .
“ I would never belong to any club that excluded anybody for race .
We still do have private clubs in America that can discriminate based on race .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I think what ’s important in this debate is not getting into any specific “ gotcha ” on this , but asking the question ‘ What about freedom of speech ? ' ”
Paul continued .
“ Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent ?
Should we limit racists from speaking ?
I do n’t want to be associated with those people , but I also do n’t want to limit their speech in any way in the sense that we tolerate boorish and uncivilized behavior because that ’s one of the things that freedom requires is that we allow people to be boorish and uncivilized , but that does n’t mean we approve of it . ”
Paul explained that in his eyes the issue was an intellectual debate , noting that “ It ’s really tough to have an intellectual debate in the political sense because what happens is it gets dumbed down .
It will get dumb down to three words and they ’ll try to run on this entire issue , and it ’s being brought up as a political issue . ”
“ Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant ?
Or does the government own his restaurant ?
These are important philosophical debates but not a very practical discussion . ”
Paul added .
Regardless of Paul ’s refusal to water down his belief in the value of the first amendment to appease MSNBC viewers , and ludicrously acting as if she was somehow championing Paul , by intimating she was preparing him for more debates along these lines , Maddow continued along the same path :
“ I think wanting to allow private businesses to discriminate along the basis of race because of property rights is an extreme view , and I think that is going to be the focus nationally on your candidacy now . ” she stated while making sardonic facial gestures as if she were in pain at just discovering that Rand Paul was secretly a marauding white supremacist .
Paul fired back , once again putting the issue firmly into context so that other establishment mouthpieces could not misuse portions of his comments to push the same talking point :
“ I think what you have done is bring up something that is really not an issue .
It ’s nothing I have ever spoken about or have any indication that I am interested in any legislation concerning .
So what you bring up is sort of a red herring or something you want to pit .
It is a political point , it is brought up as an attack weapon from the other side , and that ’s the way it ’ll be used .
But I think a lot of times these attacks fall back on themselves , and I do n’t think it ’ll have any effect because the thing is is that every fibre of my being does n’t believe in discrimination , does n’t believe that we should have that in our society , and to imply otherwise is just dishonest . ”

Following the Maddow show , MSNBC continued the attack through Joe “ I ’m a conservative – honest I am ” Scarborough , who outright stated that Rand Paul believed private businesses should operate policies of racial segregation :
While Scarborough upped the ante throughout the morning , Rand Paul simply reiterated his comments in an interview with conservative talk - show host Laura Ingraham .
Like feeding mogwai after midnight in the movie Gremlins , Maddow ’s hitpiece has spawned many more gremlin blogs taking pot shots at Rand Paul throughout the day .
We have seen these kind of attacks before on Congressman Ron Paul , Rand ’s father .
They are baseless and devoid of any truth whatsoever .
Plain and simple – they do not work because the American people see straight through them and recognise them as barrel scraping desperation on behalf of the establishment .
This is borne out by the fact that Ron Paul ’s Campaign For Liberty is stronger than ever and attracting more grass roots support with every passing day .
No matter to the establishment media , as they continue the relentless , ridiculous and infantile attempt to convince you that the grass roots backlash against incumbents is all based on indentured racism .
Prior to his emphatic victory , Rand Paul ’s desperate opponent for the GOP Senate nomination in Kentucky , Trey Grayson , ran ads that loosely questioned his sanity .
The ads depicted Dr. Paul ’s face encircled by Looney Tunes - like rings , as an announcer described “ Rand ’s world ” as “ wild , wacky and dangerous . ”
Such unrefined smear tactics demonstrate how out of touch with reality the establishment is in it ’s belief that the American voting public can be swayed by political propaganda and spin .
In reality voters find such activity repulsive and intelligence insulting .
Maddow should take a good long look at herself in light of what she has attempted to do , which is take one of the most upstanding , respectable and constitutionally sound politicians you will ever find and paint him up as some kind of crazy extreme racist .
If Maddow wants to continually take the moral high ground in such philosophical debates , she should really think about doing it somewhere other than MSNBC , which is 80 % owned by General Electric , owned and operated by General Dynamics , whose primary business comes from supplying arms and weapons systems to the US government and its international allies .
Judgements of character emanating from the belly of the global military industrial complex , particularly on issues of human equality and social harmony , sound resoundingly hollow .
Rand Paul does not fit into the establishment ’s treasured political control framework .
That is why he frightens them to death and why the attempted character assassinations will no doubt continue right up to the point Paul is elected into the Senate and then beyond .

Full transcript of Rand Paul ’s interview with Rachel Maddow
PAUL : Thank you , Rachel , and thank you for that wonderful intro piece , quite a collection .
MADDOW : I know this must feel like frying pan and into the fire here , so soon after the election with really being the focus of this national storm right now .
Everybody is trying to figure out what you meant by these things .
But let ’s talk about it .
PAUL : Yes .
MADDOW : Was “ The Courier - Journal ” right ?
Do you believe that private business people should be able to decide whether they want to serve black people or gays or any other minority group , as they said ?
PAUL : Well , I think to put things in perspective , when “ The Courier - Journal ” does not endorse a Republican , that ’s not something very unusual in our state .
They typically do n’t endorse Republicans , and it ’s a very Democratic paper .
But with regard to racism , I don`t believe in any racism .
I don`t think we should have any government racism , any institutional form of racism .
You know , one interesting historical tidbit , one of my favorite historical characters is William Lloyd Garrison .
And one of the interesting things about desegregation and putting people together , do you know when it happened in Boston ?
MADDOW : What do you mean , the desegregation ?
In general ?
PAUL : You know when we got — you know , when we got rid of the Jim Crow laws and when we got rid of segregation and a lot of the abhorrent practices in the South , do you know when we got rid of it in Boston ?
MADDOW : I — why do n’t you tell me what you`re getting at ?
PAUL : Well , it was in 1840 .
So I think it is sort of a stain on the history of America that 120 years to desegregate the South .
But William Lloyd Garrison was a champion and abolitionist who wrote about freeing the slaves back in the 1810s , ’ 20s and ’30s and labored in obscurity ( ph ) to do this .
He was flagged , put in jails .
He was with Frederick Douglass being thrown off trains .
But , you know , they desegregated transportation in Boston in 1840 , and I think that was an impressive and amazing thing .
But also points out the sadness that it took us 120 years to desegregate the South .
And a lot of that was institutional racism was absolutely wrong and something that I absolutely oppose .
MADDOW : In terms of legal remedies for persistent discrimination , though , if there was a private business , say , in Louisville , say , somewhere in your home state , that wanted to not serve black patrons and wanted to not serve gay patrons , or somebody else on the basis of their — on the basis of a characteristic that they decided they did n’t like as a private business owner — would you think they had a legal right to do so , to put up a “ blacks not served here ” sign ?
PAUL : Well , the interesting thing is , you know , you look back to the 1950s and 1960s at the problems we faced .
There were incredible problems .
You know , the problems had to do with mostly voting , they had to do with schools , they had to do with public housing .
And so , this is what the civil rights largely addressed , and all things that I largely agree with .
MADDOW : But what about private businesses ?
I mean , I hate to — I don`t want to be badgering you on this , but I do want an answer .
PAUL : I ’m not —
I ’m not —
MADDOW : Do you think that a private business has the right to say we do n’t serve black people ?
PAUL : Yes .
I ’m not in favor of any discrimination of any form .
I would never belong to any club that excluded anybody for race .
We still do have private clubs in America that can discriminate based on race .
But I think what ’s important about this debate is not written into any specific “ gotcha ” on this , but asking the question : what about freedom of speech ?
Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent ?
Should we limit racists from speaking ?
I do n’t want to be associated with those people , but I also do n’t want to limit their speech in any way in the sense that we tolerate boorish and uncivilized behavior because that ’s one of the things freedom requires is that we allow people to be boorish and uncivilized , but that does n’t mean we approve of it .
I think the problem with this debate is by getting muddled down into it , the implication is somehow that I would approve of any racism or discrimination , and I do n’t in any form or fashion .
MADDOW : But is n’t being in favor of civil rights but against the Civil Rights
Act a little like saying you ’re against high cholesterol but you ’re in favor of fried cheese ?
PAUL : But I ’m not against —
MADDOW : I mean , the Civil Rights
Act was the federal government stepping in to protect civil rights because they were n’t otherwise being protected .
It was n’t a hypothetical .
There were businesses that were saying black people cannot be served here and the federal government stepped in and said , no , you actually do n’t have that choice to make .
The federal government is coming in and saying you ca n’t make that choice as a business owner .
Which side of that debate would you put yourself on ?
PAUL : In the totality of it , I ’m in favor of the federal government being involved in civil rights and that ’s , you know , mostly what the Civil Rights Act was about .
And that was ending institutional racism .
MADDOW : When you —
PAUL : And I ’m in favor of — I ’m opposed to any form of governmental racism or discrimination or segregation , all of the things we fought in the South , in fact , like I say , I think it ’s a stain on our history that we went 120 years from when the North desegregated and when those battles were fought in the North .
And I like to think that , you know , even though I was a year old at the time , that I would have marched with Martin Luther King because I believed in what he was doing .
MADDOW : But if you were in the —
( CROSSTALK )
PAUL : But , you know , most of the things he was fighting — most of the things he —
MADDOW : I`m sorry to interrupt you .
Go on , sir .
PAUL : Most of the things he were fighting — most of the things that he was fighting were laws .
He was fighting Jim Crow laws .
He was fighting legalized and institutional racism .
And I ’d be right there with him .
MADDOW : But maybe voting against the Civil Rights
Act which was n’t just about governmental discrimination but public accommodations , the idea that people who provided services that were open to the public had to do so in a nondiscriminatory fashion .
Let me ask you a specific so we do n’t get into the esoteric hypotheticals here .
PAUL : Well , there ’s 10 — there ’s 10 different — there ’s 10 different titles , you know , to the Civil Rights Act , and nine out of 10 deal with public institutions .
And I ’m absolutely in favor of one deals with private institutions , and had I been around , I would have tried to modify that .
But you know , the other thing about legislation — and this is why it ’s a little hard to say exactly where you are sometimes , is that when you support nine out of 10 things in a good piece of legislation , do you vote for it or against it ?
And I think , sometimes , those are difficult situations .
What I was asked by “ The Courier - Journal ” and I stick by it is that I do defend and believe that the government should not be involved with institutional racism or discrimination or segregation in schools , busing , all those things .
But had I been there , there would have been some discussion over one of the titles of the civil rights .
And I think that ’s a valid point , and still a valid discussion , because the thing is , is if we want to harbor in on private businesses and their policies , then you have to have the discussion about : do you want to abridge the First Amendment as well .
Do you want to say that because people say abhorrent things — you know , we still have this .
We ’re having all this debate over hate speech and this and that .
Can you have a newspaper and say abhorrent things ?
Can you march in a parade and believe in abhorrent things , you know ?
So , I think it ’s an important debate but should be intellectual one .
It ’s really tough to have an intellectual debate in the political sense because what happens is it gets dumbed down .
It will get dumb down to three words and they ’ll try to run on this entire issue , and it ’s being brought up as a political issue .
I think if you listen to me , I think you should understand that — I think you do , I think you ’re an intelligent person .
I like being on your show .
But I think that what is the totality of what I ’m saying — am I a bad person ?
Do I believe in awful things ?
No .
I really think that discrimination and racism is a horrible thing .
And I do n’t want any form of it in our government , in our public sphere .
MADDOW : The reason that this is something that I ’m not letting go even though I now realize it would make the conversation more comfortable to move on to other things and I think this is going to be a focus for national attention on you , I guess until there ’s at least clarity on it , is that issue of the tenth , not the nine , but the tenth out of the 10 portions — proportions of the — the tenth of the Civil Rights
Act that you would want to have discussions about .
As I understand it , what you`re saying , that ’s the portion of the Civil Rights
Act that said you can’t actually have segregated lunch counters here at your private business .
I mean , when Bob Jones University in the year 2000 —
PAUL : Well , it ’s interesting .
Actually , it ’s even —
( CROSSTALK )
MADDOW : Hold on just one second .
Until the year 2000 , Bob Jones University , a private institution , had a ban on interracial dating at their school , their private institution .
If Bob Jones University wanted to bring that back now , would you support their right to do so ?
PAUL : Well , I think it ’s interesting because the debate involves more than just that , because the debate also involves a lot of court cases with regard to the commerce clause .
For example , right now , many states and many gun organizations are saying they have a right to carry a gun in a public restaurant because a public restaurant is not a private restaurant .
Therefore , they have a right to carry their gun in there and that the restaurant has no right to have rules to their restaurant .
So , you see how this could be turned on many liberal observers who want to excoriate me on this .
Then to be consistent , they ’d have to say , oh , well , yes , absolutely , you ’ve got your right to carry your gun anywhere because it ’s a public place .
So , you see , when you blur the distinction between public and private , there are problems .
When you blur the distinction between public and private ownership , there really is a problem .
A lot of this was settled a long time ago and is n’t being debated anymore .
MADDOW : But it could be brought up at any moment .
I mean , if there – – let ’s say there ’s a town right now and the owner of the town ’s swimming club says we ’re not going to allow black kids at our pool , and the owner of the bowling alley in town says , we ’re not actually going to allow black patrons , and the owner of the skating rink in town says , we ’re not going to allow black people to skate here .
And you may think that ’s abhorrent and you may think that ’s bad business .
But unless it ’s illegal , there ’s nothing to stop that — there ’s nothing under your world view to stop the country from re-segregating like we were before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 —
PAUL : Right .
MADDOW : — which you ’re saying you ’ve got some issues with .
PAUL : Well , the interesting thing is , is that there ’s nothing right now to prevent a lot of re-segregating .
We had a lot of it over the last 30 or 40 years .
What I would say is that we did some very important things in the ’60s that I ’m all in favor of and that was desegregating the schools , desegregating public transportation , use public roads and public monopolies , desegregating public water fountains .
MADDOW : How about desegregating lunch counters ?
Lunch counters .
Walgreen ’s lunch counters , were you in favor of that ?
Possibly ?
Because the government got involved ?
( CROSSTALK )
PAUL : Right .
Well , what it gets into is , is that then if you decide that restaurants are publicly owned and not privately owned , then do you say that you should have the right to bring your gun into a restaurant , even though the owner of the restaurant says , well , no , we do n’t want to have guns in here .
The bar says we do n’t want to have guns in here , because people might drink and start fighting and shoot each other .
Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant ?
Or does the government own his restaurant ?
These are important philosophical debates but not very practical discussion .
And I think we can make something out of this —
MADDOW : Well , it ’s pretty practical to people who were — had their life nearly beaten out of them trying to desegregate Walgreen ’s lunch counters despite these esoteric debates about gun ownership .
This is not a hypothetical , Dr. Paul .
PAUL : Yes , but I — yes .
Well , but I think what you`re doing , Rachel , is you ’re conflating the issue .
MADDOW : No .
PAUL : You ’re saying that somehow this abstract discussion of private property has any bit of condoning for violence .
This — there ’s nothing in what I ’m saying that condones any violence and any kind of violence like that deserves to be put — people like that deserve to be put in jail .
So nobody ’s condoning any of that .
MADDOW : Well , I understand that you ’re not condoning violence , but the people who were beating for trying to desegregate Woolworth`s lunch counters were n’t asking to be beaten .
They ’re asking —
PAUL : Those people should have gone —
( CROSSTALK )
MADDOW : — for private businesses to be desegregated by the government .
You ’re saying those people should have gone to different places ?
Left them segregated ?
PAUL : People who commit — people who commit violence on other individuals should go to prison and go to jail .
And there ’s nothing we should ever do to condone violence on other individuals .
MADDOW : And should Woolworth lunch counter should have been allowed to stay segregated ?
Sir , just yes or no .
PAUL : What I think would happen — what I ’m saying is , is that I do n’t believe in any discrimination .
I do n’t believe in any private property should discriminate either .
And I would n’t attend , would n’t support , would n’t go to .
But what you have to answer when you answer this point of view , which is an abstract , obscure conversation from 1964 that you want to bring up .
But if you want to answer , you have to say then that you decide the rules for all restaurants and then you decide that you want to allow them to carry weapons into restaurants .
MADDOW : I can — we could have a fight about the Second Amendment .
( CROSSTALK )
MADDOW : But I think wanting to allow private industry — private businesses —
PAUL : It ’s the same fight .
It ’s the same fight .
MADDOW : — to discriminate along the basis of race because of property rights is an extreme view and I think that ’s going to be the focus nationally on your candidacy now and you ’re going to have a lot more debates like this .
So , I hope you do n’t hold it against me for bringing it up .
I think this is going to be a continuing discussion for a long time , Dr. Paul .
PAUL : Well , I think what you ’ve done is you bring up something that really is not an issue , nothing I ’ve ever spoken about or have any indication that I`m interested in any legislation concerning .
So , what you bring up is sort of a red herring or something that you want to pit .
It ’s a political ploy .
I mean , it ’s brought up as an attack weapon from the other side , and that ’s the way it will be used .
But , you know , I think a lot of times these attacks fall back on themselves , and I do n’t think it will have any effect because the thing is , is that every fiber of my being does n’t believe in discrimination , does n’t believe that we should have that in our society .
And to imply otherwise is just dishonest .
MADDOW : Dr. Rand Paul , Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Kentucky , where he ’ll be representing not only his own views about how to live but what kind of laws we should have in America , sir , I enjoy talking with these things about you .
I could n’t disagree with you more about this issue , but I do respect you for coming on the show , and for being able to have this civil discussion about it .
Thank you .
PAUL : Thank you , Rachel .

Comment on this article
A few thoughts , that will probably get me lynched , on the immigration of Mexicans :
Immigration is not something Mexico did to the United States , but something the United States did to itself .
Decades ago it changed its laws to favor Latin immigrants , gives immigrant children born in the US citizenship , avidly employs the illegals , forbids police to check their papers , give them social services and schooling , establishes  sanctuary cities ,  and in general does everything but send them engraved invitations .
And then expresses surprise when they come .
We hear endlessly that Mexicans are taking the jobs of Americans .
Not quite .
Reflect that every time a Mexican gets a job , it is because a shiny white noisily patriotic American businessman gives him that job .
I could take you to whole restaurants in the metropolitan area of Washington , DC , where if I yelled ,  Migra ! ,  the entire staff would disappear out the back door .
The owners know perfectly well who they are hiring .
Mexicans are easily recognized .
They are brown and speak Spanish .
Businessmen do not hire them despite their being illegals , but because they are illegals , and therefore cheap .
I always find amusing the claims of love of country and civic responsibility that emanate from businessmen .
These frauds will , and do , send American jobs to China , to make a buck .
They will , and do , hire Indian programmers to replace more expensive American programmers .
They will , and do , sweat children in Indonesian factories to make a buck .
And they will hire illegals .
If they did n’t , there would be no illegals .
They come to work .
No work , no come .
A Brass Pole in Bangko ...
Reed , Fred Best Price : $ 3.94 Buy New $ 18.80 ( as of 01:20 EST - Details )
‘ Nuther topic : I suspect that not one American in twenty has even heard of the Mexican - American War , and maybe one in a couple of hundred can distinguish between the Treaty of Guadalupe - Hidalgo and , say , the Treaty of Westphalia .
Mexicans know that in that war the US simply grabbed half their country , to include little places like , you know , California .
The attitude of Americans , if they were told of this war , predictably would be ,  Oh .
Well , that was some other time , whenever .
Tell them to like , get over it .
But Mexicans are not over it .
Countless towns and cities have a Calle or Avenida Ninos Heroes commemorating the children who marched out , like the cadets of VMI in another example of Washington ’s aggression , to try to stop the oncoming federals .
Do n’t expect a lot of sympathy when Mexicans move back into what they regard as theirs in the first place .
Speaking of getting over it , the US will sooner or later will have to entertain the idea of getting over Latin immigration .
Allowing the immigration in the first place was a terrible idea , since diversity regularly proves disastrous , but now there is precious little to be done about it .
Nativist fantasies notwithstanding , the US is not going to round up thirteen ( give or take ) million people at gunpoint and force them across the border .
If it does n’t do this , few illegals will leave .
I encounter all manner of fury from conservatives at the idea of granting amnesty to the illegals .
Rounding them up is the very thing , they figure .
How do you round up thirteen million people who do n’t want to be rounded up ?
Perhaps at three a .m. you put a lightning cordon of Marines around a ten - block region and then go house to house , kicking in doors and dragging screaming people out .
These you would throw into sealed eighteen - wheelers , drive them to the nearest border , and perhaps literally kick them across .
Most of the children would be American citizens , but not Mexican .
The idea of deporting a couple of million US citizens to a foreign country is fascinating .

Note that large and growing numbers of Hispanics are American citizens .
(  Hispanics  are people who speak Spanish , which growing numbers of these folk do n’t , but never mind . )
In several states Latinos are a majority .
Their children rise through the schools toward voting age .
Politicians being politicians , legislatures in these states will find it difficult to deport a group when over half the voting population is of that group .
That leaves the feds , who do not seem energized by the matter .
Short of a Nazi - style war of extermination or forced depuration , America is going to have a very sizable population of Latino origin .
Adding to the complexity is that the country is far from united in wanting mass deportation .
As I understand it , some two - thirds of the US wants illegal immigration ended , which means sealing the border .
But this is a very different thing from massive expulsion of those already in the country .
Laws of the sort recently passed in Arizona may have some effect , but , again , most will remain .

While few will care , it is of perhaps minor interest that after ’ 48 ( the year of both Westphalia and Guadalupe - Hidalgo ) a large number of Mexicans , and thus their descendants , became American citizens .
These people have been Americans longer than , say , anyone whose ancestors arrived in the great immigrant waves around 1900 .
Now , a reasonable question might be , OK , Fred , what would you do ? 
If I had the power , I would seal the border to stop the influx , declare blanket amnesty for those already in the country , and get on with life .
Part of getting on would be to encourage assimilation since the last thing the US needs is another indigestible and permanent underclass .
Note ( as I have never seen noted ) that keeping them illegal forces them into something close to an underclass .
If Pablo wants to start a restaurant or auto - bodywork business , he can’t , because he will be asked for papers and eventually shut down .
The country seems to be trying to cause what it most does n’t want .
Some state or other wants to stop letting the children of illegals attend school .
Oh , good .
Let ’s create a population of angry illiterates who ca n’t possibly be assimilated .
What could be wiser ?
The underlying problem is that no solution , or attempted solution , has enough support to get put into effect .
Business wants the labor , politicians eye the vote , polls show young Americans as being much less worried about the whole question than their elders .
Conservatives — those , anyway , who are not profiting by immigration — talk of putting the military along the border , but support seems lacking .
On Fox News I see people urging the characteristic American solution : high - tech this and that .
Anyone with experience with dispersed guerrillas will see the prospects of success .
A lot of liberals think immigration is heart - warming and all .
As is so commonly the case in semi- democracies , whatever might work is politically impossible , and whatever is politically possible wo n’t work .
What now , gang ?
The Best of Fred Reed
Today there are many operating systems available .
Every vendor or community round it tries to make it as good as possible .
Having different goals , different legacy and different cultures , they succeed in it more or less .
We ( end users ) end up with big selection of operating systems , but for us the operating systems are usually compromise of the features that we would like to have .
So is there an operating system that would fit all the needs of the end user ?
Is is the BeOS clone Haiku ?
As you might have guessed , I will present my point of view on the topic of perfect operating system .
I will limit myself to desktop operating system as requirements of desktop operating system are in some aspect totally different than those of other types of operating systems .
First I will name few criteria for evaluating operating system .
Then I will look , which operating system that is currently available fulfills the criteria best .
At the end I will try to merge the operating system , and define the prefect one .
Let ’s start with criteria .
They are :
user experience ( GUI , ease of use , … ) ,
availability of software ,
availability of hardware ,
installation and updating of operating system / software ,
security ,
license .
What we have today
User experience
User experience is about how user interacts with operating system and programs running on them .
This is a “ soft ” science .
What one user likes , may other dislike .
I would define it as responsiveness , ease of use and attractiveness of design .
Responsiveness is how quickly program starts and how quickly responds to users ’ commands .
Ease of use is a logical structure of programs : would average users understand when they see the interface the first time or not ?
And the third , which I named attractiveness of design is how well does the functional organization of GUI elements come together and form a pleasant user interface .
As this is hard to explain , I ’ll name an example here : CDE offers an unpleasant user experience whereas new versions of operating systems and desktop environments provide more pleasant user experience ( Windows Vista , Windows 7 , OS X , KDE , … ) .
You might call it chrome , but this is what average users sees as operating system .
Although defining an operating system with best user experience might be arguable , I have a personal winner in this category : OS X .
It has one of the most worked - through user interfaces , which is ( pardon my nontechnical word ) just beautiful , and a joy to work with .
Availability of software
What is an operating system without software ?
A toy for programmers to tinker with and nobody else .
A perfect operating system must have a lot of software available ( open source and / or commercial ) .
The user must be able to run software for every need ( browsing web , writing memos , doing inventory in small firm or running financial payments software for a big firm ) .
In this category , there is a clear winner : MS Windows .
With market share at about 90 % , almost any type of ( commercial ) software that is made is made for MS Windows ( and much of it only for MS Windows ) .
Other operating system like Linux might have a lot of software available , but not as much as MS Windows .
Availability of hardware
Users must be able to run the operating system on any hardware they buy .
And they must be able to use their peripherals with that operating system .
There are two winners in this category : MS Windows and Linux .
Every ( end consumer ) piece of hardware gets drivers written for MS Windows – it must , as its market share is far too big to neglect it .
But the winner is also Linux : it also supports almost all hardware ( out of the box ) .
But Linux supports also other architectures , which are used for desktop computing ( such as ARM ) which MS Windows does not support .
Installation and updating of operating system / software
Adding , removing and most importantly updating the software is something that should be done in an easily understandable way .
All “ major ” operating system do it in a different way , but basically , it is a mater of taste .
I will not state a winner here because every approach has its benefits and drawbacks , but they all do basically a good job .
Security
Security comes from the design up and it must be incorporated into every aspect of the operating system .
This means well - written code , following security guidelines , code reviews , testing …
Although this category is not listed the first in line , it is a must .
A good ( desktop ) operating system must be secure .
Period .
Enough of words here : I think everybody would agree that in this category the winner is OpenBSD .
The development of the OpenBSD has clear goal : to make it a secure operating system , and they do it the right way .
License
Perfect operating system should not be controlled by one entity , and everyone should be able to see how it works and change it , if they want to .
So the only logical license is some sort of open source license .
Which open source license is better than other is beyond the scope of this writing .
Dividing between operating systems on this criteria is straightforward : Linux , all the BSDs , and other open source operating system win and MS Windows and OS X lose .
Creating a perfect operating system
You might expect , that I would add few points to every category discussed above , see which operating system got most points and pronounce it a winner .
But that ’s not the right way to do it .
We would make a compromise , what many of the operating systems are : we are not secure , but we have most of the software or we are not [ place a category here ] but we are [ place a category here ] .
This is a situation that we have today , and if you need an operating system now , you have no choice , but to make a compromise .
Let us imagine , we have a magic wand , which can merge different operating system together , how would it look like : it would be ( at least ) as secure as OpenBSD , it would run on all hardware that Linux runs , it would have all the software available that MS Windows has and its user interface would be at least that good as the one of OS X .
Of course it would be licensed under an open source license .
But as such magic wand does not exist , let ’s look how this could be achieved in a ( near ) future .
This is of course just one of theoretical alternatives .
Let ’s take an operating system , that was not mentioned yet : Haiku .
The Haiku operating system is designed to be binary compatible replacement for BeOS , which was designed from scratch , and was designed to be a desktop operating system .
Haiku builds on the same foundations .
This is its main advantage : it does not rely on any legacy architecture , as other operating systems do .
E.g. desktop operating system based on Unix have at least three layers : core operating system , X - Windows and DE ( e.g. KDE , GNOME , … ) .
A lot of the same functions in those layers duplicate , leaving system slower , harder to manage and less secure .
Haiku does not have this problems , as it was designed from ground up to be desktop operating system .
This is why I ’ve chosen Haiku – it has by my opinion the best architectural base of all other operating system .
There are also downsides to Haiku and they are not minor ones .
The major one is , that it is still in development phase and it is not suitable for everyday use .
Well , this might change in a ( near ) future .
But this is not about pro and contra about Haiku .
This is a theoretical writing how Haiku meets the criteria for the perfect operating system from the beginning of this writing .
User experience
Haiku ’s GUI was designed in the mid 90s .
And one can see its age .
It feels like mix of CDE and first version of KDE .
But this is a sensitive area , as avid OS fans are usually “ in love ” with how their operating system looks and behaves , and this might also be the case with the community behind Haiku .
Haiku needs some major GUI changes to be attractive to non-technical , non-BeOS - loving people .
It ’s true that Haiku ’s GUI provides some features that other operating systems do n’t , but those do not outweigh the outdated GUI design .
Question is :
Is the Haiku community willing to change the GUI and if the answer is yes : how much work is it willing to put in ?
Availability of software
There is software for some very basic needs available and there are also software repositories for Haiku and BeOS , and some commercial software that runs on BeOS ( and on Haiku ) .
But the current availability of software is far smaller than the availability of software for Windows or Linux .
Haiku might get “ instant software boost ” if it would possible to recompile Linux ’s software to run on Haiku ’s OS .
I ’ve noticed that QT is already in process of being ported .
But how much work remains to port all QT based applications to Haiku is another question .
Same goes for GTK , etc .
Speaking of GTK and QT – will they look like native applications on Haiku or will they look like they come from different operating system ?
Availability of hardware
Haiku currently supports only i386 architecture with limited set of hardware .
Port on the ARM architecture is on the way .
Most probably port to x86_64 architecture will be done in the future , and this is quite enough what a desktop operating system needs .
Support for the peripheral devices will be added or ported from other operating systems with licenses that allow it ( as was already done ) .
Installation and updating of operating system / software
Haiku currently supports some sort of manual installation of packaged software , but no automatic updates .
The Haiku community is currently working on this “ problem ” and I assume the automatic updates will follow soon .
Security
Haiku was build from scratch with no legacy .
This is a good starting point for well written code with good security record .
But as a wise man said : “ Assumption is the mother of all f*** ups ” .
I have n’t seen the code and I can not comment it .
It might be a spaghetti code , or it might be well - written , well - documented and well - tested code .
There are some security threads on Haiku ’s forums , but I could n’t form an opinion based on those .
I wonder what Theo de Raadt would say about Haiku ’s code .
License
Haiku is licensed under a MIT License , which is an open source license .
This fully matches the “ perfect operating system criteria ” .
Conclusion
I assume that in the future all the above mentioned criteria will be met by Haiku , except for two , which might or might not : security and GUI .
I can not foresee , if Haiku is / will be so strict about the security as OpenBSD is , and I do not know , how much of the Haiku ’s GUI is the Haiku community willing to change .
Amount of software will match the Linux ’s repository and not the one of Windows .
At the end , I would like to ask members of Haiku community to comment on my views , Theo de Raadt to comment on Haiku ’s code and all other readers to provide their views on the “ perfect desktop operating system ” .
Can a man who once refused the gift of a doormat — because , as he wrote , “ It ’s best to avoid the beginnings of evil ” — continue to inspire people in how to live simply ?
The answer is yes , but with stipulations , said scholar Lawrence Buell at a Harvard lecture last week ( March 25 ) .
Buell , Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature , explored the continuing significance of Henry David Thoreau ’s seminal “ Walden , ” the 1854 book that chronicles the author ’s two - and - a - half year experiment with simple living in the woods of Concord , Mass . , near Walden Pond .
The discussion was titled “ Does Thoreau Have a Future ?
Reimagining Voluntary Simplicity in the Twenty - First Century . ”
Buell referenced examples of literature on voluntary simplicity from the past , including Thoreau contemporary Lydia Maria Child , whose 1829 book “ The American Frugal Housewife ” promoted “ frugal efficiency as moral imperative . ”
The scholar also included examples of current authors who promote the simple life , including Duane Elgin and his work “ Voluntary Simplicity , ” and Colin Beavan , a New York City author who recounted his efforts to limit drastically his environmental impact in the book “ No Impact Man : The Adventures of a Guilty Liberal Who Attempts to Save the Planet , and the Discoveries He Makes About Himself and Our Way of Life in the Process . ”
But aspects of voluntary simplicity in a 21st century framework beg certain questions , said Buell , which can be explored with the help of Thoreau ’s work , as well as that of contemporary authors .
One challenge to voluntary simplicity ’s conventional wisdom , said the Harvard professor , is the notion that it ’s mainly a choice left to the privileged rather than the poor .
Recalling a sociologist ’s words , Buell said , “ Voluntary simplicity is a choice faced by a successful corporate lawyer , not a homeless person . ”
But Thoreau offers insights in this area , said Buell , noting that his writings in “ Walden ” are more often than not directed at those “ hard - pressed to make ends meet . ”
While Thoreau ’s work may have promoted individual action versus a united front , the message was inspiring , and continues to inspire , said Buell , despite the fears of those who argue that it will never amount to a critical mass of action .
As a counter to those who worry that voluntary simplicity is too individualistic , Buell offered the words of Beavan , who said that in the aftermath of his own simple - living experiment , “ he continues to challenge the people around him ” to make changes to save the planet .
Buell ’s talk at Harvard Divinity School was part of a lecture series titled “ Ecologies of Human Flourishing , ” co-sponsored by the Center for the Study of World Religions .
In his final remarks , Buell enlisted the help of theologian and physician Albert Schweitzer , whom he called “ a heroic example of voluntary simplicity ” who “ opted for a life of privation ” to serve others .
Buell surmised that if he could solicit Schweitzer ’s and Thoreau ’s opinions on the current importance of voluntary simplicity , they would likely agree that it “ is necessary as a precondition for human integrity and flourishing , even if not sufficient to preserve the world from ruin in the long run . ”
“ If that ’s right , ” said Buell , “ then humankind would be foolish to trust to voluntary simplicity alone , but equally foolish to disown it . ”
Diana
Eck gave the response to Buell ’s lecture and shared her own connections with Thoreau .
Eck , professor of comparative religion and Indian studies and director of Harvard ’s Pluralism Project , admitted to keeping a copy of the text , which she said came close to the status of scripture , next to her bed .
The work , said Eck , provides not so much a model for replication as a type of provocation or awakening with its nourishing passages “ that are wonderful to contemplate . ”
“ ‘ Walden ’ is an elegant and provocative work , and as long as we are attuned and willing to be provoked by that ornery ancestor … we will find that this kind of inspiration lives on , because it asks the kinds of questions we need to be asking . ”

The star of the BBC's Gardeners '
World has been drafted in by the Government as they try to persuade the public to stop using peat compost .
Ministers hope that Diarmuid Gavin will help them convince gardeners to stop using peat , which is present in almost half of all compost sold by garden centres .
Yesterday the Environment Secretary Hilary Benn announced a new target to phase out the use of peat compost in amateur gardens by 2020 but shied away from imposing a ban , provoking criticism from members of wildlife groups who said that ministers should have taken stronger action years ago .
In 1999 the Government aimed to eliminate peat from all but 10 per cent of compost by 2010 , but it is still present in 46 per cent of the compost sold in Britain .
Its extraction in the UK not only disturbs rare wildlife but also releases an estimated million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year .
Around 70 per cent of peat is used in horticulture , much by amateur gardeners who have long considered it the best way of encouraging plant growth .
It is rich in nutrients , being made up of partially decomposed plant material that has not decayed fully because of local conditions .
In northern Europe , peat is being extracted quicker than it is renewed on moors and bogs .
Some 38 per cent of peat sold here comes from the UK , with 56 per cent coming from Ireland and 6 per cent from the Baltic states .
Launching the campaign at Kew Gardens in west London yesterday , Mr Benn said : " Amateur gardeners are by far the biggest users of peat , using over 2 million cubic metres each year .
Our research shows us that gardeners often do n't realise the damage that peat extraction causes or that the compost they 're buying contains peat . "
The launch was backed by Mr Gavin , who said : " Using peat - free products in the home and garden is one of the simplest yet most effective ways that people can make a positive environmental impact and reduce their carbon footprint .
For most uses in the garden , for example , pots , growbags , hanging baskets , digging into or tidying up flowerbeds , peat - free alternatives are just as good as peat - based compost , and they do n't lead to the loss of our valuable peat bogs . "
The Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs will hold talks with retailers this summer about how they can meet their 2020 target .
But a spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds criticised Mr Benn 's plans , saying that they were not ambitious enough .
Dr Mark
Avery , the group 's director of conservation , said that peat would still be used in private gardens in 10 years ' time , and that the proposals would not affect commercial growers , who account for a third of peat use .
Representatives from the RSPB and other environmental organisations are due to meet Defra ministers tomorrow to discuss their concerns .
Dr Avery said : " The Government has missed the chance for an easy win in the fight against climate change .
Using peat in gardens releases a million tonnes of CO2 every year .
Removing it from composts and grow - bags would cut those emissions at a stroke and would be the same as taking about 350,000 cars off the road .
It would also help end the destruction of our precious peat bogs and the loss of birds , plants and insects that rely on them . "
Peat compost :
The alternatives
* Peat is not necessary to grow most plants .
A Which ?
survey this year found that alternative composts performed better than peat for growing potatoes and flowers in pots .
Bernie Cox West Ryde Already we are seeing increasing violence , congestion , housing shortages and mortgage stress in our big cities .
Migrants have been invited to add to our economy and most have become hard - working contributors to society .
Some diversity and multiculturalism is stimulating , but continuing population growth could have negative impacts on ethnic groups and our cultural integrity .
They could become victims of racial tensions .
We depend on science to justify the development of mining , agriculture and industry , and our '' carrying capacity ' ' should also be scientifically assessed .
Farmers know that overloading paddocks with livestock brings negative returns , and so it would be if our land was overloaded with people .
A population of 36 million by 2050 should not be based on a whim of Kevin Rudd , or ad hoc immigration , but on independent scientific studies and feasibility reports .
It is not only environmental capacity that should be assessed , but also our social and economic capacity to cope and benefit .
Our main source of population growth is from immigration .
Priority should be given to the welfare and future of existing citizens , not those overseas .
Vivienne OrtegaHeidelberg Heights ( Vic ) Having a minister for population is a start .
The next step is to recognise that population growth is stressing our environment and causing social problems , with little or no offsetting economic benefit .
The only responsible goal is stabilising our population and consumption at levels that can be sustainably supported .
Ian Lowe President , Australian Conservation Foundation , Marcoola ( Qld ) Larry Tofler ( Letters , April 5 ) asks how Australia will benefit from further increases in population .
I presume Tony Burke will be seeking to manage a planned increase in younger folk to redress the imbalance in the growing proportion of older folk like me .
David McKay Bathurst
Silly you , Larry Tofler .
Of course there are benefits : 100 more workers means 100 more taxpayers to provide the infrastructure and services costs brought on by the need to cope with the additional population , to manufacture the additional goods they will devour and to ensure the additional economic growth necessary to cope with and provide for the next 100 - and so on ad infinitum .
Richard Birrell Waitara
There will be disadvantages and challenges of a larger population , but these should be seen in terms of overall costs and benefits .
In 1947 Australia had a population of about 7 million ; today it is more than 22 million .
But our standard of living has risen considerably since then .
While acknowledging the disadvantages raised by Mr Tofler , I would rather live in Australia today , with a higher population and higher standard of living , than return to 1947 .

Schools guilty of letting students glory in failure
It is not only helicopter parents who refuse to let children fail ( Letters , April 5 ) .
The state school system has been integral in creating the paradigm that failure is negative and destroys self - esteem .
This has led to disastrous educational outcomes and behaviour problems .
In only the most extreme circumstances will a student be kept down a year for failing core subjects .
The students know they will progress through school even if they fail every subject .
Therefore , they do n't bother working or listening , or respecting teachers or fellow students who may want to work .
Instead school has become a social club , the classroom an opportunity to publicly glory in failure .
As a teacher this is the reality I face every day .
Students who have failed every year of secondary school arrive in year 11 thinking they can pass by doing nothing , though they are unable to construct a sentence or read more than a page in a novel without getting bored .
We need to return to keeping students down who fail , while increasing support for students with genuine learning difficulties .
Failure is a great motivator .
Rohan Wightman Parap ( NT ) Megan Cliff apparently feels her children wo n't be able to keep up with homework unless she helps them ( '' Learning from failure provides valuable lesson ' ' , April 3 - 4 ) .
As a single mother of two , I have never done an assignment for my children , now in year 10 and year 12 .
My assistance has progressed from the purchase of A3 coloured cardboard , glue sticks and coloured pencils to maintaining computer and internet access , and occasional proofreading .
The bias that comes with too much assistance is likely to inhibit the child 's ideas , producing an outcome that reflects neither the ability of the child nor their level of maturity .
There will undoubtedly come a time when parents are not competent to provide assistance , unless we are up to date with the curriculum to the level of HSC chemistry or extension maths .
When this time comes , surely it is better that our children can continue unassisted , rather than find themselves floundering at precisely the time they need to focus and achieve .
My children are much better off having learned how to approach their tasks independently .
They achieved more than they would have with my help - they are infinitely more creative and smarter than I ever was .

Not everyone needs to go to university
While there may be broad support in principle for equity in tertiary institutions , there are many serious issues simmering below the populist mantras being espoused by vice - chancellors eager to be the best boy in Julia Gillard 's class ( '' Cracking open the academy ' ' , April 3 - 4 ) .
First , not all students aspire to a tertiary education , nor should they , even those who may be judged the ' ' best and brightest ' ' .
We need a diverse workforce , including in trades and technical and paraprofessional occupations that do not require tertiary qualifications .
Second , the regional universities were established to cater to regional students , who often experience financial and social stress when moving to large cities to study .
What is the rationale for the Go8 universities to poach the best regional students ?
Third , the attrition rate of students from lower socio-economic background from universities is significantly higher than the average .
In smaller and regional universities it is higher still , up to 35 per cent in some centres .
One reason is the low ATARs under which these students are admitted to tertiary institutions .
Another is the lack of support once they are enrolled .
All students need to be encouraged to reach their potential .
Let 's not set up significant numbers of students for failure just to meet the latest political agenda .
We should be directing our attention to children from disadvantaged backgrounds , and ensuring that the origins of disadvantage are addressed at their source , rather than offering these young people five - point bonuses on the ATAR at the end of their education .
Dianna Kenny Professor of Psychology and Music , University of Sydney
We are told that the My School website introduces a stigma for schools and pupils .
The proposal by universities to give preference to disadvantaged students primarily on the basis of the schools they have attended also raises a stigma for the school , the teachers and the pupils .
The concept of disadvantage is subjective and many experience significant disadvantage that
is neither recognised nor acknowledged .
At least the assessment based on the HSC is objective , fair and open .
Michael Sobb Rydalmere Farmer at the helm will set you straight I am a simple farmer , unable to steer modern , large farming equipment to a desirable degree of accuracy .
Fortunately , for a small outlay ( about $ 20,000 ) , satellite technology is available that will guide the machine to an accuracy of two centimetres .
Turns and corners are easy .
The operator simply watches .
Most farms use it .
Why , then , might ships near the Barrier Reef , or anywhere else , need a pilot ( '' Shipping crackdown urged to protect reef from disaster ' ' , April 5 ) ?
Why not an accurate chart , autosteer and a couple of farmers to install it ?

Don't belittle abuse
The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin finds the Archbishop of Canterbury 's assessment of the devastating effect of the sex scandal on the Irish church '' unhelpful and undeserved ' ' ( '' Easter messages turn on Catholic Church 's crimes ' ' , April 5 ) .
No wonder the church 's response to victims of abuse has been to trivialise their experiences and attempt to silence them , while moving the perpetrators to new pastures and denying knowledge of their activities , to protect the ' ' good name ' ' of the church .
Jennie Morris Wollongong Stimulation makes economy weaker Richard Davey ( Letters , April 5 ) is correct that fiscal policy is not needed to stimulate an economy except in a Keynesian liquidity trap , conditions that did not exist in Australia .
Also , the form of the stimulus used here - extra government spending rather than tax cuts - has further bloated the command economy and increased monopolies , while weakening the market sector .
The inefficiencies in resource allocation this has caused will waste billions more dollars in the years to come .
None of our politicians seems to get this , but the economists in the Treasury should .
Peter Carroll Glebe Climate stupidity a lasting monument
It would be wonderful if commentators such as Chris Berg lived to see the consequences of their bone - headed thinking ( '' Face facts and adapt to a warmer world ' ' , April 5 ) .
His column should be placed in a time capsule and his descendants made to wear a copy around their necks for 500 years .
His assertion that man-made constructs ( such as economic growth ) will triumph over a ticked - off Mother Nature shows hubris at its worst .
Has he any idea of the forces that would be unleashed by a 2 - to 6 - degree rise in temperature ?
People alive in 300 years will be floored at our stupidity and ignorance of many things , one of the stand - outs being our frittering away of the precious time given to us to reduce carbon emissions .
I am indeed feeling glum .
I learnt of the dangers of global warming due to the burning of coal and oil at university 40 years ago .

Protectionists clearly have Kindle in their sights Louise Adler 's rant about the Kindle and like devices exemplifies the negative and protectionist attitude of so many book publishers ( '' Spirit of literature turns to Kindling ' ' , April 3 - 4 ) .
It was an attitude we saw in full force in last year 's debate over parallel import restrictions , in which Ms Adler was a keen advocate for their maintenance .
This we - know - what 's - best attitude towards readers has driven many of us online , where we can find books more readily and cheaply , arriving with less delay and now , in some cases , free of postage costs .
Ms Adler seems to attribute to the Kindle all manner of sins .
Apparently it will lead to self - publishing , bland internationalism , mass - market titles and more such horrors .
It may come as a surprise to her , but readers are quite capable of working out the uses and limits of an e-book reader .
She may be happy to travel with the added weight of several books in her luggage , but many of us are not .
An e-reader deals with that problem nicely , and with that of the other papers many of us carry .
Ms Adler fears we will be lost in some e-book wilderness when we discover that not all titles are available in that form .
I can't always buy certain foods fresh , but I have managed to work out that I can probably buy them in frozen or dried form .
We might be able to apply the same skills to book buying as we do to so many other purchases .
There may be concerns among authors about the impact of e-publishing .
The English author Lindsey Davis explains why she has resisted e-book versions of her Falco series , but in a way that does not condemn the e-book industry or reader .
I am looking forward to the arrival of my Kindle , just as I will continue to look forward to my next wander through one of my favourite bookshops .
I might even buy a book or two .

Farm animals not shown in true light
Is it not a little disingenuous to exhibit farm animals at the Easter Show as cuddly , young , fluffy and cute , when the show animals are as far from typically farmed animals as it is possible to be ?
The mother pig and piglets have space to suckle and play but in reality the vast majority of pigs are factory - farmed in inhumane conditions , often using sow stalls - oddly not shown at the show .
The Easter Show is intended to show children what farm animals look like , but does n't show the rest of the story .
We need to present the real story of where our food comes from so that we can make informed decisions to drive our shopping habits .
We should not hide the truth from children , nor deny it to ourselves .

As I enjoy the safety of this land ( and have done since the age of 13 in 1974 ) I trust the Australian justice system will track down and extradite Dragan Vasiljkovic ( ' ' A search for justice ' ' , April 3 - 4 ) .
How anyone who knows the story could hide this fugitive is beyond me .
Whatever happens to him , he will have the opportunity to defend himself , an opportunity denied men and women from my home town of Zvornik .
My memory of my birthplace , a town where Muslim , Orthodox and Catholic lived alongside one another without a bad word , has forever been erased .
May Vasiljkovic find justice .

Reduce the brakes
It is not only Paterson that has to suffer the infrastructure and environmental damage caused by RailCorp 's Martins Creek quarry trucking operations ( '' Community carries burden as RailCorp keeps on trucking , says mayor ' ' , April 5 ) .
The small towns of Bolwarra , Bolwarra Heights and Lorn are also suffering , yet Maitland City Council appears oblivious to the impact of these trucks .
A letter to the council requesting that a sign be erected asking truckies to reduce the use of compression brakes was met with silence .
I assume that since the trucks are not in councillors ' backyards at 5 am , it is not an issue .

Moya Ward ( Letters , April 5 ) is right about the Kindle .
I have ordered one and am waiting with bated breath until it arrives .
Many people are affronted by the cost of books and environmental destruction that occurs to produce hard copy .
The future will be electronic books .

No minister For goodness sake , David Tierney ( Letters , April 5 ) , why would you conjure up a Minister for Copulation ?
How long do you think it will be before the government takes that on board ?
And what of the junkets - when three - quarters of the cabinet gallop off overseas on a " fact - finding mission " ?
A bit more thought in future , please .

The parent company of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia is rapidly purging thousands of explicit pornographic images from its websites as it prepares to announce a new policy regarding sexually explicit content in response to reporting by FoxNews.com .
The move came as FoxNews.com was in the process of asking dozens of companies that have donated to Wikimedia Foundation -- the umbrella group behind Wikimedia Commons and its Wiki projects , including Wikipedia -- if they were aware of the extent of graphic and sexually explicit content on the sites .
Among the donors to Wikimedia Commons who were contacted by FoxNews.com were Google , Microsoft 's Bing , Yahoo ! , Open Society Institute , Ford Foundation , Best Buy , USA Networks and Craigslist Foundation .
These images were and in some cases still are easily accessible to anyone , including school children , many of whom receive unfiltered access to Wiki projects in schools across the country .
A child doing homework research on the educational website could easily stumble upon pornographic photos — including close - ups of genitalia and people having sex and masturbating .
There 's even a “ nude children ” category .
On Friday , Jimmy Wales , the president of the Wikimedia Foundation , acknowledged in a posting in the now defunct “ sexual content ” category :
“ We have had a problem with images being placed into inappropriate categories , so that viewers were exposed in unexpected ways to sexual content .
Image categorization should be done in such a way that readers are not exposed unexpectedly to content that may be offensive . "
Wales wrote elsewhere — in the newly defunct “ sexual content ” category — that he expected the foundation to announce a change in policy in the coming days .
“ I expect the board to issue a statement within a few days offering a general philosophical support for the serious enforcement of policy on this issue , " he wrote .
" The Board normally does not get involved with detailed content decisions ; I do n't expect that to change . "
Last week , FoxNews.com revealed that Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger had sent a letter to the FBI expressing his concerns that Wikimedia was distributing child pornography .
The FBI has not commented on whether it will pursue an investigation .
On Wednesday evening , Wales posted this note on Wikimedia Commons :
“ Wikimedia Commons admins [ administrators allowed to edit the site , including Wales himself ] who wish to remove from the project all images that are of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests have my full support .
This includes immediate deletion of all pornographic images .
We should keep educational images about sexuality -- mere nudity is not pornography -- but as with all our projects , editorial quality judgments must be made and will be made -- appropriately and in good taste ....
" I think our existing policies here on commons are sufficient to deal with the problem - with the minor exception that many things should just be speedy deleted and argued about later .
If you want to be technical about it , please consider this a policy change in that regard .
Try to relax .
Anything which is deleted can be resorted if there 's a good reason . ”
Immediately after , Wikimedia administrators started rapidly marking files for deletion , and the purging is going strong .
Images tagged for deletion — though some were still viewable Friday afternoon — include pictures of men , women and young girls involved in a range of sex acts with each other and , in some cases , with animals .
A collection by one user -- " Images of Stan Spanker " included at least 50 close - up photographs , many of which were too graphic to discuss .
Some involved the combined use of children ’s toys and / or household products and female genitalia .
The category was scrubbed from the site on May 6 .
The images had been online since January or earlier .
Numerous other categories have been entirely removed without a trace .
Categories of images taken from the sites of adult entertainment companies — and from their awards shows — have been marked for deletion .
Wales himself marked hundreds of images for deletion , all of which involved graphic images of sex acts .
Still , as of Friday afternoon , dozens of categories of explicit sexual images remained on Wikimedia with no indication that they had been marked for deletion .
UPDATE : Yahoo !

“ In Dec. 2008 , Yahoo !

The Mexican War between the United States and Mexico began with a Mexican attack on American troops along the southern border of Texas on Apr. 25 , 1846 .
Fighting ended when U.S. Gen. Winfield Scott occupied Mexico City on Sept. 14 , 1847 ; a few months later a peace treaty was signed ( Feb. 2 , 1848 ) at Guadalupe Hidalgo .
In addition to recognizing the U.S. annexation of Texas defeated Mexico ceded California and , New Mexico ( including all the present - day states of the Southwest ) to the United States .
BACKGROUND
As with all major events , historical interpretations concerning the causes of the Mexican War vary .
Simply stated , a dictatorial Centralist government in Mexico began the war because of the U.S. annexation ( 1845 ) of Texas , which Mexico continued to claim despite the establishment of the independent republic of Texas 10 years before .
Some historians have argued , however , that the United States provoked the war by annexing Texas and , more deliberately , by stationing an army at the mouth of the Rio Grande .
Another , related , interpretation maintains that the administration of U.S. President James K. Polk forced Mexico to war in order to seize California and the Southwest .
A minority believes the war arose simply out of Mexico 's failure to pay claims for losses sustained by U.S. citizens during the Mexican War of Independence .
Mexican Politics
At the time of the war , Mexico had a highly unstable government .
The federal constitution of 1824 had been abrogated in 1835 and replaced by a centralized dictatorship .
Two diametrically opposed factions had arisen : the Federalists , who supported a constitutional democracy ; and the Centralists , who supported an autocratic government under a monarch or dictator .
Various clashing parties of Centralists were in control of the government from 1835 to December 1844 .
During that time numerous rebellions and insurgencies occurred within Mexican territory , including the temporary disaffection of California and the Texas Revolution , which resulted in the independence ( 1836 ) of Texas .
In December 1844 a coalition of moderates and Federalists forced the dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna into exile and installed Jose Joaquin Herrera as acting president of Mexico .
The victory was a short - lived , uneasy one .
Although Santa Anna himself was in Cuba , other Centralists began planning the overthrow of Herrera , and the U.S. annexation of Texas in 1845 provided them with a jingoistic cause .
U.S. Policy The U.S. annexation of Texas , by a joint congressional resolution ( Feb. 27 - 28 , 1845 ) , had caused considerable political debate in the United States .
The desire of the Texas Republic to join the United States had been blocked for several years by antislavery forces , who feared that several new slave states would be created from the Texas territory .
The principal factor that led the administration of John Tyler to take action was British interest in independent Texas .
Indeed , anti-British feeling lay behind most of the expansionist policy statements of the United States in this period .
James Polk won the 1844 presidential election by advocating a belligerent stand against Britain on the Oregon Question .
Once in office he declared that " the people of this continent alone have the right to decide their own destiny . "
About the same time the term Manifest Destiny came into vogue to describe what was regarded as a God - given right to expand U.S. territory .
The term was applied particularly to the Oregon dispute , but it had relevance also to California , where American settlers warned of British intrigues to take control , and to Texas .
The Mexican Response and the Slidell Mission As early as August 1843 , Santa Anna 's government had informed the United States that it would " consider equivalent to a declaration of war . . . the passage of an act for the incorporation of Texas . "
The government of Herrera did not take this militant position .
It had already initiated steps , encouraged by the British , to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas , and although Santa Anna 's lame - duck minister in Washington broke diplomatic relations with the U.S. government immediately after annexation , in August 1845 the Herrera government indicated willingness to resume relations .
Not only was the Herrera government prepared to accept the loss of Texas , but it also hoped to lay to rest the claims question that had plagued U.S. - Mexican affairs since 1825 .
Britain and France had used force , or the threat of it , to induce the Mexican government to pay their claims on behalf of their citizens .
The United States , however , preferred to negotiate , and the negotiations had dragged on interminably .
Fearing that American patience was running short , Herrera seemed determined to settle the issue .
He requested that the United States send a minister plenipotentiary to Mexico , and President Polk appointed John Slidell .
Slidell 's authority , however , may have exceeded Herrera 's intentions .
Slidell was authorized to purchase California and New Mexico from Mexico and to settle the Texas boundary , which was a source of dispute even with the Mexican moderates .
While the Republic of Texas had claimed the Rio Grande as its boundary , the adjacent Mexican state of Tamaulipas claimed the area north of the Rio Grande to the Nueces River .
By the time Slidell arrived in Mexico in December 1845 , the Herrera government was under intense fire from the Centralists for its moderate foreign policies .
The Centralist strategy was to appeal to Mexican national pride as a means of ousting Herrera .
During August 1845 their leader , Mariano Parades y Arrillaga , began to demand an attack on the United States .
When Slidell arrived , Herrera , in an effort to save his government , refused to meet with him .
A few days later ( December 14 ) , Parades issued a revolutionary manifesto ; he entered Mexico City at the head of an army on Jan. 2 , 1846 .
Herrera fled , and Parades , who assumed the presidency on January 4 , ordered Slidell out of Mexico .
After the failure of the Slidell mission , Polk ordered Zachary Taylor to move his army to the mouth of the Rio Grande and to prepare to defend Texas from invasion .
Taylor did so , arriving at the Rio Grande on Mar. 28 , 1846 .
Abolitionists in the United States , who had opposed the annexation of Texas as a slave state , claimed that the move to the Rio Grande was a hostile and aggressive act by Polk to provoke a war with Mexico to add new slave territory to the United States .
Whatever Polk 's precise intentions were , for the Centralists in Mexico the annexation of Texas had been sufficient cause for war ; they saw no disputed boundary -- Mexico owned all of Texas .
Before Taylor had moved to the Rio Grande , Parades had begun mobilizing troops and had reiterated his intention of attacking .
On April 4 the new dictator of Mexico ordered the attack on Taylor .
When his commander at Matamoros delayed , Parades replaced him , issued a declaration of war ( April 23 ) , and reordered the attack .
NORTHERN MEXICAN CAMPAIGN On Apr. 25 , 1846 , Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande and ambushed a detachment of American dragoons commanded by Capt .
Seth B. Thornton .
Taylor 's report of this ambush reached President Polk on the evening of May 9 , a Saturday .
On Monday , May 11 , Polk presented his war message to Congress , and on Wednesday , May 13 , over the vigorous opposition of the abolitionists , the U.S. Congress voted to declare war on Mexico .
In the meantime two more Mexican attacks had been made across the Rio Grande at Palo Alto ( May 8 ) and Resaca de la Palma ( May 9 ) , and both had been repulsed .
Mexican Expectations Mexican leaders clearly expected to win these battles as well as to recover Texas and win the war .
Parades spoke grandly of occupying New Orleans and Mobile .
His army of about 32,000 men was four to six times the size of the original U.S. army .
Furthermore , Mexican troops were well armed , disciplined , and , above all , experienced in scores of revolutions .
Parades also counted on logistics .
The principal theater of war would be Texas , hundreds of miles from the populous areas of the United States .
Many Centralists believed that abolitionists ' objections to the war would demoralize the United States , and some Centralists believed a Mexican invasion would be supported by a massive slave uprising .
Thus , the quick defeats at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma surprised and shocked the Mexican leadership .
The U.S. victories against a larger , better trained force were attributed to the unexpected effectiveness of the American light artillery .
Parades found it expedient , however , to lay the blame on his commanding general , and he quickly replaced him .
The Mexican garrison evacuated Matamoros , moving to the south .
Taylor 's Delay Taylor occupied Matamoros on May 18 but then delayed for several months before moving south .
He was apparently waiting for transportation promised him by the U.S. government , though his critics branded him inept .
In July he moved his base up the Rio Grande to Camargo , but it was only in August that Taylor began planning the attack on Monterrey .
By that time American strength on the Rio Grande had swollen to nearly 20,000 troops , nearly all volunteers .
The principal military problem was logistical support of such a quickly expanded force .
The Americans were susceptible to subtropical diseases and found it difficult to maintain sanitary conditions in the camps .
Fevers , dysentery , and general debility were rampant , and the mortality rate from sickness was alarming .
A determined Mexican attack in July or August would have proven disastrous to the Americans .
Mexican Rebellion
The Mexicans did not attack because the Centralist government was collapsing .
Rather than uniting Mexico , the war had given the Federalist faction an opportunity to rebel .
Even while Taylor had been camped on the Nueces in the fall of 1845 , a few Federalist leaders had been in contact with him , promising supplies and asking for assistance in overthrowing Parades .
Northern Mexico was almost a Federalist stronghold , and as Taylor moved to the Rio Grande , he received increasing support from the rebels .
The defeats of the Centralist forces at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma precipitated open Federalist rebellions throughout Mexico .
Major outbreaks at Acapulco and Guadalajara in July were followed by the defection of the military garrison of Veracruz on August 3 and that of Mexico City on August 4 .
Mexico was in turmoil .
On July 28 , Parades turned the government over to his vice - president and went into hiding .
The Centralists ' government fell completely with the resignation of the vice - president on August 6 .
On August 22 the Federalists solemnly restored the constitution of 1824 , and Valentin Gomez Farias , who had been deposed as vice - president by the Centralists in 1834 , assumed temporary control of the government as the nation 's only legitimate official .
In the meantime , Santa Anna had returned to Mexico .
Having promised President Polk that he would work to effect a truce , he was allowed to pass through the U.S. naval blockade and land at Veracruz on August 16 .
Talk of a truce was forgotten .
Perhaps the only leader capable of uniting the nation , he soon received command of the Mexican army ; in December he was elected president by the Mexican Congress but did not formally assume office until the following March .
Monterrey and Buena Vista
In the meantime , Taylor began his advance on Monterrey .
He reached that fortified town , which had a garrison of more than 10,000 troops , on September 19 and began his attack on the morning of September 21 .
With about 2,000 men , Gen. William J. Worth captured the road between Monterrey and Saltillo and by noon was storming Federation Hill .
Six companies of Texas Rangers charged up the hill , seized the enemy artillery , and turned the cannon on retreating Mexican forces .
On the opposite side of the city a diversionary attack penetrated the town , despite much confusion .
On September 22 the Americans rested , but they resumed the attack the next day .
After bloody street - to - street fighting , the Mexican general Pedro de Ampudia requested and was granted a truce .
On September 25 he was permitted to withdraw his forces from the city , and an 8 - week armistice was agreed upon .
Total Mexican casualties were estimated at 367 .
The Americans had 368 wounded and 120 killed .
Taylor was criticized both by the military and by President Polk for agreeing to an armistice .
Taylor therefore informed Santa Anna , who had assumed command of the Mexican forces at San Luis Potosi , that the armistice would be terminated early .
On November 16 he occupied Saltillo .
His position was strengthened by an independent force under Gen. John E. Wood , which took Parras , to the west of Monterrey , on December 5 .
In January 1847 , Santa Anna moved north with about 20,000 men to dislodge Taylor .
Dispatches captured by the Mexicans had revealed that most of Taylor 's forces were being withdrawn to take part in Gen. Winfield Scott 's proposed landing at Veracruz .
Word of Santa Anna 's approach reached Taylor on February 21 , and although outnumbered almost three - to - one , he took up a position at the hacienda of Buena Vista , a few miles from Saltillo .
The Mexican attack began on February 22 , when troops led by Ampudia gained an advantage and forced the Americans to abandon important defensive positions .
The next morning the main Mexican force nearly overcame the U.S. defense .
However , a dramatic charge led by Col. Jefferson Davis about noon and a determined artillery advance under Capt .
Braxton Bragg finally saved the day for the Americans .
Their casualties numbered about 700 , but the Mexican losses were about 1,800 .
Santa Anna withdrew that night and moved south to intercept Scott 's invasionary force .
No further fighting occurred in northern Mexico , but Taylor remained in command of a small force there until he returned to the United States in November 1847 .
CENTRAL MEXICAN CAMPAIGN
The decisive campaign of the war was Scott 's advance from Veracruz to Mexico City .
Scott 's expedition began at a staging area at the mouth of the Rio Grande in February 1847 .
He assembled an army of approximately 12,000 , which was transported by sea to a beach about 5 km ( 3 mi ) south of Veracruz .
Landing on March 10 - 11 , it had surrounded the city by March 15 .
A combined naval and land attack began on March 22 .
Heavy shelling from navy guns forced the almost impregnable town to surrender on March 28 .
Cerro Gordo and Puebla Almost immediately Scott began the advance toward Mexico City .
Only sporadic resistance was encountered until his army reached the village of Cerro Gordo about 80 km ( 50 mi ) inland .
There , in a narrow defile , Santa Anna prepared to turn back the Americans .
The attack on Cerro Gordo was led by units under William J. Worth on April 18 .
The U.S. engineers , who included Robert E. Lee , George B. McClellan , Joseph E. Johnston , and P. G. T. Beauregard , found a trail that enabled the Americans to envelop and rout Santa Anna 's forces .
The Mexicans lost 1,000 men in casualties and another 3,000 as prisoners .
The Americans had 64 killed and 353 wounded .
Pursuit was impossible , but Worth moved up the road to occupy the venerable Perote Castle on April 22 .
Scott and the main army had entered Jalapa on April 19 .
There the advance stopped for a month .
Scott reported over 1,000 men bedridden in Veracruz and another 1,000 sick at Jalapa .
On May 14 - 15 , Worth and John A. Quitman moved into Puebla , about 80 km ( 50 mi ) closer to Mexico City .
They expected heavy resistance because of Santa Anna 's reported presence there .
However , the town 's leaders and the priests had decided to open Puebla to the Americans .
Santa Anna had only about 2,000 cavalry , which the Americans easily routed .
Another 1,000 Americans fell sick at Puebla , apparently from the local water supply .
By July 15 , with recent augmentations , Scott 's forces numbered about 14,000 .
However , over 3,000 were sick or convalescent , and the sickness rate showed no sign of decreasing .
Contreras , Churubusco , and Chapultepec During June and July , Santa Anna frantically prepared to defend Mexico City .
On August 7 , Scott began his advance from Puebla , following a route over lava beds and rough land to the south of Lake Chalco that Santa Anna had left relatively unprotected .
The first heavy fighting occurred on August 19 - 20 at Contreras , outside Mexico City , where Mexican losses were estimated at 700 and American casualties at 60 .
Santa Anna fell back about 8 km ( 5 mi ) to Churubusco , where he took up a defensive position in a fortified convent .
Advancing under extremely heavy fire on August 20 , Scott 's men finally forced the convent 's surrender , although Santa Anna and much of his command escaped .
Mexican losses were estimated at more than 4,000 killed and wounded and more than 2,500 prisoners ; by contrast , American losses were slightly more than 1,000 .
Scott might have moved promptly into the capital .
Instead he granted ( August 24 ) the armistice of Tacubaya to permit the negotiation of a peace treaty .
Santa Anna used the time to muster his forces and prepare a final defense of the city .
Fighting was renewed on September 7 - 8 at Molino del Rey , where the Americans forced the Mexican position but lost nearly 800 soldiers .
The Mexican losses totaled about 2,700 .
The final battle for Mexico City took place at the fortified hill of Chapultepec .
American artillery bombardment on September 12 was followed the next day by an infantry assault .
The citadel was heroically defended by cadets from the Mexican Military College , but they were forced to surrender before noon .
American troops entered Mexico City that afternoon , and shortly after midnight Santa Anna evacuated his troops .
The war was over .
In just over five months , Winfield Scott had done what many had considered impossible .
The duke of Wellington wrote , " His campaign was unsurpassed in military annals . "
On September 16 , Santa Anna resigned the Mexican presidency .
Forced to resign his command also ( October 7 ) , he fled the country .
The new acting president , Pedro Maria Anaya , began negotiations with the American peace commissioner Nicholas Trist ( 1800 - 74 ) in November .
Trist had just been recalled to Washington , but he decided to negotiate without credentials .
CAMPAIGNS IN THE AMERICAN WEST
While the crucial fighting was taking place in Mexico , various U.S. expeditions effected the conquest of Mexico 's territories in the American Southwest .
Kearny in New Mexico Immediately after the declaration of war , Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny , stationed at Fort Leavenworth , was ordered to occupy New Mexico and California .
With an army consisting largely of Missouri volunteers and numbering fewer than 2,000 ( though gloriously labeled the Army of the West ) , he moved down the Santa Fe Trail into New Mexico in July 1846 .
The Mexican governor was unable to rally any resistance , and Kearny entered Santa Fe unopposed on Aug. 18 , 1846 .
The conquest of New Mexico had , in fact , taken place through peaceful trade and commerce in the preceding years .
Kearny established a civil government with Charles Bent , a Santa Fe trader from Missouri , as governor .
He then divided his command into three groups : one , under Sterling Price , was to occupy New Mexico ; a second , under Alexander William Doniphan , was ordered to capture Chihuahua ; the third , under his own command , headed for California .
Price faced unrest and then rebellion in New Mexico in January 1847 .
Bent was murdered at his home in Taos .
Price fought three engagements with rebels , many of whom were Pueblo Indians , and by mid-February had the revolt under control .
Doniphan and the Missouri Volunteers struggled down the Rio Grande , suffering many privations along the route , to reach the vicinity of present El Paso , Tex. , late in December 1846 .
On Christmas Day at El Brazito they were attacked by a small detachment of Mexicans who were easily routed .
The Missourians rested at Paso del Norte ( present Ciudad Juarez ) until Feb. 8 , 1847 , when the march to Chihuahua City began .
On February 28 the Americans won a decisive victory at the crossing of the Sacramento River just outside Chihuahua .
Their casualties consisted of one killed and five wounded ; Mexican losses were about 300 dead and another 300 wounded .
In May , Doniphan took his command eastward to Saltillo to join Taylor 's forces .
Kearny set out for California on September 25 with only 300 dragoons .
At Socorro , N. Mex. , they met the famous guide Kit Carson , who was returning from California .
Learning that the conquest of California was virtually complete , Kearny sent 200 of his men back to Santa Fe and , led by Carson , continued to California .
Conquest of California
The American settlers in California had revolted against Mexican rule and established ( June 1846 ) the Bear Flag Republic , under John C. Fremont , before news of the war reached them .
On July 2 , U.S. Commodore John Drake Sloat landed at Monterey .
He proclaimed U.S. jurisdiction on July 7 and two days later occupied San Francisco .
However , California was by no means under U.S. control .
Mexican authority in California was divided between two rivals , Pio Pico in Los Angeles and Jose Castro in Monterey .
Following the American landing , Castro headed south , apparently to attempt reconciliation with Pico and resistance to the United States .
However , Commodore Robert Stockton , who replaced Sloat on July 23 , sailed down the coast and landed troops under Fremont at San Diego and others near Los Angeles .
Pico and Castro fled on August 10 .
Heavy - handed martial law administration precipitated a revolt in southern California in September .
Led by Jose Maria Flores , the rebels had expelled the Americans from Los Angeles and San Diego by the end of October .
On Dec. 6 , 1846 , Kearny , en route to San Diego , met the rebels in an indecisive action at the Battle of San Pascual .
Joining Stockton , who had arrived at San Diego , Kearny defeated a rebel band near Los Angeles on the San Gabriel River on Jan. 8 - 9 , 1847 .
On January 13 , Fremont received the final surrender of the rebels and signed the Treaty of Cahuenga .
At the end of the month another American expedition , " half naked and half fed , " reached San Diego .
The remnant of 500 Mormon volunteers under Phillip St. George Cooke , it had marched from Utah to Sante Fe and across scorching deserts in southern New Mexico and Arizona .
After a bitter dispute among Stockton , Fremont , and Kearny , the last established a provisional government in California .
With California secure , the U.S. Navy attempted the conquest of Mexican ports on the Pacific , capturing Mazatlan ( Nov. 11 , 1847 ) , Guaymas ( Nov. 17 , 1847 ) , and San Blas ( Jan. 12 , 1848 ) .
IMPACT OF THE WAR IN THE UNITED STATES Despite the objections of the abolitionists , the war received enthusiastic support in all sections of the United States and was fought almost entirely by volunteers .
The army swelled from just over 6,000 to over 115,000 .
Of this total approximately 1.5 percent were killed in the fighting , and nearly 10 percent died of disease ; another 12 percent were wounded or discharged because of disease or both .
For years afterward , Mexican War veterans continued to suffer from the debilitating diseases contracted during the campaigns .
The casualty rate was thus easily over 25 percent for the 17 months of the war ; the total casualties may have reached 35 - 40 percent if later injury - and disease - related deaths are added .
In this respect the war was the most disastrous in American military history .
During the war political quarrels arose regarding the disposition of conquered Mexico .
A strong " All - Mexico " movement urged annexation of the entire territory .
Abolitionists opposed that position and fought for the exclusion of slavery from any territory absorbed by the United States .
In 1847 the House of Representatives passed the Wilmot Proviso , stipulating that none of the territory acquired should be open to slavery .
The Senate avoided the issue , and a late attempt to add it to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was defeated .
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was the unsatisfactory result of Nicholas Trist 's unauthorized negotiations .
It was reluctantly approved by the U.S. Senate on Mar. 10 , 1848 , and ratified by the Mexican Congress on May 25 .
Mexico's cession of California and New Mexico and its recognition of U.S. sovereignty over all Texas north of the Rio Grande formalized the addition of 3.1 million sq km ( 1.2 million sq mi ) of territory to the United States .
In return the United States agreed to pay $ 15 million and assumed the claims of its citizens against Mexico .
A final territorial adjustment between Mexico and the United States was made by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 .

His show " Oral Roberts Presents " was a forum for healing the sick and dispossessed through God 's power , but God does n't work for free .
Roberts famously told his viewers in 1987 that God was going to " call him home " if he did n't raise $ 8 million from the poor dupes who believed what he said .
The death threat worked :
After climbing up into a " prayer tower " and going on a hunger strike — a " fast " — until he got his money , Roberts hit the $ 8 million mark .
He was worth every penny , though , because he had the rare ability to raise the dead .
When someone died in the crowd at one of his revivals , he told an audience once , " I had to stop and go back in the crowd and raise the dead person so I could go ahead with the service . "
Sadly , he could n't pull the trick off when his son Ronald committed suicide in 1981 after struggling with drug problems .
We 'd feel bad writing glibly about the death of the man 's son if not for the fact that hundreds of thousands of people who suffered similar tragedies sent Roberts more money than they could afford to based on his toxic and preposterous lies .
Other toxic and preposterous lies : A 900 - foot - tall Jesus appeared before him and commanded him to raise $ 120 million to build a hospital .
The devil tried to strangle him in his bedroom , only to be driven away by his wife .
Special holy water sprinkled on a billfold will bring prosperity .
God told him he would return from the dead to rule over the Earth .
In addition to a legacy of fraud and theft , Roberts left us Oral Roberts University , a Christian educational institute that served as a playground for his son Richard , who ran it , and his wife .
According to a 2007 lawsuit , Richard 's wife spent school money to remodel their home 11 times in 14 years , employ her " underaged male " friends , run up $ 800 cell phone bills , spend $ 39,000 a pop on clothes at Chico's , and fly their daughter to Orlando for spring break on a private jet .
The couple also allegedly forced professors and students to do their daughter 's homework .
Anyway , he 's dead .
UPDATE : Via Wonkette , the best way to remember Oral Roberts is to listen to his words : " The waste matter comes out of the body as poison , and he penetrates that part of the body in homosexuality .
It 's not to be put in the mouth of the man , or the mouth of the man or the woman … .
It is the male organ , penetrating the vagina of the woman , the male and the female . "
Gold closed at the end of 2009 at $ 1104.00 USD on the London Fix , while silver closed at $ 16.99 , platinum at $ 1466.00 and palladium at $ 402.00 .
Yesterday , gold closed at an all - time high of $ 1222.50 , while silver closed at $ 18.42 , platinum at $ 1689.00 and palladium at $ 521.00 .
While gold was up 10.7 % , silver was up 8.4 % , platinum was up 15.2 % and palladium was up 29.6 % .
Why do platinum and palladium continue to be overlooked as investment metals among the four precious metals with an international currency code ?
Palladium was the best - performing metal of the four in 2009 , and continues to be this year .
Platinum outperformed gold in 2009 and continues to outperform gold this year .
Previously , I wrote why platinum is the overlooked investment metal and currency .
National ISP
Exetel today outlined projected pricing on its National Broadband Network plans in Tasmania that was radically different from that offered on traditional ADSL broadband plans — such as a zero cost monthly plan at 25 M bps , with downloads charged at $ 1 per gigabyte .
“ Subject to signing contracts , we would expect to offer 25 M bps circuits for $ 0.00 monthly access and $ 1.00 per GB downloaded on a 12 month contract , ” the ISP ’s chief executive John Linton said in an emailed statement .
“ 50 Mbps and 100 M bps services have yet to be priced but are expected to be $ 15.00 / $ 25.00 per month plus $ 1.00 per GB downloaded .
However , Linton said as the NBN was the broadband market “ starting again ” , Exetel would not be interested in providing services to “ heavy downloaders ” — noting those users were subsidised by the broadband prices paid for the “ over 60 percent of the market ” that were characterised as “ low usage ” downloaders .
The ISP in late March pledged to join Internode , iiNet and Primus in seeking accreditation to resell fibre broadband services provided by the Tasmanian division of NBN Co in early stage rollout communities of Smithton , Scottsdale and Midway Point .
But it has taken quite a while for Exetel to negotiate contracts with NBN Tasmania to provide services to the areas .
Linton said Exetel would n’t announce final pricing until the NBN Tasmania contracts were executed — “ hopefully by the end of this week ” .
The Exetel pricing is dramatically different from projected Tasmanian NBN pricing outlined by iiNet in mid-March , when the company said its NBN pricing would not be materially different from fibre prices in greenfield estates like the Alamanda Estate in Point Cook in Victoria .
iiNet ’s cheapest current fibre plan goes for $ 49.95 per month , for 5 Gb of on - peak and 5GB of off - peak data at download speeds of 25 M bps .
Under Exetel ’s projected prices revealed today , that same speed and download limit would go for $ 10 .
However , when you get to the high end , the situation changes quite a bit .
For example , for the full 100 M bps fibre speeds , iiNet is currently charging at least $ 129.95 for a combined 120 GB of data — 60 GB on - peak and 60 Gb off - peak .
For the same download limit under the projected NBN plans , Exetel would charge $ 25 monthly access fee plus $ 120 for the data — for a total of $ 145 .
Linton today said there were some cost challenges in Tasmania because of the need to pay for Bass Strait backhaul data haulage back to the mainlaind — which he said was “ for us , very expensive ( even at one third of the old pricing ) ” .
Competition for data transit across Bass Strait has recently been introduced through the Basslink cable .
“ Because of the Bass Strait backhaul , IP ( internet protocol ) is effectively five times more expensive than it is in Victoria / other mainland states – which constrains what can be done in the short term in Tasmania ( at least by us ) , ” said Linton .
However , he noted the NBN , if it was rolled out quickly , provided a chance for companies of Exetel ’s size ( smaller than providers such as iiNet , Telstra , Optus , TPG , Primus or Internode ) , to offer faster broadband in Tasmania at a much more affordable pricing than it could otherwise do .
Point Cook and customer service
Separately , in a letter to customers this morning , Exetel noted it also expected to shortly execute contracts with Telstra to supply fibre services to Point Cook residents and had recently completed upgrades to its network in NSW and Queensland , with Melbourne upgrades to be finished by May 4 and the ACT , SA and WA to receive the same by May 12 .
Exetel has almost doubled the bandwidth it deploys to provide residential customer services over the past twelve months , ” the letter said .
“ Once we complete the current ‘ round ’ of upgrades we will begin again . ”
“ Over the coming year we will build a ‘ second ’ network to make the current network , which is already totally redundant even more resilient with a third level of back up to the second level of back up that is already in place .
We will also move away from the current topology of 1 gigabit links by replacing all of the current routers and switches with 10 gigabit hardware and ingress / egress circuits . ”
The ISP has also recently released a new round of ‘ unlimited ’ ADSL broadband plans , and in its newsletter went some way to outlining the performance of its Sri Lankan division , saying all calls to the division were answered within an average of less than 60 seconds .
“ Obviously we do n’t know for certain but it is unlikely that ANY other ISP in Australia has ever achieved this speed and consistency of response , ” said the newsletter .
“ Of course there are times when there are ‘ peaks ’ but these seldom cause a call wait time to exceed 3 minutes . ”
“ The second goal is to resolve all non-carrier related issues on the first telephone call .
This is an even tougher objective and is dependent on a much higher level of knowledge of all aspects of ADSL services in Australia than is currently possible to provide . ”
In addition , the company said it has executed contracts for all of the endangered species projects it will support as a company this year — it will pay out almost $ 550,000 in donations .

Syrian President Bashar Assad said Monday that he is willing to sign a peace agreement with Israel in exchange for the Golan Heights .
In an interview with the Italian daily newspaper , Assad added that he did not think it necessary to break Syria 's strong ties with Iran in order to make peace with Israel .
The Syrian president maintained in the interview that the US has lost its influence in the Middle East and should not be depended on to bring peace to the region .
Assad differentiated between US President Barack Obama , who he said brought hope to the Middle East , and the US itself .
He claimed that Obama has good intentions , but is powerless to affect real change in the region because of the Congress and lobbies involved in decision making .
Assad denied Israeli claims that Syria supplied Hizbullah with Scud missiles .
He maintains that these allegations are an Israeli diversion meant to avoid a peace settlement .
Yesterday we were lucky enough to get a mixtape from Just Jack , full of Disco hits , but today we are provided with The History of Drum & Bass courtesy of Jaguar Skills .
If you are not familiar with who he is then do n’t be too surprised , his identity has been a closely guarded secret .
Although he currently plies his trade as a DJ , in the past he has worked as a journalist interviewing the likes of the Notorious B.I.G. , Eminem & Tupac , and in a PR role for a record label which was home to acts such as Run DMC and Afrika Bambaataa .
Anyway this Drum & Bass mixtape is quality , and to top it all off it ’s hosted by the legendary MC Skibadee .
What more could you ask for ?
Jaguar Skills Presents The History Of Drum & Bass
As a follow - up to my first post highlighting the “ bad and ugly ” anti-feminist responses I received to my Craigslist ad for feminist dating partners , I promised to feature some of the good .
So here ’s one of the first replies I received :
Thank you so much for actually being a feminist because most girls I know these days seem to be reactionary when it comes to the subject .
Adorable .
After chatting on Skype and finding that we had similar interests in music , we met for coffee .
While we did n’t talk specifically about feminist issues , we had great conversation on other subjects , like music .
Unfortunately , this guy is practically a twin to an ex-boyfriend and , thus far , I have n’t been able to shake the feeling that I ’ve dated him before .
Another response :
If I had to subscribe to any political ideology I would say I am a Socialist Democrat , though in terms of ideology I am closer to a Fourierist [ Charles Fourier was said to have invented the word feminism in 1837 ] …. I am pro-feminism .
Mmm–Socialist Democrat ?
Yes , please .
After a video chat , we met at a bar for a pint and a vegan sausage .
While he admitted that he did n’t know that much about feminism , he was definitely open to learning more .
He let me go into detail about the article I had been fact - checking for the Spring issue of Ms. about George Tiller ’s murderer Scott Roeder and seemed interested .
( On newsstands May 23 ! )
While I was charmed by our conversation , he emailed the next day saying he was n’t ready for romance yet , as he is still recovering from his last relationship .
Boo .
Here are a few of the responses from those I have yet to meet :
[ I am a ] fellow admirer of socially responsible journalism ( I was raised by newspaper editors …my favorite television show as a small child was ‘ the news . ’) … I know the difference between they ’re , their and there , I also know the difference between your and you ’re .
In fact , I ’d go so far as to say I ’m the best contraction - user I know .
Bold statement , I ’m sure …
This suitor kept me laughing throughout his hilarious 500 - word response , which included the “ 5 worst things and 5 greatest things ” about him .
After conversing through e-mail , we decided to meet up , but unfortunately , he had a serious family crisis .
This one sounded earnest :
Maybe it ’s because I was raised by women and a single mom but I ’ve always been instilled with an open - minded and liberal perspective . …
I had the pleasure of being taught by some wonderful professors who introduced me to a lot of the inequality we continue to face in our society .
So yeah , I ’m pro-choice too .
As did this one :
As for feminism–ostensibly it means equal rights for women , which sounds simple but it means examining what all human rights are as a whole , the deficit in which it exists for women , and then by default the areas of empowerment that can be improved upon to achieve equal rights .
…
Many men feel threatened because they do n’t understand what feminism is , and can confuse this with their own questions about what it means to be masculine .
The shooting from the hip conclusion of many men is that more equal rights for women somehow means less rights for them–as if it were a zero - sum game .
An unfortunate conclusion .
Too bad this guy was 36 ; a little too old for my taste ( I ’m 22 ) .
This experiment proved to me that :
Yes , there are men out there who are happy to find out that you are a feminist , and that finding them on the Internet may be one way of weeding out the anti-feminists / idiots before the first date .
I got the feeling that of the two I met face to face , both were pro-feminist and were n’t just saying that to get a date .
Obviously , more research would need to be done to confirm this .

But the biggest reason I see people wanting to quit is drug testing .
With Herbal Smoking there 's no worries about drug testing or illegal activities .

The cast from the view is on six months probation .
The United States Census periodically issues reports on a category of workers it labels " extreme commuters " , which brings to mind images of eccentric Americans paragliding to the office , but which really means , less thrillingly , that they spend three hours or more travelling between work and home .
( Presumably there are a few who paraglide to the office , though ; one imagines they live on the west coast , work at Google and use the word " dude " a lot . )
Extreme commuting is on the rise , and not just in the US : one survey last year found 10 % of Britons spending two or more hours a day on the road .
This is one of commuting 's vicious ironies : if you live somewhere big and spread - out , it 'll take you ages to get to work ; but if you live somewhere small and crowded , it 'll take you ages , too , albeit for different reasons .
Another irony : people commute reluctantly , when they have no choice , because they can't afford to live closer to work – yet if they get rich , they 're liable to do it to an even greater degree , presumably because they think living in the countryside , or quasi - countryside , will make them happier .
The former kind of commuter wo n't be remotely surprised to learn that it often does n't : numerous studies have shown commuting to be among the most misery - inducing of daily activities , highly correlated with stress and social isolation , often far outweighing the benefits .
The Swiss economists Alois Stutzer and Bruno Frey call this the " commuter 's paradox " , though really it 's a cognitive mistake : people chronically underestimate the downsides of a long commute , while overestimating the upsides of ( say ) a bigger house .
The average one - hour - each - way commuter , they concluded , would need 40 % more pay to declare him or herself as " satisfied " as a non-commuter .
As the neuroscience writer Jonah Lehrer notes , that 's partly because commuting , especially in car traffic , is unpredictable , so we never get used to it .
The brain 's capacity for adapting to the predictable usually seems like a disadvantage : it explains the " hedonic treadmill " , whereby the thrill of a new car , or some other longed - for benefit , soon fades .
But it also means that if you must have aggravations , it 's best if they 're as regular as clockwork .
We imagine a long commute will be a slightly tiresome ritual .
Instead , it 's a fresh challenge every day .
Non-commuters need n't feel smug , though , because freely chosen long commutes are surely an example of a thinking error we all make .
You might call it the " best of both worlds " fallacy : faced with opposing choices , we struggle to combine the benefits of each , yet ignore the costs – in time , money and energy – of doing the combining .
Commuters do this , but so does your annoying friend who tries to pack three social events into a single evening , spending almost no time at each , and leaving everyone involved mildly irritated .
Even the serene - sounding notion of a " balanced life " , which we 're always being exhorted to attain , often seems to compound the problem : if the very act of balancing work , family , friends , hobbies , relaxation and travel wears you out , perhaps an unbalanced life is n't such a bad idea after all .
Of course , there are those who seem to relish commuting – to appreciate the quiet isolation of the car or the iPod buds , or the sense of transition between work and non-work .
But there are people who like death metal , too , and Cherry Coke .
It 's an odd world .

Not long after I launched this blog , I wrote about the damage wrought by the Eleonore Exploit Kit , an increasingly prevalent commercial hacking tool that makes it easy for criminals to booby - trap Web sites with malicious software .
That post generated tremendous public interest because it offered a peek at the statistics page that normally only the criminals operating these kits get to see .
I ’m revisiting this topic again because I managed to have a look at another live Eleonore exploit pack panel , and the data seem to reinforce a previous observation :
Today ’s attackers care less about the browser you use and more about whether your third - party browser add - ons and plugins are out - of - date and exploitable .
Hacked and malicious sites retrofitted with kits like Eleonore have become more common of late :
In a report issued this week , Web security firm Zscaler found that roughly 5 percent of the browser exploits they identified during the first quarter of this year were tied to hacked or malicious sites that criminals had outfitted with some version of Eleonore .
Like most exploit kits , Eleonore is designed to invisibly probe the visitor ’s browser for known security vulnerabilities , and then use the first one found as a vehicle to silently install malicious software .
The hacker ’s end of the kit is a Web - based interface that features detailed stats on the percentage of visitors to the booby - trapped site (s ) that are successfully attacked , and which software vulnerabilities were most successful in leading to the installation of the hacker ’s malware .
This particular Eleonore kit — which is currently stitched into several live adult Web sites — comes with at least a half - dozen browser exploits , including three that target Internet Explorer flaws , two that attack Java bugs , and one that targets a range of Adobe PDF Reader vulnerabilities .
According to this kit ’s stats page , the malicious adult sites manage to infect roughly every one in ten visitors .
As we can see from the landing page pictured above , Windows XP users represent by far the largest group of users hitting these poisoned porn sites .
Once again , Eleonore shows just how heavily Java flaws are now being used to infect computers ( the above graphic shows the number of successful malware installations or “ loads ” per exploit ) .
The last time I reviewed a working Eleonore admin panel , we saw that Java flaws were the second most reliable exploits .
This time around , Java was the biggest source infections .
In the Eleonore kit I wrote about earlier this year , some 34 percent of the systems that were successfully exploited were attacked via a Java flaw .
In this installation , four out of every ten victims who were hacked were compromised because of they were running an outdated version of Java .
Nearly one - third of all successful attacks from this Eleonore kit leveraged flaws in older versions of Adobe ’s PDF Reader .
People often scoff when I recommend an alternative to Adobe for displaying PDFs , saying that criminals can just as easily target security vulnerabilities in those applications , which ship far fewer security updates than Adobe .
That may be true , but I have n’t seen much evidence that hackers are going after flaws in non-Adobe PDF readers at any appreciable or comparable level .
Incidentally , if you use the free PDF reader from Foxit , an Adobe alternative I ’ve often recommended , you should know that Foxit recently shipped a new version — v. 3.31 — that includes security improvements .
I also found this time around similar percentages of exploit victims among those surfing with different versions of Internet Explorer .
With this Eleonore kit , more than one - third of those who visited the exploit site with IE6 were loaded with malicious software .
The Eleonore admin panel reported that more than 12 percent of IE7 users and 20 percent of IE8 surfers visited and subsequently were infected with malware .
The prevalence of IE users among the victims may be due in part to the fact that half of the exploits used by this particular kit target IE security holes .
Annoyingly , this Eleonore admin page does n’t resolve one of the open questions I heard most frequently after my last story on Eleonore :
Where are all the Firefox victims ?
I still do n’t have a decent answer to that puzzle , but I do have a couple of guesses .
For one thing , unlike the last Eleonore kit I examined , this one does not include an exploit specifically for Firefox .
It ’s also possible that these kits are detecting Firefox visitors as users of some other browser ( the report indicates , for example , that 15 percent of Google Chrome users browsing with version 4.1 were successfully attacked ) .
Whatever the reason , it seems highly unlikely that all of the nearly 5,600 Firefox users who visited the exploit sites detailed here escaped unscathed .
Anyway , below are the stats , which start with those of Chrome and Firefox visitors :
… more Firefox stats and then IE , Opera and Safari …

Downtown restaurant owners are upset they 'll have to shut down their patios for two weeks before the G20 summit begins on June 26 .
" It 's not affecting us for two days of the summer , it 's affecting us for the entire month , " said David Bagley , owner of Cora 's Restaurant on Blue Jays Way .
The restaurant is just a few hundred metres from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre , where leaders of the world 's 20 largest economies will gather this summer .
" With good weather , which June usually is , weekdays you 're probably looking at $ 2,000 a day .
On the weekends , especially on the weekend of the summit , it 'll add up to … close to $ 20,000 , " he said .
A meeting last week did n't inform businesses about the patio restriction .
Coun .
Adam Vaughan ( Ward 20 , Trinity - Spadina ) said shotgun weddings have been planned better than the G20 summit .
" When it comes to getting the details as to how businesses , residents and local parks and even things as simple as restaurant patios will be affected , every day it 's a different idea , " he said .
Vaughan thought the rationale might be that violent protesters could use the patio furniture to damage other property .
Restaurants and other businesses will only find out if they are in the higher - level inner security zone two weeks before the event -- something that could bring even more security restrictions , he said .
Meanwhile , some people between Toronto and Huntsville , site of the June 25 - 26 G8 summit in cottage country , got to see and hear military aircraft buzzing overhead .
CF - 18 Hornet fighter jets , CH - 124 Sea King and CH - 146 Griffon helicopters took part in NORAD 's air security exercise , flying as low as 600 metres .
More flights are scheduled for Friday .
Protest zone
Meanwhile , G20 protesters will not be confined to a downtown Toronto park , police have decided .
The Integrated Security Unit overlooking security - related issues for the high - profile summit says a decision was made to find a location other than Trinity - Bellwoods Park .
They made the decision after receiving complaints from residents living around the Queen West community .
The ISU is comprised of several police services , including the RCMP , OPP , Peel and Toronto Police Services as well as the Canadian Forces .
Spokesperson Meghan Gray told CTV
News that the new location for the so - called " protest zone " has n't been finalized , but the criteria is the same .
" Our primary concern is to use a location that is close enough to the downtown area that respects the entire idea of a designated speech area while at the same time , is a distance that protects the integrity of our security planning , " Gray said .
Trinity - Bellwoods residents were worried about the types of protests that might occur in the protest zone , along with environmental issues , she said .
There are n't many areas in downtown Toronto that offer a large empty space that does n't butt up against residential housing .
Nathan Phillips Square or Yonge - Dundas Square are outside the security perimeter , Gray said .
She considered the CNE grounds to be considered part of " downtown . "
A Toronto FC soccer game will be played there on June 26 .

August 23 , 2010 — jao
I just came back from the Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop at Montréal , hosted by Marc Feeley and an excellent organisation team .
It ’s been a fun couple of days putting faces to emails and IRC nicks and attending a handful of pretty interesting talks .
Here ’s a quick report .
My favourites were the two invited papers .
The first day , Olin Shivers presented a pretty cool hack in a delicious talk consisting in actually writing the code he was explaining .
Under the title Eager parsing and user interaction with call / cc , he showed us how call / cc is not just an academic toy , but can be put to good use in writing a self - correcting reader for s-expressions on top of the host scheme read ( or any other parser , for that matter ) .
He started from the very basics , explaining how input handling and buffering is usually delegated to the terminal driver , which offers a rather dumb , line - oriented service .
Would n’t it be nice if , as soon as you typed an invalid character ( say , a misplaced close paren ) the reader complained , before waiting for the whole line to be submitted to read ?
Well , all we need to do is to implement the input driver in scheme , and he proceeded to show us how .
As you know , reading s-expressions is a recursive task , meaning that when you detect invalid input in the middle of a partial s-expression , or want to delete a character , you might find yourself somewhere deep inside a stack of recursive calls and you ’ll need to backtrack to a previous checkpoint .
That ’s an almost canonical use case for call / cc , provided you use it intelligently .
Let me tell you that Olin is quite capable of using call / cc as it ’s meant to be used , as he immediately demonstrated .
I ’m skipping the details in the hope that a paper will be available any time soon .
As i mentioned , his talk was a beautiful example of live coding : he showed us the skeleton of the implementation and filled it up as he explained how it should work .
Olin does know how to write good code , and it was a pleasure ( and a lesson ) seeing him doing just that .
It was all so schemish : a terminal and emacs in the venerable twm : that ’s all you need to create beauty .
The second invited talk was by Robby Findler , who gave us a tour of Racket ’s contract system , how to use it and the subtleties of implementing it properly .
The basic idea dates back to Meyer ’s design by contract methodology of the early nineties , and was subsequently explored further by several authors , including Robby .
Simple as they sound at first sight , good contracts are not trivial to implement .
For instance , it ’s vital to assign blame where ’s blame is due , and Robby gave examples of how tricky that can get ( and how Racket ’s contracts do the right thing ) .
Another subtlety arises when you try to write contracts assessing a property of an input data structure ( say , you want to ensure that an argument is actually a binary search tree ) .
The problem here is that checking the contract can alter the asymptotic complexity of the wrapped function ( e.g. , you can go from O ( log n ) to O ( n ) in a lookup , an exponential degradation ) .
Racket provides an ingenious fix for that problem , by means of lazy contracts that are checked as the input is traversed by the “ real ” function .
There was also real - time scheme in Robby ’s talk , although in a much more sophisticated way , thanks to Slideshow ’s magic , which lets you embed code files and snippets in a presentation , evaluate them and show the results in the same or a new slide .
Very elegant .
He also used DrRacket a bit during the introductory part of his talk , and i’m starting to understand why some people are so happy with Racket ’s IDE : it definitely felt , in his hands , professional and productive .
And also kind of fun .
There were also lightning talks .
I ’m of course biased , but the one i enjoyed most was Andy Wingo ’s Guile is OK ! , where he showed us how Guile has overcome the problems , perceptual and real , of its first dozen years .
For instance , he reminded us how Guile was traditionally a “ defmacro scheme ” , and he himself a “ defmacro guy ” … until he studied in earnest Dyvbig ’s work and ported his syntax - case implementation to Guile , to become a “ syntax - case man ” as Guile gained full syntax - case support ( i hope i’ll reach that nirvana some day ; i still find syntax - case too complex and plagued by unintuitive corner cases ( one of them was showed by Aaron Hsu in another lightning talk , where apparently none of us was able to correctly interpret 10 lines of scheme ) that make me uneasy ; but that ’s surely just ignorance on my part ) .
There are many other things that make Guile a respectable citizen of the Scheme Underground , which were also listed in Andy ’s talk : i’ll ask him for a PDF , but in the meantime you can just try Guile and see :) .
Although this time we did n’t have a talk by Will Clinger , to me it ’s always a pleasure to listen to what he has to say , even if only as comments to other people ’s talks .
For instance , i enjoyed his introduction to Alex Shinn ’s R7RS progress report .
Will showed us three one dollar coins , of the same size and shape , but different , as he described , in almost everything else .
And yet , all three were useful and recognised as ( invalid ) dollars by the Canadian vending machines at the entrance .
He thinks that says something about standards , but he left to us to decide exactly what .
Finally , let me mention that this workshop has alleviated all my quibbles with what i’ve sometimes perceived as a fragmented , almost dysfunctional , community , made up of separate factions following their own path in relative isolation .
My feeling during the workshop was nothing of the sort ; rather , i’m back with the conviction that there ’s much more uniting us that breaking us apart , and that there ’s such a thing as a scheme underground ready to take over the world .
Some day .
How dare you call us blasphemers ?
IT DOES not happen often : Christian lobbyists , the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in Italian ones , lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion 's role in the public square .
But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations .
Not over the outcome , but over the slim margin of defeat .
On March 25th the Human Rights Council ( HRC ) , a Geneva - based UN agency which often exasperates its Western members , voted by 20 votes to 17 , with eight abstentions , for a text that lists the “ defamation of religion ” as an infringement of liberty .
Nothing amazing there : the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , which groups 56 mainly Muslim states ( plus Palestine ) , has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005 .
But the margin was the smallest ever , and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a “ defamation ” motion next time one comes around .
The OIC 's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection , just as individuals do .
It denies any sinister intention ( see article ) .
And to some ears , the OIC 's effort sounds like harmless UN - speak , but nothing more .
( The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , a congressionally mandated body , has noted a logical flaw : defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or entity : that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer , at least physically , alive on earth . )
But critics of the OIC campaign , who include atheists , Christians and indeed some Muslims , say the “ defamation ” idea is worse than hot air : far from protecting human rights , it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent .
What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view .
Mexico , Uruguay , Argentina , Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution .
Brazil criticised the text but abstained .
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy , another battle over religion rages — and the stakes could be even higher .
An “ ad hoc committee ” is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination .
Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith ; some want a new convention , or a protocol to the existing one .
For secularists ( in the broad sense of people , including believers , who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access to power ) , all this is alarming .
Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough ; a UN treaty on race - plus - religion would have legal force , at least for its signatories , and give heart to theocrats .
At the HRC 's latest discussion of this effort in March , the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead .
But countries like Switzerland , Japan , Mexico , Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones .
Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume , with a new chairman , late this year — but critics are relieved to have stalled it .
Still , would - be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter , because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation , in the view of Roy Brown , Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union .
Meanwhile a Christian - inspired NGO , the European Centre for Law and Justice , has been denouncing the abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states .
How fair is their point ?
It is an easy case to make , for example , over Pakistan .
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year , says that country 's independent Human Rights Commission .
In theory , blasphemy is punishable by death — a penalty that has been handed down but never carried out .
Worst - hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis , a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state .
Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s , when an Islamist general tightened up the rules , the law is still invoked in disputes ( over property , say ) that have nothing to do with faith .
“ The most vulnerable people , that is religious minorities , continue to be charged with blasphemy , ” said Ali Dayan Hasan , a researcher at Human Rights Watch , a campaign group .
“ But are people convicted ?
No. Rarely .
It is used as an instrument of political and social coercion . ”
When convictions occur , they lead to long jail terms ; and pre-trial detention can last for years .
Pakistan 's parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits , despite a vow by the ruling party to review the blasphemy laws .
( Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime . )
On Pakistani streets , the law has dire effects .
In January 2009 , in a village in Punjab province , five Ahmadis , a labourer and four children , were charged with blasphemy .
They had supposedly written “ Prophet Muhammad ” on the wall of a mosque toilet .
The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed .
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain .
It seems that his real crime , however , was affection for a Muslim woman .
A mob torched a church , and many Christians had to flee .
He was taken to jail , where he died a few days later .
His family alleged torture ; the authorities claimed suicide .
There was mayhem at the funeral and the country 's Christians ( see picture ) were appalled .
In some places , it is not the “ defamation ” of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it .
Jersey
Shore has always been guilty of being a guilty pleasure , but now the producers of the MTV show are being sued for supposedly running a " criminal enterprise , " because they 're " profiting " off of castmembers ' fights .
A judge in New Jersey has agreed to hear a lawsuit filed by three of the people that Ronnie Magro socked during the taping of the first season .
The suit argues that because 495 Productions , the company that makes the show for MTV , may have profited from fights that the gang of guidos deliberately started , the producers are in violation of the state 's racketeering laws .
Oh great , now they 're charging Jersey Shore with the same charges mobsters routinely face ?
Italian - American groups are really going to love this !
The suit better not impede the second season of the most important sociological experiment of our time or else we 're going to go out and clock those guys in the head ourselves .
From the Financial Times : Greece agrees € 24bn austerity package
Greece has agreed the outline of a € 24bn austerity package , including a three - year wage freeze for public sector workers , in return for a multibillion - euro loan from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund ...
except with permission
European leaders raced on Thursday to complete their part of a long - delayed financial rescue package for Greece , hoping to head off a chain reaction against other heavily indebted European nations that could turn into a financial meltdown across the continent .
The final details are still being worked out , but apparently the value - added tax ( VAT ) will be increased , public sector workers will lose their two large bonuses , and the retirement age will be increased significantly among other measures .
This is intended to reduce the budget deficit by 10 + percentage points over 3 years .
From the NY Times : Europe Moves Swiftly on Greek Rescue Plan People have been comparing Greece to Lehman , but maybe a better comparison would be to Morgan Stanley ( the bank everyone thought was next before TARP ) .
This might be the beginning of the European sovereign TARP .
Google Flu Trends is not as accurate at estimating rates of laboratory - confirmed influenza as CDC national surveillance programs , according to a new study from the University of Washington .
The findings were reported at the ATS 2010 International Conference in New Orleans .
" We knew from the Google Flu Trends validation study that it is highly correlated with surveillance for the non-specific syndrome of influenza - like illness , " said Justin Ortiz , M.D. , clinical fellow at the University of Washington who led the study .
" However , it has never been evaluated against a gold standard of actual laboratory tests positive for influenza virus infection .
When we compared Google Flu Trends data to CDC 's national surveillance for influenza laboratory tests positive , we found that Google Flu Trends was 25 percent less accurate at estimating rates of laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection . "
Google Flu Trends uses the popularity of certain Google search queries in real time to estimate nationwide rates of influenza - like illness activity , a non-specific combination of symptoms including a fever with either a cough or a sore throat without any confirmatory laboratory testing .
While some traditional flu surveillance systems may take days or weeks to collect and release data , Google search queries can be counted almost instantaneously .
The problem is that studies have shown that influenza - like illnesses are actually caused by the influenza virus in only 20 percent to 70 percent of cases during the influenza season .
" Many respiratory virus infections other than influenza can result in influenza - like illness .
Furthermore , there is a wide and unpredictable proportion of influenza - like illness that is due to actual influenza virus , " said Dr. Ortiz .
" Because Google Flu Trends estimates of influenza - like illness may not necessarily correlate with actual influenza virus infections , we undertook this study to evaluate the validity of Google Flu Trends influenza surveillance by comparing it to a gold standard of CDC 's national surveillance for influenza laboratory tests positive . "
The researchers analyzed the incidence of flu outbreaks in the United States between 2003 to 2008 .
They found that Google Flu Trends deviated greatest from CDC surveillance for influenza virus tests positive during the 2003 - 04 influenza season , a year notable for early and intense influenza activity , with a high number of pediatric influenza deaths and substantial media attention to influenza .
" Internet search behavior is likely different during anomalous seasons such as during 2003 - 4 , " explained Dr. Ortiz .
" We hypothesize that during periods of intense media interest or unexpected influenza activity such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic , Google Flu Trends may be least accurate at estimating influenza activity . "
" Still , Google Flu Trends influenza surveillance provides an excellent public health service , because it provides nationwide influenza activity data in a cheap and timely manner , " said Dr. Ortiz .
" Nevertheless , our study demonstrates that its data should be interpreted with caution and that other surveillance systems more accurately reflect influenza activity in the United States . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - First lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday unveiled a 70 - point plan for reducing childhood obesity within a generation , including a call for marketing healthier food , but stopping short of recommending regulatory action or a federal tax on sugary sodas .

The obesity task force report , requested by President Barack Obama , had been closely watched by the food and beverage industry .
Mrs. Obama took on childhood obesity as her signature issue and when the president put together an interagency panel in February to study the issue , he chose her to lead the campaign .
“ We do n’t need new discoveries or new inventions to reverse this trend , ” Mrs. Obama said at a briefing on the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President .
“ Again , we have the tools at our disposal to reverse it .
All we need is the motivation , the opportunity and the willpower to do what needs to be done . ”
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says two - thirds of American adults and 15 percent of American children are overweight or obese -- a condition that puts them at risk of developing heart disease , diabetes and cancer .
Disease related to excess weight costs the United States about $ 150 billion per year in direct medical costs .
Many states tax highly sweetened food and beverages as a way to discourage their consumption but recent research shows those tax rates on soda have had a relatively small impact on adolescent and adult weights , the report said .
Administration officials said the task force suggested studying the impact of state and local taxes to further good nutrition , but there was no proposal for a federal tax on sugary sodas in the report .
A higher tax rate would likely have greater impact on consumption “ as evidenced by the effects of the substantial rise in tobacco taxes , ” the report said .
Many food and beverage makers have agreed to limit marketing to children and are offering healthier products .
McDonald ’s Corp offers more grilled chicken and fresh fruit , PepsiCo Inc is using whole grains in more of its snacks and Campbell Soup Co is lowering the amount of sodium in its Spaghettios pastas and V8 vegetable juices .
Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said food and beverage companies can cash in on consumer demand for healthier products .
“ Folks , especially baby - boomers , will pay up for that so - called healthy option , ” he said .
HEALTHY MARKETING
The report ’s recommendations include encouraging the food and beverage industry , the media and the entertainment industry to market healthier foods to children .
Federal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz said regulation should be a last resort .
“ We have seen to some extent marketing of healthier foods to kids , ” he said .
“ But I also think that a regulatory approach is certainly not where we want to start . ”
There are important First Amendment concerns and if the government tries to regulate what foods can be marketed , “ that would be a matter that would be in litigation for quite some time , ” Leibowitz said .
Instead , he suggested commending companies that are “ really stepping up to the plate ” and sometimes “ shaming companies that are n’t doing enough . ”
Kelly Brownell , director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University , said the report sent “ a polite , but clear warning shot across the bow of industry ” to take action .
“ Industry will change its practices only when it has no other choice and we ’re getting to that point now , ” he said ,
The panel also said economic incentives could help eradicate “ food deserts ” -- urban and rural areas with few , if any , supermarkets and grocery stores .
The incentives would improve access to healthy , affordable food .
Some people love ’em and others hate ’em .
Now you can play with streamgraphs ( seen here and here ) yourself , whatever side you might be on .
Lee Byron has made the code available on Github , under a BSD license .
It ’s in Processing , and it ’s not plug - n - play like many of you are probably hoping for , but on a quick skim , the code does look very readable and should n’t be too hard to grasp for those with a little bit of coding knowledge .
I recommend reading Lee and Martin ’s streamgraph paper first though .
Dr. Ravi Batra , progressive economist and professor of economics at SMU , stated his support for a partial gold - backed currency as a replacement for the U.S. dollar .
On April 30 , 2010 , on the Thom Hartmann show , he stated at 57:30 :
“ I do n’t know if we will ever have one world currency in my lifetime , but currency should be backed up , partially at least , by gold , so that nobody can just inflate currency to fix the problem and leave workers dry .
Wages have been stagnant at the same time , so we need to have some backing for the currency as well , and that should be gold . ”
The U.S. dollar was on a full gold standard until 1933 , when most domestic gold was confiscated and transferred not to the U.S. Treasury , but the illegal Federal Reserve .
After the confiscation , the price was raised from $ 20.67 USD to $ 35 an ounce .
From then until August 15 , 1971 , the U.S. was on a partial gold standard , with foreign currency directly convertible into gold at the rate of $ 35 an ounce .
Since then , gold has been able to freely float , and has hit all time highs since the economic turbulence of 2008 , now over $ 1200 an ounce .
The call for a return to a gold - backed currency truly crosses the political divide , with a progressive economist singing the praises of a gold standard along with proponents of the libertarian Austrian School of Economics .
Despite growing privacy concerns , an astonishing 540 million Internet users worldwide visited Facebook in April 2010 , or 35.2 % of the entire population of Web users , according to new data from Google .
Even more incredibly , those users clicked on 570 billion Facebook pages in April , a number eight times larger than Facebook 's nearest competitor .
Ten of the World 's Strangest Social Networks
The new figures come from Google 's DoubleClick Ad Planner , and rate the top 1,000 most - visited sites on the Web ( excluding Google itself , YouTube and Gmail ) .
Yahoo came in second place after Facebook , with 490 million unique visitors , 31.8 % of the world 's Internet - connected population , and 70 billion page views .
Next was Microsoft's Live.com , with 370 million unique visitors and 39 billion page views .
Illustration : Steve Lyons
The most popular sites after Live.com were Wikipedia , MSN.com , Microsoft.com , Blogspot.com , Baidu.com , GG.com and Mozilla.com .
The numbers show that Facebook is the undisputed king of social networking , with rival Twitter attracting a comparatively modest 96 million unique visitors and 5.4 billion page views in April 2010 .
Facebook has courted controversy with new privacy settings that have made it difficult to hide personal information , and users have threatened to shut their Facebook accounts down .
More than half of Facebook users are considering dumping their Facebook accounts because of privacy concerns , according to one poll by Sophos .
But the threats may ring hollow when looking at Facebook 's actual web traffic .
In the United States Alone , Facebook attracted 135 million unique visitors in April 2010 -- 43 % of the total U.S. population -- compared to 145 million for Google , according to separate data released by Compete , an analytics firm .

Here 's how Joe Lieberman 's citizenship - stripping bill would work
By now you 've heard that Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) is proposing a new law that could potentially strip Americans of their citizenship if they 're involved with foreign terrorist organizations .
Two things you should know about this :
First , it is n't just some paranoid liberal nightmare .
It 's actually moving forward .
Lieberman is going to hold a presser tomorrow to introduce the bill , I 'm told , along with Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) has already signaled he could support this .
Second , Lieberman 's office has clarified to me how the law would work :
It would empower the State Department to conclude -- on its own -- that Americans are conspiring with terror groups and should be stripped of their citizenship .
Lieberman 's law would amend an earlier statute that details other things that can cost you citizenship : Serving in the army of a foreign state , pledging allegiance to a foreign state , and so on .
In those cases the State Department decides whether your disloyalty merits loss of citizen status .
Lieberman 's law would add involvement with a foreign terror organization -- as opposed to a foreign state -- to this list .
Who would determine whether you 're involved with a foreign terror group ?
The State Department .
It already decides what is and is n't designated as a terror organization .
Lieberman 's law would also empower State to determine whether you are in league with one of these groups .
Here 's where it gets more complicated .
You would still have the right to contest this in court .
And if you did , the burden of proof would be on State -- not on you -- to persuade the court that your involvement with a terror organization is sufficient to justify taking away your citizen status .
Bottom line : Lieberman 's law can't keep you out of court against your will if you want to contest efforts to strip your citizenship .
And chances are that if you were already facing other charges -- plotting or executing a terrorist act -- you would be simultaneously tried for that in civilian court , too , even as State continued to try to revoke your citizen status .
Lieberman is introducing this tomorrow .
So at a minimum there could be a national debate about it .
My bet is more Dems than you might think will be afraid to oppose this .
UPDATE , 4:30 p.m. :: Schumer has now come out against Lieberman 's proposal .
Senior Opposition frontbencher Christopher Pyne has taken aim at former prime minister Malcolm Fraser 's decision to quit the Liberal Party , describing his criticisms as " wrong " .
The Financial Review newspaper says Mr Fraser quit in December , shortly after Tony Abbott replaced Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader , because he believed the party was becoming too conservative .
Mr Fraser has previously criticised the party for becoming one of " fear and reaction " and says it is now unrecognisable as the party he joined more than 50 years ago .
The former prime minister has also been a vocal critic of the Coalition 's border protection policies .
Mr Pyne has told NewsRadio that Mr Fraser 's resignation will not have an " enormous impact " on the Liberal Party , and he has defended the direction it has taken under Mr Abbott .
" He 's entitled to his view , but I think he 's wrong , " Mr Pyne said .
" The Liberal Party is as much a party of both liberal and conservative traditions , as it has ever been .
It contains in it a number of very prominent ' small l' liberals such as Malcolm Turnbull and George Brandis and others , and they are in senior roles . "
Opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb said Mr Fraser 's decision was " his call " .
" Malcolm , for whatever reason , has been uncomfortable with lots of our positions for 20 years , 25 years , " he said .
" I do n't know what 's going through his head .
We 've become used to Malcolm disagreeing with our positions on many issues for nearly a quarter of a century . "
This morning Mr Abbott paid tribute to Mr Fraser .
" He obviously has a right to make his judgements about where he stands , " the Opposition Leader told Macquarie Radio .
' Troubled '
Liberal backbencher Petro Georgiou was a senior adviser under Mr Fraser when he was prime minister .
He has told ABC's AM program that Mr Fraser left because the party is different from the party he joined .
" I think Malcolm 's had a classical Menzies - ian view of the party and has been troubled by where he 's seen the party going over recent years , " he said .
" I think [ his resignation ] should be viewed with a great deal of sadness .
It should be viewed as the action of a man who takes his convictions very seriously . "
When asked if anyone had tried to convince Mr Fraser to stay Mr Georgiou replied : " That 's something you 'd have to ask Malcolm . "
Mr Georgiou said he was deeply saddened by Mr Fraser 's resignation but said others would have to form their own view as to whether it is a blow to the Liberal Party and Tony Abbott .
Opposition resources spokesman Ian Macfarlane says it is not surprising that Mr Fraser might have changed his views .
" My mother once wore an " It 's Time " t- shirt and I can assure you she is not a Labor voter these days , " he said , referring to the slogan for Gough Whitlam 's 1972 election campaign .
" I mean , everyone changes their beliefs and as time goes on reflects their beliefs . "
Final straw
Mr Fraser 's biographer Margaret Simons told ABC2 News Breakfast she knew he had quit the party earlier this year .
Ms Simons said Mr Fraser considered leaving during the Tampa crisis of 2001 .
" I think it was really various straws which broke the camel 's back , " she said .
" The things that finally brought him to this decision were partly that people such as Petro Georgiou , who he felt very loyal to , were leaving ... and also his disgust at the way Malcolm Turnbull was dealt with . "
But Ms Simons says Mr Fraser 's decision should not be seen as a personal attack on Mr Abbott .
" It 's about policy , " she said .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard says voters should reflect on the reasons for Mr Fraser 's resignation .
" I think Mr Fraser , in resigning , is saying to the Australian people that he's got a view about how extreme the Liberal Party is under Tony Abbott , " she said .
" I think that 's going to cause Australians to reflect . "
The ABC has tried to contact Mr Fraser for comment .
San Andreas had the saddest emptiest map of them all .
I hated that game because of the crappy map .
I 'm almost certain they did that just to claim it was bigger than GTA3 and Vice City combined .... yet they do n't mention how lifeless and boring 75 % of it is .
Then again , SA is by far one of the most self indulgent games I 've ever played .
They added such much to it , yet it was done in a really shabby half assed way .

Tony Hayward said the US regime for oil drilling permits was already rigorous BP 's chief executive has said the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster should not mean the end of deep - water exploration .
But Tony Hayward told the BBC's Today programme that significant changes to the oil industry should arise from what he called a " transforming event " .
Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been gushing from a seabed well since a drilling rig exploded on 20 April .
President Barack Obama says there will no longer be a " cosy relationship " between oil firms and US regulators .
He has also hit out at the executives of the oil companies involved for seeking to pass on blame for the disaster .
' Significant changes ' Mr Hayward told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " I do n't believe it should [ result in a ban ] , in the same way as Apollo 13 did not stop the space programme nor have serious airline accidents from time to time stopped people flying . "
But he said changes would have to be made to address the risk of such drilling .
" I think undoubtedly that this will be a transforming event for exploration and production activities in the deep water of the world , in particular the deep water of the United States , " he said .
MARDELL'S AMERICA President Barack Obama is doing his best to make sure that the wave of blame that is bound to follow does not lap against the doors of the White House
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full " You can't have an incident of this seriousness and not expect significant changes as a consequence .
What we need to do is ensure that the changes we make address the risk that has occurred here . "
President Obama has stopped all new drilling for the moment and some politicians want that to become permanent .
He is introducing changes to the way the federal government grants permits to drill for oil .
" For too long , for a decade or more , there has been a cosy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , " Mr Obama said on Friday .
But Mr Hayward told the BBC the permit regime in the US was as rigorous as anywhere in the world and such judgements should wait on the full outcome of the investigation into the accident .
Eleven people died when an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April .
Owned and operated by Transocean , the rig had been working on behalf of BP at a well site 48 miles ( 77 km ) off Louisiana .
Thousands of barrels of oil have been gushing daily into the sea from the well 's ruptured riser pipe , nearly a mile ( 1.6 km ) below the surface .

BP engineers are making another attempt to reduce the flow of oil from the blown - out well by using underwater robots to insert a tube into a broken pipe to funnel oil to the surface .
Previous attempts to lower a containment box over the most serious of the leaks have so far failed .
The spill is poised to become the worst environmental disaster in US history .
Some scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the amount .
Mr Hayward said BP was sticking to its estimate that 1,000 - 5,000 barrels per day .
Weather forecasts have suggested winds may drive the spill ashore at the weekend .
Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125 - tonne , 18 - metre ( 59 feet ) high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor .
However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice - like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy .
Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site .
Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak .
To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas .
The top hat is 1.5 m ( 5 feet ) high and 1.2 m in diameter .
Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe .
This should prevent the build - up of hydrates .
Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface .
BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface .
This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build - up of hydrates .

This feels like a populist moment .
Americans are Tea Partying .
Greeks are rioting .
Incumbents are being thrown out ; the Federal Reserve is facing an audit ; Goldman Sachs is facing prosecution .
In Kentucky , Ron Paul ’s son might be about to win a Republican Senate primary .
But look through these anti-establishment theatrics to the deep structures of political and economic power , and suddenly the surge of populism feels like so much sound and fury , obscuring the real story of our time .
From Washington to Athens , the economic crisis is producing consolidation rather than revolution , the entrenchment of authority rather than its diffusion , and the concentration of power in the hands of the same elite that presided over the disasters in the first place .
Consider the European situation .
For a week after Greece ’s fiscal meltdown began , all the talk was about the weakness of the European Union , the folly of its too - rapid expansion , and the failure of the Continent ’s governing class to anticipate the crisis .
But then the E.U. acted , bailing out Greece to the tune of nearly a trillion dollars , and dictating economic terms to Athens that resemble “ the kind of thing a surrendering field marshal signs in a railway car in the forest at the end of a bloody war , ” in the words of the Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum .
If the bailout succeeds , the E.U. ’s authority over its member states will be dramatically enhanced — and a crisis created by hasty , elite - driven integration will have led , inexorably , to further integration and a more powerful elite .
A study by the National Center for Policy Analysis shows that tax credits in the new healthcare law could negatively impact small - business hiring decisions .
The new law provides a 50 percent tax credit to companies offering health coverage that have fewer than 10 workers who , on average , earn $ 25,000 a year .
The tax credit is reduced as more employees are added to the payroll .

The NCPA study finds the reduction in tax relief to be a cost concern for companies looking to hire additional workers , but operate on slim profit margin yet still provide employee health coverage .
“ You would n’t think this would have an impact , but at the margins , when they [ business owners ] decide to hire an extra worker , they ’re not only going to be paying that worker ’s salary , they ’re going to have to absorb the cost of losing the tax credit , ” Pamela Villarreal , NCPA Senior Policy Analyst and co-author of the report , told The Hill .
A Treasury spokesperson acknowledged the tax credit is on a sliding scale , but stressed its primary aim is to help struggling companies provide health coverage to workers .
“ The small business tax credit was designed to provide the greatest benefit to employers that currently have the hardest time providing health insurance for their workers - small , low - wage firms , ” the spokesperson told The Hill in an e-mail .
“ Small employers face higher premiums and higher administrative costs than large firms , and in many cases cannot afford to provide coverage . ”
Villarreal said the credit creates a perverse incentive for business owners that fit the Treasury ’s profile .
While the tax break is temporary and only returns a fraction of what employees cost a company , businesses owners might forego hiring an extra worker if it means losing a piece of the tax credit .
“ If a business can make a decision to substitute capital for labor – say , contract the procedure out or automate it – I believe [ losing the tax credit ] will play an important part in the reluctance to hire , ” Villarreal said , adding , “ It ’s puzzling that we have this perverse incentive not to have businesses grow by not encouraging them to hire additional workers . ”
Using insurance premium cost projections supplied by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , the study states that the credit reaches its optimal point at 13 workers , with relief peaking at $ 36,400 for qualifying business .
After the 13th worker the economics surrounding the credit change , the study says .
For employers with 15 workers , taking on an additional hire will reduce the credit by $ 1,400 .
For a company looking to expand from 20 to 21 workers , the credit will shrink by $ 3,733 .
And businesses will take a $ 5,600 reduction on the credit when hiring the 25th worker .
The credit phases out for companies with at least 26 employees .
Bill Rys , tax counsel at the National Federation of Independent Businesses , told The Hill that while demand is the primary driver for hiring decisions , costs related to new hires is a key factor .
“ To the extent that a tax credit is related to the benefits that you ’re paying your employees , it is going to be a factor in determining what is the cost of the employee , ” he said .
“ The fact that you ’re losing a portion of the credit because you brought in a new employee is going to have to factor into the cost of who you ’re hiring . ”
The tax credits are available to businesses until 2016 , two years after the healthcare exchanges are up and running .
In 2016 , of the 159 million Americans that participate in employer - sponsored health plans , only 3 million will be eligible for the tax credits provided to their employer , the CBO predicts .
It seems a box is always too big or small so designer Patrick Sung came up with flat sheets of recyclable corrugated cardboard called the Universal Packaging System or UPACKS .
The patterns make it easy to fold and conform to almost any shape while maintaining structural rigidity and protecting the contents .
Love the idea of saving on packaging but will this actually work ?
I suspect each sheet would have to be sufficiently padded ; not too thick , not too thin , but just right said Goldilocks .

THE world faces the nightmare possibility of fishless oceans by 2050 unless fishing fleets are slashed and stocks allowed to recover , UN experts warned .
" If the various estimates we have received ... come true , then we are in the situation where 40 years down the line we , effectively , are out of fish , " Pavan Sukhdev , head of the UN Environment Program 's green economy initiative , said .
A Green Economy report due later this year by UNEP and outside experts argues this disaster can be avoided if subsidies to fishing fleets are slashed and fish are given protected zones - ultimately resulting in a thriving industry .
The report , which was opened to preview overnight , also assesses how surging global demand in other key areas including energy and fresh water can be met while preventing ecological destruction around the planet .
UNEP director Achim Steiner said the world was " drawing down to the very capital " on which it relies .
However , " our institutions , our governments are perfectly capable of changing course , as we have seen with the extraordinary uptake of interest .
Around , I think it is almost 30 countries now have engaged with us directly , and there are many others revising the policies on the green economy , " he said .
Environmental experts are mindful of the failure this March to push through a worldwide ban on trade in bluefin tuna , one of the many species said to be headed for extinction .
Powerful lobbying from Japan and other tuna - consuming countries defeated the proposal at the CITES conference on endangered species in Doha .
But UNEP 's warning was that tuna only symbolises a much vaster catastrophe , threatening economic , as well as environmental upheaval .
One billion people , mostly from poorer countries , rely on fish as their main animal protein source , according to the UN .
The Green Economy report estimates there are 35 million people fishing around the world on 20 million boats .
About 170 million jobs depend directly or indirectly on the sector , bringing the total web of people financially linked to 520 million .
According to the UN , 30 percent of fish stocks have already collapsed , meaning they yield less than 10 percent of their former potential , while virtually all fisheries risk running out of commercially viable catches by 2050 .
Currently only a quarter of fish stocks - mostly the cheaper , less desirable species - are considered to be in healthy numbers .
The main scourge , the UNEP report says , are government subsidies encouraging ever bigger fishing fleets chasing ever fewer fish , with little attempt made to allow the fish populations to recover .
The annual 27 billion dollars in government subsidies to fishing , mostly in rich countries , is " perverse , " Mr Sukhdev said , since the entire value of fish caught is only 85 billion dollars .
As a result , fishing fleet capacity is " 50 to 60 percent " higher than it should be , Mr Sukhdev said .
Creating marine preservation areas to allow female fish to grow to full size , thereby hugely increasing their fertility , is one vital solution , the report says .
Another is restructuring the fishing fleets to favour smaller boats that - once fish stocks recover - would be able to land bigger catches .
" What is scarce here is fish , " Mr Sukhdev said , " not the stock of fishing capacity . "
Has excess capacity hit the legal profession ?
The Chicago Tribune discusses the situation in Law school tuition hikes spark talk of bubble
The rising cost of law school is becoming a sore subject as the number of high - paying jobs shrink .
With large numbers of unemployed or underemployed lawyers who borrowed heavily to pay for their educations , legal educators face growing skepticism about the value of a law degree .
Anonymous critics have started blogs with harsh names such as " Big Debt , Small Law " or " The Jobless Juris Doctor . "
With three - year programs at top schools costing nearly $ 150,000 , not including room , board or even books , some of the criticism is coming from inside the legal profession .
Christine Hurt , a law professor at the University of Illinois , suggests that the market for legal education is strikingly similar to the subprime mortgage market .
Her theory , which she posted on " The Conglomerate Blog " last week , goes like this :
Double - digit tuition increases in the last 25 years have priced law schools out of reach for many .
Yet the promise of a career at a big law firm with its six - figure paychecks kept boosting enrollment .
Easy credit allowed more students to finance their law degrees .
All of a sudden law firms lay off droves of attorneys and limit the number of new hires , leaving graduates out of work with more than $ 100,000 in loans to repay .
The recession already has forced law schools to rein in tuition hikes that were well above inflation for the last 25 years , including double - digit increases in many years .
Last fall , Northwestern University 's law school raised its tuition by about 4 percent , its smallest increase in 32 years , said David Van Zandt , its dean .
Its annual tuition is still among the highest in the country at $ 47,202 .
But with law firms cutting salaries and hiring fewer graduates last year because of the economy , Northwestern sent just 55.9 percent of its 2009 graduates to the largest firms , according to the National Law Journal .
Yet the school still was No. 1 in the publication 's annual ranking of graduates who found jobs at big firms .
Van Zandt said he believes big law firms will never go back to hiring graduates in droves .
That means they will recruit from fewer schools .
" It does n't make a lot of sense to go to law school unless you go to a pretty good one , " Van Zandt said .
Bubbles , Student Loans and Sub - Prime Debt
For a couple of decades now ( and until a few years ago ) , the conventional wisdom was that real estate would always rise in value and that the world would always need lawyers .
Home ownership at whatever cost , particularly with tax - deductible interest rates , was better than alternatives such as renting ; financing a law degree with student loans , some of which was low - interest and tax - deductible , was an equally good investment given the value of the law degree .
Just as something about home ownership seemed intrinsically good , so did getting a law degree , from any law school .
Strangely , most law school educations were priced similarly .
Law schools with lower employment rates charged more money than some schools with higher employment rates .
Price was not a clear signal of quality .
Anyway , more and larger houses were built ; more and larger law schools were built .
Then , as if on a dime , the world changed and all of a sudden lots of people with law degrees were getting laid off , deferred , ignored .
...
How can someone write off $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 in student loans as a bad call ?
Many of these loans are n't federal loans -- they are from private lenders at high rates .
And , unlike homeowners , law students do n't have a " put " option -- they can't tell lenders to take their law degrees and quit calling them .
So , what 's the future of law school pricing ?
Will someone create an affordable model that does n't depend on third - party financing ?
Will some law schools start to look like culinary schools or technical institutes that provide financing of $ 40,000 a year for a law degree few employers are looking for ?
Or will law schools pride themselves not on inputs ( LSAT , GPAs , you know -- USNews stuff ) and on outputs ( where our graduates actually end up working , and how much they make ) .
If you thought that Apple 's foray into the world of home entertainment died with the last iteration of the Apple TV , you 're quite wrong .
A tip we 've received -- which has been confirmed by a source very close to Apple -- details the outlook for the next version of the Apple TV , and it 's a doozy .
According to our sources , this project has been in the works long before Google announced its TV solution , and it ties much more closely into Apple 's mobile offerings .
The new architecture of the device will be based directly on the iPhone 4 , meaning it will get the same internals , down to that A4 CPU and a limited amount of flash storage -- 16GB to be exact -- though it will be capable of full 1080 p HD (! ) .
The device is said to be quite small with a scarce amount of ports ( only the power socket and video out ) , and has been described to some as " an iPhone without a screen . "
Are you ready for the real shocker ?
According to our sources , the price - point for the device will be $ 99 .
One more time -- a hundred bucks .
Not only will this be priced to sell ( like hotcakes ) , it seems that Apple is moving away from the model of local storage , and will be focusing the new ATV on cloud - based storage ( not unlike Amazon 's streaming scheme , though we 're talking instant - on 1080 p , a la Microsoft ) .
For those still interested in keeping their content close , there will be an option to utilize a Time Capsule as an external storage component , but the main course will be all about streaming .
The new ATV will do away with its current OS X - lite variation as a operating system , and will instead adopt the iPhone OS for the underlying experience .
There 's no word at this point on whether apps and the App Store will be coming along for the ride , but it makes sense given the shared platform .
Of course , scaling iPhone apps to that 52 - inch plasma in your living room is n't exactly a no -brainer .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Apple wo n't deliver the ATV news at the upcoming WWDC -- that event will be focused on the capabilities of the new iPhone -- but development on the product is most definitely full steam ahead .
Is your TV screen the next battleground in the platform wars ?
Survey says : hell yes .
Mess with the bull , you get the horn !
A day after dashing Spanish bullfighter Julio Aparicio showed his dominance by cutting the ears off two vanquished bulls , one of their bovine brothers got revenge yesterday by gruesomely impaling the matador through his throat and out his mouth .
As Aparicio held his red cape and sword out to face down the 1,100 - pound beast named Opiparo at the Feria de San Isidor bullfighting event in Las Ventanas , Spain , the bullfighter lost his footing and the bull was able to strike .
“ [ The horn ] went though the tongue and penetrated the roof of the mouth , fracturing the jawbone , ” one of the medics who worked on Aparicio told AFP news in Madrid .
The Seville native , a member of a well - known family of matadors , was in grave condition last night but expected to survive .

VIDEO : MATADOR GORED BY BULL
The sickening goring happened as Aparicio was going in for the faena , a series of passes in which he uses his cape and sword before delivering the wounded animal the death blow , or estocada .
As Aparicio teased the angry bull with his cape to entertain the fans , it was the bull who delivered the finishing move as the experienced matador fell to his rear end .
The bull thrust its horn into the matador ’s throat then drew it back a moment later , yanking it out of the man ’s mouth .
Aparicio was able to briefly stand before being overcome by the wound and falling as assistants rushed into the bloody , dusty ring and drew Opiparo away .
It was not clear what happened to the bull .
Aparicio was rushed to a medical facility located in the stadium and stabilized .
An initial scan showed skull damage , and he also had a tracheotomy , according to Spanish news sources .
“ We do n’t have a reason to fear for his life , although he will have a very slow recuperation , ” Dr. Maximo Garcia Padros told El Pais newspaper .
Which side are you on – the bull or the matador ?

Despite encouraging words from politicians and the establishment media 's talking heads , it is clear to me , and I believe most Americans who do not live in a regime ivory tower , that we are not coming out of the recession .
In fact , things appear to be getting worse as unemployment continues to rise and businesses cut salaries or shut down .
The fears that this recession could turn into another Great Depression are very real , as we have lost so much of our capacity to create wealth and the federal government seems determined to use up any remaining capital fighting endless wars , funding endless entitlement programs , and spending trillions of dollars on non-wealth - creating " stimulus " programs while handing out even more trillions to their bankster buddies and corporate cronies .
However , another 1930s - style depression is not what keeps me up at night with worry .
America could survive another Great Depression if it was like the last one .
Sure , it would be extremely painful , but it would be manageable , as it was before , and eventually we would come out of it , despite the fact that the government would most certainly make all the wrong moves along the way .
However , what really terrifies me is a hyperinflationary depression .
The Politically Incorr ... Murphy , Ph.D. Robert P. Best Price : $ 5.62 Buy New $ 15.94 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
According to John Williams at ShadowStats.com , in an article titled Hyperinflation Special Report , hyperinflation is not only possible , but inevitable due to the overspending of the federal government , and the printing press of the Federal Reserve , which as Congressman Ron Paul continuously reminds us , prints money out of thin air .
Williams ' report is a truly terrifying read that insists that the coming hyperinflation could get so bad that we will have to resort to the barter system as the dollar will become nothing more than very rough toilet paper .
He cautions that electronic banking will cease to work and for a time no one will have any money at all , not even inflated currency .
You can certainly imagine the type of Hell on earth this will create for the American people .
There is one bright side , however .
Since Williams foresees the beginnings of this hyperinflationary nightmare starting this year , the pain from it might be felt in time for the 2012 elections .
Since the crash of 2008 and the recession of 2009  10 , I cannot leave the house wearing a " Ron Paul ' 08 " shirt without someone coming up to me and saying that " we sure would have been better off if everyone had listened to him , " or " I sure wish I had voted for him , " etc .
The current recession has validated Dr. Paul 's warnings , and thus given him credibility in the eyes of the American people that he lacked when he campaigned for the 2008 election .
This sent his book End the Fed to top of the bestseller list .
If hyperinflation does occur , the pain that the American people feel will hopefully be enough to awaken them fully to the follies of the establishment politicians and their " spend , spend , spend ! " mentality .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Williams predicts this , though he does not mention any candidate by name .
What he does say is that " [ a ] wide variety of possibilities would follow or coincide politically with a hyperinflationary great depression , but the political status quo likely would not continue .
Times would be financially painful enough to encourage the development of a third party that could move the Republicans or Democrats to third - party status in the 2012 presidential and congressional elections . "
If Williams is correct , then a hyperinflationary depression could cause the people to elect candidates that would make the necessary corrections , instead of the same old establishment candidates that got us into this mess to begin with .
Of course those corrections would be slow in coming , as the previous administrations going back to at least Woodrow Wilson , have done so much damage that undoing it all will be slow and painful .
There is also the risk that a third party could move in the other direction , to an even more authoritarian system so that the United States government became openly Socialist or Fascist .
A hyperinflationary depression will be very painful to Americans , but may present those of us who love sound money , free markets , and liberty with an opportunity to get sensible politicians into office .
However , we must use the time we have now to continue reminding the people that it is government spending and interference along with central banking and economic planning that led us to the crisis to begin with .
Otherwise the crisis may be used by authoritarians to seek even more power and control over the economy and our lives .
After all , great crises often bring revolutionary change , but that change is not always for the better .

Thousands of firefighters in Australia are battling wildfires across the country ’s south - east which have destroyed dozens of homes and set a coal mine alight .
The worst of the fires spread in swirling winds across the state of Victoria , which faced its worst threat since the Black Saturday fires in February 2009 which killed 173 people .
The fires , which include a blaze with a front more than 24 miles long , have spread across the state and reached the outskirts of Melbourne , Australia ’s second largest city .
Thousands of people were evacuated across the state , more than 30,000 residents spent the night without power and some rural train services were suspended .
No lives have been reported lost but further losses of homes are expected .
In Kilmore , a town about 35 miles north of Melbourne , residents said the damage was “ horrendous ” .
Firefighters from interstate and from New Zealand joined the battle , as authorities deployed more than 200 tankers and 21 aircraft .
Police are investigating nine cases of arson , which may have contributed to the 150 - odd fires that have broken out in recent days .
Milder conditions have assisted fire crews but about 48 blazes in Victoria remain out of control .
A fire has broken out in an open - cut coal mine in the Latrobe Valley , east of Melbourne , which is likely to take several days to control .

PORTLAND , Ore. —
The Boy Scouts of America were ordered Friday to pay $ 18.5 million in a lawsuit that has focused new attention on the secret files the Scouts keep to document claims of sexual abuse by troop leaders and volunteers .
Known variously as the “ perversion files , ” the “ red flag files ” and the “ ineligible volunteer files , ” the documents have been maintained for more than 70 years at the Scouts ’ national office in Texas .
Yet even after scores of abuse cases against the Scouts in recent decades , the case here is one of the few times that substantial portions of the files have been made accessible to a jury .
In Multnomah County Circuit Court on Friday , a jury found the Scouts liable for $ 18.5 million in punitive damages in a case brought by a man who was sexually abused by an assistant troop leader in the early 1980s , when the man was about 12 .
The verdict was by far the largest ever against the Scouts in a jury trial .
The jury could have ordered the Scouts to pay up to $ 25 million .
The same jury last week awarded the man , Kerry Lewis , $ 1.4 million in compensatory damages .
Most abuse cases involving the Scouts have ended in private settlements , and it is unknown how much the group has paid to victims .
Google has just revealed that Gmail users in the UK will soon be able to choose to switch back to an @gmail.com email address rather than @googlemail.com .
Though Gmail became the standard address with the launch of Gmail in beta in April 2004 , UK users who signed up after 19 October 2005 were saddled with the longer address after a legal spat between Google and a UK - based firm .
Independent International Investment Research had been using the name ' Gmail ' for its own webmail application two years before Google .
At the time , Google said IIIR had asked for an " exhorbitant " $ 50 m for the Gmail trademark and after 15 months of negotiations , it pulled out and reverted to the Googlemail.com address for UK users .
Google said at the time that IIIR 's claims to the trademark were tenuous , and that " they have not provided sufficient evidence to establish common law rights based on use in the large number of countries it claimed use " .
There 's no hint today whether Google had continued these negotiations and / or paid up , the official Gmail blog announcement focusing on the efficiency of the new address .
" Since ' gmail ' is 50 % fewer characters than ' googlemail , ' we estimate this name change will save approximately 60 million keystrokes a day .
At about 217 microjoules per keystroke , that 's about the energy of 20 bonbons saved every day ! "

New sign - ups will get a gmail.com address , while users with an @googlemail.com address can choose to switch .
Addresses are interchangeable , so your email will arrive whichever domain the sender uses .
Google has had similar trademark battles in Germany , Russia and Poland , and , interestingly , the original gmail.com domain was used by Garfield 's creators .
Google does n't break out figures for Gmail , but indicated with the launch of Buzz in February this year that around 170 million people are using Gmail .
• Update : Google sent us this statement : " After engaging in legal proceedings at the trademark office , we were able to reach a settlement with the party with whom we had the conflict .
We are happy to have resolved this issue , and look forward to offering @gmail.com addresses to users in the UK .
We are unable to disclose the settlement agreement details . "

Dr Myhill has a specialist private practice in Powys A doctor has been banned from prescribing drugs and told to take down part of her website after appearing before the General Medical Council .
Dr Sarah Myhill will have to comply with the order for 18 months after two complaints were made against her .
She has a private practice near Knighton , Powys , where she specialises in treating chronic fatigue syndrome .
Her supporters were outside the hearing in London and claimed she was the victim of a witch - hunt .
There have complaints against her on seven occasions since 2001 , but this the first time Dr Myhill has appeared before a General Medical Council ( GMC ) panel .
Before the hearing , she said that she could not understand why complaints against her were being heard .
But the chair of the GMC panel said there serious concerns about the potential risk to patients and her fitness to practice would continued to be reviewed .
One of the complaints was on the content of Dr Myhill 's website , which warned patients against oral contraceptives , the MMR triple vaccine as well as mammogram tests and biopsies for cancer .
But Dr Mygill says she tries to find the causes of a disease , rather than treating the symptoms with drugs .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The GMC considered whether there might be " impairment of Dr Myhill 's fitness to practise which poses a real risk to members of the public or may adversely affect the public interests or Dr Myhill 's own interests " .
But her supporters say no patient has ever complained about her .
Dr Myhill runs a website which gives information on allergies and hormones , and advocates what she calls a " stone age diet " for people suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME ) and other complaints including chemical sensitivity .
She treats people from across the UK .
However it is the website which has prompted the latest complaints against Dr Myhill .
She said in a statement on her website that a group of doctors have complained about her recommending a B12 vitamin injection to a patient .
A second complainant said the information on her website was " very worrying " and was concerned " patients are being seriously misled " .
Supporters of Dr Myhill protested outside the hearing in London Six previous complaints have been made by other doctors against Dr Myhill since 2001 .
She told BBC Wales : " I think there 's a small group of doctors who perceive me as a threat to their professional integrity in some way and that is certainly not my desire to in any way threaten them .
" My motive is purely to help the patient to get well in as safe a way as is possible . "
Patricia Chell has been travelling back and forth from Shropshire for three years to receive treatment , and says her health has improved dramatically since being prescribed magnesium by Dr Myhill .
" I think it 's dreadful , and in fact if she 's suspended , my life 's at stake - literally .
" Without this magnesium , I should eventually get heart failure again . "

Not related , but here 's a news tip : a study out of Montgomery County , PA ( a swing county in a swing state with a big population ) reveals that the '08 vote count was highly inaccurate .

Ross , I hate to spoil your fun , but since the only two presidential candidates with any chance of winning in '08 were both pro-war , pro-bailout , and anti-environment , what difference would an accurate vote count have made ?
The only possible outcome of the " election " was more wars , more bailouts , and more environmental destruction , no matter who won .
As for the decision to assassinate a U.S. citizen , the Supreme Court in it 's incontestable Divine Right , appointed by Presidents who themselves are n't directly elected by the people , supports the right of those who appoint them to do whatever they wish , including the continuing right of Presidents to appoint Supreme Court justices .
Actually , the Supreme Court does not have Divine Right , as their edicts can be appealed to God ( rather than being assumed to have come from God ) by those who believe in God .
For those of us who do not , there is no difference whatsoever .

Mark E. Smith asked : since the only two presidential candidates with any chance of winning in '08 were both pro-war , pro-bailout , and anti-environment , what difference would an accurate vote count have made ?
The difference is that the voice of the citizenry , however corrupted and / or disinformed that voice has become ( thanks to the failures of corporate media ) , would have been respected .
While I appreciate you believe your " boycott " of the vote makes some kind of a difference --- which is your right to believe ---
I believe that those voters who show up to exercise their right to vote should have their vote counted and counted accurately whether you like the way they voted or not .
Not that any of this has anything to do with the article at the top of this comment thread !

The US has long been exercising the right to drop bombs and kill or permanently maim countless civilians in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and other places in the hopes of killing a terrorist target ( typically missed ) .
Did the New York Times report that fact much , offer profiles of civilians killed , the number of casualties , how many were permanently maimed or disfigured ?

This could possibly be okay if there is no chance that you can accidentally kill an innocent person , but can they assure that .

this is not ok ... chances are very high that the " terrorist " is in fact an innocent person .
They do not need to produce any evidence before a judge , a jury , God , my aunt Jane .... nobody .
They just proclaim , " He bad man " and presto , he dead man .
Al - Alwaki , Joe Smith , Betty Jones , its all good , if we wanna kill , we kill , simple .
So , this American Citizen is allowed to be assasinated , no questions asked .
Not even a hint of due process .
Not a scintilla of the " evidence " against him made public or even shown to a judge .
Our gov. is , and has been so very trustworthy that , " just because we say so " is plenty .
Oh , but not to worry , sufficient evidence has been fed to us through the media .
We are told he was in contact with Hasan , the alleged " Magic - Pistols Pete " of Ft. Hood fame .
You remember the guy , surrounded by the best trained killers in our planets history kills 12 and wounds 31 !!
All by himself !!
With only a couple sidearms !!
We know this is rock solid evidence because of all the video we have seen of him diong the shooting , right ?
And the plethora of eye - witness testimony , remember seeing all those soldiers describing the attack on CNN , etc ?
No ?
Well , then you must be one of those malcontents .... you probably can't forget that in the first several hours following the shootings all the cable stations were reporting that there were multiplew shooters .
Then of course Al - Alwaki was also ministering to the infamous crotch bomber Abdulmutallab .
And we know he was also presented as acting alone when clearly he was not .
Who was the sharp dressed man at the boarding gate ?
When the little problem of no passport came up , our mysterious SDM says , " we do it all the time " ..... well is n;t that comforting .
Where are the security videos ?
What about the man filming the entire flight ?
And it always struck me odd that this " dear in the headlights " cold blooded " terrorist ' was the son of Nigeria 's most powerful , wealthy banker .
Then of course we come to Shahzad , our third vicious killer inspired by the master mind Al - Alwaki .
He spends 5 months training in Pakistan ( we are told ) only to come back and use the wrong kind of fertilizer and firecrackers in his " bomb " .
Was he absent that day ?
This crap would even be weak for a comic book .
We get to murder american citizens on THIS ?
The entire war on terror is COMPLETE AND UTTER FABRICATION !
We need a peaceful revolution .

Theodore Van Kirk was the navigator aboard the Enola Gay , the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima 65 years ago .
Now the sole survivor of the crew , how does he live with the deaths of 200,000 people ?
Theodore Van Kirk is sitting at his desk in a detached bungalow in the gated community where he lives outside Atlanta , Georgia .
The room is cluttered with boxes , trinkets , shelves full of books on wartime history , and photographs of planes on the walls .
He picks up a large calendar from the floor and begins flicking through it .
" Let 's have a look at what 's coming up on 6 August , " he says .
Finding that date , he holds up the calendar .
The page is empty .
" Nope , nothing there . "
The absence of any plans is unusual , because Van Kirk is usually heavily in demand on 6 August .
This year , he tells me , he has been invited to travel , all expenses paid , to Tinian , the tiny Pacific island where , 65 years ago on that same day , he set out with 11 other men on an aeroplane journey that would change the world .
But this year , Van Kirk declined the invitation .
He just did n't feel like it , he says .
His uncharacteristic inactivity is explained by the fact that none of the 11 crew members who joined him on that fateful flight will be in Tinian this year , and without them he did n't have the stomach to go .
Over the last 65 years they have fallen one by one .
The first was William Parsons , a military engineer who died in 1953 , followed by Robert Shumard , another engineer , 14 years later .
Others died through the 80s and 90s ; and Paul Tibbets , the commander of the plane , in 2007 .
And then , less than two months ago , Morris Jeppson , a bomb expert , became the penultimate member of the crew to pass away , dying in a hospital in Las Vegas .
Which leaves Van Kirk as the only living crew member of the Enola Gay , the B - 29 bomber that set out from Tinian on 6 August 1945 .
The bomb they carried , dubbed Little Boy , was the world 's first atomic bomb dropped in combat .
Its target : Hiroshima .
Jeppson 's death on 30 March has left Van Kirk , " Dutch " to his friends , as the standard - bearer for a flight that has come to symbolise the terrible destructive power of nuclear warfare .
He is fully aware of the burden he now shoulders .
" I read the papers as they reported Morris 's death , and they all said that Van Kirk is the last survivor .
Now I get asked all the questions . "
' We knew there was something special going on '
Van Kirk was 24 when he joined the crew of the Enola Gay and by then he had already flown more than 50 bombing raids over Europe and North Africa .
Most of those flights were in the company of his great friends , Tibbets and Thomas Ferebee , the Enola Gay 's bombardier .
Together , they formed the core of the Hiroshima mission .
In the six months prior to the mission they and other members of the 509th Composite Group had been holed up in Wendover Field , Utah , training for an unspecified bombing run amid total secrecy .
The words " atomic " and " nuclear " were never mentioned .
" We knew there was something special going on , " he says .
" You could n't be in the 509th and not know something was up .
They told us we were going out to do something that would either end or significantly shorten the war .
They told us that the weapon we were going to drop would destroy an entire city . "
On top of that , they saw hundreds of physicists milling around the base , one of whom Van Kirk recognised from the cover of Time magazine .
" After all that , if you could n't figure out it was an atomic bomb you were pretty damn stupid .
If you talked about it you were even more damn stupid , as you would be transferred instantly to the Aleutian islands , where you could talk all you wanted and nobody would listen . "
A few months before the mission , the pace of preparations picked up .
The crew was told that the bomb they would drop would be so powerful that their plane would need to be at least 11 miles away when it detonated or else it would break up .
They stripped down the B - 29 bomber to its shell to reduce weight and began practising hair - raisingly tight mid-air turns that would be needed to reach a safe distance once the bomb was away .
On 5 August , having been relocated to Tinian , they were called together for a final briefing .
They were informed they were about to do the job for which they had trained for so long : to drop a bomb unlike anything that had gone before .
The word atomic remained unspoken .
After the briefing , they were ordered to get some sleep .
Instead Van Kirk , Tibbets and Ferebee sat up all night playing poker .
" I mean , they tell you you were about to go out and drop the first atom bomb that night , and then tell you to get some sleep !
That was absolutely beyond me ! "
' Bomb away '
The Enola Gay – named by Tibbets after his mother – took off on 6 August at 2.45 am .
Van Kirk 's role was navigator : " We did things the old - fashioned way : celestial navigation , telling your position by the stars .
We had a dome up top of the plane to sit up in and shoot the stars with a bubble sextant . "
Despite the basic techniques , Van Kirk navigated the Enola Gay to its target 1,800 miles away , 15 seconds later than scheduled .
" Fifteen seconds was damn good , that 's all I can say . "
He pulls out from one of the many boxes in his study a facsimile of the navigator 's log he kept that day .
The entry at 09.15 ( 8.15 am Japanese time ) reads " Bomb Away " .
Forty - three seconds later , Little Boy exploded , some 580 m above the streets of Hiroshima .
When the bomb dropped , the Enola Gay suddenly lurched upwards , and Tibbets sent the plane into a 150 - degree turn .
" We were just levelling out with throttles full forward when the bomb exploded at our back .
All we see is a bright flash like a photographer 's bulb going off in the aeroplane . "
Within seconds of that , the first shock wave hit the plane .
" There was a hell of a jolt .
The sound was like the aeroplane being torn in half . "
On the ground , of course , the jolt was far greater than the 3.5 Gs Van Kirk and his 11 colleagues felt inside the Enola Gay .
The pika - don , or " flash - bang " , as the Japanese call the impact of the atom bomb , ripped through Hiroshima with a force equivalent to 13 kilotons of TNT , razing almost five square miles of the city .
Estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 70,000 people , most of them civilians , died within seconds of the blast , 140,000 by the end of 1945 and more than 230,000 in total .
Many died in hideous ways , including burns and radiation sickness .
' You always knew people would be very seriously hurt '
It would be wrong to hold Van Kirk , now 89 , in any sense responsible for the extreme human suffering that the bomb caused .
As Harry Truman , the president who ordered the dropping of the bomb , told Tibbets when they met in 1948 : " I 'm the guy who sent you .
If anybody gives you a hard time about it , refer them to me . "
But on a personal level , how has Van Kirk coped over the years with the knowledge of the destruction the bomb yielded ?
I begin by asking him whether he had any thoughts , at the moment the bomb exploded , about the thousands of people who were right then being obliterated .
" You do that thinking beforehand .
You knew that when you were bombing over occupied France , over Africa ; you always knew that when you were dropping bombs out of aeroplanes a lot of people on the ground would be very seriously hurt . "
And civilians ?
Most of the Hiroshima victims were civilians .
" You 've heard of ' Bomber ' Harris , " he replies , referring to the RAF commander who ordered the raid that obliterated the German city of Dresden .
" The idea at the time was to destroy a nation 's will to fight , and you were n't dropping bombs in a pickle barrel , for chrissakes .
You always recognised there were people on the ground – workers in a factory or civilians living nearby – who could be killed or damaged by the bombs . "
And how difficult was that for him to deal with ?
" If you could not deal with that you were worthless as an aviator .
You had to separate that in your mind or else you were no good .
You could n't have done the job .
Tibbets and Ferebee and I , we always agreed on this : the will of the United States at the time was that we drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . "
He pauses , and then he adds : " I 've never found a way to fight a war without killing people .
If you ever find that out , let me know . "
Van Kirk says he never lost a night 's sleep over Hiroshima .
Such lack of anguish is testament , as he says himself , to the training that he received in the US air force that shielded its pilots from introspection .
It is testament too , perhaps , to the ability of man – and all 12 crew members of the Enola Gay were men – to compartmentalise extreme events and emotions and thereby neutralise them .
' All you saw was plain , flat , level ground '
A few days after Japan surrendered , Van Kirk , Tibbets and some of the other crew visited Nagasaki which , on 9 August , had become the second city to have been eviscerated by an atomic bomb .
I ask him what he recalls about the trip .
" Nothing .
It was just a trip to Japan , that 's all . "
I can't believe that , I say .
Nagasaki had just been entirely flattened by a nuclear explosion .
" Yes , we saw a city that was completely levelled .
All you saw was plain , flat , level ground . "
That must have been a powerful sight , I say .
" There was not much difference between an atomic bomb and a conventional bomb .
The difference was in the area that it covered . "
Did he see the shadows of people who had been burned to dust on the walls and pavements ?
" Yes , you saw that . "
And was n't that shocking ?
" It was shocking as you wondered how the heat of that bomb had done something like that .
But you were immune to it because they told you during your training that would happen . "
Have you ever allowed yourself to read accounts of what it was like to be at the receiving end of the bomb ?
" Yes . "
And what was your reaction ?
" An information reaction . "
Did he ever wish he had never taken part in the Enola Gay 's atomic mission ?
" No , I was proud to be on the Enola Gay .
The war ended on 14 August .
I do n't know when it would have ended if we had not dropped the atomic bombs . "
Would you do it again ?
" Under the same circumstances – and I realise you can never have them exactly again – yes , I would do it again . "
There is a slightly rehearsed quality to the answers Van Kirk gives , which is perhaps unsurprising as he has been responding to questions like this for almost 65 years .
But he suspects he wo n't have to face such grilling for very much longer .
The last man standing who is able to describe the experience of dropping the world 's first atomic bomb is facing his own mortality .
" Every time one of my fellow crew members died it was a shock , " he says .
" But when the last one died it was a real shock .
It 's not just that I 'm now the last survivor .
It 's the shock of getting old .
Hell , I 'm 89 !
The fact of the matter is we are all getting old and dying .
That 's all there is to it . "

Occupations and from [ edit ]
I noticed the Category : Nurses by country had subcategories named " Nurses from X " ( except Belize ) .
Why ?
The Category : Nurses of Belize makes much more sense .
Normally you would like an image of a nurse working in the country in question , regardless of nationality or immigration history – and when taking such photos you usually do not ask about those latter ( so they are known for few photos ) .
For some occupations the " from " might make sense , i.e. where people work globally but are from a specific country – is the " from " because of such standardisation ?
If so , I think there was a mistake of thought , as the standardisation of names should not confuse different content in the categories .
While " from " categories make sense for some occupations , " in " categories make more sense for other ones , and for some you might want both , such as for a Finnish violinist playing in a Canadian orchestra .
–LPfi ( talk ) 11:49 , 23 September 2020 ( UTC )
It 's all pretty complicated , I once noticed that my country of birth , country on my passport , country of residence , and country of current location were all different .
Commons categories can't really capture these kinds of details .
I never really know what " from " or " of " are supposed to mean , or if there 's any difference between them .
I suppose " Nurses in Belize " would refer to current location .
-- ghouston ( talk ) 13:29 , 23 September 2020 ( UTC ) Categories like Category : Nurses by country are generally " Nurses from X " , while " Category : People by country is " People of X " .
I suppose no real difference can be recognized .
-- ghouston ( talk ) 13:33 , 23 September 2020 ( UTC )
Generally all those categories have a mix of " from " and " in " and " of " and we try to harmonize on one , but it is a lot of work .
When a new category is created , " Occupation from / of / in X " , it is almost random which one the editor chooses , and we start all over again .
-- RAN ( talk ) 01:11 , 24 September 2020 ( UTC )
Does this mean that the category should contains nurses from as well as in and of the country ?
I 'd prefer that to be stated explicitly in a category description – preferably in all those categories but at least in a root category at suitable level .
– LPfi ( talk ) 09:55 , 24 September 2020 ( UTC )
Some developed countries seem to import a large fraction of their nurses from poorer countries .
I suppose they can apply for citizenship eventually , depending on the country .
The problem with citizenship is that the information is n't always publicly available , and guessing is a common practice .
-- ghouston ( talk ) 22:10 , 24 September 2020 ( UTC )
' Nurses of ' seems preferable , as the location is usually more significant and easier to determine than current or original nationality .
' Of ' is preferable to ' in ' as it allows for nurses working in military units or in disaster relief to be categorised under the nationality of their organisation , irrespective of the location .

Currently it 's marked as CC - BY - SA 3.0 , but without other evidence that the original author wanted to give it that license , making me think the CC license was added in confusion .
Could the current license template be removed and replaced , or is that bad practice ?
Thanks !

It is an interesting thing , when a potentially public domain file is distributed under a free licence .
Normally I leave the licence be .
The point is that in some countries there are laws like " sweat of the brow " , which protect the work based on the difficulty that the person went through when creating it and not based on creativity of the outcome .
Let 's say that in order to make Allen Matkins logo somebody has sat there and edited the image pixel by pixel , that might qualify the work for copyright protection in those jurisdictions .
We currently do not have " fall back " system in place , which would allow to say something like " This work is in public domain , but if that fails it is also released under a free licence " .
However , in this particular case it is even more difficult , since in order to accept CC - BY - SA 3.0 we need evidence that the original author really did mean to place it under that licence .
And in this case I would remove the said licence , and replace the licence template with {{PD - textlogo}} , since that is actually a safer option .

Preserved in a museum [ edit ]
Good morning , dear all .
I have a question whether I can upload an image of a book cover that is preserved in a museum ( means uploading an image of a preserved book ; however it was first published in 1967 ) .
The book is historically valuable as it first described a copper - plate inscription ( inscripted between 905-935 CE ) .
And thus a copy of it's " first edition " is kept in the museum along with the copper - plate .
— Meghmollar2017 ( talk ) 03:41 , 28 September 2020 ( UTC )
A book copyrighted in 1967 undergoes no change to its copyright status because a museum preserves a copy .
- Jmabel !

I see !
Thanks a lot .

The cover of a book may not be eligible for a copyright if it is just text .
-- RAN ( talk ) 03:24 , 30 September 2020 ( UTC ) @ Richard Arthur Norton ( 1958 - ) : I have uploaded the file on local wiki .
Should it be moved to Commons ?
— Meghmollar2017 ( talk ) 16:13 , 30 September 2020 ( UTC )
I do n't see it eligible for copyright , the right side is text , the left is a rubbing of a copper plate from the 900s .
I do not see the rubbing as eligible for a new copyright .
I do not see it as a derivative work of art that would reset the copyright clock to 1967 .

Identification of individuals [ edit ]
Looking at images of people at Bagram air base , Afghanistan , many people are identified by name .
Seems a dubious practice to me .
Should we preserve anonymity of individuals , especially people who are potentially unpopular , like American soldiers ?
Any guidelines ?
Sardaka ( talk ) 08:01 , 28 September 2020 ( UTC )
There are no guidelines that directly address this .
Instead courtesy removals of information have been done when requested .
It is likely that most veterans are comfortable with photographs of them in service being a matter of public record , and in the sense of COM : IDENT , the photographs are often published by the military as public domain and at the time of publication there was no expectation of privacy .
Photographs which may ( even retrospectively ) demean identifiable people , may be anonymized or removed , depending on context .
A deletion request should be avoided if by creating it , unnecessary attention is drawn to the information or nature of photograph .
Alternative processes like email correspondence with trusted administrators , the Oversight email list , or confidential emails to OTRS , might be more suitable to assess what action is appropriate .
Files which are in use on other projects are unlikely to be removed , even at the request of the subjects , unless the case is exceptional .
My experience of these actions is as an uploader of hundreds of thousands of DOD public domain photographs , a very small number of which were both later withdrawn by the DOD and had requested courtesy removals or anonymizing actions on Commons .
We could refine IDENT , but it probably would not improve the current process .
Addendum With regard to Afghanistan specifically , refer to Commons:Country_specific_consent_requirements #Afghanistan .
Depending on the context , photographs might be challenged on that country 's more complex consent requirement , however this would not apply if the photographer was " authorized by the public authorities " , as would be the case for DOD publication .

I created Category : Tsaranoro reserve .
This is a high valley just to the east of the Andringitra National Park .
It is called the Tsaranoro valley .
I suppose the river is called the ' Tsaranoro ' river .
But I can not get any comfirmation on the maps for this or any source mentioning the local river name .
The river flows into the Zomandao river a tributairy of the Mangoky river .

PS : The File : Mangoki drainage.png is confusing as the long tributary going south is the Ihosy river ( a tributary of the Zomandao river ) and not the Zomandao river itself .

AutoWikiBrowser [ edit ]
A quick review of the archives ( Commons talk : AutoWikiBrowser ) , does not provide a discussion showing that needing authorization to use AWB was a matter of formal consensus .
This seems to have been established back in the early days , so the decision was probably down to a couple of power users thinking it was sensible .
Considering the speeds possible with VFC and cat - a - lot , it 's not clear why non -bot operators need authorization just for this , and whether it 's worth discussing a new consensus about it .
Could someone explain the history ?
Thanks -- Fæ ( talk ) 13:35 , 30 September 2020 ( UTC )
AutoWikiBrowser is a general purpose high speed editing tool , which can be used to make different types of changes , whereas VFC and cat - a - lot have more limited functions .

Live COVID - 19 trend charts for UK data [ edit ]
Example live trends for Tyne and Wear region in lockdown .
Because it was difficult to see the latest COVID case data locally , some code to query the live UK Government data ( data.gov.uk ) and put the 7 - day cumulative trend in charts has been put together .
Some selected charts at Category : COVID - 19 testing in the United Kingdom .
Interestingly , doing this has highlighted that other sources like the excellent NYTimes maps , lag the data releases at data .gov.uk by over 12 hours .
Consequently , these trend charts are significantly ahead of most national publications .
It also turns out that numbers being used by some of the press are relying on ONS population stats from the 2011 census , rather than using the most recent 2019 estimated populations of UK regions , which is what UK Gov ( and hence SAGE ) uses in their figures to determine political decisions like COVID lockdowns .
This is not significant in terms of trend , but does matter when comparing an area at " 90 cases / 100,000 " against " 120 cases / 100,000 " in the light that the Government appears to be judging anywhere over 100 cases per 100,000 in the last 7 days may need emergency measures .
It 's relatively straight forward to add more regions to the script , it 's a question of looking up the population estimates for each one , then revising the script .
Once set up , it can refresh daily as long as it's of interest , without any more volunteer time invested .
Ping me if these would be valuable , such as adding some more England regions officially entering lockdown .

Enlarge by Mary Ann Chastain , AP Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin waves to supporters after endorsing S.C. gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley , during a campaign rally at The Statehouse , Friday , May , 14 , 2010 , in Columbia , S.C. ( AP Photo / Mary Ann Chastain ) PHOENIX 
As calls spread for an economic boycott of Arizona , the state 's governor enlisted the help of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Saturday to defend a new law cracking down on illegal immigration .
Jan Brewer and Palin blamed President Barack Obama for the state law , saying the measure is Arizona 's attempt to enforce immigration laws because the federal government wo n't do it .
" It 's time for Americans across this great country to stand up and say , ' We 're all Arizonans now , ' " Palin said .
" And in clear unison we say , ' Mr. President : Do your job .
Secure our border . ' "
The former Alaska governor appeared with Brewer at a brief news conference on Saturday .
The event launched a website that Brewer said was an effort to educate America about border security and discourage an economic boycott of the state .
The site , funded by Brewer 's re-election campaign , shows pictures of Brewer and Palin and invites visitors to sign a petition opposing boycotts .
It includes a list of politicians and organizations calling for the boycotts and asks visitors to call or e-mail to " let them know that you support Arizona . "
" Our purpose today is to help the rest of the nation understand the crisis which confronts our state , " Brewer said , citing the presence of human and drug smugglers .
The immigration law takes effect July 29 unless blocked by pending court challenges .
It requires police enforcing another law to ask a person about his or her immigration status if there 's " reasonable suspicion " that the person is in the country illegally .
Being in the country illegally would become a state crime .
" I think for most American people the reaction to this would be , ' Why have n't the police already been doing that ? ' "
Palin said .
Obama and some city , state and foreign governments have condemned the law , which critics say will lead to racial profiling of Hispanics .
Brewer on Saturday reiterated her assertion that profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated .
" The president apparently considers it a wonderful opportunity to divide people along racial lines for his personal political convenience , " Brewer said .
Arizona Democratic
Party spokeswoman Jennifer Johnson said Brewer 's the one who has divided people , which she 's done by signing controversial bills , and " puts her political survival first every single day . "
" Every word she said today was crafted with her Republican primary in mind , " Johnson said .
" Arizona is just an afterthought . "
Brewer automatically became governor last year after former Gov. Janet Napolitano was appointed U.S. Homeland Security secretary .
She 's found herself rapidly thrust into an international spotlight , the subject of ridicule on the left and praised by anti-illegal immigration activists on the right .
Arizona 's law is considered the nation 's toughest crackdown on illicit border crossers .
It was pushed by illegal immigration hard - liners in the state Legislature , but Brewer has become the public face of the law since she signed it April 23 .
Her decision to sign it , announced in a nationally televised press conference , has given Brewer traction in this year 's crowded GOP primary for governor .
Some of Brewer 's opponents say she 's not a true conservative and have hit her hard for demanding a temporary increase in the state sales tax .
Her campaign has seized on the immigration bill to bolster her conservative credentials .
Brewer and Palin refused to say whether they 'd support a guest worker program that would allow unskilled workers to temporarily work legally in the United States .
Palin is in Phoenix for a previously scheduled speech to a hunters group .
She has defended the law on national television and spoken out against boycotts .
This week she railed against a suburban Chicago high school for skipping a girls ' basketball tournament in Arizona because of concerns over the new law .
Palin said Wednesday night that people should help the Highland Park team get to Arizona even if the girls have to " go rogue . " ___ Copyright 2010 The Associated Press .

For years it has burnished a reputation as Eastern Europe 's destination of choice for stag weekends , drawing thousands of revellers in search of cheap lager , pretty girls and Kalashnikov - shooting activities .
But Latvia is fast carving a new identity as a corporate hotbed in which a rising female workforce is intrinsically programmed to thrive .
A new book claims that 41 per cent of the country 's executives are women , the largest proportion in Europe and six percentage points more than in the UK .
The figure reflects a management style pervasive in Latvia that an author argues is fuelling the success of women in the workplace .
" In Britain there is still a glass ceiling in relation to what many women can achieve .
A major factor holding them back are job criteria rooted in male - typical rather than female - typical behaviours , " says Gloria Moss , author of Profiting from Diversity : The Business Advantages and the Obstacles to Achieving Diversity .
" In Latvia , there is an acceptance that people - focused styles of transformational management bring significant benefits . "
The consensus , she argues , is that Latvia offers fewer barriers to success for women , thanks to their penchant for " transformational management " , which is focused on amplifying the individual talents of a workforce , fostering close communication and empowering individuals to perform in structures that are largely meritocratic .
The " more male " alternative , she says , is " transactional management " , which reflects a more traditional power structure that fosters top - down leadership , and is part of the reason why certain firms are unable to break out of a male - dominated workforce .
The book claims that Latvia offers a " rare glimpse of how women manage when freed of the constraints of being a minority " .
In addition to achieving higher levels of university enrolment and further education than their male counterparts , Latvian women occupy some of the highest positions in the country .
The author argues today , on International Women 's Day , that Latvia boasts " a legacy of strong women " with folklore punctuated by powerful women , and " families in which men were not at the apex " .
" This is ... indicative of a pervasive culture in Latvian business , " says Ms Moss .
" With women approaching parity in the Latvian workforce , transformational relationships are lived and practised almost unconsciously " she says .
" This influences selection criteria and unconsciously becomes a self - replicating mindset that fosters female success . "
Famous " transformational " female managers include Jacqueline Gold , the founder and chief executive of Ann Summers , whose women - only parties business was one of the enduring business successes of the past two decades .
Other leading women include Shaa Wasmund , online entrepreneur and the founder of mykindaplace.com , and Indra Nooyi , the chief executive of Pepsi .
Ms Moss says : " These are people with a strong sense of vision , with skills to communicate and empower as well as take a day - to - day interest in the individuals within a business . "

* JACQUELINE GOLD
Perturbed by the sleaziness of the sex industry , Jacqueline Gold 's visit to a Tupperware party in 1981 alerted her to the potential of selling lingerie and sex toys to women within their homes .
She launched the Ann Summers Party Plan , a home marketing plan with a strict " no men allowed " policy , which has since entered British culture .
With an estimated turnover of £ 117 m in 2008 , the Ann Summers Group ranks as one of the most successful and profitable private companies in Britain .

But some of the most pointed criticism in Hockeimer 's report seemed aimed at DiMedio and the technology staffers below her who set up and managed the system .

The following is based off a speech given at the Palm Desert Tax Day Tea Party on April 15 , 2010
There are a few core beliefs that guide me in everything I do as the founder of the Tenth Amendment Center :
Rights are not granted  to us by the government — they are ours by our very nature , by our birthright .
ALL just political authority is derived from the people — and government exists solely with our consent !
We the people of the several states created the federal government — not the other way around !
The Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that which has been delegated by the people to the federal government in the Constitution — and nothing more .
The People of each State have the sole and exclusive right and power to govern themselves in all areas not delegated to their government .
A Government without limits is a tyranny !
!
When Congress enacts laws and regulations that are not made in Pursuance of the powers enumerated in the Constitution , the People are not bound to obey them .
These seven items are about sovereignty , which is something we hear about quite a bit lately — but few really understand .
Sovereignty is defined as final authority .
All through history , this final authority was in the hands of just one or two people — a king , a queen , or even just a small cabal of elites at the top of the food chain .
But the founders and ratifiers gave us something unique in history — a first , really .
They created a system where the average people — you and I — held final authority .
We the people are sovereign .
We the people hold final authority .
We the people are in charge .
And , they the government work for us !
The Tenth Amendment codifies in law this principle of popular sovereignty — that  We the People of the several states created the federal government to be our agent for certain , enumerated purposes — and nothing more .
But unfortunately , that ’s not how things have been working , and very little that the government does is actually authorized by the constitution .
And , this is a problem that did n’t just start in January 2009 — it ’s been going on a long , long time .

Question —
What do we do about it ?
Do we call and email our representatives in Congress and ask them to limit their own power ?
Do we march on D.C. and demand that the government limit its own power ?
Do we sue them in their own courts and ask their judges to limit their power ?
Do we vote the bums out in 2010 , or 2012 — and ask new politicians to limit their own power ?
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both warned us that if the federal government ever became the sole and exclusive arbiter of the extent of its own powers — that power would endlessly grow regardless of elections , separation of powers , courts , or other vaunted parts of our system .
Guess what — they were right .
For a hundred years , we the people have been suing , and marching , and lobbying , and voting the bums out — but yet year in and year out , government continues to grow and your liberty continues to diminish — and it does n’t matter who is the president , or what political party controls congress — the growth of power in the federal government never stops .
The problem we face today is not about personalities or political parties — it ’s about power .
Until we address the absolute fact that the federal government has too much power , things will never change .
Question —
What do we do about it ?
Jefferson and Madison gave us the answer .
In response to the unconstitutional attacks on liberty that were the Alien and Sedition Acts , they secretly authored the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 .
Here are a few excerpts that really define exactly how things are supposed to work when two or more branches of the federal government conspire against the constitution and your liberty .
the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government
whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force .
where powers are assumed [ by the federal government ] which have not been delegated [ by the Constitution ] , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy
So while it might be important to call , petition , demand , march , sue and vote bums out , because they ’re all bums , there ’s much more we ’re supposed to do .
When the federal government violates your rights , you ’re not supposed to wait four years for new politicians in the hope that they ’ll fix it .
You ’re not supposed to wait two , or four , or more years for some black - robed judge to pronounce that they ’ve violated your rights .
You are supposed to resist those violations of your liberty as they happen — and it is your state ’s solemn duty to do the same .
New Movement
While such a task might seem daunting , it ’s something that ’s already happening today , and has been growing in recent years too .
In 2007 , one state rep in Maine introduced a non-binding resolution opposing the REAL ID Act .
In 2008 , one state rep in Oklahoma introduced a simple non-binding resolution reaffirming the Constitution as defined by the 10th amendment , .
In 2009 , one state rep in Montana introduced a bill to nullify some federal gun laws and regulations .
In 2009 , one state rep in Arizona introduced a state constitutional amendment to effectively ban a national health care plan in that state .

These simple , single acts by courageous people have grown into a state - level resistance to unconstitutional federal acts the likes this country has possibly never seen .
Here at the Tenth Amendment Center we have released model legislation for you to give to your state reps to demand that they stand with you and refuse to comply with unconstitutional acts from Washington D.C.
Our latest ?
The Federal Health Care Nullification Act .
This Act is not over 1000 pages .
It ’s not 500 pages .
It ’s not a dozen , or even two .
It ’s one single page to nullify now .
Here ’s a majority of what it says :
The Legislature of the State of _______________ declares that the federal law known as the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ,  signed by President Barack Obama on March 23 , 2010 , is not authorized by the Constitution of the United States and violates its true meaning and intent as given by the Founders and Ratifiers , and is hereby declared to be invalid in this state , shall not be recognized by this state , is specifically rejected by this state , and shall be considered null and void and of no effect in this state .

Any official , agent , or employee of the United States government or any employee of a corporation providing services to the United States government that enforces or attempts to enforce an act , order , law , statute , rule or regulation of the government of the United States in violation of this act shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ( $ 5,000.00 ) , or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five ( 5 ) years , or both .
They want to fine us or put us in jail for not buying insurance from some corporation .
What ’s next — fining us for not buying a Chevy ?
Well , it ’s time that we turn this thing around — and in the federal health care nullification act — we fine THEM for violating our rights !
While this may seem difficult to accomplish — or even insurmountable — if we do nothing , or if we even do the same things we ’ve been doing , we ’re doomed to failure
But if we do what ’s right , we will succeed !
Samuel Adams put it best :
 It does not require a majority to prevail , but rather an irate , tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people ’s minds . 
Question :
What do we do about it ?
Step one is to sign on in support the Federal Health Care Nullification Act.
WeRefuse.com is a new website ( and the only one that I ’m aware of ) dedicated solely to nullifying national health care on a state level .
Join us in our first goal of 100,000 to stop national health care laws today !
Let ’s make this work and then we can use it as a model for every other constitutional violation coming out of D.C .

A business inadvertently gives you counterfeit money — are you stuck with it ?
In most cases , yes .
But what if that business happens to be a branch of the federal government ?
Los Angeles resident David Lipin found himself asking this question the other day after he cashed a $ 1,000 Postal Service money order at a West Hollywood post office .
He said the postal worker handed him 10 $ 20 bills and eight $ 100 bills .
Lipin , 43 , said he then stopped at a nearby gas station to fill his tank .
He tried to pay with one of his new $ 100 bills .
Advertisement
“ The clerk took a close look at it and said it was fake , ” Lipin told me .
“ Then she looked at some of the other $ 100 bills .
She said they were fake too , and she called the police . ”
Alarmed , Lipin phoned a lawyer friend .
At his friend ’s urging , he too called the Los Angeles Police Department to report that he ’d been given bogus bills .
“ I wanted it very clear that I was a victim and not someone trying to pawn off some counterfeit dollars , ” Lipin said .
The cops arrived at the gas station and inspected the cash .
They shook their heads .
“ The police said the $ 100 bills were actually $ 5 bills that had been bleached and altered , ” Lipin recalled .
“ They showed me how you could hold them up to the light and see Abraham Lincoln ’s face .
All eight turned out to be counterfeit . ”
Advertisement
So now what ?
The police took a report but said they could n’t do anything .
They suggested that Lipin try the L.A. County Sheriff ’s Department , which serves West Hollywood .
A sheriff ’s deputy also said they could n’t do much and suggested he try the Secret Service .
So did the post office when Lipin returned to the same branch that had given him the funny money .
“ We do n’t have anything in our regulations to address this , ” said Richard Maher , a spokesman for the Postal Service .
He added that even though Lipin has a receipt showing he cashed his money order at the post office , it ’s impossible to verify that he received the bogus bills in the transaction .
“ What if he got them after he left the post office ? ” Maher asked .
Advertisement
The Secret Service was sympathetic toward Lipin ’s situation .
But an agent basically told him he was out of luck .
Unless an investigation turned up a counterfeiting mastermind , the buck would stop with Lipin .
“ Unfortunately , counterfeit money is like a hot potato , ” said Wayne Williams , deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service ’s L.A. office .
“ Whoever ends up with it last is the victim . ”
Well , yes , but Lipin got his bogus cash from the U.S. Postal Service , redeeming a Postal Service money order .
Should n’t Uncle Sam bear some responsibility ?
“ Not really , ” Williams replied .
“ The post office operates as a business .
It takes in money from customers .
Postal workers do n’t really have special equipment or training to spot counterfeit bills .
Unless they ’re in on it , this is n’t their responsibility . ”
Advertisement
So Lipin is hosed ?
“ He ’s hosed . ”
Williams advised anyone who receives questionable cash to stop by a bank and ask what the money pros have to say .
If a bill is indeed counterfeit , contact the Secret Service and turn it in to authorities .
Maybe they ’ll be able to find out where it came from , maybe not .
And do n’t try and be clever by spending the bogus bill elsewhere — passing the hot potato to someone else , as it were .

“ If you tried to cash a bill you were told was fake , you could be arrested , ” Williams warned .
We ’re talking a felony , by the way , punishable by up to 20 years in prison .
Public transit
I asked readers to contact Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa with their thoughts on my recent columns on public transportation .
He received hundreds of e-mails expressing frustration with our current transit system and commuters ’ hopes for improvement .
Advertisement
And he wasted no time in responding .
Villaraigosa submitted a motion to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last week calling for steps to create daily and weekly EZ Passes good for all transit systems in the county , as well as a better sales network so that commuters can readily find the passes if they want them .
The mayor called for the MTA to improve its website and wireless offerings to help commuters navigate regional transit systems and make the best use of the bus and rail network .
He also wants the MTA ’s leaders to sit down with their counterparts at Metrolink to finally hash out ways to avoid duplication in services and thus allocate scant financial resources more effectively .
Advertisement
Separately , Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich submitted an amendment to Villaraigosa ’s motion that would direct the MTA to look into distance - and time - based pricing — that is , setting fares according to the number of miles traveled and when you ’re using public transit .
If much of this sounds familiar , it ’s because they were among the suggestions I made in my column and that readers said they supported .
“ It ’s not enough to build new rail lines and a sustainable transit network , ” Villaraigosa said .
“ We also need to provide the highest level of customer convenience and service for our riders .
Making transfers between lines easier and taking advantage of technology are just two ways we can better serve and attract riders . ”
Art Leahy , chief executive of the MTA , told me he expected the transit agency ’s board to approve the mayor ’s motion and Antonovich ’s amendment Thursday and for work on the measures to begin immediately .
Advertisement
“ This is completely feasible , ” he said .
“ We should do these things . ”
We should , and it ’s great to see city and county officials at last getting serious about public transit .
But the real heavy lifting is still ahead — gas taxes , parking fees , congestion pricing , elevated rails .
I ’ll keep you posted .

Want an expert lesson in how to respond without actually responding and how to apologize without saying you 're sorry ?
Then you need to read Facebook CEO Mark Zukerberg 's quasi-mea culpa in today 's Washington Post .
Do it now ; I 'll wait .
Zuckerberg 's essay comes after more than a month of near silence as Facebook 's foes piled on about the social network 's rapidly evaporating privacy protections .
Until today , the only official response had been from Facebook spokesmodel Eliott Schrage , who tried to deflect the bullets via a smarmy PR session in the New York Times that even Microsoft would find embarrassing .
[ Also on InfoWorld : Cringley laid out the five lessons Facebook needs to learn and warned " Facebook wants to control the Web , like it or not . " | Stay up to date on all Robert X. Cringely 's observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Zucky started the ball rolling yesterday with an email he sent to blogging doyenne Robert Scoble in which he admits to making " a bunch of mistakes " recently , without detailing what those mistakes were .
In his Post piece , Zuckerberg also says Facebook " missed the mark " ( if not the Mark ) but failed to elaborate how , beyond admitting that users find Facebook 's privacy controls hopelessly complicated .
( The snarks at eSarcasm have a NSFW version of Zuckerberg 's essay ; I suspect it 's closer to how he really feels . )
Maybe he 's just forgotten .

Caffeine in Tea
Is there caffeine in tea ?
What are the benefits and side effects of it ?
And the most important question of all ... how much caffeine content is in your cup of tea ?
These are all perfectly valid questions that need to be answered especially if you are sensitive to caffeinated drinks .
Come and learn about the caffeine levels in tea !
How Much Caffeine is in Your Tea Cup ?
As you may know there are four main types of tea – black tea , green tea , white tea and oolong tea .
While you may be conscious that black tea has caffeine , you may be unaware that there is caffeine in green tea and all other types of tea , too .
So next time you find yourself unable to sleep at night , you should look at how much tea you have been drinking .
So remember , all teas contain caffeine .
Yes , there is even caffeine in white tea .
What determines the level of caffeine in tea
Measured by weight , tea leaves contain , on average , 3 % of caffeine , but the numbers vary according to soil chemistry , type of tea plant , how they were cultivated and processed or altitude .
The size of the leaf is also quite important to determine the quantity of caffeine in tea .
For example , if you have the chance to drink the brew from the leaves of the Assam tea plant , also known as camellia assamica , more caffeine content will be released in your cup , due to its larger leaves .
On the other hand , camellia sinensis , the Chinese tea plant , is smaller ; therefore , its caffeine content is lower .
It ’s not possible to determine exactly the amount of caffeine in each type of tea , because there are so many variables to consider in each tea produced , but we can give you an idea of …
… how much caffeine you are consuming per cup of tea .
Type of Tea Caffeine in Tea
( per 8 oz or approx . 240 ml or 1 teacup )
Black tea 25 - 110 mg Oolong tea 12 - 55 mg Green tea 8 - 36 mg
White tea 6 - 25 mg
Water temperature and steeping time also influence the amount of caffeine in tea .
The longer you steep your tea and the hotter your water temperature is , the more caffeine is released into your cup .
That is one of the reasons green and white teas have lower caffeine content .
They are both very delicate and steeped for shorter times at cooler temperatures to protect the leaves and flavour .
Keep in mind that when brewing your leaves several times , the quantity of caffeine in tea will diminish .
Caffeine Benefits
If you just love the thrill caffeine gives you then do n’t worry .
Yes , the caffeine in tea , when consumed in recommended amounts , has actually several health benefits that we are pleased to show you .
Coffee Alternative
Do you feel like caffeine is your best friend in those difficult mornings you just want to stay in bed and sleep ?
Does it help you get through your day ?
Caffeine may be a great ally and tea offers a wonderful coffee alternative when it comes to giving you the energy boost you need in the morning .
Caffeine in tea will allow you to stay alert and focused throughout your day .
Next time you are enjoying your breakfast try drinking a cup of tea instead of coffee .
Caffeine in tea will be progressively released into your system during the day , so you wo n’t be feeling the constant need to have another cup .
Keep your energy and focus all day and enjoy one the best pleasures of life !
Protecting Your Heart
When consumed wisely , caffeine is a healthy stimulant that may help your heart gain strength and vitality .
Caffeine combined with the amazing antioxidants in tea protects your heart and helps it fight cardiovascular diseases .
Burn Fat , Build Muscle

Imagine you are planning to work out : try drinking a couple of cups of tea before leaving .
Caffeine combined with its powerful antioxidants will help you burn fat and build muscle in a healthy way .
Pain Alleviation
The caffeine in tea not only has the ability to increase the efficiency of pain killers but it is also considered a strong pain reliever for problems like migraines or exhaustion .
If you are feeling tired or sensing one of those terrible headaches coming , grab a cup of tea and enjoy it .
Push pain aside and let this pleasure embrace and protect you .
Have you tried meditation ?
Combine a relaxing moment with a cup of tea .
There are many other benefits of having caffeine in tea such as :
It may help reduce the risk of Parkinson ’s disease .
It may improve your memory by enhancing the growth of brain cells .
It may prevent muscle damage and increase muscle strength .
Caffeine Side Effects
Caffeine is , indeed , an important compound in tea that helps and protects you in many ways .
However , it also has a down side to it as you can see below :
Disturbs Your Sleep
If you are sensitive to caffeine , you should n’t drink tea or any other drink that contains caffeine close to your bedtime .
It will lengthen the time you take to fall asleep .
Drink tea during the day .
It is safer .
Do n’t forget that tea , besides containing caffeine , also has an important amino acid named theanine , which has the ability to relax you .
And if by chance you are looking for a natural sedative to help you sleep , stay in our tea world .
Valerian tea may be the right tea for you .
Natural , inexpensive and a great insomnia help .
It can help you sleep and do much more for you and your family in terms of rest and relaxation .
Caffeine and Pregnancy
If you are expecting or breastfeeding you must reduce your caffeine intake to one or two cups of tea per day .
Caffeine consumption has been associated with prematurity , poorer reflexes or under weight babies .
It may also reduce foliate level and lead to neural birth tube defects .
So be sure to always consult your doctor about this to find out what is best for you and the bouncing baby that is making its way into your life .
Excessive Intake of Caffeine
Now this is the big drawback about caffeine in tea .
If you consume high amounts of caffeine you may experience some unpleasant side effects such as : restlessness , headaches , agitation , tremors , panic attacks , nausea or vomiting .
You will increase your blood pressure and heart rate , which may lead to cardiovascular diseases .
Keep it simple .
Do n’t overdo it .
Go back up and check out our table again , choose white tea and do n’t be afraid to go herbal !
Most herbal teas have no caffeine content .
Check out the stimulating powers of tulsi tea ( also known as holy basil ) .
Tea vs. Coffee
Tea and Coffee have been a part of our lives for a long time .
However , if you are planning to choose your daily drink for health reasons , you should go with tea .
Despite its caffeine content , tea offers you a wide range of antioxidants , minerals and vitamins that linger in your mouth every sip you take .
Tea is known for its ability to fight cancer , to reduce cardiovascular diseases or to be a natural rejuvenator due to its famous antioxidants .
Coffee , besides its caffeine content , does n’t offer you these health benefits .
It is a much dangerous stimulant and it is addictive .

Fifty - year - old Midtowner Stan Green contracted HIV in 1993 , and he now relies on a daily cocktail of medications to keep him healthy .
But despite all the drugs he 's been prescribed , Green continues to suffer from a lack of appetite and chronic pain from neuropathy in his legs and stomach .
That is , unless he smokes marijuana .
" Without pot , I do n't want to eat .
I have to force myself to eat , and then it tears up my stomach , " said Green , whose name has been changed here to protect his identity .
Though Green 's mother is now aware of his marijuana use , he hid it from her for years .
Once , while visiting her , he went a week without pot and lost 11 pounds .
If medical marijuana were legal in Tennessee , Green would be a prime candidate for a prescription .
Even Green 's physician , who has known about his pot habit since 2003 , supports his use of marijuana to treat his lack of appetite and pain .
Though medical marijuana in Tennessee is still a long shot , the state 's Safe Access to Medical Cannabis Act — co-sponsored by state representative Jeanne Richardson and state senator Beverly Marrero , both of Memphis — recently saw the most movement it's had since some form of medical pot legislation was proposed years ago .
In late April , the House Committee on Health and Human Resources unanimously voted to establish a task force to study the issue of legalizing medical marijuana .
The task force must report back to the legislature with recommendations by or before February 2011 .
" All the advocates are very excited , because we 've never had anything go even that far , " Richardson said .
Included in the task force are members of the state Board of Pharmacy , the Board of Medical Examiners , the Department of Health , the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation , the Tennessee Sheriff 's Association , and the Department of Agriculture .
" This is very important .
If we use a geographical line , like the Mason - Dixon Line , there are not many examples of movement [ in the South ] with medical marijuana bills despite years of their introduction , " said Allen St. Pierre , executive director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
Since 1996 , 14 states — most of them in the West — have legalized marijuana for medical use .
In California and Colorado , where medical pot was approved by ballot initiatives rather than legislation , laws are fairly lax .
Patients are prescribed medical marijuana for anything from cancer and HIV to anxiety or a bum knee .
Tennessee 's model is strict by comparison .
If passed , qualifying patients would need to be diagnosed with specific serious illnesses , including cancer , glaucoma , HIV or AIDS , and Hepatitis C. Consideration also would be given to people with severe nausea , seizures , wasting syndrome , and other chronic conditions .
Those approved for the program would be issued an identification card .
" It 's very tightly controlled in terms of the growing , the production , the processing , and the distribution , " Richardson said .
" In crafting the bill , we tried to avoid all of the obvious abuses of California and Colorado .
Those places are now passing bills to regulate after the fact .
It really was sort of the wild , wild West . "
St. Pierre says the stricter Tennessee model is the norm for pending legislation these days .
" Access for patients to whole , smoked marijuana probably hit its zenith in the second week of January this year , " St. Pierre said .
" After New Jersey passed medical marijuana laws not allowing home cultivation and restricting who can access it , almost every state that did n't have legislation in the hopper is attracted to the restricted model . "
" States will go from allowing people to use marijuana for chronic pain and mental illness , which is a big catch - all , to restricting them down to the big five — cancer , AIDS , glaucoma , epilepsy , and multiple sclerosis , " St. Pierre said .
Though St. Pierre says the more restrictive model is n't ideal for all patients , he admits that more conservative states , like Tennessee , may stand a better chance at passing stricter legislation .
" It has to be so restrictive that many of us are not exactly keen on it , but we recognize the need for political expediency to at least establish some baseline of legal protection for patients , " St. Pierre said .
Although medical marijuana has been legal in some states for 14 years , the federal government still considers marijuana a Schedule I narcotic , meaning it 's been determined to have no medical value .
During the Bush years , federal raids on state - approved growers were common , but the Obama administration has stated publicly that it will not seek to arrest medical marijuana users and suppliers , as long as they conform to state guidelines .
" That has allowed for the promulgation and explosion at the state level , because states no longer fear the federal government coming in , " St. Pierre said .
A prime example is Denver .
Though Colorado voters passed an amendment allowing medical marijuana use in 2000 , the medical pot dispensary business did n't explode until the past year .
The boom is attributed to both the Obama administration 's policy and a Colorado state ruling allowing medical marijuana care - givers to have more patients .
" We did a big story on the [ medical marijuana ] industry in February 2009 , when there were maybe a dozen dispensaries [ in Denver ] , " said Patricia Calhoun , editor of Denver 's alt - weekly newspaper , Westword .
" By July , they were exploding so fast .
The city of Denver has at least 250 dispensaries . "
That change has translated into a boom in advertising revenue for Westword , a free ad - supported newsweekly similar to the Memphis Flyer .
A recent issue of Westword had nine pages of advertisements for local cannabis clubs .
The paper 's website even features weekly reviews of pot dispensaries in its " Mile Highs and Lows " blog , with one reporter solely dedicated to trying out different strains of medical - grade pot .
The economic impact of medical marijuana legislation also is a factor in its revival by state legislators .
Denver 's dispensary boom came during one of the worst national recessions in history .
" In the last several years , we 've had empty storefronts [ in Denver ] , and no one was moving in , " Calhoun said .
" Then all of a sudden , real estate agents were discovering they could lease [ to dispensaries ] . "
Earlier this month , the Oakland East Bay Express newspaper reported that California 's Board of Equalization has collected between $ 50 million and $ 100 million in sales taxes per year from medical cannabis dispensaries .
" During these wrenching economic times , this is definitely catching the bean counters ' and the politicians ' attention , " St. Pierre said .
Regardless of the economic impact , seriously ill patients like Green would love to see legal medical marijuana become a reality in Tennessee .
Green says he 's tired of worrying about being caught with an illegal drug that he considers essential medicine .
Though Richardson doubts the bill will pass anytime soon , she thinks the legislature is inching closer , and she has noticed an overall change in attitude toward medical pot .
" Most reasonable people think medical marijuana is fine , " Richardson said .
" You almost never hear anyone talking about marijuana being a gateway drug anymore , because it 's not .
A lot of the old - fashioned rhetoric is dying off . "

To quote an over - used phrase , these are tough economic times , and a girl 's got to do what a girl 's got to do .
We interviewed a female pot dealer — who for obvious reasons did n't want her name revealed — on the ins and outs of the business .
Why did you start selling marijuana ?
About five years ago , I was having trouble paying bills , even though I was working about 30 hours a week at my job .
I was going to college , and an opportunity arose where I could sell .
At the time , I had credit card bills , so it was about the money .
Plus , I smoked weed too , and I could n't afford to buy it .
This way I had weed for free and , in turn , I 'd make a little profit .
Now you 're out of college and working a corporate day job .
How does selling pot affect your income these days ?
Would you be able to live the life you want without that extra income ?
Now the money that I make from my day job pays my bills .
Without the extra money that I make from selling , I would n't have any money for gas or lunch or going out for drinks .
Tennessee has pretty strict pot laws .
Do you ever worry about the risk ?
There are the obvious concerns with not wanting to get caught .
I do n't want to go to jail or have to pay any fines .
I do n't like to have to worry about picking it up and having to drive it back to my house .
Anytime I have it in my car , there 's a concern .
But I do n't ever have that much on me at one time .
Do you think you 'd lose your job if you were busted ?
When I first started , I had a bullshit job , and it really did n't matter .
The people who worked with me all smoked , and I did n't have any concerns , because those people knew what was up and it did n't matter .
But now I definitely can't let on to anyone at work that I do this as a side job .
Have you ever had customers who bought pot from you for medical reasons ?
Yes , I had one who was HIV positive and needed it to have an appetite .
Other people use it for anxiety and stress , even if that 's not technically a medical issue .
What 's it like being a female pot dealer in a male - dominated workforce ?
I never put myself in a situation where I feel like there 's going to be physical danger .
I 'm friends with the people I get it from .
You have to keep a trusted network .
Does being a female pot dealer make you feel hardcore ?
I always feel hardcore .
But there 's a little bit of celebrity associated with it .
You have what people need , and you 're cool .
You 're definitely popular .
A friend with weed is a friend indeed .

Tennessee state laws against recreational use remain strict .
Rhodes College graduate Jeff Carney had hopes of using his psychology degree to pursue a career as a youth counselor , but a misdemeanor pot charge from 2006 is holding him back .
Carney was busted breaking up a small amount of marijuana — a couple of grams — to smoke in a park in his hometown of Smyrna , Tennessee .
" It was right before school started , so I was back home .
I had to go back to Smyrna after school started for the court date , and they gave me 11 months and 29 days of probation , " Carney said .
After graduation , Carney moved to Nashville , where he applied for a job with Youth Villages .
Though he failed to mention the drug charge on his application , he felt mentioning it during his job interview was the responsible thing to do .
He was then told Youth Villages would not be able to hire him .
Had Carney been busted in Mississippi , where 30 grams or less has essentially been decriminalized for first - time possession , he would have gotten off with a ticket .
Such a charge in Mississippi is treated like a minor traffic violation .
Unfortunately for Carney , Tennessee boasts stricter marijuana laws , with a first - time conviction for any amount of marijuana resulting in a mandatory minimum fine of $ 250 .
Convictions cannot be expunged in Tennessee without a dismissal , meaning even a small misdemeanor pot possession can remain on one 's record for life .
Carney was told his record could not be expunged .
Delivery or sale of more than half an ounce ( that 's two quarter bags of marijuana ) is considered a felony in Tennessee .
" I 'd say Tennessee is probably average , compared to what 's around us .
Some states are a little better , and some are worse , " said criminal defense attorney T. Clifton Harviel , who often represents marijuana offenders in federal court .
" We are not one of the more progressive states . "
Tennessee is 11th in the nation for marijuana arrests and 19th in the nation in overall severity of maximum sentences for marijuana possession , according to a 2009 report from the Bulletin of Cannabis Reform .
That report also states that marijuana arrests cost $ 148 million in Tennessee in 2006 , the most recent statistics available .
From 2005 to July 2009 , Tennessee was one of several states with laws requiring drug dealers to purchase drug tax stamps from the Department of Revenue .
The law was declared unconstitutional last year , but until then , dealers who had not paid their Unauthorized Substance
Tax could be charged not only for possessing and distributing an illegal substance but also for violating state tax laws .
Recently , the Memphis Police Department ( MPD ) has been cracking down on marijuana , though police spokesperson Alyssa Moore said it 's not a concentrated effort .
Last week , the MPD seized approximately 200 pot plants and more than 47 pounds of cultivated marijuana in a raid at the Continental Apartments in Midtown .
In the first five months of 2010 , the MPD seized nearly 950,000 grams of marijuana compared to 175,000 grams seized in all of 2009 .
They 've also confiscated 272 plants to date this year , while they only seized 52 plants in 2009 .
" At the moment , I 'd wager I 've got more pot cases than other drug cases right now , " Harviel said .
Memphis police even put a damper on the city 's unofficial " 4:20 Festival " in Overton Park in April , discouraging open marijuana use by posting officers and cameras in the park .
In years past , police have largely ignored recreational pot smokers during the annual gathering .
Meanwhile , California is looking at decriminalization of pot for recreational use .
The state has allowed legal medical pot since 1996 , and , in November , voters in California will decide whether pot should be legalized , taxed , and regulated for adults ages 21 and older .
Such a move is still inconceivable for Tennessee , but Carney 's future could have certainly benefited from more lax marijuana laws .
Not only has he had trouble finding a professional counseling job with the conviction on his record , he 's struggled finding a job at all .
" I just recently found a job as a temporary worker in a machine shop , but I have a college degree , " Carney said .
" There are people out there with [ marijuana ] charges who really want to help people , but they can't because of one little incident that happened years ago . "
Marijuana Possession Laws for the Tri-State Area
( information courtesy of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws )

• Delivery or sale of one - half ounce or more — felony Arkansas
• Possession of one ounce or less ­— misdemeanor on first conviction ( becomes a felony after subsequent convictions )
• Possession of more than one ounce — felony ( any amount over an ounce is presumed to be for sale and subject to felony charges )
Mississippi
• Possession of 30 grams or less — misdemeanor ( summons only , no arrest , no criminal record for first - time conviction )
• Possession of more than 30 grams — felony

A Conversation With Shea Flinn by Jackson Baker
For a few months in 2007 , Shea Flinn , now a member of the Memphis City Council , served as an interim appointee to the Tennessee state Senate , occupying the former seat of newly elected 9th District congressman Steve Cohen .
Like his predecessor , Flinn sponsored a bill to legalize medical marijuana , but , as Flinn puts it , " The bill did not hit committee before my Cinderella moment was up . "
Now that a similar bill is receiving serious attention in the legislature , Flinn reflected on the issue in a Q&A with the Flyer .
Flyer : Medical marijuana has been decriminalized in California and Colorado , and there are recreational prescription shops all over those states .
Might the same thing happen in Tennessee ?
Shea Flinn :
This is the problem with this issue and a lot of issues in politics .
Which is , we immediately go to the slippery slope .
Does the legalization of medical marijuana mean that people could get marijuana and use it recreationally ?
News flash : People are doing that anyway .
What we are doing by not allowing it to be used as a medicine is criminalizing the alleviation of human suffering .
And that is morally objectionable and morally wrong .
So the perceived " harm " is a complete fallacy , because there is n't a person in the city of Memphis who wants to go out and buy marijuana for recreational use who can't right now .
Yes , but they can still be prosecuted for that , can't they ?
And if you get a false prescription , you would also be breaking the law .
The number - one growth rate in drug use is for prescription drugs that are bought illegally .
There is already a huge black market .
You 've seen it with OxyContin , " hillbilly heroin . "
You see it with Lortab .
You see it with all sorts of pharmaceuticals .
At one point , in the late 1960s , there was something like $ 2.2 billion of theft attributed to drug addicts .
The problem was , in the entire United States that year , there was only $ 2 billion worth of theft crimes reported .
President Nixon had a study done as to whether it should be legalized .
And it came back and said it should .
In the 1970s !
Just like cigarettes or beer or alcohol , you do n't want this stuff targeted to kids .
But young people can go and buy illegal drugs .
There is n't a drug dealer alive who asks for an I.D .
Is there a legitimate economic future for marijuana farmers
in Tennessee ?
You can get into monetary arguments on that issue , as to whether Tennessee should try to tax marijuana as a legal cash crop or how that would affect farm subsidies in the future .
California , I know , is looking at it .
And that 's going to be the domino .
They 're five years ahead of the curve .
If you could n't grow marijuana in the ground , if you had to develop it in a laboratory and spend millions of dollars on R and D and turn it into a pill , so that a pharmaceutical company could make money off of it , it would be legal .
It would be prescribable .
Should marijuana use be fully legalized ?
There are a lot of advocates who are for legalizing marijuana and treating it like beer or anything like that .
And while I do n't disagree with them , I think that is a much lower priority .
The medical marijuana issue , at its core , is that people are suffering with chronic disease , chronic pain , and we have a cheap , effective way to treat it .
And the government is saying no , you will go to jail for alleviating your pain .
How can we live with ourselves as a society on this , how can we rationalize this ?
Will marijuana eventually be fully legalized ?
You have to get to the Voltairean point that " nothing is stronger than an idea whose time has come . "
I do n't think we 're quite there yet , but it is a war of attrition , because generationally marijuana is viewed so differently than in the " reefer madness " days of the 1930s .
At some point there will be a majority in favor of legalization .
Will it happen ?
Yes .
Lee “ Rosy Rosenberg , ” who accompanied Obama to Israel during his campaign , takes over on Sunday as the new president of AIPAC .
Lee “ Rosy ” Rosenberg , a jazz recording industry veteran capitalist who accompanied U.S. President Barack Obama on his campaign trip to Israel two years ago , takes over on Sunday as the new president of American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Rosenberg also served on the president ’s national campaign finance committee .
The new AIPAC president hails from Chicago , the home state of President Obama , and also is on first - name terms with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod , President Obama ’s senior advisor .
Steve Rosen , a former 23 - year , high - ranking AIPAC official , told the Chicago Tribune , “ I do n't think AIPAC has made any secret of the reality that his friendship with the president played a role in Rosy 's rise .
He 's a guy who works very hard at fundraising [ and ] in the political arena .
It was not as if he was plucked out of nowhere .
He paid his dues .
But I 'm sure nobody was blind to the fact that he 's from Chicago . “
Rosenberg is known as an expert in bringing in big money from powerful people who generally are not outwardly committed to Israel .
AIPAC claims more than 100,000 members and is considered the most powerful Jewish lobby in Washington .
It opens its annual three - day conference Sunday and will hear addresses from Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Their relationship has been sorely tested the past two weeks because of American and Arab opposition to Israel ’s building for Jews in long - established Jewish neighborhoods in parts of Jerusalem that were resorted to Israel in the Six - Day War in 1967 .
“ The fact that he [ Rosenberg ] and the president have had a relationship helps now , ” Illinois Democrat Rep. Mike Quigley told the Tribune .
Rosenberg ’s ventures have included real estate , a music recording company , and high - tech startups and investing in jazz documentaries .
He replaces Michigan - based David Victor , who recently signed an AIPAC letter asking Congress to “ demand ” that the Obama administration " enforce existing sanctions law and impose crippling new sanctions on Iran . "
Evangelicals urge caution in wake of Morocco expulsions
A delegation of evangelical church leaders visiting Morocco urged Representative Frank Wolf on Friday to postpone hearings on the recent expulsion of Christians .
" We believe it is too early to hold hearings because much more time is needed to determine facts and to give this issue the attention it deserves , " said the Rev Dr David Anderson , spokesman for the delegation .
A hearing , led by Wolf , is scheduled for June 17 to look into the " harsh nature " of the expulsions of more than 40 Christians – some of whom are US citizens – who were accused of proselytising .
Wolf said in a statement Thursday that he has been working with Moroccan and US officials over the last two months in an attempt to find a satisfactory solution but the " Moroccan government seems unwilling to compromise " .
" I feel it is my responsibility to speak out about the human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Moroccan government , " he stated .
Proselytism is illegal in the predominantly Muslim country .
Though Morocco has been recognised for its religious tolerance and freedom , many Christians expressed concern in recent months with what some believe to be a national crackdown against Christians .
Among those ordered to leave the country were 16 Christians from the Village of Hope who were taking care of 33 orphaned and abandoned children .
The workers had been serving as foster parents for some 10 years with the full knowledge of the government and were shocked by the sudden expulsion in March .
They refuted proselytism claims and maintained that they have abided by the law .
According to Wolf , 10 additional foreign nationals were asked to leave the country earlier this week .
The congressman noted that Moroccan authorities have refused to turn over any evidence or offer any explanation of the proselytism charges .
Along with scheduling a hearing , Wolf has also called on the US State Department and the White House to raise the issue with Moroccan authorities .
But a group of evangelicals who have been talking with government officials and church leaders in Morocco say investigating the matter publicly could do more harm than good .
The five - member team went to Morocco to " quietly pursue a better understanding of the complex circumstances surrounding these deeply troubling events " and so far found that Christians were not the only ones expelled .
Recent deportations have also involved " at least as many Muslims as non-Muslims " , said Anderson .
With that , and also considering the value of the relationship between the US and Morocco , the delegation urged Wolf to delay any action .
" It ’s not in anyone ’s best interests to explore details of these allegations publicly , " Anderson stressed from the capital of Rabat on Friday .
" This is better handled discretely and sensitively , especially considering the large number of Christians that live in Morocco . "
According to the delegation , the Moroccan government has issued an invitation to U.S. congressional members and evangelical leaders to visit Morocco and discuss the situation .
In addition to Anderson , who is senior pastor of Faith Baptist Church in Sarasota , Florida , members of the delegation include : the Rev Dr Kenneth Barney of New Antioch Baptist Church in Randallstown , Md. , the Rev. Patrick J Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition , the Rev Dr Rob Schenck of National Clergy Council , and the Rev Dr Harry Thomas of Come Alive International .
Last night there was a bomb scare in Times Square , New York , that was less a scare than an actual , you know , bomb .
The “ amateurish ” car bomb was an SUV carrying three canisters of propane , ten gallons of gasoline , and some fireworks .
While it ’s a bit beyond our purview to cover the event itself ( we ’ll leave it to Mediaite ) , we did notice something funky on CNN .
Weekend CNN Newsroom anchor Don Lemon was alarmed that he was unable to get a clear picture of the Times Square area on Google Earth .
After using blurred footage from Google Earth as an illustration of the tight security around the area , he asked his guest , Tom Fuentes , former FBI Assistant Director of International Relations , what this might mean .
His guest ’s answer was not exactly … well .
Informed .
Lemon : My question to Mr. Fuentes would be : what does that mean ?
What should we garner from this when this area is even blurred out on Google Earth because of this security alert ?
Fuentes : I think they do n’t want you to see exactly what kind of work they ’re doing , and also they ’re searching other parts of the area just to be safe .
Most of you are probably already screaming this in your heads , so , in unison everyone :
Google Earth images are not in real time !
So , there ’s no reason to blur the area for a temporary high security situation .
Those pictures were taken months ago .
Feeling any better ?
I was , until I remembered that Tom Fuentes is a former FBI Assistant Director .

Microsoft to award cash and software to support programs for veterans .
REDMOND , Wash .
- Microsoft Corp. today announced that it is inviting organizations to submit proposals for the Elevate America Veterans Initiative , which focuses on giving veterans and their spouses the technology skills and support resources they need to be successful in todays civilian work force .
Through a competitive request for proposal ( RFP ) process , Microsoft will award cash , software and IT skills training curriculum to eligible veterans service organizations , work - force agencies , as well as other nonprofit organizations and their partners that are providing veterans and their spouses with the support they need to be successful in their transition to civilian careers .
Support provided by these organizations may include technology skills training , job placement , career counseling and other support services such as childcare , transportation and housing .
Organizations have until June 30 , 2010 , to apply to this initiative and successful applicants will be announced in August .
The RFP is the first phase of Microsofts Elevate America Veterans Initiative , which will provide $ 2 million in cash and up to $ 6 million in software and other resources over the next two years to provide veterans and their spouses with these necessary skills and resources .
A second round of the competitive RFP process in 2011 will provide opportunities for the successful grantees to deepen their efforts based on results from the first phase and scale projects that have demonstrated effectiveness .
Microsoft announced the Elevate America Veterans Initiative in March as an extension of its Elevate America program , which has so far provided more than 600,000 vouchers for free technology training in 17 states and will be adopted by several more states in the coming weeks .
Since this initiative was announced , Microsoft has convened organizations serving veterans to serve on an advisory committee for the Veterans Initiative over the next two years to help provide guidance and expertise throughout this process .
Organizations on the advisory committee include The American Legion , Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America ( IAVA ) , Paralyzed Veterans of America , United Service Organizations ( USO ) , and Wounded Warrior Project .
 Our servicemen and women who are separating from the military and reintegrating into their civilian communities and the work force face a tough job market ,  said Pamela Passman , corporate vice president of Microsoft Global Corporate Affairs .
 We know that access to technology skills training combined with critical support services can help them succeed , and we look forward to partnering with organizations that can help our veterans and their spouses through innovative approaches to job training and placement . 
Successful applications will include collaborative partnerships between two or more organizations in the nonprofit , work - force development , labor and education sectors .
Applicants may request between $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 cash , not to exceed 50 percent of the total program budget , as well as software and IT skills training curriculum .
The RFP and more information are available at www.microsoft.com/veterans.
 This is a great initiative that Microsoft has come up with and complements some of our programs for veterans and their families ,  said Clarence Hill , national commander of The American Legion .
 Our Heroes to Hometowns program helps wounded veterans with their return to the civilian world , and our Operation Military Family Outreach is geared toward helping service members and their families with the same kind of transition .
Any program that helps our returning veterans find jobs in the current U.S. economy is a godsend , so were very pleased to see that the initiative includes skills training and job placement for veterans . 
 With the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan - era veterans teetering on 15 percent , this initiative could not be coming at a more critical time ,  said IAVA Founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff .
IAVA continues to be excited about this initiative and the potential for it to impact thousands of veterans nationwide .
We are thrilled to be a part of this coalition and working with Microsoft on such a critical issue . 
 Paralyzed Veterans of America is proud to partner with Microsoft to elevate employment opportunities for the men and women who have served and sacrificed , and to help dramatically reduce the 85 percent unemployment rate for veterans with severe disabilities .
All veterans and their families deserve a shot at what is at the heart of the American dream  a good job at a good company ,  said Paralyzed Veterans National President Gene A. Crayton , whose organization is home to one of the nations most innovative career development programs for veterans with disabilities .
The program , launched in 2007 , helps veterans develop the skills they need to compete in the job market while matching them with businesses with vacancies .
 Hiring more veterans represents a great deal for our country .
Those who have served secure good careers .
Employers get great employees .
And , in turn , our economy becomes stronger . 
 We salute Microsoft for its ongoing support of the nations wounded veterans and wounded warriors ,  said Sloan Gibson , president of the USO .
 The community - based efforts to support these troops and ease the transition from military to civilian life will improve their lives . 
 Wounded Warrior Project believes it is our duty to empower wounded service members with the tools they need to embark on a path toward a successful and meaningful career ,  said WWP Executive Director Steve Nardizzi .
 We commend Microsoft for creating Elevate America and for shouldering responsibility for the training and transition of our wounded warriors into the civilian work force . 

A comic collector has paid a tidy sum to get his hands on a copy of the first appearance of Batman .
An issue of Detective Comics # 27 has sold to an anonymous collector at auction for $ 1,075,000 .
The comic , which originally went on sale in May of 1939 contains the very first appearance of Bob Kane and Bill Finger 's Batman , and has broken the record for comic books sales , set by the million dollar auction of Action Comics # 1 - which contains the first appearance of Superman - earlier this week .
The record for comic books sales before the pair of million dollar sales had stood at $ 317,000 for another copy of Action Comics # 1 .
The value of the sale comes as something of a surprise , even after the Action Comics sale , as the comic had only been valued at around $ 100,000 , although advance bidding had reached $ 400,000 by the time the auction started .
Does this finally prove once and for all that Batman is better than Superman ?
Probably not , but it does prove that some comic book fans have very deep pockets indeed .

The Justice Department has decided not to file criminal charges against the former head of a division at American International Group Inc. whose dealings in mortgage - related securities nearly bankrupted the company and led to a controversial government bailout , according to lawyers involved in the cases .
The decision appears to bring an end to the criminal investigation of AIG , but a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into AIG and the dealings of its London - based Financial Products subsidiary is continuing and could lead to a civil securities fraud case .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawyers representing Joseph Cassano , who formerly ran AIG ’s Financial Products unit , and Andrew Forster , who worked for Cassano , said they were told by federal prosecutors late Friday that no criminal charges would be filed .
A person familiar with the government ’s criminal investigation of AIG confirmed that charges would n’t be brought .
The person was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity .
The Justice Department declined comment Saturday .
SEC investigators have been involved in the case from the start , but it is unclear when a decision would be made on a civil fraud case .
Federal prosecutors were investigating AIG ’s Financial Products unit , which dealt in financial contracts called credit default swaps that helped sink AIG in September 2008 , leading to a taxpayer - funded bailout .
The credit default swaps AIG sold were insurance - like guarantees on mortgage securities that wound up forcing AIG to pay out billions of dollars after the housing market went bust .
ADVERTISEMENT
Investigators were looking into whether Financial Products officials tried to deceive investors and AIG ’s auditors , PricewaterhouseCoopers , by misstating the accounting value of a credit default swap portfolio .
When AIG posted a loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 , it pinned the blame on an $ 11 billion writedown related to the credit default swaps held by its Financial Products group .
If AIG could n’t make good on its promise to pay off the contracts , many of which were held by major banks , regulators feared the consequences would pose a threat to the whole U.S. financial system .
That led the government to go ahead with the $ 180 billion bailout .
ADVERTISEMENT
Cassano ’s attorneys , F. Joseph Warin and Jim Walden , said in a statement that the two - year federal investigation was intense and difficult .
“ The results are wholly appropriate in light of our client ’s factual innocence , ” said the statement , which lauded federal agents and prosecutors for following the facts to end the case .
“ This result was the product of two things :
An innocent client and fair prosecutors and agents .
The system worked , ” the statement said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Forster ’s attorneys , David Brodsky and Richard Owens , said in a statement that they knew it would have been easy for federal prosecutors to win a grand jury indictment , but praised them for listening to their client ’s case .
“ We knew the prosecutors were smart , fair and open - minded and that , given a full opportunity to present all the evidence , we could convince them that our client acted at all times in good faith .
In the end , the facts were stronger than the emotions surrounding AIG ’s problems , ” the statement said .
Cassano left AIG in 2008 , shortly after the $ 11 billion loss was reported .
Forster is still employed by the company .

An AIG spokesman did not return a telephone message left Saturday .
The AIG bailout has drawn much public ire , largely because the company paid employees $ 165 million in retention bonuses after the company nearly failed and had to be bailed out by the government .
Nearly two years after a meltdown in the market for subprime mortgage securities cascaded into the worst financial crisis in the U.S. since the 1930s , prosecutors have had little luck bringing criminal cases against top financial executives .
Last November two executives at Bear Stearns who ran hedge funds that collapsed after betting on the subprime mortgage market were acquitted of charges that they lied to investors .

Hollywood will soon have the power to remotely disable the analog outputs on your set - top box , under a decision by federal regulators on Friday intended to prevent home recording of new movie releases .
The move by the Federal Communications Commission grants cable and satellite providers the power to block consumers from viewing just - released movies in an analog format through a process known as Selectable Output Control .
Hollywood requested SOC powers as a condition of allowing providers for the first time to release movies to their in - home customers while the film is in theaters .
The Motion Picture Association of America said its member studios would not authorize the early movie releases unless it won the ability to deploy Selectable Output Control .
The reason : Analog video signals can easily be recorded , while digital video standards include a copy protection scheme that lets providers set a no - copy flag on the signal .
Digital rights group , Public Knowledge , said millions of older televisions , including 11 million HD sets , would be affected , a number the MPAA disputes .
Owners of those devices would not have the luxury of being able to view the latest theater blockbuster at home through video on - demand services .
" The FCC is allowing the MPAA to control your television , " John Bergmayer , Public Knowledge staff attorney , said in a telephone interview .
Howard Gantman , a Motion Picture Association of America vice president , said in a telephone interview that , while some consumers may be left out , " It 's not going to stop you from getting what you get now . "
The FCC said it sided with the MPAA in the name of " public interest , " ( .pdf ) and granted SOC controls for no longer than 90 days per title .
" We believe that providing consumers with the option to view films in their homes shortly after those films are released in theaters will serve the public interest , " the FCC said in its order .
It added that permission to deploy Selectable Output Control " is necessary to provide adequate protection against illegal copying of the proposed service . "
Gantman said it 's now about four months between theater debut to home or DVD release .
With Friday 's decision , he said , it was not immediately clear how much shorter that span would become .
Agreements between studios , producers and the cable and satellite providers need to be worked out , he said .
" We 're not breaking anybody 's TVs , " he said .

Seoul , South Korea ( CNN ) -- A South Korean investigator said Friday that an " external explosion " was the most likely cause of the mysterious sinking of a naval ship in which 46 South Korean sailors were lost in tense waters off the North Korean coast .
" There is a higher possibility of an external rather than an internal explosion , " Yoon Duk - yong , the co-head of a government - appointed team to investigate the March 26 sinking of the corvette Cheonan , said Friday in a televised press conference .
The Cheonan 's stern section , where the missing sailors were believed to have been trapped , was raised from the Yellow Sea bottom Thursday after a salvage operation that was made both risky and difficult by low underwater visibility and strong currents .
The bow section is expected to be salvaged next week .
Of the Cheonan 's 104 - man crew , 58 men were rescued from the sea on the night of the explosion .
Thirty - eight bodies have so far been recovered ; eight remain missing .
Yoon 's comment was based on a preliminary investigation of the stern wreckage .
He added , however , that it was necessary " to make a detailed analysis , leaving all possibilities open . "
President Lee Myung - bak has demanded a transparent probe into the sinking , which Defense Minister Kim Tae - young on Friday called " a grave national security incident . "
While Seoul has avoided blaming North Korea , Kim has said that a sea mine or torpedo appear the most likely causes .
The media has been rife with speculation -- theories aired range from an internal boiler explosion to a North Korean naval special forces attack .
On Thursday , Open Radio for North Korea , a Seoul - based radio station that maintains covert contacts north of the border , announced that Northern authorities are calling the Cheonan sinking " self - inflicted . "
North Korea 's state - run media have been silent on the issue , and both South Korean and U.S. forces in South Korea say they have not detected any unusual moves by the armed forces of the hard - line state .
However , the Cheonan went down close to the disputed inter-Korean sea border , off which fatal naval skirmishes took place in 1999 and 2002 .
If forensic evidence does point to North Korean involvement , it is unclear what moves South Korea could take against a country that has artillery ranged in on Seoul , and which is believed to possess at least six nuclear devices ..
The United States declined to strike militarily against North Korea when the spyship USS Pueblo was seized in international waters off North Korea in 1968 .
Nor did South Korea retaliate in 2002 , when three Southern sailors were killed and their patrol boat sunk in a North Korean attack on the same day that South Korea was playing its last match of the World Cup .

The International Space Station is passing overhead in the next week - beginning tonight - on a course that offers several good times to see the " moving star . "
Traveling at 17,500 mph more than 200 miles overhead , the station will be the brightest object in the night sky .
And with more interior room than a conventional five - bedroom house , it will be easily visible .
There station will pass over seven times , but most of the opportunities will be for about a minute .
On Sunday and Tuesday , however , the ISS will be at a good height for a good period of time .
If the sky is clear , use the degrees above the horizon and the directions below to see the station :
* Tonight : 9:20 p.m. , visible 1 minute , approach 17 degrees above north , departure 24 degrees above north - northeast , maximum elevation 24 degrees
* Sunday , 9 p.m. , visible 2 minutes , approach 32 degrees above northwest , departure 43 degrees above south - southeast , maximum elevation 77 degrees

When you come right down to it , the image of vibrant , diverse , but neighborly city life — Zukin speaks of the continued struggle between the homogenized “ corporate city ” ( bad ) and the “ urban village ” ( good ) — that champions of urbanism summon is really the ideal of the West Village neighborhood life that Jacobs imperishably described .
Here were the laundry , the deli , the tailor shop , the candy and cigar stores , the greengrocer , the pizzeria , the hardware store , the locksmith , the corner drugstore , and the dry cleaner — all of which , with their comradely - but - not - officious proprietors , helped sustain the intimacies of long neighborhood association .
Here was a rooted population of Italian , Spanish , and Irish working - class families , many of whose menfolk worked at the piers a few blocks to the west ( my mother , who lived in the neighborhood — on Charles Street , just east of Hudson — from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s , always recalled the exotic glamour that the waterfront bestowed on it ) .
Here were cobblestone streets and early - 19th - century houses , such as the one Jacobs ’s family was restoring , all of which testified to the continuity and stability — the fly - in - amber quality — of an enclave that , thanks to a series of historical accidents ( and the nativist sentiments of its 19th - century inhabitants ) , was removed from the ravenous economic dynamism of a city that had bypassed it .
Jacobs summoned , as Zukin trenchantly puts it , “ an idyllic picture of small town life in the midst of the big city . ”
But added to the workaday if charming neighborhood were worldly bohemian embellishments : an antique store , a shabby - genteel French restaurant that Ezra Pound had patronized , and the White Horse Tavern , open very late , which had been a favorite of Anaïs Nin , James Baldwin , Dylan Thomas , and countless longshoremen .
And here were the urbane newcomers — journalists , architects , artists — who , like Jacobs and her husband , eschewed the central part of the Village , around MacDougal Street , that the tourists were blighting .
Here , then , was a vivacious , neighborly , historic district inhabited by Old World workers and well - educated sophisticates .
Thanks to the profound influence that The Death and Life of Great American Cities has exerted , the West Village circa 1960 has come to epitomize — really to be the blueprint for — the urban good life .
But in its mix of the new and the left over , in its alchemy of authenticity , grit , seedy glamour , and intellectual and cultural sophistication , this was a neighborhood in a transitional and unsustainable , if golden , moment .
Which meant that it was about to lose its soul .
Two recently published books , Wrestling with Moses , by Anthony Flint , and Manhattan Projects , by Samuel Zipp , detail how the working class was driven out of the West Village , as gentrifiers like Jacobs drove up assessed values and rents .
Progressive , reformist city planners , supported by seemingly most of the Village ’s blue - collar residents , favored a relatively low - impact urban - renewal scheme to build hundreds of below - market - rate homes in the neighborhood — a plan Jacobs and a group of largely affluent residents successfully fought on the grounds that it would destroy the area ’s character .
Whatever the merits of the opposing positions , one of the proponents of renewal was surely prophetic in arguing in 1961 , “ If the Village area is left alone … eventually the Village will consist solely of luxury housing
This trend is already quite obvious and would itself destroy any semblance of the Village that [ Jacobs and her allies ] seem so anxious to preserve . ”

Lets say you have a tank holding a liquid of known specific gravity .
And let 's say you have a spout coming off the top that is a known height above the tank providing static head .
Let 's also say that this tank is valved at the spout to release a relatively constant flow at a constant pressure .
For the purposes of this exercise , it does n't matter what the pressure is , as long as it is greater than ambient .
( The pressure on the tank is essentially constant only if you have a large enough tank , or if your tank has an expansive / compressive gas in it which is compressed to the pressure level of the tank and it free to expand as the liquid is depleted . )
Now , let 's say you decided to immediately shut the valve , stopping the flow .
What happens ?
I know what happens , and so do the engineers at BP .
There will be no top kill attempted , except as maybe a public display .

This is for sure a big blowout but that 's all it is .
Blowouts have occurred in the past and will again in the future .
If the well had been cemented then long string had been run , this is casing not drill pipe in the hole .
Compared to drill pipe , casing is thinner and easier to crush or cut .
No matter which method of controlling the well you choose you still have to get back into the casing , only way to do that is to cut off the bent or crushed portion so you have a regular full gauge opening looking up .
If you have that then you can consider what size pipe you can get down hole through the casing or maybe an overshot which goes over the outside of the casing and can be used as a guide to get back in the hole .
Ideally a packer can be run down hole also otherwise your weight mud will be blown out as fast as it is pumped in .
I have set cast iron bridge plugs by the hundred over the ten years I worked for a wire line company .
In certain ways this is less complicated than if it were on the surface .
Most of the time fire or explosion is a constant hazard with any blowout or even a kick , not in this case .
I do n't know why none of the conventional time proven methods of controlling have been tried , instead this is looking more and more like a Wiley Coyote cartoon except with dire consequences of course .
As well as a wire line I have another ten years as a mud engineer and when I put that hat on I see no way this should have be allowed to occur .
Explosives even if you succeed in getting them down hole would likely only serve to frac the well which is a procedure normally used to enhance production , not the direction we want to go at this point .

Thread : CRIMINAL PROBE in Gulf of Mexico oil spill

Gibbs opens door to criminal probe in Gulf of Mexico oil spill
By Ben Geman - 05/23/10 11:36 AM
ET
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Sunday suggested that the Justice Department may explore criminal charges related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
“ I think the Justice Department has been down in the Gulf to look at and to gather information on this , ” Gibbs said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” when asked whether a criminal probe may be opened .
He did not provide any details , and emphasized that the administration ’s current priority is stopping the ongoing spill from oil giant BP ’s damaged undersea well .
Several Senate Democrats have called for a criminal inquiry in the wake of the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent spill .
Last Monday , eight members of the Environment and Public Works Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder asking him to explore whether BP made “ false and misleading statements to the federal government regarding its ability to respond to oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico . ”

The sooner its stopped is a plus for life , and the longer its left too flow , the greater number of deaths will eventually result .

Being progressed in parallel with plans for the top kill is development of a lower marine riser package ( or LMRP ) cap containment option .
This would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the BOP , leaving a cleanly - cut pipe at the top of the BOP ’s LMRP .
The LMRP cap , an engineered containment device with a sealing grommet , would be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and then placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well and transporting it to the drillship on the surface .
The LMRP cap is already on site and it is anticipated that this option will be available for deployment by the end of May .
Additional options also continue to be progressed , including the option of lowering a second blow - out preventer , or a valve , on top of the MC 252 BOP .

A few press releases today .... seems like they are going to try pumping tomorrow morning ...
BP on Tuesday provided an update on developments in the response to the MC252 oil well incident in the Gulf of Mexico .
Subsea efforts continue to focus on progressing options to stop the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the MC252 blow out preventer ( BOP ) and to collect the flow of oil from the leak points .
These efforts are being carried out in conjunction with industry experts and governmental authorities .
Plans have been developed for a series of interventions via the BOP ; it is currently anticipated these may be carried out over a period of about a week , commencing in the next few days .
These interventions have not been carried out at these depths and conditions before and the success of individual options cannot be assured .
The first planned intervention is the so - called top kill operation where heavy drilling fluids would be injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas and , ultimately , kill the well .
Most of the equipment is on site and preparations for this operation continue , with a view to deployment within a few days .
If necessary , equipment is also in place to combine this operation with the injection under pressure of bridging material to seal off upward flow through the BOP .
Sophisticated diagnostic work using remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) will precede the ' top kill ' to allow the procedure to be planned in detail .
The knowledge from this diagnostic work will be instrumental in determining whether to proceed with this option .
LMRP Option

and what we are facing in the Gulf .
" We should know by Wednesday evening , " said Suttles , chief operating officer for BP Exploration & Production , during a press conference Monday to provide an update on the company 's effort to kill the leak that has been threatening the Gulf Coast since the April 20 blowout at the well .
Suttles said engineers would know when top kill works because " the well would stop flowing . "
Top kill is the name for the procedure that would inject heavy drilling fluids into the choke and kill lines of the well 's malfunctioning blowout preventer to clog the flow of crude that had been estimated around 5,000 b/d , a figure largely discredited .
" It should n't actually make the leak worse , " Suttles said when asked about the risk for attempting the top kill procedure .
He said the biggest risk is the possibility that the drilling mud would be forced from the wellhead into the water instead of forcing the flow of oil and natural gas back down into the wellbore .
If that occurs , Suttles said the company could then deploy what it calls the " junk shot , " using tire shards , golf balls and other odd - sized debris to force it back .
" That is one of the options we would have available , " Suttles said .
" If we saw the right conditions and felt like that would be the right next step . "
He said BP decided to use top kill prior to the junk shot for fear that the junk shot might clog the lines and eliminate the top kill option altogether .
" If that happened , we could n't follow with top kill , " Suttles said .
If the top kill fails to halt the Macondo flow , Suttles said the company would look next at what he called a " lower marine riser package , " cutting the riser and placing a new containment device over the leak .
He again stressed the unprecedented nature of all options at these water depths and said the company has to carefully consider the timeline for its maneuvers to ensure that failed attempts with some options do not block attempts with other options .
Suttles also said the company 's riser insertion tube continues to divert oil from the leak at a rate of about 2,000 b/d.
BP successfully inserted that tube a week ago and has been measuring the flow of oil siphoned to a vessel on the surface .
Suttles also defended the initial estimate of a 5,000 b/d flow from the well , citing the large amount of natural gas and stressing the number as an estimate with " wide uncertainty . "
" I am very confident that the rate coming out of this well is nowhere near the estimates seen on TV , " Suttles said in reference to independent research that has speculated the flow could be as high as 120,000 b/d.
Suttles also dismissed a suggestion that explosives might ultimately be used to collapse the well , calling it " not an option that we believe we would ever use " because " we could n't control the damage . "
Salazar 's comments on BP draw reaction
Suttles , earlier in the day on CNN , fired back at the Obama administration for threatening to push the company out of the way and take control of the effort to cap the Macondo leak .
He said the US government " very well could " assume total control of the leak - stopping effort " if they chose to do that . "
But Suttles quickly questioned the wisdom of such a move , noting that BP controls the huge fleet of specialized surface vessels , remote - controlled submarines and other technologies that are needed to staunch the oil and gas .
" The technology that 's out there is very specialized , " Suttles said .
" We 're the biggest of the international companies .
We have the biggest deepwater capability .
We do more of this than anyone else .
We got the best contractors in the world .
We pulled in the best scientists from the government and from across our industry .
So , I do n't think anyone else could do better than we are . "
Suttles ' comments came a day after US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters that the Obama administration would " push [ BP ] out of the way , " if the company is " not doing what they 're supposed to be doing " with respect to the leaking well .
Salazar made that remark in Houston after meeting privately with BP officials on the oil leak .
Salazar did not make it clear if he was talking about the US government taking control of BP 's efforts to plug up the leaking well , or assuming control of the efforts to clean up the oil that is now washing ashore in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast States .
US Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen on Monday also backed away from Salazar 's statements .
" To push BP out of the way would raise the question of replacing them with what , " Allen said in a White House news conference .
" I 've been involved with the technical decisions and ( BP ) is pressing ahead , " trying every possible technical solution to address the leak .
Allen said he sees no reason for the federal government to take over the spill relief efforts from BP , saying he is " satisfied with the coordination that 's going on . "
But he and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs denied suggestions that the federal government has not pressed BP hard enough on its spill response .
Allen said BP has been following a " logical sequence " of techniques " based on risk " aimed at stopping the oil leak .
EPA not happy about dispersant choice
US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday she is " not satisfied " with BP 's decision to stick with its current dispersant rather than switch to a less toxic alternative , even as tests have shown no negative environmental impact from dispersant use .
Jackson said the EPA will do its own independent tests of Corexit , the dispersant BP has been using both on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and undersea .
She has also ordered BP to continue searching for alternatives , even as the EPA starts conducting its own independent tests .
" Rather than take their word for it , I would rather have my own scientists do their own testing , " Jackson said during a conference call with reporters .
Jackson said the use of dispersants has been very effective , especially subsea .
She said subsea use has dramatically cut the need to use dispersants on the surface and that total use of dispersants going forward could be cut by anywhere from 50 % to 75 % .
BP Group Chairman and Chief Executive Tony Hayward said Monday he felt " devastated " by environmental damage from the leaking Macondo well that he had just seen on the Louisiana Coast .
" Absolutely gutted , " Hayward told reporters in comments made at Fourchon Beach , where oil from the well had washed onshore .
Hayward 's remarks were broadcast on television .
" We are going to put the Gulf Coast right and back to normal as fast as we can , " Hayward said .
" We will clean every last drop of oil off the shore .
We will remediate the environmental damage .
And we will put the Gulf Coast right and back to normality as fast as we can . "
Hayward denied BP was limiting the resources it was using toward plugging the Macondo well and cleaning up the oil so far released

Suttles also dismissed a suggestion that explosives might ultimately be used to collapse the well , calling it " not an option that we believe we would ever use " because " we could n't control the damage .

there will be no " blowing apart " the bop .
the bop will basically be neutral , or slight pressure into the well when they are done ... they will only baby step the beginning to make sure they are absolutely open to the well .
Once they establish that they are open , expect to see much rate , as they need to not only overcome the flow from the well , they need to create enough pressure to force the fluid down .
The mud will take the path of least resistance , and that is going to be up , unless there is sufficient kinks and blockages in the riser to create back pressure with rate that forces the fluid down .
that 's where the junk shot comes in , try to fill the riser to get the fluid to preferentially flow down .
if the well is flowing at 5000 bpd , that 's only 3.5 barrels per minute .
if the well is flowing 100,000 bpd , pray the junk shot works to slow it down , because you are n't getting that rate through the choke and kill lines ...

Calculus with Analytic Geometry .
By George F. Simmons .

This is about calculus books , and there are seven important conclusions .
Let us go back to the beginning and look at the first calculus book , Analyse des
Infiniment Petits , pour L'intelligence des Lignes Courbes , published in Paris in
- 1696 and written by Guillaume François Antoine L'Hospital , Marquis de Sainte - Mesme ,
Comte d'Entrement , Seigneur d'Orques , etc .
To almost everyone , L'Hospital is just a
name attached to L'Hospital 's Rule and almost no one knows anything about him .
His
memory deserves better .
He displayed mathematical talent early , solving a problem
about cycloids at fifteen , and he was a lifelong lover and supporter of mathematics
who , unfortunately , died young , at the age of 43 .
Also , L'Hospital was no .
mean
mathematician .
He published several papers in the journals of the day , solving
various nontrivial problems .
I know that I could not have found , as he did , the
shape of a curve such that a body sliding down it exerts a normal force on it always
equal to the weight of the body .
Further , as Abraham Robinson has written ,
According to the testimony of his contemporaries , L'Hospital possessed a very
attractive personality , being , among other things , modest and generous , two
qualities which were not widespread among the mathematicians of his time .
His book was a huge success .
There was a second edition in 1715 , and there were
commentaries written on it .
I have the 1781 edition , with additions made by another
author .
Not many textbooks last almost 100 years .
Birkhoff and MacLane is not yet
50 years old .
L'Hospital 's book is about differentials and their applications to
curves and the style is exclusively geometrical .
There are not many equations , but
there are an awful lot of letters and pictures , just as I remember in my tenth grade
geometry text .
Mathematics was geometry then , and mathematicians were geometers .
There are many things not in the book .
There are no sines or cosines , no
exponentials or logarithms , only algebraic functions and algebraic curves .
There
are also no derivatives , only differentials .
Here is L'Hospital 's proof of
L'Hospital 's Rule , using differentials .
In Figure 1 , points on the graph of
f( x ) /g(x ) are found by dividing lengths of abscissas , except at a .
But if you dx
past a , the point on the graph will be dfldg .
Since dx is infinitesimal , that ratio
gives you the point at a .
Is that not nice ?
It took some time for calculus to become generally taught in colleges .
Eventually
it made it , and calculus textbooks began to appear in the nineteenth century .
I
have a copy of one , Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus , by Elias
Loomis , LI .
D. , Professor of Natural Philosophy at Yale College .
His calculus was
first published in 1851 , and my copy of it is the 1878 edition .
It sold in excess
of 25,000 copies , so it must reflect accurately the style and content of calculus
teaching of the time .
Just as with L'Hospital , the differential was the important
idea .
Loomis derived the formula for the differential of x " with no use of the
binomial expansion , ( d( xy ) / xy = dx /x + dy /y , d( xn ) / xn = dxlx + + dxlx , add and
simplify ) and his proof of L'Hospital 's Rule was short , simple , and clear , and also
one which does not appear in modern texts because it fails for certain pathological
examples .
Also , Loomis put all of his formulas in words , italicized words .
After
deriving the formula for the differential of a power of a function , he wrote
The differential of a function affected with any exponent whatever is the continued
product of the exponent , the function itself with its exponent diminished by unity ,
and the differential of the function .
It was a good idea .
It is also probably a good idea to do as L'Hospital and Loomis
did and talk about differentials instead of derivatives whenever possible .
Little
bits of things are easier to understand than rates of change .
It is a still better
idea to strive for clarity and let students see what is really going on , which is
what Loomis did , rather than putting rigor first .
But nowadays authors cannot do
that .
They must protect themselves against some colleague snootily writing to the
publisher , " Evidently Professor Blank is unaware that his so - called proof of
L'Hospital 's Rule is faulty , as the following well - known example shows .
I could not
possibly adopt a text with such a serious error . "
It is a shame , and probably
inevitable that calculus books are written for calculus teachers , but I have
nevertheless concluded
CONCLUSION #1 : CALCULUS BOOKS SHOULD BE WRITTEN FOR STUDENTS .
It would be worth a try .
Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson was quite
successful in its time , which ran for quite a while .
The second edition appeared in
1914 , and my copy was printed in 1935 .
It is still in print .
The book has a
motto :
What one fool can do , another can .
and a prologue :
Considering how many fools can calculate , it is surprising that it should be thought
either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the
same tricks .
...
Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow , I have bad to unteach myself the
difficulties , and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard .
Master these thoroughly , and the rest will follow .
What one fool can do , another
can .
Chapter 1 , whose title is " To Deliver You From The Preliminary Terrors " forthrightly
says that dx means " a little bit of x . "
Thompson did not include L'Hospital 's Rule .
Both Loomis and Thompson are like L'Hospital when it comes to giving applications
and examples : they are all almost entirely geometrical .
Loomis 's applications of
maxima and minima are all about inscribing and circumscribing things , and so are all
of Thompson 's except one .
In fact , all three books are full of geometry .
Thompson
concluded with arc length and curvature , Loomis had involutes and evolutes , cusps
and multiple points , and lots of curve sketching .
Did you know that the asymptote
to y3 = X3 + X2 is y = x + 1/3 ? 1 did n't until I read Loomis .
It is nice to know .
There must have been some reason why calculus books for more than 200 years taught
so much geometry .
Mathematics may no longer be synonymous with geometry , but we
have discarded , wrongly I think , the wisdom of the ages , and I have concluded
CONCLUSION #2 : CALCULUS BOOKS NEED MORE GEOMETRY .
Before writing this essay , I examined 85 separate and distinct calculus books .
I
looked at all of their prefaces , all of their applications of maxima and minima , and
all of their treatments of L'Hospital 's Rule .
By the way , I found five different
spellings of L'Hospital .
There were the two you would expect , and Lhospital , as
L'Hospital sometimes spelled his name .
In addition , one author , not wanting to take
chances , had it L'Hôspital , and one thought it was Le Hospital .
Why are there so
many calculus books , and why do they keep appearing ?
One could be cynical and say
that the authors are all motivated by greed .
But I do not think so .
I think that
authors write new calculus books because they have observed that students do not
learn much from the old calculus books .
Therefore , prospective authors think , " if I
write a text and do things properly , students will be able to learn . "
They are
wrong , all of them .
The reason for that is
CONCLUSION #3 : CALCULUS IS HARD .
Too hard , I think , to teach to college freshmen in the United States in the 1980s ,
but that is another topic .
If you plot the books ' numbers of pages against their year of publication , you have
a chart in which an ominous increasing trend is clear .
The 1000 - page barrier , first
pierced in 1960 , has been broken more and more often as time goes on .
New highs on
the calculus - page index are made almost yearly .
Where will it all end ?
We can get
an indication .
The magic of modern statistics packages produces the least - squares
line : Pages = 2.94 ( Year ) - 5180 , showing that in the middle of the next millennium ,
the average calculus book will have 2,270 , pages and the longest one , just published ,
will have 3,783 pages exclusive of index .
Why do we need 1000 pages to do what L'Hospital did in 234 , Loomis in 309 , Thompson
in 301 , and the text I learned calculus from , used exclusively for four whole
semesters , 14 semester - hours in all , in 416 ?
There are several reasons .
One , of
course , is the large number of reviewers of prospective texts .
No more can an
editor make up his mind about the merits of a text , it has to go out to fifteen
different people for opinions .
And if one of them writes that the author has left
out the tan ( x / 2 ) substitution in the section on techniques of integration , how can
he or she do that , we wo n't be able to integrate 3 / ( 4 + 5 sin 6 x ) , how can anyone
claim to know calculus who can't do that ; is n't the easiest response to include the
tan( x /2 ) substitution ?
Of course it is , in it goes , and in goes everything else
that is in every other 1000 - page text .
It is impossible to escape
CONCLUSION #4 : CALCULUS BOOKS ARE TOO LONG .
Another reason for the length is the current mania for Applications .
If you go to
Books in Print and look in the subject index under " Calculus " what you see is
The Usefulness of Calculus for the Behavioral , Life , and Managerial Sciences
Essentials of Calculus for Business , Economics , Life Sciences , and Social Sciences
and many , many similar titles .
Now authors have to explain , with examples , what
marginal revenue is , and consumer surplus , and what tracheae are whereas in the old
days , all their readers knew what a cone was .
A third reason is the supposed need
to be rigorous .
Now we see statements of L'Hospital 's Rule that take up half a page
and proofs of it that go on for three pages .
My 416 - page calculus book never even
mentioned L'Hospital 's Rule , and I never felt the lack .
Its author never proved
that the derivative of x ' was ex '- , but I was willing to believe it .
Trying to
include everything and trying to prove everything makes for long books .
Everything
gets longer .
Prefaces used to be short , a page or less .
Now they are five and six
pages , hard sells for the incredible virtues of the text that follows , full of
thanks to reviewers , to five or six editors , to wives , to students , even to cats .
Let me return to " applications . "
There are n't many , you know .
In the 85 calculus
books I examined , almost all of them had the Norman window problem - the rectangle
surmounted by a semicircle , fixed perimeter , maximize the area .
The semicircle
always " surmounts . "
This is the sole surviving use of " surmounted " in the English
language , except for the silo , a cylinder surmounted by a hemisphere .
Only one
author had the courage to say that the window was a semicircle on top of a
rectangle .
All the books had the box made by cutting the corners out of a flat
sheet , all have the ladder sliding down the wall , all had the conical tank with
changing height of water , all had the tin can with fixed surface area and maximum
volume , all had the V - shaped trough , all had the field to fence , with or without a
river flowing ( in a dead straight line ) along one side , all had the wire - usually
wire , but sometimes string - cut into two pieces to be formed into a circle and a
square , though some daring authors made circles and equilateral triangles .
There
are only finitely many calculus problems , and their number is very finite .
I
" Applications " are so phony .
Ladders do not slide down walls with the base moving
away from the wall at a constant rate .
Authors know the applications are phony .
One book has the base of the ladder sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet
per minute .
At that rate , you could finish up your painting with time to spare and
easily step off the ladder when it was a foot from the ground .
Another author has
the old run-and - swim problem - you know , minimize the time to oet somewhere on the
other side of the river - with the person able to run 25 feet per second and swim 20
feet per second .
That 's not bad for running ( it 's a 3:31.2 mile ) , but it is super
swimming , 100 yards in 15 seconds , a new world 's record by far .
There are no
conical reservoirs outside of calculus books .
Real reservoirs are cylindrical , or
perhaps rectangular .
The reason for this is found in the texts : in the problems ,
the conical reservoirs usually have a leak at the bottom .
Tin cans are not made to
minimize surface area .
I could give any number of examples of absurd applications
in which businessmen " observe " the price of their product decreasing at the rate of
$ 1 per month , or where the S. D. S. ( remember them ? ) " find " that staging x
demonstrations costs $ 250 x ' .
Why will authors not be honest and say that these
artificial problems provide valuable practice in translating from En- lish into
mathematics and that is all they are for ?
Surely they cannot disagree with
CONCLUSION #5 : FIRST - SEMESTER CALCULUS HAS NO APPLICATIONS .
Before getting to my next conclusion , here is my favorite " application . "
A cow has 90 feet of fence to make a rectangular pasture .
She has the use of a
cliff for one side .
She decides to leave a 10 foot gap in the fence in case the
grass should get greener on the other side .
Find .. . .
Hardly any authors dare to do that .
Calculus books are Serious .
The text from
which that problem came was titled Calculus Without Analytic Geometry and it is no
surprise that it did not catch on .
The existence of all those calculus books with " Applications " in their titles
implies a market for them ,
There must be students out there who are being forced to
undergo a semester of calculus before they can complete their major in botany and
take over the family flower shop .
I cannot believe that any more than a tiny
fraction of them will ever see a derivative again , or need one .
Calculus is a
splendid screen for screening out dummies , but it also screens out perfectly
intelligent people who find it difficult to deal with quantities .
I do n't know
about you , but I long ago concluded
CONCLUSION #6 : NOT EVERYONE NEEDS TO LEARN CALCULUS .
The book by Simmons is a fine one .
It was written with care and intelligence .
It
has good problems , and the historical material is almost a course in the history of
mathematics .
It is nicely printed ' , well bound , and expensive .
Future historians
of mathematics will look back on it and say , " Yes , that is an excellent example of a
late twentieth - century calculus book . "
This leads to my last conclusion
