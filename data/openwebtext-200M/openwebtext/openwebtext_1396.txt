WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A federal judge threw out all charges on Thursday against five Blackwater Worldwide security guards accused of killing 14 Iraqi civilians in 2007 , saying the U.S. government had recklessly violated the defendants ’ constitutional rights .
U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina said prosecutors had wrongly used statements the guards made to State Department investigators under a threat of job loss .
The five guards were charged a year ago with 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempt to commit manslaughter and one weapons violation count over a Baghdad shooting that outraged Iraqis and strained ties between the two countries .
The shooting occurred as the private security firm ’s guards escorted a heavily armed four - truck convoy of U.S. diplomats through the Iraqi capital on September 16 , 2007 .
The guards , U.S. military veterans , were responding to a car bombing when gunfire erupted at a crowded intersection .
The defendants -- Paul Slough , Evan Liberty , Dustin Heard , Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- were employed by Blackwater Worldwide , known since February as Xe Services .
The company , based in North Carolina , lost a State Department contract involving security for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after the shooting .
The government had argued that whatever knowledge prosecutors and investigators may have had of the defendants ’ compelled statements , they had made no use of them .
But Urbina found the compelled statements pervaded nearly every aspect of the government ’s investigation and prosecution , and the government ’s use of those statements “ appears to have played a critical role ” in each indictment .
“ Accordingly , ” he wrote , “ the court declines to excuse the government ’s reckless violation of the defendants ’ constitutional rights as harmless error . ”
Urbina said prosecutors and investigators , in their zeal to bring charges , had repeatedly disregarded warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors that their course of action threatened the prosecution ’s viability .
The Justice Department said it was disappointed in the judge ’s action .
“ We ’re in the process of reviewing the opinion and considering our options , ” Dean Boyd , a department spokesman , said in response to a question about whether the government would appeal .
Mark Hulkower , a lawyer for the defense team , welcomed the decision and said the team was “ thrilled that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them . ”
Representatives of Xe Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Urbina prefaced his opinion with a quotation from a landmark 1966 U.S. Supreme Court case , Tehan v. U.S. :
“ The basic purposes that lie behind the privilege against self - incrimination do not relate to protecting the innocent from conviction , but rather to preserving the integrity of a judicial system in which even the guilty are not to be convicted unless the prosecution shoulder the entire load . ”
A sixth Blackwater guard pleaded guilty late last year to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter , and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors .
eso1002 — Science Release
VLT Captures First Direct Spectrum of an Exoplanet
By studying a triple planetary system that resembles a scaled - up version of our own Sun ’s family of planets , astronomers have been able to obtain the first direct spectrum — the “ chemical fingerprint ” [ 1 ] — of a planet orbiting a distant star [ 2 ] , thus bringing new insights into the planet 's formation and composition .
The result represents a milestone in the search for life elsewhere in the Universe .
“ The spectrum of a planet is like a fingerprint .
It provides key information about the chemical elements in the planet ’s atmosphere , ” says Markus Janson , lead author of a paper reporting the new findings .
“ With this information , we can better understand how the planet formed and , in the future , we might even be able to find tell - tale signs of the presence of life . ”
The researchers obtained the spectrum of a giant exoplanet that orbits the bright , very young star HR 8799 .
The system is at about 130 light - years from Earth .
The star has 1.5 times the mass of the Sun , and hosts a planetary system that resembles a scaled - up model of our own Solar System .
Three giant companion planets were detected in 2008 by another team of researchers , with masses between 7 and 10 times that of Jupiter .
They are between 20 and 70 times as far from their host star as the Earth is from the Sun ; the system also features two belts of smaller objects , similar to our Solar System 's asteroid and Kuiper belts .
“ Our target was the middle planet of the three , which is roughly ten times more massive than Jupiter and has a temperature of about 800 degrees Celsius , ” says team member Carolina Bergfors .
“ After more than five hours of exposure time , we were able to tease out the planet 's spectrum from the host star 's much brighter light . ”
This is the first time the spectrum of an exoplanet orbiting a normal , almost Sun - like star has been obtained directly .
Previously , the only spectra to be obtained required a space telescope to watch an exoplanet pass directly behind its host star in an “ exoplanetary eclipse ” , and then the spectrum could be extracted by comparing the light of the star before and after .
However , this method can only be applied if the orientation of the exoplanet ’s orbit is exactly right , which is true for only a small fraction of all exoplanetary systems .
The present spectrum , on the other hand , was obtained from the ground , using ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , in direct observations that do not depend on the orbit ’s orientation .
As the host star is several thousand times brighter than the planet , this is a remarkable achievement .
“ It 's like trying to see what a candle is made of , by observing it from a distance of two kilometres when it ’s next to a blindingly bright 300 Watt lamp , ” says Janson .
The discovery was made possible by the infrared instrument NACO , mounted on the VLT , and relied heavily on the extraordinary capabilities of the instrument ’s adaptive optics system [ 3 ] .
Even more precise images and spectra of giant exoplanets are expected both from the next generation instrument SPHERE , to be installed on the VLT in 2011 , and from the European Extremely Large Telescope .
The newly collected data show that the atmosphere enclosing the planet is still poorly understood .
“ The features observed in the spectrum are not compatible with current theoretical models , ” explains co-author Wolfgang Brandner .
“ We need to take into account a more detailed description of the atmospheric dust clouds , or accept that the atmosphere has a different chemical composition from that previously assumed . ”
The astronomers hope to soon get their hands on the fingerprints of the other two giant planets so they can compare , for the first time , the spectra of three planets belonging to the same system .
“ This will surely shed new light on the processes that lead to the formation of planetary systems like our own , ” concludes Janson .
Notes
[ 1 ]
As every rainbow demonstrates , white light can be split up into different colours .
Astronomers artificially split up the light they receive from distant objects into its different colours ( or “ wavelengths ” ) .
However , where we distinguish five or six rainbow colours , astronomers map hundreds of finely nuanced colours , producing a spectrum — a record of the different amounts of light the object emits in each narrow colour band .
The details of the spectrum — more light emitted at some colours , less light at others — provide tell - tale signs about the chemical composition of the matter producing the light .
This makes spectroscopy , the recording of spectra , an important investigative tool in astronomy .
[ 2 ]
In 2004 , astronomers used NACO on the VLT to obtain an image and a spectrum of a 5 Jupiter mass object around a brown dwarf — a “ failed star ” .
It is however thought that the pair probably formed together , like a petite stellar binary , instead of the companion forming in the disc around the brown dwarf , like a star–planet system ( see eso0428 , eso0515 and eso0619 ) .
[ 3 ]
Telescopes on the ground suffer from a blurring effect introduced by atmospheric turbulence .
This turbulence causes the stars to twinkle in a way that delights poets but frustrates astronomers , since it smears out the fine details of the images .
However , with adaptive optics techniques , this major drawback can be overcome so that the telescope produces images that are as sharp as theoretically possible , i.e. approaching conditions in space .
Adaptive optics systems work by means of a computer - controlled deformable mirror that counteracts the image distortion introduced by atmospheric turbulence .
It is based on real - time optical corrections computed at very high speed ( several hundreds of times each second ) from image data obtained by a wavefront sensor ( a special camera ) that monitors light from a reference star .

In a voice shaking with emotion , mayoral candidate Adam Giambrone Tuesday night admitted he had " intimate relations " with other women throughout most of last year .
Giambrone , a city councillor and Toronto Transit Commission chair , made the confession in an exclusive telephone interview with the Toronto Star .
He read a prepared statement in which he apologized profusely to everyone in his life , including Sarah McQuarrie , his live - in partner of several years .
" I have no excuse for my failure to disclose my relationships with other women , " he said .
" To have misled those around me in this fashion is the worst mistake of my life . "
He pledged that in the days ahead he will " do everything possible to live by the lessons learned in this scarring experience . "
The Star reported Tuesday Giambrone , 32 , suggested in a Dec. 27 text message to university student Kristen Lucas , 20 , that McQuarrie was in his life for " political " reasons .
Lucas , who produced copies of extensive texting with Giambrone , said they had an intimate relationship that began when she was 19 and included sex on a couch in his City Hall office .
When asked questions about Lucas Monday , Giambrone sent a statement to the Star that evening , admitting " an inappropriate relationship with a young woman , " but insisting the relationship consisted of " text messages and conversations in public places only . "
Tuesday night he apologized to the Star .
" I misled you and I am sorry I have no excuse , " Giambrone said , referring to his statement to the newspaper the night before .
Then , he read the new statement .
His voice was halting and he spoke in a subdued and sombre tone .
He declined to answer questions about his political future .
Before Tuesday night 's confession of multiple affairs , his campaign chair John Laschinger said Giambrone was involved in consultations throughout the day , adding : " At this point , our intention is full - steam ahead . "
Laschinger , a veteran political manager , said it was " a painful day for Adam , " but claimed Giambrone had been " fully frank and transparent since the story hit .
People are proud that he took responsibility for his actions . "
With media camped out at City Hall , Giambrone went to ground Tuesday .
He spent the day at home talking to family friends and advisers , missing a Toronto and East York community council meeting and unreachable to the media .
In his Tuesday evening statement to the Star , Giambrone said : " The most painful lessons in life come from the mistakes you make yourself and then inflict on those around you .
" In an effort to bring this chapter to a close , let me say I did have intimate relationships for a period that lasted throughout most of last year with women other than my partner , " he continued .
" I apologize to them for the hurt I have caused .
I regret deeply not having made this full disclosure earlier , to Sarah , my partner , and to my family , my friends and my supporters as well . "
Added Giambrone : " I have broken my own moral code and offended the values I was raised with by my parents and my grandparents ; those I have always tried to live by . "
Throughout the day Tuesday , City Hall was abuzz with the emerging scandal .
Councillor Brian Ashton called for Giambrone to resign his chairmanship of the TTC , which has been beset by bad publicity .
" The TTC is under serious assault around issues of customer relations and performance .
The union is now fragmented from the management .

" I think his moral authority has been totally debased and undermined , " said Ashton .
" I think mentally he 's going to be distracted by both his mayoralty bid and this sex scandal .
His ability to come to terms with the TTC issues is tremendously weakened . "
Councillor Joe Mihevc reacted to Tuesday 's Star report with " shock , shock . "
" I just read it an hour ago , " said Mihevc .
" Pain – that 's all I can say . "
Lucas told the Star Giambrone disclosed City Hall secrets to her , adding she 'd known for " a long , long time " about the TTC fare hike , announced last November for Jan .
1 . She also said he shared negative views about city councillors , although Mayor David Miller " was like a god to Adam . "
Councillor Paula Fletcher called text messages that surfaced " disturbing . "
Said Fletcher : " A lot of women today have told me they are very concerned about what 's in the text messages , "
In one message , Giambrone tells Lucas , " I still think of you when I need ... um ... stimulation . "
Another said : " I like you because you 're smart and interesting .
You 're also good - looking naked . "
According to Lucas , Giambrone told her he did n't have a girlfriend and lived with his brother .
He allegedly said he could n't invite her to his apartment because his elderly parents lived nearby and dropped in unexpectedly .
Lucas claimed they last had sex at her home on Jan. 2 of this year , after Giambrone finished a campaign event on the Danforth with McQuarrie .
Frequent Giambrone critic councillor Rob Ford , who has come under fire for his own public indiscretions , said : " One , you should n't use your city hall office as a place to have sex .
But the issue is his private life ...
Do I think it 's right ?
No .
But that 's my personal opinion . "
Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone , Giambrone 's rival for the mayor 's chair from the left - wing faction of council , would say only that he is " surprised " by the damaging allegations .

Nato and Afghanistan government launch inquiry after planes fire on convoy of vehicles , killing at least 27 people
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
At least 27 civilians were killed in a Nato air strike in southern Afghanistan yesterday , prompting a furious response from Afghan officials .
The airstrike – in which four women and a child are known to have died – brought a personal apology from General Stanley McChrystal , the Nato commander in Afghanistan , to the president , Hamid Karzai .
It added to growing anger over the number of civilian casualties in the Afghan conflict , and came hours after Karzai had urged Nato to do more to protect civilians .
In a statement , the Afghanistan council of ministers condemned the air strike as " unjustifiable " .
The cabinet said initial reports indicated that Nato had fired on a convoy of three vehicles , killing at least 27 people and injuring a further 12 .
McChrystal spoke to Karzai yesterday to express his regret and promise an investigation .
" We are extremely saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives , " he said .
" I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people and inadvertently killing or injuring civilians undermines their trust and confidence in our mission .
We will redouble our effort to regain that trust . "
Syed Zahir Shah , the police chief of Kajran district , in Daikondi province , said he spent all day yesterday helping to recover body parts so they could be prepared for burial .
He said three four - wheel drive vehicles were hit while travelling through a Taliban area .
The vehicles were carrying passengers from Day Kundi province to various destinations , including Kandahar , Herat and Iran .
All the victims were Hazaras , the ethnic group from the central highlands who have always opposed the Taliban .
Shah said the injured included a six - year - old child who was taken for treatment in Uruzgan and a nine - year - old girl .
He said all the vehicles were entirely destroyed and that many of the bodies were so badly disfigured it was hard to identify them .
Locals say the injured were taken by helicopter to the US military base at Bagram , north of Kabul .
The attack triggered fury from local politicians , including Muhammad Hashim Watanwali , an MP from Uruzgan , who said Nato and Hamid Karzai had repeatedly promised to bring a stop to civilian casualties , including most recently at the opening of parliament on Saturday .
Amanullah Hotak , head of Uruzgan 's provincial council , demanded a government investigation into what happened .
He said : " We do n't want their apologies or the money they always give after every attack .
We want them to kill all of us together instead of doing it to us one by one . "
Nato confirmed that its planes had fired on what it believed was a group of insurgents on their way to attack a joint Nato and Afghan patrol in the southern Uruzgan province .
The organisation said it had later discovered that women and children had been hurt in the strike .
The incident was not part of Operation Moshtarak , the major offensive to combat the Taliban in Helmand province .
Zemeri Bashary , an Afghan interior ministry spokesman , said the airstrike hit three minibuses on a main road near the Uruzgan border with the central Day Kundi province .
Bashary said the 42 people in the vehicles were all civilians .
On Saturday , Karzai criticised Nato troops for not doing enough to protect civilian lives .
During a speech to the opening session of the Afghan parliament he called for extra caution from Nato .
" We need to reach the point where there are no civilian casualties , " Karzai said .
" Our effort and our criticism will continue until we reach that goal . "
Nato claims it has taken steps to reduce civilian casualties , primarily through reducing air strikes and tightening its rules of engagement .
However , in the offensive against Marjah , two Nato rockets killed 12 people in one house and others were caught in the crossfire .
Nato said at least 16 civilians had been killed during the offensive so far , although human rights groups claim the total is at least 19 .
Last Thursday , an air strike in the northern Kunduz province missed the insurgents it was targeting and killed seven policemen .
The continued loss of civilian lives will make it harder for Nato as it attempts to win the support of local Afghans against Taliban militants in the south .
Survey the incredibly wide - ranging evidence — including video — that certain insider factions are pushing for UFO / ET Disclosure very soon .
The Norway Spiral is only the most recent attempt to ‘ force ’ the issue — after the US failed to deliver on November 27th .
[ First Four Parts Published 11:59 PM , Christmas Eve 2009 ! ]
By David Wilcock
In Russia there comes the hope of the world —
Not as that sometimes termed of the communistic , or Bolshevik , no ; but freedom , freedom !
That each man will live for his fellow man !
The principle has been born .
It will take years for it to be crystallised , but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world .
Guided by what ?
That friendship with the nation that hath even set on its present monetary unit , “ In God We Trust . ”
( Cayce Reading 3976 - 29 , June 22 , 1944 )
PART ONE : INSIDER BATTLE REACHING CRITICAL MASS
TURN , TURN , TURN
To everything , there is a season — and a time for every purpose under heaven .
A remarkable structure appeared in the skies over northern Norway on December 9 , 2009 — a stunning aerial formation , as you see in the above , unaltered photograph , that was massive in size and hung there rotating in space for ten to fifteen minutes straight .
We now have irrefutable scientific proof that the mainstream media ’s explanation for the Norway Spiral cannot be correct .
We now have irrefutable scientific proof that the mainstream media ’s explanation for the Norway Spiral cannot be correct — as you will soon see .
And that raises many more questions .
If the visual sight of this Spiral was n’t interesting enough , the context certainly was — it showed up the day before Obama was set to receive his Nobel Peace Prize in the very same country .
Also , on that very same day , December 9 , 2009 , hundreds of eyewitnesses reported — and two of them filmed — a gigantic , triangular pyramid - shaped UFO that hovered over the Kremlin in Russia for hours — from daylight on into darkness .
Coincidence ?
Once you review all the evidence , you will see how compelling this case really is — and how these ‘ islands ’ really do connect below the surface .
The Norway Spiral is only the most recent indication that an incredible , seemingly - impossible moment in human civilization and consciousness may actually be about to happen — the open , formal announcement that we are not alone in the Universe .
IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO KEEP A SECRET
We will also convincingly argue that perhaps the number - one reason why the truth is about to come out is that the primary group responsible for the UFO cover - up can no longer afford to keep it a secret .
It costs a lot of money to harass , intimidate and discredit the opposition on such a huge issue as this , for such a prolonged period of time — and the group responsible for the secrecy is now functionally bankrupt , and is being systematically taken down by opposing insider factions who want Disclosure .
Last year ’s shockingly sudden economic collapse — and the unmitigated political disaster of the short - term bailouts that were handed out to the usual suspects — is a strong piece of supporting evidence to suggest that the money simply is n’t there anymore to finance the enormous political / military / corporate machine required to keep this enormous secret under wraps .
All empires in recorded history have crumbled from over - extending themselves financially .
History repeats itself .
This time , the results will be much better than most of us could ever have expected .
No one holding the reins of power would have let something as grotesquely embarrassing as the bailouts occur … potentially leading to the revolutionary overthrow of their own corporate and governmental authority … unless they ’d had no other choice .
It ’s the very simple logic of power — Never Let ‘ Em See You Sweat .
The supporting evidence makes that case very , very clearly .
LAUGH IF YOU WANT TO
You can laugh if you want to , and attack everyone who does n’t think the same way you do as being a loser and a crank , but you may be in for quite a surprise when such a Disclosure is actually made .
In fact , the insiders who have kept this secret for the last 60 years are counting on the skeptics , debunkers and religious fundamentalists to freak out and destabilize society once they are finally told the truth — though I highly doubt that will actually happen .
Instead of absolutely believing you will never hear any “ genuine proof ” that UFOs exist , or ever see a ‘ real one ’ with your own eyes , I invite you to try the intellectual exercise of at least allowing yourself to ask the “ What If . ”
Just try .
As a Highly Intelligent Skeptic you have to be willing to consider all possibilities , rather than automatically assuming your opinion must be correct .
As a Highly Intelligent Skeptic you have to be willing to consider all possibilities , rather than automatically assuming your opinion must be correct .
What if the government actually did tell you UFOs were real ?
What if we are surrounded by intelligent life throughout the Universe ?
What if humans like us have evolved on other planets besides the Earth ?
What if there are technologies out there that are vastly superior to our own — and our cherished ‘ laws ’ of physics need to be completely rewritten ?
What if our own technology was dramatically assisted by this “ celestial endowment ? ”
What if the extraterrestrial presence was considered the highest secret of all , due to its potential to eliminate the oil - based economy , and has been carefully kept under wraps — with deadly force — for six decades now , but is finally falling apart ?
I mean , think about it — after all this talk of UFOs for so many years ; after all the movies , documentaries , books , TV shows and the like ; after all the evidence you have been exposed to throughout your life , do you honestly believe the whole , entire thing is completely and totally BS ?
Can you sincerely be confident that every single sighting ever reported in human history must be a lie or a hoax , and every single whistleblower is similarly concocting fairytales — despite the career destruction , poverty and ridicule they endure , notwithstanding the tired old lies you may have heard about them “ selling their stories ” and becoming ‘ rich ’ from them ?
( I know many of these UFO whistleblowers personally .
Very few , if any , are lucky enough to function above a subsistence level . )
I ’m serious .
This is your life .
You do with it what you want .
But can you absolutely be sure you are right ?
What happens if you ’re not ?
Who will you owe your sincerest apologies to then ?
In light of the tremendous , irrefutable body of evidence that is available , who really is the naive one ?
You , the Highly Intelligent Skeptic , or all the people you so cavalierly insult as being stupid , ignorant savages for looking at this vast body of compelling data … and concluding that it might actually be true ?
You may not have to wait much longer to find the answers to these questions .
We are on the threshold of what may well be the most exciting moment in human history .
Or , shall we say , Earth - born human history .
BIG AND CRAZY THINGS ACTUALLY DO HAPPEN
Despite how surreal it was to watch two of the world ’s tallest buildings crumble to ashes after two planes crashed into them in 2001 , 9/11 actually did happen .
It was 100 - percent real .
No one disputes that fact .
The ‘ bully ’ , so to speak , sure terrorized the whole schoolyard with that one .
9/11 was an incredible , world - changing event that forever altered society as we know it .
In many ways , a formal announcement that “ We Are Not Alone ” would have a similarly vast game - changing effect — quite a bit more than 9/11 .
And I am confident that Disclosure will have a far more positive effect than 9/11 ever did , regardless of whatever plans might be underway to manipulate it for political gain .
We may very well be about to discover , as a planet , that the UFO phenomenon is not a hoax , not a fantasy , nor a delusion — but a very real situation that has been ongoing since well before human beings ever walked the face of the Earth .
Since this entire game is still being played behind the scenes , it can be easy to overlook the stunning clues that have emerged , particularly in more recent times — but that ’s precisely why we wrote this paper .
Once we have a greater understanding of what we ’re looking at — in events that may at first seem completely mysterious , random and inexplicable — the case becomes extremely compelling .
Some of the key factions involved in this grand football game are tired of waiting .
They ’re playing for keeps .
No more treating us like children .
This is it .
Game over .
Childhood ’s End .
We need to know the truth — and we need it now .
THE ‘BAT SIGNAL ’
Considering the evidence we will reveal , the Norway Spiral might be likened to Batman ’s signal — calling in the end of the bully ’s nefarious reign over the schoolyard , with the arrival of not just one , but a whole group of more powerful opponents who can actually defeat him .
They ’ve been working on this for a long time — some two centuries now .
And I ’m not talking about ETs coming in for a landing here …
I ’m talking about other factions of the world ’s leadership structures that are sick and tired of the lies , treachery , deceit and secrecy .
The UFO cover - up sprung out of a toxic system that was already well in place by the 1940s , as we shall discuss .
THE FALL OF THE BULLY
Before we plunge fully into this epic discussion , we can nicely summarize the ‘ hologram ’ of our current situation on Earth with the following analogy :
The bully did n’t want any of the kids in ‘ his ’ schoolyard to play with the other kids — the ones who lived all throughout the neighborhood .
He guarded the gates .
He liked being the Big Fish in a Small Pond .
He told elaborate stories of how evil , treacherous and deceptive the other kids were .
He wanted everyone to respect him and pay him for protection , while fearing anyone and everyone else around them — including him most of all .
If the kids found out they had all these other friends in the neighborhood who could have helped them , they might have quickly forgotten about the bully … and laughed at his once - fearsome authority .
Over the years , the bully grew weak and tired .
He could n’t beat people up anymore , so he started paying his friends to do it .
Now he has run out of money to pay all his friends .
They , too , became tired of all his lies and backstabbing games — so as soon as his money ran out , they ditched him .
It took a while for all the kids on the schoolyard to realize the bully could not hurt them anymore .
His power was so feared , so legendary , that the stories of his beatings continued to awe and inspire them for some time .
But there were cracks in the armor .
A series of signs — irrefutable and undeniable — started happening that gradually made the kids realize the bully ’s power to hurt them had evaporated .
Now all the people he shamed , humiliated and attacked over the years are finally standing up — and they ’re going to tell us the truth .
They ’re going to tell their story … of what it was like to live in fear of this bully for so many years , and never be able to share the secret truth of the horrors he was putting them through .
Once the bully is gone , the children can run and sing and dance and play happily — quickly recovering from the nightmare of abuse they endured for so long .
They wo n’t have to hand over all their lunch money to him and his friends any more .
And they will soon find out they have a lot more friends than they ever could have imagined — regardless of whatever horror stories the bully tried to tell them about how mean and evil all the other kids were .
THE ‘COVER STORY ’ MAKES NO SENSE FROM A TACTICAL STANDPOINT , IN THIS CASE
Let ’s discuss some very basic , common - sense thoughts about the Norway Spiral sighting itself for a minute — before we get into the irrefutable scientific proof — yes , mathematical proof — that the “ official explanation ” must be a lie .
If you still believe the official story that the Spiral was nothing more than a Bulava missile , as almost all mainstream media outlets now suggest , is n’t it interesting that the Russians would have chosen December 9 , 2009 , in skies that were visible over Norway , to do a nuclear missile test — knowing they had decisively failed on every preceding attempt with this prototype , as all the articles said ?
Why would the Russians have set themselves up for such an obvious and epic military failure — in an area the entire world ’s attention was momentarily focused on ?
Could n’t they have waited for a less - conspicuous day to try it out — if there was even the slightest chance it was going to screw up in such a tremendously embarrassing fashion ?
Did you also notice that the video of the Spiral that was aired by Russia Today — one of the mainstream Russian television networks — was much , much clearer and stranger - looking than the grainy , brief versions shown in Western mainstream television media ?
Watch the good - quality Russian version first , followed by the type of plausible - deniability version shown in Western media , and see for yourself .
The first video you see here is from Russia Today , followed by a more typical mainstream - media treatment from CNN .
Embedded video from CNN Video
If it were only a missile , why did the American mainstream media stick to grainy , short clips of it that denied the viewer the full impact of what was really being seen in the Norwegian sky — making it much easier to believe it was merely a rocket malfunctioning , and therefore keeping their audience from understanding what all the fuss was about ?
MANY PEOPLE ARE ‘NOT BUYING IT ’
Regardless of what created the apparition — and we ’ll get to that in a minute — the timing of the event is almost certainly not an accident , nor a coincidence .
For starters , no documented photo or video of a missile failure looks anything close to what we ’ve just seen in Norway .
The only video used by skeptics as ‘ proof ’ that a missile failure could look anything like this is of a typical rocket in flight — complete with the exhaust trail , which then gives off a farty little smoke - ring when it extinguishes .
This does n’t even begin to match up to how awesome the Norway Spiral looks .
In short , the “ official explanation ” was so laughable — so old school — that almost every UFO blogger and enthusiast on Earth wrote about this stunning phenomenon with breathless enthusiasm .
At the time we began this piece on 12/12 , 2009 , when you searched for “ Norway spiral UFO ” on Google , over one million , five hundred eighty thousand hits came up — just three days after it happened :
Similarly , a search for “ spiral ufo video ” yielded 1,120,000 hits , making it very difficult to search for any other phenomena like this that may have appeared in the past .
By any reckoning , this is a very , very big event in UFOlogy — hardly anything else has ever attracted this much attention so quickly .
PYRAMID -SHAPED UFO OVER THE KREMLIN ON THE VERY SAME DAY — 12/9/09
I discussed the Norway Spiral on Whistleblower Radio with Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot the same day Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize — Thursday , December 10th , 2009 .
In this show , we also covered another amazing event that had just occurred .
While I was live on the air , Kerry sent me this link to a video of what appeared to be a gigantic pyramid - shaped UFO hovering over the Kremlin — Russia ’s own equivalent of the White House .
Strangely enough , the Kremlin Pyramid appeared the very same day as the Norway Spiral .
Despite the overwhelmingly strange appearance of the Spiral creating a viral - video sensation , the Kremlin Pyramid video shot to the number - one position on the Russian YouTube ’s most - viewed list .
This then created a mainstream - media television news story on Russia Today , posted here on their website , dated December 11th .
The giant pyramid — actually a tetrahedron , since it has a triangular base rather than a square one — lazily turns in the air like a hot - air balloon , never makes any sudden , jerky moves unlike other alleged UFO sightings , looks fairly grainy in both the daytime and nighttime videos that were shot , and may be an excellent fake … as we will discuss .
The daytime video is only 12 seconds long , taken at a fixed angle , whereas the separate nighttime video was dynamically shot from within a moving car :
VERY DIFFICULT TO FAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON SHORT NOTICE
My own experience as Executive Producer of CONVERGENCE
The Movie , and in doing free videos for Divine Cosmos , has already involved work with computer animators and visual FX staff .
Faking a video like the Kremlin Pyramid Night Shot would require some highly savvy CG post - production and compositing work :
Complex motion tracking so the UFO remains properly and believably positioned relative to the constantly - wobbling items around it , along with the ever - changing camera angles ;
Precisely adjusting the CG light sources in a hypothetical 3D space to remain consistent with all other motion tracking , so the object catches the right reflections as it keeps slowly rolling in the night sky ;
Masking out street lights , power lines , trees and everything else properly so the object appears to be at the proper three - dimensional depth in the shot , leaving no traces of error ; and lastly ,
Perfectly hand - tweaking lighting and opacity settings to compensate for the ever - shifting glare from the windows of the moving car , in addition to all the other 3D lighting concerns .
Thus , even if it was a fake , someone would have needed to put some real time and money into this operation .
However , that still does n’t account for the fact that according to the UK Daily Mail , hundreds of different people witnessed this UFO hovering over the Kremlin the same day the videos came out … with the naked eye !
EITHER HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE LYING , OR SOMETHING WAS REALLY THERE OVER RED SQUARE
Now that we have eyewitness sightings , it becomes extremely unlikely , if not impossible , that such a sophisticated fake as the nighttime video from within a moving car could have been shot , post - produced and rendered out into a finished product … the very same day .
If the videos were indeed fake and produced in advance of the alleged sighting , this suggests a highly premeditated effort in place .
However , if there was indeed an “ unidentified flying object ” in the sky that hundreds of people could see , then why the heck would you need to create a fake video of something other than what people were actually seeing in the first place ?
The only way you could ‘ debunk ’ this sighting is to either say that the hundreds of eyewitnesses reported by Russian mainstream media are lying ( see below ) , or else you have to come up with a physical explanation for whatever was in the sky — such as a gigantic inflatable , like a pyramid - shaped dirigible , and / or some sort of holographic projection .
And again , let ’s not forget — this potential prelude to a “ Landing on the Kremlin Lawn ” in Red Square — rather than the White House lawn — happened on the very same day as the Norway Spiral !
( emphasis added ) :
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1236880/Triangle-UFO-hovering-Kremlin.html
The UFO hovered for hours over Red Square in the Russian capital , and was seen by hundreds of people .
The identity of the shape has not been confirmed , but internet forums are buzzing with the sighting .
The UFO appeared on December 9th , the same night that a mysterious blue spiral light appeared over Norway .
That was later attributed to a failed rocket launch from Russia .
Some have likened the object to one of the spaceships from Star Wars .
But others have said it is merely a reflection from inside the cameraman ’s car .
If the object exists , experts estimate that it could be up to a mile wide .
Some commentators have reacted skeptically to the videos , and have pointed out that if hundreds of people had seen the object , more videos and photos would have emerged by now .
Russian reports ruled out a UFO , but police have refused to comment .
Nick Pope , a former Ministry of Defence UFO analyst , said it was ‘ one of the most extraordinary UFO clips I ’ve ever seen ’ .
‘ At first I thought this was a reflection , but it appears to move behind a power line , ruling out this theory . ’
A spokesman for aerospace journal Jane ’s News said : ‘ We have no idea what it is . ’
Whether real or fake , the timing of the Kremlin Pyramid ’s appearance is consistent with a greater pattern .
Hundreds of people witnessed something hovering over the Russian capitol — on the very same day that the Norway Spiral appeared .
If it is somehow still a fake , it definitely was meant to capture our attention .
And that again raises many new questions as to the motive for doing so .
The story has now even been covered by other mainstream media outlets , including The Independent , Pravda ( who got the date wrong , claiming it was the 18th — and Michael Salla speculates this could be a faction of the Russian government that is trying to deliberately blur the connection to the Norway Spiral ) and even FOX .
Both the Independent and FOX mention how the Russian television media was giving this sighting very heavy - rotation coverage .
If it was a hot - air balloon of some kind , think about the amount of money you would have to spend to create a mile - wide tetrahedron - shaped hot air balloon .
It would be the most massive , not to mention the most expensive balloon ever made — or at least ever openly acknowledged .
If such a technology already did exist in a classified project , why bring it out on that particular day — the very same day as the Norway Spiral ?
TIME TO “ PUT UP OR SHUT UP ”
And why fly the Pyramid directly over Red Square — as if the alleged ETs were ready to produce the Russian equivalent of the proverbial “ landing on the White House lawn , ” thus treating the United States as if it were no longer ‘ relevant ’ as the world ’s sole - remaining superpower ?
Now again , whether you like him or not , carefully consider the fact that two of the “ most extraordinary UFO clips ever seen ” appeared the day before Obama finally got what may be seen as the proper credentials to represent Planet Earth to our extraterrestrial neighbors — a sitting US President who is also a Nobel Peace Prize winner .
You may also be aware that these two huge sightings appeared only 12 days after the Disclosure date that was allegedly planned by the Obama administration — a date which has obviously been postponed to some future point .
Dr. Pete Peterson , a very credible insider , had three different high - level sources in media and government tell him the same story in June 2009 , independently — that Disclosure is indeed imminent .
The date had been set for November 27 , 2009 , and would come from the White House , by Obama himself , as a two - hour television address aired around the world .
Dr. Peterson had been shown the actual scheduled television time that had been booked , and said any time he ’d heard something from three sources of this caliber , it turned out to be true .
It also made tactical sense to have done this on November 27th , as it was the day after Thanksgiving .
Almost all American families would be home together , and thus they would be in a much better position to absorb the impact of such a stunning , world - changing announcement .
Bill and Kerry from Project Camelot , who were with me when we all heard this , both leaked the date — whereas I maintained the secret until after it came and went .
I was almost certain that giving away the secret date ensured it would n’t — nay , could n’t — have happened on that particular day .
But that certainly does n’t mean it wo n’t happen .
A mere twelve days after the initial plan had been dropped , Obama may have been sent a very clear warning — perhaps one of the last of this type he will ever have the chance to receive before the rug is whipped out from under him .
What was the message ?
“ Either make it official … or we ’re going to do it for you . ”
DISCLOSURE ENDGAME
Look at these two huge events — whether real or hoaxed — happening on the very same day .
No matter how you slice it , something is going on here .
And yet we ’ve barely even begun to look at the incredible evidence to support the whole idea that these are end - game events in a grand battle to finally conclude 60 years of UFO secrecy , and bring Disclosure out to the masses , once and for all .
In order to flesh out the evidence for our case further , we need to take a very close look at the Norway Spiral .
Is it a genuine ET manifestation , a failed Russian missile test , or something else entirely … something manmade ?
If we can prove the Norway Spiral is manmade , and is not a missile , this lends even greater support to the idea that a Disclosure Endgame is now playing itself out on the world stage , in real time .
And that is a very exciting prospect indeed — because although these latest events may not be of extraterrestrial origin , a significant percentage of the UFO phenomenon definitely is .
THE OFFICIAL THEORY IS OUT - GASSING MORE AND MORE
The Norway Spiral attracted vastly more attention and analysis than the Kremlin Pyramid — probably because many more people photographed , filmed and witnessed it .
No matter where you were , all throughout Norway , it was quite visible — and very , very strange - looking .
Speculations about what the Spiral is , and “ whodunit , ” are as wide and as far - reaching on the Internet as the formation itself was over the Norwegian sky .
Many people have commented how it clearly seems to be emanating from a single bright point on the ground — looking as if some sort of massive projection system were beaming it up into the sky … using a ‘ blue beam ’ :
Granted , a rocket launched from the ground would have a trail that started from a single point , but it is unlikely that its exhaust would have created such a perfectly round teardrop shape — in addition to creating the blue spiral in the center .
Yet , that is what we might see if a ground - based projection system were beaming up a circular shape into the atmosphere — like the Batman symbol .
We know this image was taken from the island of Tromsø , facing the southeast — hence you can see the sun starting to rise on the horizon .
Many may need to believe this is a missile , so they can continue feeling comfortable in their own ‘ consensus reality ’ for a little longer — but that blue corkscrew spiral hanging in the air for 10 - 15 minutes , never dissipating or fading until after it opened out into a curious , perfectly round “ black hole ” shape , ( see picture below , ) is anything but normal .
HOW DO YOU GET SUCH STABILITY AND LACK OF ‘MIXING ’ BETWEEN THE TWO COLORS ?
If it were indeed a missile , how was it simultaneously creating a perfectly circular spiral that was white — while also maintaining the blue corkscrew formation at the same time ?
Forget the official explanations that say it “ must ” be a missile .
Bottom line : the corkscrew never changes color .
It remains blue .
It does not dissipate , but stays completely visible , as a spiral , without the particles ever spreading out , for 10 - 15 minutes — while the concentric white circles stay completely white !
The ‘ missile ’ does n’t release any other gases , of any color , in any other direction .
Just white , in a perfectly concentric series of spirals , and blue in a bizarre corkscrew spiral that never went away until the whole thing spread apart and disappeared .
We ’re supposed to believe the same missile created two different colors simultaneously — but then they never blended in with each other .
This ‘ missile ’ is starting to sound as supernaturally powerful as Lee Harvey Oswald ’s magic zig - zagging bullet .
If this stunning aerial phenomenon is a natural result of missiles malfunctioning , there should be plenty of other examples that are at least partially as fascinating as this that we can look at .
And yet , there are very few , if any — much to the chagrin of skeptics , who would just as quickly want to forget this had ever happened .
None of these observations will change the conviction and smug arrogance of many skeptics .
They ’re out there .
They ’re completely convinced .
They are Scientific and anyone else is a Dangerous Nutcase .
We know .
Thank you for your opinion .
The truth is about to break free either way .
You ’ll see .
People can think whatever they want — and if something is repeated enough times , you ca n’t help but start to believe it , and thus become convinced that this spectacular formation , the likes of which has never before been seen , must be nothing more than a gorgeously misguided missile .
Or is it ?
IRREFUTABLE SCIENTIFIC
PROOF IT COULD NOT BE A MISSILE
Thanks to the research of our correspondent Arash Amini , we now have irrefutable scientific proof that the Norway Spiral could not have been a missile .
Even if the Spiral was positioned just past the mountains in the below photograph , as it appears to be , the missile exhaust would need to be rotating more than twice as fast as the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth — which was clocked at 318 miles per hour , in the middle of a tornado !
The story begins with a video by Kevin Martin , who was the first to demonstrate , via his clever investigative work with Google Earth , exactly where the mountains in the following photograph are located .
It is a delicious irony that the hard work of a dedicated skeptic provided the very data that completely destroys the official cover - up story , once and for all — even as he was stridently hoping to defend it .
Kevin ’s video , where he argues in favor of the official explanation , can be watched here .
As this 100 - percent verbatim transcript reveals , he takes a condescending , strangely inarticulate and thus inadvertently humorous pot -shot against anyone who thinks it is other than a missile ( this may be why comments are disabled on the video ) :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GSa2wRtZRI
Looks beautiful , but this has been completely explained .
It boggles the mind how high the percent of human intelligence cannot pick out simple explanations like this .
We must be bored , or we feel like we are higher in life than we actually are .
If we continue to think this way in large numbers , we will never expand past the era we are in now .
Considering the future is we are still in the dark ages .
Time to think logically , people .
Ninety percent of human brains cannot compute fluid dynamics , location physics and depth perception .
This is Kevin Martin , meteorologist , reporting for the Southern California weather authority .
Well , I ’m bored enough to compute some location physics — how about you ?
( No offense to Kevin Martin .
Without your excellent research , we might never have gained the critical data needed to disprove the official explanation !
Challenge the data itself , rather than lobbing sophomoric insults at your audience … and the truth will stand on its own ! )
THE WHITE SEA IS ALMOST A THOUSAND KILOMETERS AWAY
In the aforementioned video , Kevin used the position of the visible mountain range in the photo to determine that the White Sea , where the alleged Russian missile was launched , was indeed in the same general direction as the Spiral appears in the photograph .
In his new paper , our correspondent Amini plotted out , on a map , where the alleged missile launch took place in the White Sea .
The important point here is the distance involved — namely 971.26 kilometers , or a little over 600 miles :
The first thing that jumps out here is that if the missile malfunctioned over the White Sea as reported , it should have been visible in northern Russia , Finland and Sweden as well as Norway — yet the island of Tromsø , at point A , was where it was the most visible , and no sightings were reported in Finland or Russia .
NORWEGIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE 100 TIMES CLOSER
The mountain Kevin Martin found via Google Earth is fully 100 times closer than the White Sea — at 9.63 kilometers ( 5.98 miles ) compared to 971.26 kilometers ( 603.5 miles ) :
MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SPIRAL TO BE A MISSILE AT EITHER OF THOSE DISTANCES
Now that we ’ve ( ahem ) computed the location physics , let ’s hear from Amini in his own words — first from the introduction and then the conclusion of this very thorough research paper ( emphasis added ) :
On the morning of December 9th , reports of strange , spinning spirals flooded the internet and media outlets .
They have come to be known as the “ Norway Spirals ” .
Though popularly attributed to a failed test - launch of a Russian “ RSM - 56 Bulava ” Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile ( SLBM ) , it can be shown with some basic trigonometry that this explanation is physically impossible .
From a single , time - lapsed photo and any one of the many videos of the spirals , the speed at which the “ ripples ” caused by the phenomena propagate can be calculated at two limits :
1 ) In the lower limit , the spiral is taken to be directly over the mountain in the photograph ( 9.63 km away ) and the velocity of the “ ripple ” propagation is approximately 316.8m / s. 2 ) In the upper limit , the spiral is taken to be directly over the White Sea ( 971 km away ) and the velocity of the “ ripple ” propagation is found to be approximately 32,873m / s .
It is assumed that the missile , the alleged cause of the spirals , would be somewhere between these two points at the moment of the malfunction .
Yet , these velocities suggest that the observed “ ripples ” cannot be smoke — and therefore the spiral could not be caused by a missile .
GETTING DOWN TO THE NUMBERS — IT JUST SPINS MUCH TOO FAST
After Amini goes through a series of straightforward mathematical proofs , working in the fact that the Spiral rotates at about one cycle per second , as seen in the various videos , he calculates how fast the missile exhaust would have to be spinning — both at the “ lower limit ” distance of 9.63 kilometers and the “ upper limit ” of 971.26 kilometers .
Here ’s the problem — even if the Spiral were only at the “ lower limit ” of 9.63 kilometers away — just past the other side of the mountain , as it clearly appears to be in the photograph — the rotational speed of the arms would still be seven hundred and ten miles per hour — which is over twice as fast as the greatest wind speed ever recorded in human history !
( emphasis added ) :
The lower limit velocity of 316.58m / s is equivalent to about 710 mph .
This is over twice the 318 mph world record for the fastest wind speed recorded ( which was caused by a tornado ) .
The speed of the “ ripple ” propagation at the lower limit is far greater than any particulate could travel in the atmosphere .
Furthermore , the “ ripples ” move away from the center of the spiral with a near constant speed .
Particulates moving at such speeds should dissipate quite rapidly .
This impossible speed is calculated as if the spiral ’s center were above the mountain .
And yet , the further away we assume the spiral is , the larger the speed of the “ ripples . ” …
There is no physically possible distance at which a missile could be the cause of the spirals in question .
Now what the hell is going on here ?
A missile could not have created the Norway Spiral .
There is no longer any question about this .
It is a scientific fact .
We will explore this connection further on the next ‘ page ’ of this Report — entitled The Norway Spiral Explained .

Quick Vote Should Ben Bernanke be confirmed for a second term as Fed chair ?
Yes
No or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On the eve of what 's expected to be a tough confirmation hearing Thursday , one senator has thrown up a political roadblock intended to stymie Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's second term .
Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt. , said late Wednesday that he will put a hold on Bernanke 's nomination .
A hold is an informal practice in which a senator informs the majority leader that he does not want a measure or nomination to reach the floor for a vote .
" The American people overwhelmingly voted last year for a change in our national priorities to put the interest of ordinary people ahead of the greed of Wall Street and the wealthy few , " said Sanders , one of Bernanke 's sharpest critics , in a statement .
" What American people did not bargain for was another four years for one of the key architects of the Bush economy . "
Sanders said Bernanke , who took the helm of the Fed in 2006 , could have averted the financial crisis in several ways , but failed at " core responsibility of the Federal Reserve " and thus " it 's time for him to go . "
Among the litany of reasons he cited for his move , the statement from Sanders ' office noted that unemployment had more than doubled under Bernanke 's watch and more than 120 banks have failed since he became chairman .
Bernanke 's first term expires next month .
Majority leader Sen. Harry Reid , D - Nev. , would not need to recognize Sanders ' hold , but Sanders could filibuster the motion to nominate the Fed chairman for another 4 - year term .
A spokesman for Reid would not comment on the hold by Sanders .
The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on Bernanke 's nomination on Thursday morning .
This is going to come that when you pray there will be no time lapse between you pray and when ...
Few of the hundreds of products on the shelf state ' palm oil ' on the label
In researching Dying for a Biscuit , Panorama asked the makers of the top selling products containing palm oil and the major supermarket chains about their palm oil use .
We also requested information on how they sourced their palm oil and whether or not they participate in the GreenPalm trading scheme , aimed at encouraging growers to produce more sustainable oil .
CADBURY
Cadbury told Panorama that it is a relatively small user of palm oil .
It said it uses the GreenPalm certificate scheme , which rewards producers that produce palm oil in a sustainable fashion .
The company said it has " a road map in place for working towards a practicable segregated supply of sustainable palm oil by 2014 " .
CLOVER ( DAIRY CREST )
The makers of Clover margarine said they share the goal of finding a sustainable source of palm oil for its products .
The company said it is looking into the Green Palm certificate scheme , but " the Green Palm scheme would not guarantee that our products are CSPO ( Certified Sustainable Palm Oil ) and we would not wish to confuse customers " .
Dairy Crest said it is also reviewing its labelling , which currently does not single out palm oil as an ingredient in Clover .
YOUNG'S ( FINDUS )
The makers of the Young 's Chip Shop range of battered fish products told us it has a plan in place to reduce its reliance on unsustainable palm oil and overall use of the oil .
It has already removed palm oil from Young 's Scampi and Cod Fish Fingers .
By 2015 , Findus Group said it will only use sustainable palm oil and in the meantime is increasing the use of sunflower and rapeseed oils in its products .
Findus also said it is not participating in the GreenPalm scheme because " our business is following a journey to exit completely from non-sustainably sourced palm oil " .
GINSTERS
The makers of Ginsters savoury pastries said they too are members of the GreenPalm scheme and that they plan to use only sustainable palm oil within the next 12 months .
The company does not source the 3,250 tonnes of palm oil it uses a year from Indonesia or Malaysia .
Ginsters does not label palm oil in its products , saying " we have had very few consumer inquiries on this matter " .
HARIBO
The sweets manufacturer said it uses small amounts of palm oil in Haribo products and hopes to be able to source sustainable oil by 2012 .
Haribo cream products that contain palm oil include Liquorice Allsorts , Liquorice Favourites , Liquorice Cream Rock , Micro Mix , Dolly Mixtures , Rhubarb & Custard and Strawberries & Cream .
AUNT BESSIE'S ROAST POTATOES ( HEINZ )
Heinz told Panorama that it plans to source sustainable palm oil for its Aunt Bessie 's range " when it becomes truly commercially available " .
The company said it uses very small quantities of the oil and that it is not used in its soups , beans , pasta , ketchup or sauces .
They said they are looking at participating in the GreenPalm trading scheme in 2010 .
CRUNCHY NUT CLUSTERS ( KELLOGGS )
Kelloggs said the vast majority of its cereals do not contain palm oil and , where present , it is in small quantities .
It identified Crunchy Nut Clusters and Special K with Nut Clusters and Almonds as two products that do contain palm oil .
The company said it supports the GreenPalm trading scheme and said it uses palm oil as part of its efforts to replace hydrogenated vegetable oils , which are trans fats , in response to health and nutritional concerns .
Once sourcing sustainable oil is available " at financially and logistically feasible volume , we will move to sustainable palm oil . "
MARS
Mars said it is working towards sourcing 100 % sustainable palm oil by 2015 and hopes to achieve 20 % of that goal by the end of 2010 .
The company said it also hopes to reduce reliance on palm oil by more than 25 % from 2008 levels in its European operations in 2010 .
Mars is not a member of the Roundtable For Sustainable Palm Oil , although it said its suppliers are members .
Its chocolate that contain " small amounts of palm oil " include Mars bars , Galaxy bars and Maltesers .
NESTLE
The makers of Kit Kat , Quality Street and Aero said palm kernel oil is used in a range of confectionery and dairy products , but added that it is not a major ingredient .
It has committed to sourcing sustainable oil by 2015 and said it has no direct links to palm plantations .
GOODFELLA'S PIZZA
Northern Foods , the makers of Goodfella 's Pizza , said from January 2010 , 60 % of the 19,000 tonnes of palm oil it uses annually will be from sustainable sources .
The company said it hopes to use only segregated , sustainable oil by 2012 .
The company said palm oil is used in its biscuits , pizzas and pies .
CHICAGO TOWN PIZZA
The company said that while all Chicago Town pizzas do contain palm oil , it amounts to just 3 % of the raw materials used by the company .
Chicago Town Pizza said none of its palm oil is from a sustainable source , although it said the issue was " high on our agenda as part of a wider company initiative regarding the continuity of supply and volume of raw materials " .
PROCTOR & GAMBLE ( PRINGLES )
Proctor & Gamble said it is committed to buying only sustainable palm oil by 2015 for its range of products that include beauty and household items including detergents , shampoos , hand and body cleansers , soap and colour cosmetics .
The company told Panorama that it uses a small amount of palm oil in Pringles crisps , but the amount used was reduced significantly in 2009 and there are plans to reduce the levels further in 2010 .
PREMIER FOODS
The makers of Hovis bread , Mr Kipling cakes , Cadbury cakes and Bisto gravy granules told Panorama that it uses 30,000 metric tonnes of combined palm / vegetable oil each year .
By 2012 , the company aims to be able to identify the source of its palm oil and blended oil .
Premier Foods said it began using the GreenPalm certificate system in January 2010 .
VANISH
Reckitt Benckiser , makers of Vanish , said it is a small user of a product derived from palm oil .
It said it is committed to sourcing sustainable oil by 2015 .
A spokeswoman for the company said Vanish contains a small volume of palm oil derived natural ingredients .
UNILEVER
The makers of Flora margarine , Knorr soups , Pot Noodles and Dove soap said it is the industry leader in purchasing GreenPalm certificates to encourage sustainable palm oil growth .
For its European business , Unilever said it plans to establish traceability for its palm oil supply chain by 2012 , although not for its palm oil derivatives .
By 2015 , the company said it will only buy certified sustainable palm oil , regardless of cost .
They added that any extra cost would not be passed on to consumers .
Unilever has recently committed to severing its supply chain links with a major Indonesian palm oil producer that Panorama found to be logging illegally in high conservation value rainforest in Borneo .
WARBURTONS
The breadmaker said palm oil accounts for between 15 - 20 % of the blend of oils used in its products .
Warburtons also uses the GreenPalm trading scheme and said it would like to rely on 100 % sustainable oil by 2011 .
WRIGLEY
Wrigley also aims to source only 100 % sustainable oil by 2015 for use in its chewing gum , including Wrigley 's Extra .
The company has not bought GreenPalm certificates and said it uses very small amounts of the oil in its manufacturing .
SAINSBURY'S
In 2008 , Sainsbury 's announced ambitious plans to source sustainable palm oil for its most popular own brand products .
The company estimates that 2,000 of its own brand products contain palm oil .
The supermarket estimates that around 10 % of the palm oil it uses comes from sustainable sources .
It said its strategy is to introduce sustainable sourcing standards to those products that use the greatest volume of palm oil , and to offer sustainable palm oil in the everyday products that customers buy on a regular basis .
The company says it has addressed a substantial proportion of its palm oil footprint since it first began its sustainable palm oil programme in 2008 with basic fish fingers .
ASDA
Asda said any palm oil or palm oil derivatives used in its own label products must be sourced from plantations that are recognised for not endangering vulnerable native forests and their fauna and flora , particularly areas of high conservation value forest or peat lands .
Asda told us it strongly encourages all its suppliers for its own label products to use RSPO ( Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ) certified palm oil and palm kernel oil as soon as possible , but at the very latest this must be achieved by January 2013 and January 2015 respectively .
In the meantime , suppliers can use the GreenPalm trading certificate system .
Currently , palm oil is found in a variety of its products , including margarines , crisps , ready meals , chocolates , soap , candles and cleaning products .
ALDI
Aldi has already introduced a policy to individually name palm oil in its ingredients list for own label products so that customers know which of its products contain the oil .
A company spokesman said Aldi is " aware of the importance of deriving palm oil from sustainable and responsible sources and are developing a policy that covers this . "
The spokesman added that Aldi is reviewing its own label range with a view to finding alternative or sustainable sources and is also developing an on - pack icon to highlight for customers that it contains sustainable palm oil .
TESCO
Tesco told Panorama that most of its palm oil use is found in bakery products , cosmetics , pies , pastries and soaps .
The supermarket giant has publicly committed to using 100 % sustainable palm oil by 2015 .
By 2012 , all suppliers to Tesco 's own brand products must use palm oil that is 100 % traceable as a step towards using only sustainable oil after 2015 .
WAITROSE
Waitrose told us that palm oil is used in about 1,000 of the company 's own - brand products , representing about 10 % of the total range .
It has committed to using 100 % sustainable palm oil by the end of 2012 .
By the end of 2010 , it aims to have achieved 25 % of that goal and it has committed to singling out palm oil as an ingredient on it own label products .
The CO - OPERATIVE
The Co-operative said that as of January this year , 16 of its own brand products are made with sustainable palm oil , and it is in the process of converting 16 more lines to sustainable palm oil by June of this year .
It has committed to using sustainable oil in its own products by 2015 .
Since the mid-1990s , the Co-operative said it has labelled palm oil on its ingredient list .
BIRDS EYE
Birds
Eye have committed to only source palm oil that is certified sustainable under the RSPO Book and Claim method by 2011 .
The company says their palm oil use is less than 5 % of their total oil use and they do not use palm oil for frying .
MARKS & SPENCER
Marks & Spencer told Panorama that they have reduced the use of palm oil in the company 's products wherever possible over the last two years .
Where possible , M&S said it singles out palm oil as an ingredient in its own - label products .
The company is committed to using 100 % fully traceable certified sustainable palm oil in all products by 2015 .
KRAFT FOODS
Kraft told Panorama that it sources its palm oil from Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) members .
But it also told the programme that more needs to be done to enforce guidelines and address deforestation and the impacts of palm oil production on climate change .
Hosting an international event – a conference , a sporting event – is a classic strategy for rebranding a troubled nation .
Concerned that your rigged elections and abysmal human rights record makes you look a little backwards ?
Host an international meeting on information technology to prove you ’re firmly rooted in the 21st century .
( Yeah , that went well . )
Concerned that you ’re better known for violent civil war and land mines than for your booming oil industry and bustling capital ?
Host the Africa Cup of Nations !
Actually , hosting Africa ’s biggest football tournament – that is , up until the World Cup later this year – was probably a good branding move for Angola , which has made vast strides since the Angolan civil war ended in 2002 .
The mistake was in holding one of four sets of matches in Cabinda .
It proved to be a tragic , deadly mistake : Separatist guerillas attacked a convoy of team buses , led by Angolan military , as they travelled from Congo - Brazaville into Cabinda , killing three members of the Togolese national team ’s entourage and wounding nine others .
If the world ’s media was n’t busy asking itself , “ Where the heck is Yemen ? “ , we ’d probably be asking “ Where ’s Cabinda ? ”
It ’s not in Angola – at least , it ’s not geographically contiguous with Angola – it ’s a small enclave separated from Angola by a 60 km wide strip of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
About the size of Puerto Rico , it ’s ethnically and linguistically separate from the rest of Angola – Cabindans speak Cabind�s and French , rather than Portuguese .
About 100,000 Cabindans live in Cabinda – twice as many live in exile in neighboring Congo - Brazzaville and DRCongo .
Oh , and Cabinda is very , very rich .
Which is to say , it ’s got 60 % of Angola ’s oil … and Angola is now the largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa .
( According to one history , Cabinda is part of Angola through Chevron ’s support of Angolan MPLA forces in 1975 . )
As often happens in resource - rich nations , Cabinda does n’t see much of that oil money , a major grievance of the Cabindan people .
A recent agreement invests 10 % of oil profits into Cabinda .
That agreement helped the Angolan government achieve a ceasefire with some members of the FLEC – Forces for the Liberation of Cabinda .
At least one faction of FLEC – the Forces for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - Military Position ( FLEC - PM ) – was n’t on board with this plan .
Their general secretary Rodrigues Mingas told the media that he ’d warned Cup of Nations organizers not to hold matches in Cabinda , as his faction of FLEC considered themselves to be at war with Angolan forces .
Mingas went on to apologize for the loss of Togolese life :
We did n’t specifically target the Togolese .
It could have been Angola , Ivory Coast , Ghana …
Anything is possible , ” he said .
“ We are at war , and it ’s no holds barred . ”
“ We always regret the death of human beings but there are also thousands of Cabindans killed over 35 years , ” he said .
Obviously , the attack by FLEC - PM on unarmed footballers is a horrific and disgusting act of terrorism .
But it ’s hard to imagine the Angolans screwing the situation up much more thoroughly .
First , hosting matches in Cabinda was clearly a political decision designed to demonstrate Angola ’s firm hold over this disputed territory .
Colin Droniou , writing for the AFP , observes that police presence in Cabinda is currently higher than normal , but quips : “ Normal in Cabinda means one soldier for every 10 residents . ”
Human Rights
Watch reports that those military forces are routinely involved with the detention and torture of rebels .
The Angolan government had to know that there was a risk of violence during the tournament , a risk they could have mitigated by moving matches out of Cabinda .
One analyst calls the decision to host matches in Cabinda “ stupid and tragic “ .
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has refused to move the matches – instead , he ’s increased security .
And tournament organizers have been less than accomodating towards
Togo , whose backup goalkeeper is in hospital in South Africa and one of whose coaches was killed in the assault on their bus .
Togo ’s players returned home for three days of national mourning , and requested that the organizers allow them to return and play a delayed opening match against Ghana .
The organizers refused , and Togo has evidently been disqualified for failing to arrive for their scheduled match .
The other teams competing in Cabinda – Ghana , Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso – all had discussions about whether to pull out of the competition , but elected to stay and play .
The results of an attack like this one are complex and far - reaching .
Obviously , the attack has called attention to FLEC ’s cause and the “ forgotten war ” in Cabinda .
Whether that attention helps their cause – or causes the Angolan military to attempt to crush them once and for all – is unclear .
Angola , which had been hoping to showcase its newfound stability and prosperity , has probably taken a major step in the wrong direction .
It ’s possible that the attacks in Cabinda will make it significantly harder to host international football tournaments in the future .
Kevin Eason , writing in the Times of London , points out that African football teams generally can’t insure their players when they travel to a location like Cabinda .
Some of the stars on African sides might have anti-kidnapping coverage through their European clubs – many others do n’t .
It ’s likely that top European sides may be more reluctant to release players like Didier Drogba or Michael Essian to play in tournaments like the Cup of Nations if they ’re worried not just about injury , but about kidnapping and death .
The killings in Cabinda are also putting a dark cloud over the upcoming World Cup in South Africa … even though the countries do n’t share a border .
Critics of the decision to host the World Cup in South Africa suggest that the attacks in Cabinda point to the “ danger ” of the African continent .
Danny Jordaan , the leader of South Africa ’s organizing committee , responded to this suggestion angrily : “ The world understands that sovereign countries are responsible for their own safety and security and to say what happened in Angola impacts on the World Cup in South Africa is the same as suggesting that when a bomb goes off in Spain , it threatens London�s ability to host the next Olympics .
It is nonsensical for South Africa to be tainted with what happens in Angola … ”
Nonsensical , yes , but it seems likely that the attack in Cabinda could change the travel plans of some global football fans .
Perhaps they should consider the fact that the Confederations Cup , and the U - 17 and U - 20 tournaments all took place this year on the African continent and went without a hitch .
Meanwhile , Cabindan rebels threaten more attacks .
My fingers are crossed for the Ghanaian , Burinabe and Ivorian players , the fans and everyone in Cabinda .
Stories like this one take you into some of the stranger corners of the Internet .
Reading about Cabinda , I learned that the country was a member of UNPO , the Unrepresented Nations and People ’s Organization , an international group for peoples , territories and groups that are n’t recognized by the UN .
UNPO is able to point to four former members who ’ve gone on to become recognized , soverign nations .
And they ’ve got fifty four members , who range from an Australian aboriginal group to Somaliland , which often functions more effectively than its nominal parent nation , Somalia .
It ’s fascinating to imagine the conversations at UNPO , especially given that one of the members is Freedom Front Plus , an Afrikaner group that seeks a separatist Afrikaner volkstat in the Northern Cape of South Africa .
I wonder if they and the Cabindans ever meet for friendly soccer matches ?

The best way to stop deaths on building sites is to empower building unions and workers .
That means the Rudd Labor Government abolishing the anti-union Australian Building and Construction Commission and workers reclaiming their power to enforce safety standards through strike action .
After all , who has real interests in workplace safety , and who has the power to deliver it ?
Workers .
The bosses ’ real interest is profit , not safety .
Howard set up the ABCC to smash building unions , one of the last group of workers in Australia with any tradition of strike action .
Rudd Labor have continued this anti-union abomination for the same reason .
What has been the impact of the ABCC on safety standards ?
As I wrote in Is Ark Tribe Labor ’s next political prisoner ?:
Ever since the ABCC began its crusade against building workers and against their willingness to strike over safety issues , deaths and injuries on building sites have increased .
The year before the ABCC crawled from Howard ’s swamp there were no deaths on building sites in Victoria .
Now there are ten a year .
Without unions able to enforce standards through industrial action bosses have cut corners on safety to increase their profits .
Profit is king and a few extra deaths are n’t important to the bosses and the ABCC .
Every year 50 workers die on building sites around Australia .
In the name of stopping the lawlessness of death and injury on sites is n’t it time the ABCC attacked the building bosses to enforce safety standards ?
But they wo n’t because their real role is to tame the building unions .
Where was the ABCC when the shonks predictably moved in to the roof insulation business and put badly trained workers at risk ?
Perhaps they were too busy trying to imprison Ark Tribe for the heinous crime of refusing to answer their questions about , you guessed it , a meeting on a safety issue .
Meanwhile the real criminals were cutting corners ( literally ) , rushing to put foil in roofs and not training people properly .
Unions could have enforced safety if there had been a program of empowering workers in the industry instead of worshipping at the feet of the white shoe brigade and quick bucks .
The Act setting up the ABCC says that one of its objects is ‘ improving occupational health and safety in building work ’ .
How is that coming along , Julia Gillard ?
The Act even sets up a Federal Safety Commissioner to , among other things , ‘ promote occupational health and safety in building work ’ .
Where were they , Julia , when young kids were dying putting insulation foil in roofs ?
Could it be the real role of the Gillard Gestapo is to handcuff unions to stop them enforcing safety standards so the bosses can make more profits ?
Could it be their real role is to tame the building unions so that other workers wo n’t draw obvious lessons – strikes can enforce safety standards and win better conditions ?
Not voting Labor , not voting Green , not voting Liberal ( shudder ! ) , not relying on ‘ independent ’ state bodies , but workers using their power in the workplace .
That would mean breaking Labor ’s laws .
No strike is illegal ( something some in the ALP used to believe ) .
If the choice is between breaking the law by striking to enforce safety standards and protect lives or doing nothing and watching people die , I ’m for breaking the law .
Older mothers are more likely than younger ones to have a child with autism , and older fathers significantly contribute to the risk of the disorder when their partners are under 30 , researchers are reporting .
In a study published online on Monday in the journal Autism Research , the researchers analyzed almost five million births in California during the 1990s , and 12,159 cases of autism diagnosed in those children  a sample large enough to examine how the risk of autism was affected when one parent was a specific age and the other was the same age or considerably older or younger .
Previous research found that the risk of autism grew with the age of the father .
The new study suggested that when the father was over 40 and the mother under 30 , the increased risk was especially pronounced  59 percent greater than for younger men .
By contrast , for women 30 and older , the risk of autism rose 13 percent when the father was over 40 .
Objective : Information about the psychiatric histories of adults with anxiety disorders was examined to further inform nosology and etiological / preventive efforts .
Method :
The authors used data from a prospective longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort ( N=1,037 ) from ages 11 to 32 years , making psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM criteria .
For adults with anxiety disorders at 32 years , follow - back analyses ascertained first diagnosis of anxiety and other juvenile disorders .
Results :
Of adults with each type of anxiety disorder , approximately half had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder ( one - third with an anxiety disorder ) by age 15 .
The juvenile histories of psychiatric problems for adults with different types of anxiety disorders were largely nonspecific , partially reflecting comorbidity at 32 years .
Histories of anxiety and depression were most common .
There was also specificity .
For example , adults with panic disorder did not have histories of juvenile disorders , whereas those with other anxiety disorders did .
Adults with posttraumatic stress disorder had histories of conduct disorder , whereas those with other anxiety disorders did not .
Adults with specific phobia had histories of juvenile phobias but not other anxiety disorders .
Conclusions : Strong comorbidity between different anxiety disorders and lack of specificity in developmental histories of adults with anxiety disorders supports a hierarchical approach to classification , with a broad class of anxiety disorders having individual disorders within it .
The early first diagnosis of psychiatric difficulties in individuals with anxiety disorders suggests the need to target research examining the etiology of anxiety disorders and preventions early in life .
Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric difficulties throughout the life course ( 1 – 4 ) .
In addition to causing human suffering , these disorders entail substantial economic burden ( 5 ) .
The developmental histories of these disorders are largely neglected in DSM - IV .
However , retrospective studies suggest that anxiety disorders begin early in life — the National Comorbidity Study Replication ( 2 ) estimates the median age of onset for any anxiety disorder to be 11 years — and these problems often remain untreated for many years .
Although researchers have developed sophisticated methodologies to promote accurate recall in retrospective studies , they acknowledge that biases may remain in retrospective reporting , especially when respondents are asked to estimate age at onset of disorders that occurred long ago ( 2 , 6 ) .
Prospective follow - back studies are , therefore , needed to provide more precise knowledge about the developmental histories of anxiety disorders .
This information can be used to inform classification decisions in nosological systems , target research efforts aimed at elucidating the etiology of anxiety disorders , and help target prevention strategies .
Information about developmental histories can inform nosology ( 7 ) .
Indeed , there is a great deal of debate concerning the best way to categorize anxiety disorders ( 8 ) .
Anxiety disorders may be split into small homogeneous groups or may be “ lumped ” into a single phenotype .
Hints as to the best way to classify anxiety disorders come from three lines of research .
First , factor analyses suggest that although it is appropriate to draw general distinctions between internalizing and externalizing disorders , there are also distinctions between different types of anxiety .
Indeed , two independent reports indicate that in addition to a general distinction between internalizing and externalizing disorders , it is possible to draw distinctions within the higher - order internalizing factor .
Specifically , there is a second - order factor wherein generalized anxiety disorder is grouped with depression and distinguished from other anxiety disorders ( specific and social phobias as well as panic and agoraphobia ) ( 8 – 10 ) .
Second , studies of shared vulnerability suggest that different anxiety disorders are influenced by the same factors .
These studies have also emphasized distinctions between specific disorders .
For example , twin research suggests that the genetic etiology of specific phobias may be largely distinct from that of other anxiety disorders ( 11 , 12 ) .
Further risk factors , such as physical and sexual abuse , are also associated with a variety of anxiety disorders in adulthood .
However , research also points to the possibility that there are elevated rates of abuse in patients with specific types of anxiety disorders .
Illustrating this point , two studies have suggested that adults with panic disorder relative to other anxiety disorders are particularly likely to have suffered physical and sexual abuse as children ( 13 , 14 ) .
Finally , treatment research suggests commonalities between different anxiety disorders .
For example , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) can be effective in treating a variety of anxiety disorders , including panic disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , social anxiety , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) ( 15 ) .
However , SSRIs are not typically used in the treatment of specific phobias , emphasizing the aforementioned distinction between phobias and other anxiety disorders .
Similarly , there are commonalities in cognitive behavior therapies for different anxiety disorders ( such as the focus on phenomenology in the development of treatments ) , although there are also clear differences in the content of these therapies for different anxiety disorders ( 16 ) .
Another relatively unexplored way of informing nosology is to examine the developmental course of disorders .
If different anxiety disorders have different histories , this may suggest that there are important distinctions between these disorders that should be reflected in nosological systems .
Conversely , the absence of differences in the developmental histories of anxiety disorders may suggest that it is more appropriate to categorize these disorders together .
Follow - forward analyses have informed this issue by showing that anxious behaviors predict a range of subsequent anxiety disorders ( 17 ) .
However , there is also evidence of specificity in the course of phobias ( 18 ) .
Follow - back studies are also able to inform this issue , although relevant studies of this nature have not yet been reported .
Information about the developmental histories of disorders is also essential for understanding and effectively preventing later psychopathology .
For example , the early onset of anxiety disorders would suggest that research exploring risk factors for the development of anxiety needs to begin early in life , as do preventions .
If a certain disorder is particularly likely to precede anxiety disorders , targeting individuals with this disorder may be particularly useful in preventing future occurrence of anxiety disorders .
In an effort to inform classification decisions , target research efforts , and inform preventions , this study investigated the developmental histories of adult anxiety disorders using a follow - back design .
We distinguished different anxiety disorders at age 32 years and examined the age at which study members were first diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and the types of psychiatric disorders occurring developmentally .
We tested whether there was 1 ) strict homotypic continuity , whereby anxiety disorders were preceded by anxiety ; 2 ) broad homotypic continuity , whereby anxiety disorders were more likely to be preceded by internalizing than externalizing disorders ; and 3 ) heterotypic continuity , whereby anxiety disorders were also preceded by externalizing disorders .
This study advances knowledge in two key ways .
First , many longitudinal studies have either collapsed all anxiety disorders into one group ( 19 , 20 ) or have primarily focused upon a single anxiety disorder ( e.g. , panic [ 21 ] ) .
In contrast , few studies have examined longitudinal intra-anxiety associations .
Here , we compare among anxiety disorders .
Second , although studies have examined the lifetime co-occurrence of anxiety disorders ( 22 ) , few studies have asked the longitudinal question about similarities and differences in the developmental history of different anxiety disorders .
Here , we examine longitudinal associations .
Previously , we reported that adults with any anxiety disorder — like those with an affective , substance use , or psychotic disorder — are highly likely to have a childhood psychiatric history ( 23 ) .
This report elaborates on the type of psychiatric history and examines specificity among the anxiety disorders .
Method
Participants
Participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study , a longitudinal investigation of the health and behavior of a complete birth cohort .
The cohort of 1,037 children ( 52 % male ) was constituted at 3 years of age when the investigators enrolled 91 % of consecutive births from April 1 , 1972 , through March 31 , 1973 , in Dunedin , New Zealand .
Cohort families were primarily white and represented the full range of socioeconomic status in the general population of New Zealand ’s South Island .
At each assessment age , participants ( including emigrants living overseas ) were brought back to the research unit for a full day of individual data collection .
At each assessment , psychiatric interviewing was conducted blind to all study data , as was the assigning of diagnoses .
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating universities .
After complete description of the study to the subjects , written informed consent was obtained from parents up to age 15 and thereafter from the study members .
Follow - up evaluations have been performed at 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 26 , and most recently 32 years of age ( N=972 , 96 % of the living cohort members ) .
In this article , we report all available diagnostic data gathered at all ages from 11 to 32 years for the 963 individuals who received a psychiatric interview at 32 years .
Psychiatric Diagnoses
Mental health was assessed in private standardized interviews with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children for the younger ages ( 11 –15 years ) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for the older ages ( 18 – 32 years ) , with a reporting period of 12 months at each age .
Diagnoses were assigned according to the criteria of DSM - III at ages 11 , 13 and 15 ; DSM - III -R at ages 18 and 21 ; and DSM - IV at ages 26 and 32 .
Procedures , reliability , validity , prevalence , and evidence of impairment for diagnoses in the cohort are reported elsewhere ( 1 , 24 – 27 ) .
The seven anxiety disorders diagnosed at 32 years were generalized anxiety disorder , OCD , PTSD , panic disorder , agoraphobia , specific phobia , and social phobia .
Psychiatric diagnoses from assessments before 32 years of age are presented in diagnostic families .
Between 18 – 26 years these included 1 ) anxiety disorders , 2 ) major depressive episode , 3 ) substance use disorders ( alcohol dependence , marijuana dependence , and other drug dependence ) , and 4 ) conduct disorder ( at 18 years only ) .
Between 11 –15 years , diagnoses included 1 ) anxiety disorders ( overanxious disorder , separation anxiety , phobias ) , 2 ) depressive disorders , 3 ) conduct disorder ( including oppositional defiant disorder at 11 and 13 years ) , and 4 ) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Self - reported delusional beliefs and hallucinatory experiences were also examined at 11 years ( 28 , 29 ) .
Statistical Analyses
Prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders and their developmental diagnostic histories are reported , with sex differences in morbidity presented for each disorder ( sex ratios are set against 1 for male respondents ) .
Concurrent associations between disorders at 32 years are demonstrated by providing the percentage of cases with one anxiety disorder that have also been identified with another anxiety disorder .
Follow - back longitudinal analyses were conducted to determine what percentage of anxiety cases at age 32 had a developmental history characterized by 1 ) any disorder and 2 ) an anxiety disorder .
Significance testing was carried out using chi-square analyses .
Results
Of the seven anxiety disorders at age 32 , the 1 - year prevalence rates ranged from 2 % ( PTSD , OCD , and panic ) to 9 % ( social phobia ) ( Table 1 ) .
More women than men experienced most anxiety disorders .
Table 1 also shows concurrent comorbidity between the various anxiety disorders , underscoring its extent .
For example , 30 % of those with generalized anxiety disorder met criteria for social phobia , and only 13 % of those suffering panic disorder did not meet criteria for another anxiety disorder .
Table 2 presents the mental health history of study members who met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at 32 years .
Virtually all persons who met criteria at age 32 years for a DSM - IV anxiety disorder in the preceding 12 months had met criteria for a psychiatric disorder at an earlier age ( range for specific diagnoses : 88 %–100 % ) , and of these at least 50 % had met diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder by age 15 ( see also Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . Age at First Psychiatric and Anxiety Disorder Diagnosis Among Adults With an Anxiety Disorder at Age 32
Table 2 also presents the anxiety disorder histories of study members who met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at age 32 .
Over 75 % of persons diagnosed at age 32 with any DSM - IV anxiety disorder in the preceding 12 months had met criteria for an anxiety disorder at an earlier age ( range for specific diagnoses : 78%–96 % ) , and over one - third had an anxiety disorder before age 15 ( see also Figure 1 ) .
Follow - back analyses focused on prior diagnoses when participants were 11 – 15 years of age , since this period clearly reflects a juvenile phase in development and represents a propitious opportunity for early intervention .
The prevalence of childhood disorders in the overall sample at 11 to 15 years of age is presented in Figure 2 ( panel A ) .
Figure 2 . Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders Diagnosed at Age 32 and Juvenile Disorders * p<0.05 .
**p<0.01 .
Figure 2 also shows follow - back analyses for each of the seven different age 32 anxiety disorders ( panels B–H ) .
Three findings are noteworthy .
First , all adult cases of anxiety had an excess of juvenile anxiety disorders .
This association reached significance for each anxiety disorder , with the exception of panic disorder .
Second , adult cases of anxiety , regardless of the specific disorder , were also more likely to have experienced juvenile depression relative to those without adult anxiety .
This association was significant for each type of anxiety disorder except for specific phobias and panic disorder .
Third , adults with certain anxiety disorders ( social phobia , agoraphobia , and PTSD ) were significantly more likely to have experienced externalizing spectrum disorders than those without these disorders .
Most strikingly , adults with PTSD were likely to have met diagnostic criteria for conduct or oppositional defiant disorder .
Figure 3 looks more specifically at the kinds of juvenile anxiety disorders that characterized adults who met diagnostic criteria for each of the seven anxiety disorders .
Three findings are particularly salient .
First , there was very little specificity in the association between adult and juvenile anxiety disorders .
For the most part , regardless of their specific form , adult anxiety cases were more likely than comparison adults to have been diagnosed with overanxious disorder , separation anxiety , and phobias .
Second , adult cases of specific phobia stand out for having a significant developmental history of juvenile phobias , but not of overanxious disorder or separation anxiety .
Third , adult cases of panic disorder stand out for having no significant developmental history of anxiety disorder .

Discussion
This study examined the developmental histories of adults with anxiety disorders using a prospective follow - back design in order to inform nosology , to target research efforts aimed at understanding etiological mechanisms , and to inform preventions .
Five main results emerged .
First , the developmental stage at which study members were first diagnosed with a disorder was similar for adults with different types of anxiety disorders .
Adults with anxiety disorders typically experienced a psychiatric disorder — and more specifically an anxiety disorder — early in life , and there were few “ new ” cases emerging later in life .
Second , there was evidence for strict homotypic continuity , and it was found that adults with all anxiety disorders ( except panic ) had experienced significantly more anxiety disorders as juveniles and that juvenile anxiety disorders were the most common history across all adult anxiety diagnoses .
Third , there was also evidence for broad homotypic continuity , whereby adults with most types of anxiety also had a juvenile history of depression .
Fourth , there was little evidence for heterotypic continuity , since adults with anxiety disorders did not typically have a significant history of externalizing disorders or psychotic symptoms .
Finally , there was some evidence of specificity .
Three trends are particularly noteworthy : adults with PTSD , as opposed to other anxiety disorders , had juvenile histories of conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder ; adults with OCD , but not other anxiety disorders , tended to have childhood self - reports of delusional beliefs and hallucinatory experiences ( although not statistically significant , the odds ratio was 2.49 ) ; and there was some evidence of specificity within phobias , with specific phobias in adulthood preceded by juvenile phobias but not other anxiety disorders .
Although the significance of differences between developmental histories of adults with different anxiety disorders was not examined because of anxiety disorder comorbidity at 32 years , these associations appeared despite the overlap between anxiety disorders in adulthood and chime well with previous research highlighting these associations ( 18 , 30 , 31 ) .
Implications
The five main results of this study have implications for nosology , etiology , and prevention .
Four of the five main results suggest that a general approach to the classification of anxiety disorders may be warranted .
Indeed , there were similarities in the developmental histories of the different anxiety disorders in terms of the juvenile stage at which sufferers were first diagnosed with a disorder and the types of disorders occurring previously , generally internalizing disorders .
Similar developmental histories are not unexpected , given the comorbidity of different anxiety disorders at 32 years .
It should also be acknowledged that some of the more specific findings , including the finding that specific phobias in adulthood were associated with juvenile phobias but not other disorders , suggest that certain disorders may warrant classification independent of other anxiety disorders .
Overall , our findings fit well with a proposed hierarchical approach to classification , with a broad class of internalizing disorders having individual anxiety disorders within it ( 8 ) .
The history of disorders in adults with anxiety disorders also suggests that research aimed at understanding the etiology of anxiety needs to begin early in life , and before the youngest age assessed here .
This finding points to the need to improve methods of assessing anxiety in young children .
In line with previous suggestions ( 2 , 23 ) , our findings also suggest that prevention efforts should begin early in life .
Similar conclusions have been drawn concerning other adult disorders , including depression , eating , and substance use disorders ( 23 ) .
As for whom should be targeted early in life , the results of this study indicate that those who experience depression or anxiety ( particularly phobias , which preceded six of the seven anxiety disorders ) as juveniles may be particularly good candidates for prevention .
Given the longitudinal overlap between different types of anxiety disorders , developing general techniques to help individuals deal with various anxiety symptoms may be particularly beneficial .
Once administered , preventions and interventions can have long - term benefits ( 32 ) .
Although the practical difficulties of attempting to prevent the development of anxiety in the general population are formidable , educating those who have regular contact with children ( e.g. , teachers ) to identify and help particularly anxious children could prove fruitful , as could addressing anxiety in children visiting general practitioners for routine check - ups .
Clinicians who treat adults with anxiety disorder may find their case conceptualizations benefit from information about their client ’s developmental mental health histories .
Indeed , knowing that the dysfunctional cognitions and behaviors that are being addressed in cognitive behavior therapy sessions are likely to have emerged early in life may help the clinician to trace and address the origins of such thoughts and behaviors .
Limitations
Despite the strengths of this study , including the use of an entire birth cohort , prospective measures , and the low attrition rate , there were a number of limitations .
First , juvenile data were recorded in a way that did not distinguish social and specific phobias , although given the prevalence rates reported in other studies ( 18 ) it is likely there were more specific phobias than social phobias in this cohort .
This limitation is particularly noteworthy because previous research has demonstrated specificity within phobias ( adolescent simple phobia predicted simple phobia in adulthood whereas social phobia in adolescence predicted later social phobia [ 18 ] ) .
Second , the standardized diagnostic interview we used to examine juvenile disorders may have difficulties in identifying and distinguishing certain anxiety disorders ( 33 ) .
Third , psychiatric disorders were first examined when the study members were 11 years old .
However , it is possible that some cases of anxiety disorders began before this age ( 2 , 34 ) .
Indeed , we may have missed important information about a number of disorders such as separation anxiety disorder , which typically occurs early in life and has been linked to a range of anxiety disorders later in life ( 35 ) .
This limitation , together with 1 - year gaps between juvenile assessments , means that early difficulties experienced by adults with anxiety disorders may be undercounted in this report .
Fourth , although we waited until age 32 years to carry out these analyses ( since this is past the peak age of anxiety onset ) , new cases of anxiety will appear later in life ( 2 ) , so the associations reported here may not apply to older adults .
The fifth limitation is that there were small subject numbers for certain groups of anxiety disorders at 32 years , with associated lack of power .
Care should be taken in drawing conclusions from null results , such as the finding that panic disorder ( which was only experienced by 16 study members at 32 years ) was not associated with any juvenile disorder .
While this finding is consistent with the age at onset of panic disorder reported in the National Comorbidity Study Replication ( median 25 years with 75 % having onset later than 16 years [ 2 ] ) , it may also reflect in part the DSM categorical approach , and it is possible that there would have been continuity had symptom scales been examined or if the DSM - IV disorder threshold were lower .
Sixth , we aimed to add information beyond prior studies ( which studied only one disorder , or lumped all anxiety disorders into one group ) by making comparisons among the different adult anxiety disorders .
However , because of the high levels of comorbidity we observed among the adult anxiety disorders , our study group size did not allow us to test for the statistical significance of the comparisons between each adult anxiety disorder and healthy comparison subjects while controlling for all other adult anxiety disorders .
Nevertheless , we presented the findings for each disorder separately to stimulate hypotheses for future studies with larger samples .
Seventh , since this report focuses upon a single cohort , the results of this study may not apply to other birth cohorts .
This is particularly salient as cohort differences have been suggested for certain anxiety disorders ( 2 ) .
Given similarities in the developmental histories of adults with different types of anxiety disorders , it may be wise to categorize these disorders together , while at the same time acknowledging differences between disorders .
Our results also document that anxiety , as seen with other psychiatric disorders , first begins early in life .
The diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of anxiety disorders may benefit from including this type of information in future editions of DSM .
Wole Soyinka , the first African winner of the literature prize , claimed the Nigerian student who tried to blow up a jet over Detroit on Christmas Day , was radicalised during his time at University College London .
The criticism comes amid a growing row between Nigeria , Britain and Yemen about where Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab turned to violent extremism .
Hillary Clinton , the US Secretary of State , said last week that “ ideology knows no boundaries ” and the blame for Abdulmutallab ’s extremism could not be “ pinned on any one place ” .
But Mr Soyinka , 76 , who was born in Nigeria and studied at Leeds University in the 1950s , said : “ England is a cesspit .
England is the breeding ground of fundamentalist Muslims .
“ Its social logic is to allow all religions to preach openly .
But this is illogic , because none of the other religions preach apocalyptic violence .
And yet England allows it . ”

Just prior to Copenhagen , there was a flurry of news stories about Greenland melt accelerating and sea level rising up to seven meters , like this one from Spiegel .
11/13/2009 A Warming Arctic Greenland ’s Ice Sheet Melting Faster than Ever By Christoph Seidler Everyone knows that the ice sheet on Greenland is melting .
But new research shows it is disappearing much faster than previously thought .
The findings could mean that ocean levels are also rising more quickly .
As a corollary , some climatologists have speculated ( as recently as this week ) that cold water pouring into the North Atlantic from Greenland melt will cause the Gulf Stream to collapse and an ice age to set in across Europe .
‘ Glaciers on Snowdon ’ warning by climate expert Jan 12 2010 by Rhodri Clark , Western Mail THIS winter ’s prolonged cold spell could be a taste of things to come for Wales – with glaciers a possibility within 40 years .
That ’s the chilly message from a leading Welsh climate expert who has warned that global warming could paradoxically trigger a collapse in temperatures in western Europe .
It is simple enough to show how unlikely these claims are .
If the Greenland ice sheet was melting at an accelerated rate and pouring cold water into the North Atlantic , we would necessarily see two side effects :
Increased rate of sea level rise Cold water around Greenland
In fact , we see neither of these things happening .
Over the last four years sea level rise has slowed , and over the last fifteen years sea level has been rising at an average of only 32 cm per century .
This is an order of magnitude less than the predictions of alarmists .
Source : University of Colorado Sea Level Lab
The Spiegel article further claims :
In the period between 2000 and 2008 , the dwindling glaciers have been responsible for the sea level rising by an average of about half a millimeter per year .
However , during the last three years of observation , the value rose to 0.75 millimeters per year .
According to the researchers , these results could indicate that the sheet of ice is melting at an accelerated rate .
These claims are not supported by the University of Colorado data .
Since 1900 , sea level has been rising at about 20 cm per century , and has n’t changed much recently – as seen in the graph below .

Is there evidence of cold water around Greenland pouring into the North Atlantic ?
No , quite the opposite .
Sea Surface Temperatures around Greenland have running consistently above normal .
Below are SST maps for the end of July ( peak melt season ) for 2007 - 2009 .

How about winter ?
Same story – warmer than normal temperatures around Greenland at the end of December 2007 - 2009 .

http://weather.unisys.com/archive/sst/sst_anom-091227.gif
Even if all this speculation was true and the Gulf Stream did slow down and colder weather started to set in – Greenland would stop melting , causing the whole process to reverse .
In other words , do n’t book any glacier climbing vacations in Wales quite yet .

Imagine you are almost dozing in a lounge chair outside , with a magazine on your lap .
Suddenly , a fly lands on your arm .
You grab the magazine and swat at the insect .
What was going on in your brain after the fly landed ?
And what was going on just before ?
Many neuroscientists have long assumed that much of the neural activity inside your head when at rest matches your subdued , somnolent mood .
In this view , the activity in the resting brain represents nothing more than random noise , akin to the snowy pattern on the television screen when a station is not broadcasting .
Then , when the fly alights on your forearm , the brain focuses on the conscious task of squashing the bug .
But recent analysis produced by neuroimaging technologies has revealed something quite remarkable : a great deal of meaningful activity is occurring in the brain when a person is sitting back and doing nothing at all .

Cressida Dick became a Met commander in July 2001
The senior Metropolitan Police officer who led the operation that ended with the death of Jean Charles de Menezes in south London has been honoured .
Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick was awarded a Queen 's Police Medal for distinguished service .
She oversaw the operation that mistook Mr de Menezes for a suicide bomber - he was shot at Stockwell Tube station in July 2005 .
Campaigners for the family said they were disappointed about the honour .
Cmdr Dick , 47 , was born and brought up in Oxford .
She was educated at Oxford High School , went on to join the university and graduated from Balliol College .
She has had a notable career at Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police and is now arguably Britain 's most senior woman officer .
Rewarding Ms Dick after her role in the biggest policing scandal of the decade displays woeful disregard for both the de Menezes family and broader public opinion
Family spokesman
But her actions over Mr de Menezes ' death were scrutinised in great detail during an Old Bailey health and safety prosecution and a public inquest .
In a rare move , the Old Bailey jury ruled against the force but said Ms Dick should be absolved of any personal culpability .
But a spokesman for the de Menezes family criticised the awarding of the honour .
" Rewarding Ms Dick after her role in the biggest policing scandal of the decade displays woeful disregard for both the de Menezes family and broader public opinion .
" It is only one year since an inquest jury flatly rejected the police account that Jean was lawfully killed . "
He added : " Handing out congratulatory medals makes a mockery of real commitment to that process . "
The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the family 's criticism of Cmdr Dick 's honour , saying it was not " up to them " who is named in the New Year Honours list .
Campaigners for the Menezes family recently agreed a secret compensation deal with police .

TRENTON -- Gov. Jon Corzine tonight signed a measure making New Jersey the 14th state to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes , part of a flurry of bills the Democrat penned in his last full day on the job .
Corzine also signed legislation requiring chain restaurants to provide nutritional information to customers , ending state control of Camden , and adding new layers of accountability to the state 's higher education system .
The governor stayed out of sight in his Newark office as the Statehouse was readied for Republican Gov.-elect Chris Christie , who takes office at noon Tuesday .
“ I have enormous gratitude to the people of New Jersey for this decade of opportunity to serve , ” said Corzine , a U.S. Senator before becoming governor .
He has not revealed his future plans .
The marijuana bill ( S119 ) is expected to take effect in six months .
Only patients with specific illnesses would be permitted to get a prescription : cancer , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis , HIV / AIDS , seizure disorder , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( also known as Lou Gherig ’s disease ) , severe muscle spasms , muscular dystrophy , inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn ’s disease and any terminal illness if a doctor has determined the patient will die within a year .
The law allows the state health department to include other illnesses when it writes rules implementing it .
The law has other restrictions , such as forbidding people from growing their own marijuana , ensuring it is dispensed through licensed “ alternate treatment centers , ” and requiring designated caretakers who retrieve the drug on behalf of someone severely ill to undergo criminal background checks .
“ It means a lot to my family whether I can go sleigh - riding or not , or even just a day at the beach , ” said Chuck Kwiatkowski , a 38 - year - old multiple sclerosis patient from Hazlet who uses the drug .
“ It ’s a great thing to not feel like a criminal anymore . ”
Opponents said it would send the wrong message to children and promote crime .
The nutrition bill ( S2905 ) requires franchises with more than 20 locations nationally to calculate the number of calories for all items they sell and post the information on all drive - through and indoor menu boards .
The law takes effect in a year and will be enforced through fines .
Restaurant associations and owners of chains , argued it would be too costly .
Corzine also signed an executive order that put the state Treasurer in charge of making sure New Jersey 's schools , counties and municipalities take full advantage of special borrowing tools created through the federal stimulus act .
The Treasurer is now responsible for keeping an inventory and figuring out which local governments are not using their full allocation of bonds , and transferring those bonds to other areas or to the state , said Ed McManimon of the McManimon & Scotland law firm , which specializes in municipal finance .
Susan K. Livio , John Reitmeyer and Lisa Fleisher contributed to this report .

Rohmer made 24 films over a period of 50 years
French film - maker Eric Rohmer has died at the age of 89 , his production house has said .
He was the director of the critically acclaimed Tales of Four Seasons and one of the key figures of the post - war New Wave cinema movement .
Rohmer , born Maurice Scherer , made more than 20 feature films over 50 years .
His main works include the cycle of films Six Moral Tales .
The third , My Night at Maud's , released in 1969 , brought him international recognition .
His films are known for being almost completely devoid of action , featuring lengthy conversations between the usually young protagonists .
Pauline at the Beach , a typical work from 1983 , features a 15 - year - old girl 's summer by the seaside and her observation of adult relationships .
' Master '
Born in 1920 , Rohmer was formerly a literature professor , and literary works heavily influenced his film - making .
After the release of his last film , The Romance of Astrea and Celadon , at the Venice film festival in 2007 , he said he was considering retirement .
Rohmer was awarded the Golden Lion at Venice in 2001 for his career 's work .
The New Wave tried to achieve a more improvised style free from the constraints of classical cinema .
Rohmer said he wanted to look at " thoughts rather than actions " , dealing " less with what people do than what is going on in their minds while they are doing it " .
Reacting to news of Rohmer 's death , former French Culture Minister Jack Lang called him " one of the masters of French cinema " , hailing his " original and revolutionary stature " .
Cannes film festival director Thierry Fremaux said Rohmer 's body of work was " unique " .
" Under apparent lightness , he put a rigour into his films that places him among the greatest directors in history , " he said .
The cause of Rohmer 's death was not immediately clear .

An article appearing in today 's issue of 24 Hours Vancouver garbled what I had to say about social media and protesters , giving the impression that I had knowledge the Media Coop is acting as a command and control centre for anarchist protests .
In fact , I have no such knowledge and did not say I did .
The mistake happened during editing , people at 24 Hours say .
The result is this mistaken paraphrase of my views :
" David Beers , editor of the TheTyee.ca , said contributors to vancouver.mediacoop.ca have set up something similar to satellite - based communication system used by military . "
Actually , I was speaking in general about social media – texting and twitter and other means of sharing digital information via the Net – and the power it gives anyone wanting to organize a protest .
But that was well after the reporter and I had finished discussing the Media Coop .
Earlier in the interview I was asked what I knew about the Media Coop and I answered that I knew very little , but saw it as a place where journalistic practices were employed with the aim of advancing social causes .
I would not want to give the impression that the Media Coop people are helping to orchestrate protests .
I do n't have any reason to believe that .
João Magalhães sent me a link to an article by John O’Sullivan at ClimateGate.com about the research by Chiefio aka E.M. Smith and his Czech reader Jan ( meaning " John " ) .
Prague 's Clementinum , an old Jesuit Convent and the current National and University Library near the Charles Bridge ( Google Maps ) , hosts the world 's second oldest continuously working weather station after the Central England dataset ( * 1659 ) and , obviously , the oldest one in the Czech Republic .
The records go back to 1770 and have n't been interrupted or modified since 1775 .
The picture of the building above is not too beautiful by itself but you can take prettier pictures of the Old Town from the Clementinum tower . ;-)
Today , Clementinum is also the warmest weather station in the Czech Republic , exceeding the annual mean temperature of 10 °C , arguably because of urban effects as well as its low elevation of 192 meters .
The coldest station in Czechia is on our highest peak Sněžka , elevation 1602 meters , on the Czech - Polish border .
Its annual mean temperature is close to the freezing point .
The Czech average is around 7 °C .
Click to zoom in or get the Excel file or CSV file ( with proper English decimal points , not comma ) with the monthly averages since 1770 which began to be recorded during the reign of Maria Theresa of Austria , queen of Bohemia .
The Clementinum temperature was mostly cooling between 1800 and 1900 and mostly warming since 1900 , by roughly the same amount .
If you allow me to cherry - pick a bit , the Clementinum 's annual mean temperature in 1794 was 11.50 °C but 10.88 °C in 2005 .
The 1848 revolution in Prague .
As recently as in 1850 , Prague only had 157,000 inhabitants , which includes the ( relatively negligible ) villages that joined Prague later - much fewer than the 1.2 million population today .
Guess how the urban heat effects have changed since 1800 .
The links above present some evidence that this robust old station which , despite the urban effects , shows that there 's been no statistically significant warming in Prague since 1800 ( and at most 0.5 °C or so in 200 years , and I have n't subtracted any corrections for the intensification of Prague 's urban heat island which may be as much as 0.6 °C per century and which would probably revert the 200 - year trend to a significant cooling ! ) , has been deliberately censored from the GHCN data in some way , without a known scientific reason , and replaced by some gapped and strangely artificially adjusted data from the Prague International Airport ( Ruzyně , a Western suburb of the Czech capital ) .
The incomplete Prague International Airport data were taken instead of the Clementinum data .
Moreover , inside them , a gap in the 1940s was inserted and the temperatures on both sides were " adjusted " to change a cooling trend ( blue ) to a warming trend ( red ) .
A lot of seemingly problematic stuff to check .
It 's plausible that the Clementinum data actually show that there 's been no statistically significant warming in all of Central Europe for 200 years .
Warming trends in Prague since 1770
This text is a counterpart of Warming Trends in Central England Since 1659 where I explain the basic issues .
The Prague record , the second oldest , is somewhat shorter .
The average temperature between 1770 and 2009 ( included ) is 9.6 °C which is 0.4 °C warmer than in Central England , 1659 - 2009 .
The standard deviation of the annual mean temperatures from this overall average is 0.98 °C which is 50 % higher than 0.65 °C in Central England where the fluctuations are probably lower because of the relative proximity to the " stabilizing " sea ( while Prague has a more continental climate ) .
Let 's begin with the 100 - year trends ( linear regression ) .
I have to emphasize that the y - axis in all the graphs below is the warming trend ( a kind of smoothed derivative of the temperature ) , not the temperature itself .
We see that the trends were positive in the 20th century and negative in the 19th century .
The fastest warming and cooling was in
1910 -2009 : +1.88 °C/ century
1789 -1888 : - 1.46 °C/ century
For 50 - year trends , the graph looks like this :
The fastest warming and cooling was :
1960-2009 : +3.93 °C/ century
1806 -1855 : - 3.47 °C/ century
However , when you look e.g. at 20 - year warming trends , when the man -made warming should be really fast in the current era , our generation actually drops out of the race .
The graph looks like this :
A 20th century interval only appears on the 8th place in the ranking :
1779 -1798 , 9.187 °C/ century
1782-1801 , 8.317 °C/ century
1776-1795 , 8.103 °C/ century
1778-1797 , 7.629 °C/ century
1783-1802 , 7.407 °C/ century
1849 -1868 , 7.292 °C/century
1777-1796 , 7.214 °C/century
1984-2003 , 7.125 °C/century
1850 - 1869 , 6.984 °C/ century
1780 - 1799 , 6.853 °C/ century
And by the way , even the fastest warming at the end of the 18th century loses when compared to the fastest 20 - year cooling in the 19th century :
1821-1840 , - 10.05 °C/ century
1822-1841 , - 9.338 °C/ century
1823-1842 , -8.005 °C/ century
1824-1843 , - 7.259 °C/century
1819 -1838 , - 7.029 °C/ century
1825 -1844 , -6.879 °C/century
1820 -1839 , - 6.586 °C/ century
1831 -1850 , - 6.582 °C/century
1826-1845 , - 6.461 °C/century
1830 - 1849 , - 6.331 °C/ century
At any rate , you can't see any unexceptional behavior in the late 20th century Prague , either .
Moreover , it 's likely that if you adjusted the figures for the urban heating , the warming trend would disappear completely or change to a cooling trend .
Is there a global weirding ?
An inkspiller at the New York Times has proposed a new replacement for global warming and climate change , namely global weirding .
Well , until November 2009 , we have seen a lot of it , but of a different type than Thomas Friedman envisioned .
In order to be able to use any weather event as a proof of climate change , which would certainly simplify the life for all the AGW gods and their prophets , he conjectures that the climate variations are increasing .
And no doubt , man is to blame .
However , already the first step is wrong because there is no increase of the climate variations .
For example , the graph above shows the " typical " ( standard deviation , or " Pythagorean average " , as I call it ) month - month variations calculated from the Prague 1770 - 2009 monthly anomalies ( which I first have to calculate ) , smoothed over 10 - year intervals or so ( with a truncated Gaussian - like measure , but let me not go into irrelevant details ) .
You see that there is actually a vaguely decreasing trend in these variations .
The minimum variations were sometime in 1905 - 1915 - it's the point 1650 ( months since the first 10 - year period ) on the graph above .
But the maximum variations occurred around the point 1000 on the x-axis which corresponds to 1865 - 1875 and similar years ( there are two similar peaks over there ) .
The decrease of the month - on - month temperature variations in the anomalies is pretty large : the maximum is around 2.8 units while the minimum is close to 2.0 , which is a 20 % decrease - despite the averaging over 100 month - on - month differences or so !
The most recent decade is much closer to the minimum ( like around 1910 ) than the maximum .
So the temperatures are actually changing somewhat less dramatically these days , which actually can be justified theoretically , too ( the pole - tropic differences have decreased , reducing gradients and storminess etc. ) .
Similar methods to calculate these things actually lead to similar graphs with similarly located maxima and minima ( even when I start with the year - on - year jumps , the basic structure looks very similar ) .
The quantity I drew , being inspired by Mr Friedman , could be interesting to study but global weirding is just not taking place right now .
Before Mr Friedman blames SUVs for his global weirding , he should have noticed that only himself , and not the Earth 's climate , has actually been a victim of such a recent global weirding . ;-)
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden speaks during a press conference , Tuesday , Feb. 2 , 2010 , at the National Press Club in Washington , where the it was announced that NASA has awarded $ 50 million through funded agreements to further the commercial sector 's capability to support transport of crew to and from low Earth orbit .
NASA on Tuesday unveiled awards totaling $ 50 million to support the commercial spaceflight efforts of five American companies , one day after announcing a new plan to use privately built spaceships to launch astronauts to space instead of government vehicles .
NASA chief Charles Bolden announced the winners of the space agency 's commercial crew development competition to encourage progress in privately built spacecraft during a morning briefing at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C .
" Ladies and gentlemen , these are the faces of the new frontier .
The vanguard , " said Bolden .
" We will certainly be adding to this group in the near future . "
The competition 's $ 50 million award came from NASA 's stimulus money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .
The winning companies under the program include :
Sierra Nevada Corp. : At $ 20 million , Sierra Nevada in Centennial , Colo. , is the top winner of the competition and received the funds to further develop Dream Chaser , a seven - person spacecraft designed to launch astronauts into space using an Atlas 5 rocket .
The Boeing Co. : Boeing , a major NASA contractor on the International Space Station and shuttle , will receive $ 18 million in competition funds to support the development of its own seven - person space capsule to launch astronauts using a medium - class rocket .
United Launch Alliance : A veteran of expendable rocket launches , the joint effort by Boeing and Lockheed Martin will receive $ 6.7 million to develop an emergency detection system to monitor the health of its Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets — unmanned expendable boosters that could be repurposed to launch manned spacecraft .
Blue Origin : A normally secretive team established by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos , Blue Origin in Kent , Wash . , has been quietly developing a vertical launch and landing spacecraft called New Shepard .
The firm will receive $ 3.7 million to develop a novel launch escape system and build a crew - carrying module made of composite materials for structural tests .
Paragon Space Development Corp. : This Tucson , Ariz .- based company will receive $ 1.4 million to develop an environmental control and life support air vitalization system for use in space .
The five awards join two billion - dollar contracts already in place between NASA and private space industry to supply unmanned cargo shipments to the International Space Station .
Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) of California and Virginia - based Orbital Sciences Corp. have received contracts worth $ 3.5 billion in total to build and launch unmanned cargo ships to the station .
On Monday , President Barack Obama unveiled the 2011 budget request for NASA as part of overall budget for the country .
The request included a $ 6 billion boost over five years to support commercial spaceflight development , but scrapped NASA 's Constellation program to build new Orion spacecraft and Ares rockets aimed at returning astronauts to the moon .
Bolden said today 's announcement tied directly into NASA 's new plan to embrace commercial spaceflight more directly , but did not mean the United States was turning away from human spaceflight .
" We are not abandoning human spaceflight by any stretch of the imagination , " Bolden said , adding that NASA hired a new class of astronauts last year .
The new plan , he added , is to develop new technologies and capabilities to sustain future expeditions to the moon , asteroids , Mars or elsewhere in the solar system .
New rocket propulsion is one of those technologies .
" When I talk about game - changing propulsion , we 're talking about going back to some stuff that NASA has on the shelf , " Bolden said .
Lighter spacecraft , orbital fuel depots and faster ways to reach distant parts of the solar system are potential projects , he added .
White House science advisor John Holdren also emphasized that NASA 's new direction will not back off of human spaceflight .
" It is not a retreat from U.S. leadership of human spaceflight as some are asserting , " Holdren said .
" But rather an exciting and promising path forward that invests in new ideas , new technologies and the complementary strength between NASA and the private sector in order to make human access both to low - Earth orbit and beyond to deep space faster , safer and more affordable than it could ever have been on the old path .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : Haskell XML Toolbox Version 8.5.0
Haskell XML Toolbox 8.5.0
I would like to announce a new version of the Haskell XML Toolbox .
The main change in this release is the separation of the XPath module and the XSLT module into separate packages hxt - xpath and hxt - xslt .
So the base package becomes a bit smaller .
Installation should n't become more complex because of the easy install with cabal and hackage .
A second major change concerns the XPath module .
The internal data structures , especially the XPath node - sets , have been refactored for runtime efficiency .
So even complex XPath expressions with ambiguous paths to single nodes run in acceptable time .
The source repositories have been converted to the git version control system .
There is a single git repository for all HXT packages at " http://git.fh-wedel.de/repos/hxt.git "
More information and also downloads can be found at http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/index.html

The ACLU has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a college student who was arrested by the TSA and detained for five hours over a set of Arabic - language flash cards he was carrying .
Nick George , a student at Pomona College in California , was grilled by the TSA on “ who did 9/11 ” and asked by FBI agents whether he was a communist after airport security officers found Arabic - English language learning cards in his luggage last summer , according to news reports and the ACLU .

George was boarding a plane to California on Aug. 29 , 2009 , after visiting his native Pennsylvania when TSA agents noticed the cards .
George had been studying Arabic and used the flash cards — which have Arabic on one side and English on the other — to help him translate the Arabic news service al - Jazeera .
Among the flash cards were the words “ terrorist ” and “ explosion , ” the Philadelphia Daily News reported .
Among the questions a TSA agent asked him were “ Do you know who did 9/11 ? ” and “ Do you know what language Osama bin Laden spoke ? ”
Grilled later by the FBI , George — who is not Arabic — was asked if he had converted to Islam or joined a communist organization , the Daily News reported .
“ I understand I might warrant a second look , ” George told the paper .
“ They should have taken me aside , seen I had a legitimate explanation and a student ID and that I was carrying nothing illegal , and waved me on . ”
“ Nick George was handcuffed , locked in a cell for hours and questioned about 9/11 simply because he has chosen to study Arabic , a language that is spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world , ” ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said in a statement .
“ This sort of harassment of innocent travelers is a waste of time and a violation of the Constitution . ”

Wizner said that “ arresting and restraining passengers who pose no threat to flight safety and are not breaking any law not only violates people ’s rights , but it wo n’t make us any safer . ”
The ACLU says George was “ never informed of why he was handcuffed , detained or arrested , and he was not informed of his rights . ”
The lawsuit charges that the TSA officials , the Philadelphia police and the FBI violated George ’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and his First Amendment right to free speech .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit on George ’s behalf in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , against the three TSA officers , two FBI agents and two members of the Philadelphia Police Department who were involved in his detainment and interrogation .

In September , Fox News reported that the TSA defended its decision to detain George .
The agency said George had been flagged for inspection even before he arrived at the security gate because he was “ acting suspiciously . ”
And during the questioning , George ’s “ behavior escalated to a point where our officers deemed it necessary to contact the Philadelphia Police Department , ” a TSA spokesman told the news network .

“ As someone who travels by plane , I want TSA agents to do their job to keep flights safe , ” George says .
“ But I do n’t understand how locking me up and harassing me just because I was carrying the flashcards made anybody safer .
No one should be treated like a criminal for simply learning one of the most widely - spoken languages in the world . ”

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Law firms across the United States are scrambling for a chance at the mother lode : a lawsuit against embattled , but cash - rich Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T .

It has been just over two weeks since the world ’s largest automaker announced an recall of 8 million vehicles because of a sticky gas pedal , but already at least 30 class - action lawsuits have been filed against the Japanese automaker .
“ This is just the beginning , ” said Mark Bunim of New York - based mediation firm Case Closure LLC .
“ There ’s going to be one of these cases in every town . ”
“ And why not ?
When you ’ve got a lot of victims and a lot of money , it ’s only to be expected , ” he added .
San Diego law firm Steiner & Associates already has a website up and running ( www.ustoyotalaw.com) that asks : " Have You or Loved One Been Injured or Killed in an Accident Due to A Defective Gas Pedal or Floor Mat ?
You may be entitled to substantial compensation ! "
On its website , the national plaintiff lawyers trade group the American Association for Justice ( www.justice.org) has a blurb that reads : " Coming soon ... Toyota Sudden Acceleration Litigation Packet . "
In essence , this will be the lawsuit version of “ Plug and Play , ” where all plaintiff lawyers will need to do is enter names and data into a boilerplate lawsuit , lawyers say .
“ This is going to a little cottage industry all of its own , ” said Matt Cairns , president - elect of DRI , the Voice of the Defense Bar , the largest U.S. civil defense attorney association .
The likely lawsuits that Toyota will face include everything from death and injury cases to those alleging the automaker concealed the truth .
The legal mess could take years to resolve and will ultimately come down to a business decision on Toyota ’s part on whether it is better to settle or to fight it out in trial in dozens of cases .
COMING STORM
Cases related to injuries and deaths are the most obvious of the cases that will be brought against Toyota .
Up to 19 U.S. crash deaths over the past decade may be linked to accelerator - related problems at Toyota , congressional officials have said .
There have also been an unknown number of injuries that could yet result in lawsuits .
" As this issue gets more attention , Toyota owners who had accidents in the past few years are going to wonder if those accidents were caused by unintended acceleration , " said Frank Pitre , a plaintiff lawyer at Cotchett , Pitre & McCarthy , who in the past decade successfully fought cases against Bridgestone Corp 5108 .
T unit Firestone and Ford Motor Co F.N over rollover incidents .
Class-action lawsuits are a predominantly U.S. phenomenon , involving a large group of people bringing a collective claim to court .
Critics argue that while the individual plaintiffs only get small amounts of compensation in these cases , plaintiff lawyers can walk away with millions of dollars .
The possibilities for these kinds of cases are vast even if the risk of death and injury is low .
“ There is a very minuscule percentage of vehicles actually experiencing unintended acceleration , ” said Jeffrey Thomen , a Hartford - based product liability partner at McCarter & English .
“ But that will not prevent people from filing lawsuits against Toyota . ”
The cases will range from those alleging that the recall has hurt the resale vehicle of Toyota models or that selling faulty vehicles was in breach of warranty .
Or , in the case of a lawsuit filed in Colorado on February 2 by Burg Simpson Eldredge Hersh & Jardine , alleging that Toyota knowingly hid its acceleration problem from the public .
“ We believe Toyota knew about the problem but misled people and concealed the truth , ” said Mike Burg , the firm ’s founder .
“ There are many people out there who would never have bought Toyotas if they ’d known about the unintended acceleration issue . ”
Auto insurers are also likely to pursue cases against Toyota over accidents that may prove to have been caused by faulty vehicles .
Experts predict a flurry of lawsuits over the hybrid Prius model , which may also become part of the recall .
“ At some point , Toyota may have to decide to settle out of court , ” Pitre said .
“ It ’s far more expensive to go to court and would prolong the pain for Toyota and many families . ”
In the meantime , the Japanese automaker will need to beef up its outside counsel , lawyers say .
“ If I were Toyota , if I had n’t already hired the best automotive defect defense lawyers in America , I ’d be tracking them down right now , ” said DRI ’s Cairns .
A handful of scholars have already started to explore the ways that advertisers , educators , political campaigners , or anyone else in the business of persuasion can use these findings .
And some of the implications are surprising .
For example , to get people to think through a question , it may be best to present it less clearly .
And to boost your self - confidence , you may want to set out to write a dauntingly long list of all the reasons why you ’re a failure .
“ Every purchase you make , every interaction you have , every judgment you make can be put along a continuum from fluent to disfluent , ” says Adam Alter , a psychologist at the New York University Stern School who co-wrote the paper on fluency and stock prices .
“ If you can understand how fluency influences judgment , you can understand many , many , many different kinds of judgments better than we do at the moment . ”
Because it shapes our thinking in so many ways , fluency is implicated in decisions about everything from the products we buy to the people we find attractive to the candidates we vote for - in short , in any situation where we weigh information .
It ’s a key part of the puzzle of how feelings like attraction and belief and suspicion work , and what researchers are learning about fluency has ramifications for anyone interested in eliciting those emotions .
Psychologists have determined , for example , that shares in companies with easy - to - pronounce names do indeed significantly outperform those with hard - to - pronounce names .
Other studies have shown that when presenting people with a factual statement , manipulations that make the statement easier to mentally process - even totally nonsubstantive changes like writing it in a cleaner font or making it rhyme or simply repeating it - can alter people ’s judgment of the truth of the statement , along with their evaluation of the intelligence of the statement ’s author and their confidence in their own judgments and abilities .
Similar manipulations can get subjects to be more forgiving , more adventurous , and more open about their personal shortcomings .
One of the hottest topics in psychology today is something called “ cognitive fluency . ”
Cognitive fluency is simply a measure of how easy it is to think about something , and it turns out that people prefer things that are easy to think about to those that are hard .
On the face of it , it ’s a rather intuitive idea .
But psychologists are only beginning to uncover the surprising extent to which fluency guides our thinking , and in situations where we have no idea it is at work .
This would probably not strike you as a great idea .
But , if recent research is to be believed , it might just be brilliant .
Imagine that your stockbroker - or the friend who ’s always giving you stock tips - called and told you he had come up with a new investment strategy .
Price - to - earnings ratios , debt levels , management , competition , what the company makes , and how well it makes it , all those considerations go out the window .
The new strategy is this :
Invest in companies with names that are very easy to pronounce .
More recent work suggests that people assign all sorts of specific characteristics to things that feel familiar .
Like beauty .
Psychologists have identified what they call the “ beauty - in - averageness ” effect - when asked to identify the most attractive example of something , people tend to choose the most prototypical option .
For example , when asked to identify the most appealing of a group of human faces , people choose the one that is a composite of all the others .
And it ’s not just faces :
Studies have found a similar tendency when people are asked to identify what makes for an attractive dog or car or watch .
Some psychologists suggest that much of what we perceive as beauty is just the fact that the most prototypical faces and dogs and watches are the easiest to process , because they share the most with all the other faces and dogs and watches that we ’ve seen and stored in our perceptual inventory .
Our bias for the familiar , however , can be triggered in settings where there ’s little purpose to it .
In the 1960s , Zajonc did a series of experiments that uncovered what he dubbed the “ mere exposure ” effect :
He found that , with stimuli ranging from nonsense words to abstract geometric patterns to images of faces to Chinese ideographs ( the test subjects , being non-Chinese speakers , did n’t know what the ideographs meant ) , all it took to get people to say they liked certain ones more than others was to present them multiple times .
“ That gut feeling of familiarity determined by ease of processing is a very effective shorthand , ” says Schwarz , a psychologist at the University of Michigan .
“ Having to sit down and analyze every time whether something is familiar would not be a good idea . ”
According to Norbert Schwarz , a leading fluency researcher , the late psychologist Robert Zajonc used to explain the evolutionary logic behind this tendency succinctly .
“ He ’d say , ‘ If it is familiar , it has not eaten you yet . ’ ”
An instinctive preference for the familiar made sense in the prehistoric environment in which our brains developed , psychologists hypothesize .
Unfamiliar things - whether they were large woolly animals , plants we were thinking of eating , or fellow human beings - needed to be carefully evaluated to determine whether they were friend or foe .
Familiar objects were those we ’d already passed judgment on , so it made sense not to waste time and energy scrutinizing them .
Most of the time , the shortcut works pretty well .
If something feels notably easy to decipher , whether it ’s a piece of text or the shape of an object or the particulars of a person ’s face , there ’s a good chance it ’s because we ’ve previously done the work of processing it , and that it ’s something we ’ve encountered before .
Cognitive fluency signals familiarity - some psychologists argue that the eerie experience of déjà vu is simply when we ’re fooled by the unexpected ease of taking in a piece of sensory information , and interpret that as a memory of having been there or seen it before .
Our sensitivity to - and affinity for - fluency is an adaptive shortcut .
According to psychologists , it helps us apportion limited mental resources in a world where lots of things clamor for our attention and we have to quickly figure out which are worth thinking about .
It is n’t just visual cues that have this sort of effect .
Matthew McGlone , a psychologist at the University of Texas , has found that auditory cues can shape people ’s perception of truth .
McGlone did a study in which he presented subjects with a series of unfamiliar aphorisms either in rhyming or nonrhyming form : “ Woes unite foes , ” for example , versus “ Woes unite enemies . ”
He found that people tended to see the rhyming ones as more accurate than the nonrhyming ones , despite the fact that , substantively , the two were identical .
Phrases that are easier on the ear are n’t just catchy and easy to remember , McGlone argues , they also feel inherently truer .
He calls it “ the rhyme - as - reason effect . ”
To Alter , it ’s a demonstration not so much of the power of fluency but of its opposite , what psychologists call “ disfluency . ”
Even at the level of a trickier font , the experience of disfluency makes people wary and uncomfortable .
That sensation , Alter argues , is enough to make them less forthcoming and also less forgiving in their moral judgments .
Playing with legibility can also change perceptions in subtler , less predictable ways .
Alter and Daniel Oppenheimer , a psychologist at Princeton University who also co-wrote the stocks and fluency paper , have found that when a personal questionnaire is presented in a less legible font , people tend to answer it less honestly than if it is written in a more legible one .
Alter and two other psychologists , Simon Laham and Geoffrey Goodwin , also found that , when presenting people with written descriptions of moral transgressions , increasing the contrast between text and background to make it easier to read the description made people more forgiving .
One thing that fools us , for example , is font .
When people read something in a difficult - to - read font , they unwittingly transfer that sense of difficulty onto the topic they ’re reading about .
Schwarz and his former student Hyunjin Song have found that when people read about an exercise regimen or a recipe in a less legible font , they tend to rate the exercise regimen more difficult and the recipe more complicated than if they read about them in a clearer font .
“ People are very sensitive to the experience of ease or difficulty , but very insensitive to where that feeling comes from , ” says Schwarz .
Winkielman does n’t claim that beauty is entirely explained by fluency , but he argues that the effect is powerful , all the more so because we ’re unaware of it .
Indeed , the power of the effect , combined with the ease with which psychologists can fool people into mistaking the sensation of fluency for actual familiarity , helps explain the current popularity of research into the phenomenon .
“ These faces fit right in there .
In effect , you ’ve already learned the facial features , so people like them , ” says Piotr Winkielman , a psychologist at the University of California San Diego who has done research on fluency and attractiveness .
The persuasive power of repetition , clarity , and simplicity is something that people who set out to win others ’ trust - marketers , political candidates , speechwriters , suitors , and teachers - already have an intuitive sense of if they ’re good at what they do .
What the fluency research is showing is just how profound the effect can be , and just how it works .
And some of the more interesting ramifications of the new work come from the suggestion that disfluency , rather than fluency , can sometimes be what ’s called for .
Work on product marketing by Schwarz and Hyejeung Cho has found , for example , that while creating a sense of disfluency in potential consumers is likely to make them see a product as less familiar , it also makes them see it as more innovative .
And a few studies suggest that disfluency works well as a prompt to get people to think carefully and catch mistakes .
Alter and Oppenheimer found that using a more difficult font can get students to do better on the Cognitive Reaction Test , a three - question test that usually trips up people answering intuitively .
In another study , they found that disfluency also led people to think more abstractly .
Schwarz and Song found that a difficult font can dramatically increase the number of people who correctly respond to the question , “ How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark ? ”
( The answer is “ none ” - Moses was n’t on the Ark . )
In other words , to get people to think carefully and to prevent them from making silly mistakes , make them work to process the question : make the font hard to read , the cadence awkward , and the wording unfamiliar .
Some researchers are also starting to look at the question of how to change people ’s responses to cognitive fluency .
Winkielman is part of a team of researchers who , in a forthcoming study , looked at the relationship between mood and the desire for fluency .
They found that happy people are less interested in familiar , fluent stimuli - in this case abstract visual patterns - than sad people .
According to Winkielman , this makes sense :
When we ’re unhappy , we seek out stability and a sense of safety ; when we ’re happy , we ’re more open to the unfamiliar .
“ Fluent things are familiar , but also boring and comfortable , ” he says .
“ Disfluency is intriguing and novel .
Sometimes you like comfort food , like when you ’re sick .
And usually you want to try something new when you ’re more comfortable . ”
It may be possible to tactically use disfluency to improve our own everyday lives , as well .
Schwarz has found that the ease or difficulty of thinking something can sometimes neutralize the actual content of the thoughts themselves .
Along with Lawrence Sanna of the University of North Carolina , Schwarz has looked at fluency and self - confidence .
The two found that , if the goal was to boost college students ’ confidence before an exam , getting them to list a few reasons why they were going to succeed was more effective than getting them to list many reasons .
Because it was harder , the students who were asked to think of more ways to succeed were actually less confident , even though they ended up with longer lists .
And Schwarz and Sanna found a converse effect when they asked students to think of reasons they would not do well : Students asked to come up with a longer list of reasons they would fail reported feeling more confident than those asked for a shorter list .
Indeed , they reported feeling as confident as the students who had been asked to come up with the short list of ways to succeed - by the authors ’ calculation , thinking of 12 ways to fail had the same effect as thinking of three ways to succeed .
In unpublished research , Schwarz has found a similar effect with marital happiness : Couples asked to come up with a short list of good qualities about each other reported higher levels of marital happiness than the other couples in the study - but so did those couples asked to come up with a long list of each other ’s bad qualities .
“ Having to come up with many good things about your spouse is terrible , because it becomes difficult and then you think she ’s obviously not that wonderful , ” Schwarz says .
“ Coming up with a few bad things about your spouse , that ’s bad because it ’s not that hard .
Having to come up with a lot of bad things , since it ’s hard , it means she ’s not that bad at all .
The difficulty that you have tells you that there are not many such things . ”
Results like these suggest that feeling good about yourself may in part be a matter of having a hard time feeling bad , and that confidence and even success might be triggered by interventions that do nothing but make failure seem the more intimidating possibility .
The human brain , for all its power , is suspicious of difficulty , but perhaps we can learn to use that .

A new study of chimpanzees living in the wild adds to evidence that our closest primate relatives have cultural differences , too .
The study , reported online on October 22nd in Current Biology , shows that neighboring chimpanzee populations in Uganda use different tools to solve a novel problem : extracting honey trapped within a fallen log .
Kibale Forest chimpanzees use sticks to get at the honey , whereas Budongo Forest chimpanzees rely on leaf sponges -- absorbent wedges that they make out of chewed leaves .
" The most reasonable explanation for this difference in tool use was that chimpanzees resorted to preexisting cultural knowledge in trying to solve the novel task , " said Klaus Zuberbühler of the University of St Andrews in Scotland .
" Culture , in other words , helped them in dealing with a novel problem . "
" Culture " in this sense refers to a population - specific set of behaviors acquired through social learning , such as imitation , Zuberbühler explained .
That 's in contrast to an animal or human learning something on his or her own through trial and error , without taking into account what others around them do , or behaviors that are " hard - wired " and require no learning at all .
Behavioral differences among animal populations have been taken as evidence of culture , the researchers said , but it 's a notion that has remained controversial .
Some think that other explanations -- differences in the environment or in genetics -- seem more likely .
Perhaps the strongest evidence for animal culture has come from studies on wild chimpanzees in Africa , Zuberbühler said .
For instance , 15 years of field observation has shown that Kibale chimps habitually use sticks as tools , whereas Budongo chimps never do .
Both groups make use of leaf sponges to access water from tree holes .
The question is , are those differences really cultural ?
That 's been a hard question to answer because scientists could n't rule out all of the possible ecological or genetic explanations for those behavioral differences .
Scientists have seen social transmission of behaviors among chimpanzees living in captivity , with good evidence that the chimps can socially learn arbitrary behavior .
It still was n't clear whether those findings were relevant to chimps in the wild .
To help get around earlier limitations in the new study , Zuberbühler and his colleague Thibaud Gruber presented the two well - known chimpanzee groups with something that they had n't seen before , in this case , honey trapped inside a narrow hole drilled into a log .
" With our experiment we were able to rule out that the observed differences in chimpanzee tool use behavior are the result of genetic differences because we tested members of the same subspecies , " Zuberbühler said .
They also ruled out habitat influences by exposing the chimps to the same unfamiliar problem .
Zuberbühler said that they were surprised by how quickly the animals found their respective solutions .
" The cultural differences , in other words , must be deeply entrenched in their minds , " he said .
The researchers include Thibaud Gruber , University of St Andrews , St Andrews , UK , Budongo Conservation Field Station , Masindi , Uganda ; Martin N. Muller , University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , NM , Kibale Chimpanzee Project , Fort Portal , Uganda ; Pontus Strimling , University of St Andrews , St Andrews , UK ; Richard Wrangham , Kibale Chimpanzee Project , Fort Portal , Uganda , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA ; and Klaus Zuberbuhler , University of St Andrews , St Andrews , UK , Budongo Conservation Field Station , Masindi , Uganda .
It 's astounding that until this moment , three years after the iPhone , the biggest software company in the world basically did n't compete in mobile .
Windows Phone 7 Series is more than the Microsoft smartphone we 've been waiting for .
Everything 's different now .

Today , at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Microsoft is publicly previewing Windows Phone 7 for the first time .
The brand new , totally fresh operating system will appear in phones this year , but not until the holidays .
All of the major wireless carriers and every likely hardware maker are backing it , and they'd be stupid not to .
It 's awesome .
We 've got a serious hands on for you to check out , but here is everything that you need to know :

The name — Windows Phone 7 Series — is a mouthful , and unfortunately , the epitome of Microsoft 's worst naming instincts , belying the simple fact that it's the most groundbreaking phone since the iPhone .
It 's the phone Microsoft should 've made three years ago .
In the same way that the Windows 7 desktop OS was nearly everything people hoped it would be , Windows Phone 7 is almost everything anyone could 've dreamed of in a phone , let alone a Microsoft phone .
It changes everything .
Why ?
Now that Microsoft has filled in its gaping chasm of suck with a meaningful phone effort , the three most significant companies in desktop computing — Apple , Google and Microsoft — now stand to occupy the same positions in mobile .
Phones are officially computers that happen to fit in your pocket .
Windows Phone 7 is also something completely new for Microsoft : A total break from the past .
Windows Mobile is n't just dead , the body 's been dumped , buried and paved over by a rainbow brick road .
The Interface
It 's different .
The face of Windows Phone 7 is not a rectangular grid of thumbnail - sized glossy - looking icons , arranged in a pattern of 4x4 or so , like basically every other phone .
No , instead , an oversized set of bright , superflat squares fill the screen .
The pop of the primary colors and exaggerated flatness produces a kind of cutting - edge crispness that feels both incredibly modern and playful .
Text is big , and beautiful .
The result is a feat no phone has performed before : Making the iPhone 's interface feel staid .

If you want to know what it feels like , the Zune HD provides a taste : Interface elements that run off the screen ; beautiful , oversized text and graphics ; flipping , panning , scrolling , zooming from screen to screen ; broken hearts .
Some people might think it 's gratuitous , but I think it feels natural and just …fun .
There 's an incredible sense of joie de vivre that 's just not in any other phone .
It makes you wish that this was aesthetic direction all of Microsoft was going in .
Another , sorta similar interface , in terms of data presentation , is this Android Slidescreen app , which gives you a bunch of info up top .

Windows Phone 7 is connected in the same sense as Palm 's webOS and Android , with live , real - time data seamlessly integrated , though it 's even smoother and more natural .
Live tiles on the Start screen , which you can totally customize , are updated dynamically with fresh content , like weather , or if you 've pinned a person to your Start screen , their latest status updates and photos .

The meat of the phone is organized around a set of hubs : People , Pictures , Games , Music + Video , Marketplace , and Office .
They 're kind of like uber - applications , in a sense .
Massive panoramas with multiple screens that are each kind of like individual apps .
People , for instance , is n't just your contacts , but it's also where social networking happens , with a real - time stream of updates pulled in from like Facebook and Windows Live .
( No Twitter support announced yet , it appears — a kind of serious deficiency , but one we 're sure will be remedied by ship date . )
As another example , Music +
Video is essentially the entirety of Zune HD 's software , tucked inside of Windows Phone 7 .

A piece of interface that 's shockingly not there : A desktop syncing app .
If anyone would be expected to tie their phone to a desktop , you 'd think it'd be Microsoft , but they 're actually moving forward here .
All of your contacts and info sync over the air .
The only thing you 'll be syncing through your computer is music and videos , which is mercifully done via the Zune desktop client .

Hello , Connected World
The People hub might be the best social networking implementation yet on a phone :
It 's a single place to see all of your friends ' status updates from multiple services in a single stream , and to update your own Facebook and Windows Live status .
Needs .
Twitter support .
Badly .
But you have neat things going on , like the aforementioned Live tiles — if you really like someone or want to stalk them hardcore , you can make them a tile on your Start screen , which will update in realtime with whatever they 're posting , and pull down their photos from whatever service .
There 's also your very own profile page , where you can scan your current social state and post updates to multiple services simultaneously .
Advertisement
All of your contacts are synced and backed up over - the - air , Android and webOS style , and can be pulled from multiple sources , like Windows Live , Exchange , etc .
Makes certain other phones seem a little antiquated with their out - of - the - box Contacts situation .
Holy Crap !
The Zune Phone !
Microsoft 's vision of Zune is finally clear with Windows Phone 7 .
It 's an app , just like iPod is on the iPhone , though the Zune Marketplace is integrated with it into the music + video hub , not separated into its own little application .
It 's just like the Zune HD , so you can check out our review of that to see what it 's like .
But you get third - party stuff like Pandora , too , built - in here .
Oh , and worth mentioning , there will be an FM radio in every phone ( more on that in a bit ) .

Pictures is a little different though , and gets its very own hub .
That 's because it 's intensely connected — you can share photos and video with social networks straight from the hub , and via the cloud , they 're kept in sync with your PC and web galleries .
The latest photos your friends post also show up here .
Of course , you get around with multitouch zoom and zip - zip scrolling stuff .

Xbox , on a Phone
I 'll admit , I very nearly needed to change my pants when I saw the Xbox tile on the phone for the first time .
Obviously , you 're not going to be playing Halo 3 on your smartphone ( at least not this year ) , but yes , Xbox Live on a phone !
It 's tied to your Live profile , and there are achievements and gamer points for the games you can play on your phone , which will be tied to games back on your Xbox 360 .

If Microsoft 's got an ace - in - hole with Windows Phone 7 , it 's Xbox Live .
Gamers have talked about a portable Xbox for years — this is the most logical way to do it .
The N - Gage was ahead of its time .
( Okay , and it sucked . )
The DS and PSP are the past .
The iPhone showed us that the future of mobile gaming was going to be on your phone , and now that just got a lot more interesting .
The potential 's there , and hopefully the games will be plentiful and awesome enough to meet it .

Browser and Email
Yes , the browser is Internet Exploder .
And yes , the rumor 's true :
It wo n't be as fast as Mobile Safari .
Not to start .
But it 's not bad !
Hey , least it 's got multitouch powers right out of the box .
Naturally , you 've got multiple browser windows , and you can pin web pages to the Start screen , like any other decent mobile browser .

The Outlook email app makes me question how people read email on a BlackBerry .
It is stunning .
I never thought I 'd call a mail app " stunning , " but , well , it kind of is .
It 's the best looking mobile mail app around .
Text is huge .
Gorgeous .
Ultrareadable .
Of course , it 's got Exchange support too .

Apps , Office and Marketplace
Remember what I said earlier about Windows Mobile being dead ?
So are all the apps .
They wo n't work on WP7 .
Sorry Windows Mobile developers , it 's for the best .
Deep down , we all knew a clean break was the only way Windows Phone was n't going to suck total balls .
Advertisement
Apps will have some standardized interface elements , like the app bar on the bottom for common commands .
But here 's a question :
Will they multitask ?
Um , that depends on your definition of multitasking !
When we asked Joe Belfiore , the guy running Windows Phone , he alluded to live tiles and feeds as some ofthe ways that third - parties will be able to " bring value to the user , even when their apps are n't running . "
Which sounds to us like a big ol ' " shnope , " but we 'll see more next month at Microsoft 's developer event MIX .
Advertisement
The Marketplace is where you 'll buy apps .
Since we 've got like 6 months ' til Windows Phone 7 launches and people should be excited to develop for it , hopefully there 'll be plenty of stuff to buy there on day one .

Naturally , Bing and Bing Maps are built into the phone as the default search and maps services .
They 're nice , smartly contextual , and very location - oriented .
Bing 's also used for universal search on the phone , via a dedicated Bing button .
( There is no search but Bing search , BTW . )
Bing Maps is multitouchable , with pinch - to - zoom .
It 's rich , with built - in listings with reviews and clever ways of searching for stuff .
And yeah , Office !
It 's connected to that cloud thing , for OTA syncing and such .
Business people should be happy .

Another way the old Windows Mobile is dead is how Microsoft 's handling partners and hardware situation .
With Windows Mobile , a phonemaker handed Microsoft their monies , and Microsoft tossed them a software kit , and that was that .
Which is why a lot of Windows Mobile phones felt and ran like crap .
And why it took HTC like two years to produce the HD2 , the most genuinely usable rendition of Windows Mobile ever .

Microsoft 's not building their own phones , but they 're going to be picky , to say the least , with Windows Phone 7 .
Ballmer phrases it as " taking more accountability " for people 's experiences .
There 's a strict set of minimum hardware requirements : a capacitive , multitouchable screen with at least four points of touch ; accelerometer ; 5 - megapixel camera ; FM radio ; and the like .
There are serious benchmarks that have to be met .
And only chosen OEMs get to build the phones now , not like before , when anybody with $ 20 could get a license .
The OEMs that Microsoft 's announcing they 're working with at launch are : Qualcomm , LG , Samsung , Garmin Asus , HTC , HP , Dell , Sony Ericsson , and Toshiba .
AT&T's their " premiere partner " in the US ( dammit ) .
( Take note people !
Premiere does not mean exclusive ! )
Every phone will have a Bing ( search ) button and a Start button .
Custom skins , like the minor miracles HTC worked , are now banned .
The message to hardware makers is clear :
It 's a Windows Phone , you 're just putting it together .
Basically , phonemakers get to decide the shape of the phone , and whether or not there 's a keyboard .

One other word on hardware , in a manner of speaking .
Hardware it wo n't work with ?
Macs .
Which is kind of stupid to us — a lot of the people Microsoft wants to use Windows Phone 7 , like college students , have been going Mac in droves .
You wanna lure them back Microsoft ?
Let them use your phone with any OS .
The Big Picture
Windows Phone 7
Series is , from what we 've seen , exactly what Microsoft 's phone should be .
It 's actually good .
It brings together a bunch of different Microsoft services — Zune , Xbox , Bing — in a way that actually makes sense and just works .
But there 's a real , lingering question :
Are they too late ?
The first Windows Phone 7 Series … phone — goddamn that is a stupid name — wo n't hit until the end of this year .
That 's more than three years after the iPhone , two years after Android , hell , even a year after Palm , the industry 's sickly but persistent dwarf .

History is on Microsoft 's side here — we know what happened the last time Apple had a massive head start .
( Update : To be clear , in computing . )
Microsoft is , if nothing else , incredibly patient .
Remember the first Xbox ?
Back when it was crazy that Microsoft was getting into videogames ?
It 's cost them about a billion dollars and taken nearly 10 years , but now , with Xbox Live , Project Natal and their massive software ecosystem , they arguably have the most impressive gaming console you can buy .
That was a pet project .
Now , mobile is the future of computing .
What do you think Microsoft will sink into that ?
The mobile picture is now officially a three - way dance : Apple , Google , and Microsoft .
The same people who dominate desktop computing .
Everybody else is screwed .
Former Palm CEO
Ed Colligan famously said a few years ago : " PC guys are not going to just figure this out .
They 're not going to just walk in . "
That 's precisely what 's just happened .
Phones are the new PCs .
PC guys are the new phone guys .

Editor 's note : Somalia defines the term failed state .
This GlobalPost series includes accounts of being under fire in Mogadishu , on guard duty with African Union peacekeepers , an investigation into the Al Shabaab rebels and an analysis of when Somalia will improve .
MOGADISHU , Somalia and HARGEISA , Somaliland — Imagine a country where poetry is everything .
Imagine a place where the poets themselves are folk heroes and role models , a place where
everyone knows the verses by heart and where crowds gather spellbound to hear the most popular poets perform .
What you ’re imagining is probably not Somalia , a country that has become a byword for death , mayhem and chaos , but where poetry is a political tool as powerful as the gun .
“ Without poetry we would not exist as a society .
It can rouse thousands of people in a minute and demobilize thousands in a minute .
As the stomach needs food , so the brain needs beautiful words , ” said Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame , known as Hadraawi , Somalia ’s most famous poet .
Some have compared Hadraawi to Shakespeare and his works have been translated internationally .
During the years of General Mohamed Siyad Barre 's dictatorship that ended in 1991 , he was locked - up in solitary confinement for five years .
“ My poems were against the regime at that time , ” he said .
With sparkling eyes and a neatly trimmed white beard , the 66 - year - old explained , “ Poetry is a weapon that we use in both war and peace .
When we want to tell somebody something , poetry is the best way to convince them . ”
Somali poems are not just entertainment .
They frequently use allegory and myth to talk about sensitive issues of politics , clan and conflict .
As Hadraawi put it : “ Poems and not just recited for their own sake , there must be a purpose . ”
In 2003 he walked the length and breadth of Somalia on a peace march .
“ The only weapon I carried with me were my poems , ” said Hadraawi .
The march did not end the fighting but he drew crowds wherever he went reminding people that there is more to life than war .
It is hard to overstate the importance of poetry in Somalia .
Here it is not an esoteric minority interest but a form of mass popular culture .
When poets such as Hadraawi perform — the words half - sung , half - spoken — audiences are silent , taking in every word .
“ You think the audience is not breathing ; they are trying to feel the words , ” said one Somali poetry fan .
“ Poetry has many roles , ” said Boobe Yusuf Duale , program coordinator at Hargeisa ’s Academy for Peace and Development , a cultural institution in the breakaway territory of Somaliland .
“ It has an awareness , a sensitization , an educational role ; it has a role in helping people to develop , in saving the environment ; it has got socio- economic and political roles ; it has cultural and ethical and moral roles .
“ In traditional Somali society poetry played the role of the media and to a certain extent it still does : it tells people what ’s going on , ” said Duale .
Like most of the buildings in Somalia ’s capital , Mogadishu , the National Theater does n’t exist anymore .
It has been bombed to rubble .
But the theater ’s director Abdi Dhuh still keeps busy .
Last month he choreographed celebrations to mark the first anniversary of President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed ’s rule .
In between the falling mortars , tank and machine gun fire that punctuated the proceedings a display of poetry , music , singing and comic theater entertained the gathered crowds .
“ Poetry and prose are extremely important for the Somali people .
It ’s the only thing that can turn the people to you or against you , that is how powerful it is , ” explained Dhuh .
GlobalPost caught up with the president of Somalia , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , late last year in Chicago :
The show talked about the president ’s achievements and the need for national unity and for peace .
“ Our hope is that the theater will be rebuilt then the singers and poets will come back , ” said Dhuh .
“ When we had a government — way back when — they used to line up in the mornings for two or three kilometres to get tickets for the evening show .
I hope those happy days will come again , ” said Dhuh .
“ We are a nation of poets , ” said Hadraawi .
That may be true but it is a side of Somalia rarely seen as , so often , the gunfire drowns out the poetry .
Read one of Hadraawi's poems .

Opinion : When will Somalia improve ?
Katherine Nguyen , a friend of one of the accused , Fostar Akoteu , had earlier told the court Akoteu was wearing a black puffy jacket and sunglasses on his head .
She said that she did not see who punched Mr Aguiar last but that she clearly saw Akoteu stomping on his head after the alleged victim fell .
Pub bouncer Raymond Thompson , who tried to break up the fight , said one Polynesian man threw the last punch after which Mr Thompson pushed the alleged attacker against the wall .
Mr Thompson said that while he was holding him , another Polynesian man stomped on the victim 's head as he lay on the ground .
He said the bigger of the two men was wearing a brown T - shirt , dark jeans and black hoodie - type jacket but could not remember whether this was the man who allegedly threw the last punch .
He said only two Islander men were involved in the fight .
Andrew Edmunds , a pub patron , had earlier told the court one man had delivered the last punch , a " dog shot , in the back of the head , did n't see it coming " , while another man , whom he identified as the " main aggressor " , stomped on the victim as he lay on the ground , possibly on his chest .
Several other witnesses said they did not have a clear view of the fight or they could not identify people who may have punched the victim but that there were three alleged attackers .
Akoteu , 22 , Jacob Palutele , 22 and Sioeli Seau , 19 , are charged with Mr Aguiar 's murder .
Where Victoria begins to compare disastrously in its smartcard roll - out is in the costs of establishing the first stages .
The state government 's Transport Ticketing Authority yesterday attempted to dismiss the opposition 's assertions that Oyster had cost $ 289 million to create , saying the card was widely reported as costing around $ 2 billion .
'' The ' comparison ' to London 's Oyster system , '' spokeswoman Jean Ker Walsh said , was flawed because ''it is well publicised that full implementation of Oyster has come at a cost of £ 1.2 billion , or about $ A2.1 billion . ''
But this bundles together the cost of running the system over the past decade , as well as the initial establishment costs .
British Treasury figures confirm that £ 161 million was spent establishing Oyster - about two - thirds of what the Victorian government had initially committed to spending on its smartcard project before the massive cost blow - outs .
Other cities analysed by the opposition , including Delhi , Chicago , Perth , New York and Seattle , all had much cheaper options , albeit simpler cards with less functionality .
Myki has now become a festering sore that Labor in Victoria must deal with before November 's state election .
Certainly , new Transport Minister Martin Pakula has done all he can to stress it is his top priority .
He has moved the old boss of the government 's ticketing authority on and brought in an old government transport campaigner , Bernie Carolan , to try to get things back on track .
'' Myki is one of those issues that has caused people to take it out on us a bit , '' Pakula conceded last week .
It is criticism well deserved .
The card , late and significantly over budget , is operating only on trains - and working well for those who use only its simplest functions - but not on trams .
An extra $ 216 million has also had to be poured into Metcard to keep it running alongside myki while the problems are tackled .
Perhaps the problems started for the government when Transport Ticketing Authority officers selected US company Keane to write crucial elements of the tender brief in 2005 .
The lack of probity in having a likely future tenderer write guidelines for how the tender process should work - as detailed in a leaked Auditor - General 's report in 2008 ( that was later dismissed by the Auditor - General as an early draft , despite all dates , names and verifiable facts thus far proving correct ) - was remarkable .
It later emerged that the then chief executive of the Transport Ticketing Authority , Vivian Miners ( who could not be contacted for this story despite many attempts by The Age ) , was found to have shares in a company that was part of the consortium that won the myki contract .
The US company Keane leads the consortium building myki , and operates as Keane Australia Micropayments Consortium .
'' Keane had no corporate experience in developing , implementing and operating a ticketing system …
Keane has barely demonstrated adequate capability , '' the leaked audit report said .
WHAT was never seriously considered by the government after 2003 , when then transport minister Peter Batchelor pledged a $ 300 million smartcard for Melbourne , was simply extending the existing Metcard system , which already had a very basic smartcard capacity built into it ( although it would not have been able to store money as myki can , or automatically calculate the lowest fare for passengers ) .
ERG , the company that created Metcard , repeatedly offered to do this for the government , for what they claim was a cost under $ 100 million ( others have estimated it would have cost $ 220 million ) .
Such a move would have mirrored the less ambitious but more successful transitions to a smartcard by other cities .
Smartcards are being introduced by many transport systems worldwide because they allow the system operators to spend less on ticketing and simultaneously gather massive amounts of travel data .
Transport systems with smartcards also need fewer vending machines , are cheaper to maintain because so many transactions are done online , and allow huge numbers of passengers to board services quickly .
Sophisticated smartcards also allow different fare options , such as off - peak , that will lure passengers away from packed peak - hour services .
The government has been at pains to point out that '' off - the - shelf ' ' smartcard systems are not possible .
In a statement posted on its website , the Transport Ticketing Authority said in November that '' while hardware components can be bought off the shelf - and myki uses some - software must be designed to best meet our state 's individual fare structure ' ' .
This meant maintaining many existing Metcard and regional fare features , while introducing many new myki features - an excruciatingly complicated feat .
What is clear , however , is that the government could easily have employed a smartcard ticketing system specialist with vastly more experience than Keane .
Also bidding were Cubic , which has built many US systems and worked on Oyster in its first stage .
Another consortium bidding to build Melbourne 's smartcard had developed Hong Kong 's Octopus smartcard , which initially cost $ 100 million to introduce .
It has had many teething problems over the years , including in 2007 having to refund about $ 500,000 to customers who had been overcharged small amounts over seven years .
So what are the problems that stop myki being turned on for users across Melbourne , and then rolled out to the wider V / Line system across Victoria ( many regional towns will not get myki , despite the system being promoted as a statewide project ) ?
Myki users who catch a train daily and who use only myki's most basic function are likely left wondering what all the fuss is about - other than an occasional problem getting out of gates at City Loop stations , the card works well if they top up with cash and remember to touch off .
This is the sort of functionality that Tasmania got with the $ 4 million Greencard : the most basic of smartcard , it is available on the Apple Isle 's buses , and is not much more difficult to use than an office or parking lot entry card .
Any myki users , however , who have tried to top up their card automatically online , or tried to make an online payment , have been left either waiting days for the money to appear on their online myki balance , or find that it does not turn up at all .
Minister Pakula has regularly said that these sort of '' back office ' ' problems continue to happen .
Peter Carr , a city worker , is typical of those who have encountered a ' ' back office ' ' problem with the card .
Upon receiving his card in the mail , Carr topped it up with $ 50 , and noted that the website said it would take 24 hours for this money to load .
Three days later , he checked his myki account online and the money had still not appeared .
So , despite having spent $ 50 , he was forced to buy a Metcard to travel .
A long discussion with the myki call centre followed , and he was told there were delays because so many people were trying to top up .
'' Surely that 's what it 's designed for !'' says an incredulous Carr , who works in IT .
Eventually , the money appeared in his account and Carr got to use his myki at Flinders Street Station .
He held it up to the barriers but they failed to open , so he bought a Metcard and went home .
The next time he checked his myki balance he was shocked to discover he had been charged a $ 9.92 default fare for a journey he was never able to make .
Another conversation to the call centre resulted in being told he would be refunded the $ 9.92 .
That conversation was almost three weeks ago , and Carr is still waiting for the refund to arrive .
FOR a few users luckier than Peter Carr , the opposite has been the problem : myki money they never asked for has been credited to their accounts .
One pensioner , Kamco confirmed , checked his balance in January to find he had been credited $ 167,000 to his myki card .
Other users have registered for one card , only to receive up to four , or their gender has been mistaken , or they could not access any of their online details .
The problems have been as varied as they have been numerous as far as the website and online top -ups have been concerned .
Many students using the cards as they started to go back to universities and TAFEs this week and next are experiencing issues with cards that were never activated properly by Kamco before they were sent out .
The other problem that continues to nag myki - the big one that stops it from finally being rolled out for all tram and bus users in Melbourne - are the drop - outs that continue to occur on trams , making reliability far below what is needed for a functioning ticket system .
This week , the Australian Financial Review reported that tram drop - outs were related to the heavy steel construction of the trams hindering wireless communications .
Pakula said earlier this month that a key problem still affecting trams is '' canyoning ' ' , in which trams regularly drop out of remote communication with a central server because of tall city buildings .
One source who is close to the myki project said the government had considered installing remote devices on tall CBD buildings to improve communications with all devices in the city centre .
So what are the solutions to the problems being experienced ?
Last week , it was reported that Pakula had asked his department to look at the impacts of dropping zone two from trams , so that travellers would not have to touch off .
Yesterday his office said this was not being considered at this stage .
Ultimately , if this option is taken up by the government , it would mean its expensive smartcard could have been bought for a fraction of the cost because the complexity of designing a system for the 53 zones that Victoria has been divided into for myki need not have occurred .
A simpler card would have sufficed .
Another option that the government appears not to have considered was to follow Sydney 's lead : dumping the whole project , which the NSW government did in 2008 , after a decade of trying to make it work .
It is now starting the process of trying again , but it is clear it is going to be a long road before Sydney has a smartcard .
When Mr. Bernanke is challenged about the Fed ’s performance , he often points out that recognizing a bubble is hard .
“ It is extraordinarily difficult , ” he said during his Senate confirmation hearing last month , “ to know in real time if an asset price is appropriate or not . ”

Most of the time , that ’s true .
Do you know if stocks will keep going up ?
Is gold now in the midst of a bubble ?
What will happen to your house ’s value ?
Questions like these are usually an invitation to hubris .
But the recent housing bubble was an exception .
By any serious measure , houses in much of this country had become overvalued .
From the late 1960s to 2000 , the ratio of the median national house price to median income hovered from 2.9 to 3.2 .
By 2005 , it had shot up to 4.5 .
In some places , buyers were spending twice as much on their monthly mortgage payment as they would have spent renting a similar house , without even considering the down payment .
More than a few people  economists , journalists , even some Fed officials  noticed this phenomenon .
It was n’t that hard , if you were willing to look at economic fundamentals .
You could n’t know exactly when or how far prices would fall , but it seemed clear they were out of control .
Indeed , making that call was similar to what the Fed does when it sets interest rates : using concrete data to decide whether some part of the economy is too hot ( or too cold ) .
And Fed officials could have had a real impact if they had decided to attack the bubble .
Imagine if Mr. Greenspan , then considered an oracle , announced he was cracking down on wishful - thinking mortgages , as he had the authority to do .
So why did Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke get it wrong ?
The answer seems to be more psychological than economic .
They got trapped in an echo chamber of conventional wisdom .
Real estate agents , home builders , Wall Street executives , many economists and millions of homeowners were all saying that home prices would not drop , and the typically sober - minded officials at the Fed persuaded themselves that it was true .
“ We ’ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis , ” Mr. Bernanke said on CNBC in 2005 .

The United Nations independent expert on Palestinian rights has again called for a threat of economic sanctions against Israel to force it to lift its blockade of Gaza , which is preventing the return to a normal life for 1.5 million residents after the devastating Israeli offensive a year ago .
“ Obviously Israel does not respond to language of diplomacy , which has encouraged the lifting of the blockade and so what I am suggesting is that it has to be reinforced by a threat of adverse economic consequences for Israel , ” Richard Falk , the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 , told UN Radio .
As a law student , the joy and excitement of graduation quickly fades once the realization sets in that you ’ll be spending the bulk of your Summer studying for the Bar Exam , a mandatory test law - school grads must pass before they can practice law .
Preparing for the Bar Exam is a rigorous and time consuming process , and much like other professional exams , students routinely pay thousands of dollars for standardized review courses .
In the legal world , the biggest purveyor of bar review classes is a company called BarBri , and the cost of their intensive review courses can run in excess of $ 3500 .
As a note of interest , BarBri is currently embroiled in a class action lawsuit for allegedly engaging in price fixing with rival companies to prevent undercutting and keep prices sky high .
But in a sign of the times , a virtual competitor to BarBri has emerged in the form of an iPhone app called BarMax CA that promises to prepare students for the bar exam for just $ 1,000 , an asking price that makes it the most expensive app on iTunes , but still significantly cheaper than BarBri .
As the name suggests , the app is currently tailored for the bar exam in California , though the developers are looking to expand and include tailored bar review courses for New York along with 5 other states before the end of the year .
But the most important issue in discussing this app is whether or not it ’s actually worth paying for .
The Bar Exam is no joke , and the developers of this iPhone app , to their credit , are n’t treating it as such and are really striving to deliver a lot of bang for the buck .
BarMax CA touts itself as a complete solution for law students , and according to the app description , it certainly seems to deliver .
Included in the app are audio lectures and outlines that cover all 12 topics of the California Bar Exam , over 1,000 review flashcards organized by subject , skeleton outlines for note taking , 1,371 practice multiple choice questions from previous bar exams , 102 real California essay questions with sample answers , 18 real California performance tests with sample answers , study tips , and finally , live e-mail support with the app development team ( which is comprised of lawyers from Harvard , Georgetown , and USC ) .
It goes without saying , though , that looking at an iPhone screen for hours on end probably is n’t the most efficient or beneficial way to study for a bar exam .
For as much as we live in a digital age , you still ca n’t replace old - fashioned studying with mp3 files , a digital outline , and a virtual keyboard for taking notes .
The developers of BarMax CA thankfully understand that going digital is n’t necessarily a replacement for more conventional forms of studying , but rather a helpful alternative .
In that vein , all of the material available in the app is also included in a MS Word document that users can print out if they want to study the old fashioned way .
As someone who ’s actually taken a bar exam , BarMax CA definitely seems to be an interesting option because many students are able to pass the bar exam simply by studying on their own with BarBri materials purchased on the “ black market ” ( BarBri forbids users from re-selling their books , though you can find plenty on eBay and Craigslist . )
In other words , you do n’t need a classroom experience to pass the bar , you just need the right material to study .
From the looks of it , BarMax CA seems to deliver the goods , though it ’s still too early to tell if the breadth of material and explanations is as extensive as those provided by BarBri .
Either way , it ’s a step in the right direction if you ’re tired of the BarBri monopoly .
Moving on , let ’s say you ’re interested in the BarMax app but do n’t happen to have an iPhone or iPod Touch .
In that case , BarMax will loan you an iPod Touch free of charge .
By way of comparison , the cost of BarBri in California is currently $ 3600 .
And if you want to access BarBri materials digitally on your iPhone , BarBri charges users another $ 750 to upgrade to “ BarBri Mobile ” , which brings the total purchase price up to $ 4350 .
And all of a sudden , $ 1,000 does n’t seem so expensive after all .
You can check out the app on iTunes over here .
If the media was n't owned lock , stock and barrel by the big corporate interests desperate to maintain the status quo for their own sake , what you 're going to see below is how real news and opinion TV would look every day instead of that drivel coming out of CNN , Fox and the broadcast networks .
Rachel starts off on her own -- well , noton her own .
She has a little help from Republican Governors Schwarzenegger ( CA ) and Crist ( FL ) representing virtuallygovernors of both parties with the exception of a tiny handful of secessionists and über - partisan hacks like Mark " Tango Dancer " Sanford ( SC ) , Rick Perry ( TX ) , John Hoeven ( ND ) and delusional presidential aspirants Tim Pawlenty ( MN ) and Bobby Jindal ( LA ) , in talking about how useful and successful Obama 's stimulus package has been in saving and creating jobs , not Inside - the - Beltway , where out - of - touch congressional ideologues spend their lives , but in America , which they all avoid assiduously .
Governors of 42 states and 5 territories signed a letter to Pelosi , Reid , Boehner and McConnell urging them to give Obama their " assistance in protecting jobs and speeding economic recovery by extending the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ’s ( ARRA ) enhanced federal match for Medicaid ( FMAP ) for two additional quarters . "
Yes , even far right Republicans like Haley Barbour ( MS ) , Sonny Perdue ( GA ) , Bob McDonald ( VA ) , Mitch Daniels ( IN ) , Bob Riley ( AL ) , Dave Heineman ( NE ) and Sean Parnell ( AK ) , when faced with the realities of real life Americans elected congressmembers Inside - the - Beltway are shielded from ( they only talk to wealthy donors and lobbyists ) , are n't willing to throw their state 's citizens under the bus for narrow partisan gain .
You 'd never know it from listening to obstructionist GOP hacks like Boehner , Cantor , Pence , McCotter , Foxx , Issa , Ryan , McHenry , Schock , etc. , but last year 's stimulus bill created something like 2.1 million jobs in the last three months of 2009 according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
Crist : " We accepted the stimulus money ; I think all of my fellow governors did .
I think it was the responsible thing to do for the people and it puts people above politics .
In Florida alone , for example , it created or maintained at least 87,000 jobs .
" Schwarzenegger : " I have been the first of the Republican governors to come out and support the stimulus money ... and anyone who says it has n't created a job can talk to the 150,000 people who have been getting jobs in California .
" And then Rachel talked about the grotesque hypocrisy and partisan game - playing of Lindsey Graham , Tim Pawlenty and John McCain .
Man , did she nail those three -- especially poor pathetic old McCain !
And then she brought on Barney Frank , who 's been working with Republicans in Congress since 1980 and has some understanding of what makes them tick , to drive a stake through their hearts .

An observer at the catwalks in New York yesterday could be forgiven for thinking they 'd slipped back in time to the 40s : elegant gowns with long hemlines and fur , fur , fur .
Carolina Herrera , designer for women who do not need to ask the price , used fox , sable and mink .
Marc Jacobs added furry fringes to bags , while Zac Posen kept his carnival - themed models warm with fur coats .
Rather go naked than wear fur ?
Do n't go shopping in New York next autumn .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Senate adjourned Friday without approving extensions of cash and health insurance benefits for the unemployed after a lone senator blocked swift passage due to his insistence that Congress first pay for the $ 10 billion package .
Retiring Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Kentucky , led a spirited Senate debate with Democrats over the issue -- at one time cursing at another senator on the floor .
Bunning said he does n't oppose extending the programs -- he just does n't want to add to the deficit .
According to two Democratic aides on the Senate floor Thursday night , Bunning muttered " tough s--- " as Sen .
Jeff Merkley , D - Oregon , criticized Bunning 's stance on the package .
An aide to Merkley said the senator did n't hear the remark .
A spokesman for Bunning said he was aware of the reports about the senator 's language but did n't have a comment .
On Friday , Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - California , sent Bunning a letter asking him to " stand down immediately " from his stance .
" Unemployment insurance is a lifeline to the long - term unemployed whose families have been hit very hard by this recession , " she said .
For his part , Bunning maintained on Friday that if all senators could agree that the benefits are so important , then they should find a way to pay for them .
" If we can't find $ 10 billion somewhere for a bill that everybody in this body supports , we will never pay for anything , " he said .
Democrats argued the safety net funds are classified as " emergency " and therefore do n't need to be offset .
Starting Monday , the jobless will no longer be able to apply for federal unemployment benefits or the COBRA health insurance subsidy .
With the Senate not in a position to vote on the extensions until next Tuesday at the earliest , senators and their staffs scrambled to determine the practical implication of letting the programs lapse -- even if for just a few days .
In addition to funding unemployment insurance and the COBRA health insurance program for people who have lost their jobs , the bill would have prevented a scheduled 21 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors .
Those cuts will technically go into place when doctors ' offices open Monday .
But because there is a two - week delay processing Medicare payments , a short - term lapse of the program is unlikely to affect payments , according to experts in the medical community and a Senate Finance Committee aide contacted by CNN .
Likewise , unemployment benefits could be delayed -- but if Congress acts next week , they will probably be minor , according to a Labor Department analyst who spoke to CNN .
That 's because Congress will likely approve the funds retroactively to make up for the missing days .
An aide to Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus confirmed the Senate will try to pass the funds retroactively .
Other programs involving federal flood insurance , satellite TV licensing , and small business loans , will also go dark until Congress passes extensions .

Partners
The southern Milky Way can be so bright that on a clear moonless night it will cause shadows , yet it is something people living in the northern hemisphere only hear stories of .
In the same way , the beauty and objects of the northern sky are a mystery to southern residents .
“ Big Dipper to Southern Cross ” brings these two hemispheres -- truly “ One People , One Sky . ”
For this project there will be two telescopes -- one in the northern hemisphere and one in the south -- on two different nights .
No experience is needed .
This is a chance to watch as an experienced telescope operator and guide show how they capture the wonders of the night sky .
Join other members of AWB Affiliates around the world .
Chat will be available between participants and with the telescope operator .
Join in or just watch .

Nowadays , employers seem to think that all graphic design work is done by software and that the employees are just doing data - entry .
I ’ve even seem job offers that refer to graphic artists as “ computer operators , ” rather than the trained and ( hopefully ) experienced professionals they are .
However , a few years ago , art directors and account managers had more respect for the skills of their artists .
Well , sometimes …
It was a friday afternoon , ten minutes before quitting time , when the account team raced into the studio of a major ad agency –they ran right to my desk and dropped a handful of paintings and photos in front of me .
“ We need your help–but we promise it ’ll only take an hour . ”
I understand about advertising deadlines and I was the “ go to ” guy when jobs were on the line .
“ Sure , ” I said , “ whatcha got ? ”
They showed me a completed illustration : a painting of a man in a rowboat on a lake , with the wake of the boat spelling out the name of their product .
The also showed me some photos torn from magazines which were probably reference pix for the painting .
Lakes , man in boats , that sort of thing .
“ We commissioned this illustration , ” they explained , “ and we decided we want to give the client another choice , but we have to ship the ad to the printer and we have no more time .
We want you to reconstruct the illustration from these magazine pictures , but it has to be ready to release , so you have to make it really polished –and make it sharper and hi-rez . ”
“ You realize , if I can do this , it ’ll take about 12 hours , and no guarrantee I can make it look like a real photo , ” I advised them .
“ Yes , you can .
You have Photoshop ! ”
The art director screamed .
Meanwhile , one of the account guys brought my boss over , who corroborated everything I said .
“ Listen , ” I said , “ you have a finished illo , but if you really want me to do this I will , but I ca n’t have it done before tomorrow , and that ’s if I stay all night .
your illustration will still look better . ”
The art director blew his stack “ LOOK–THIS WON ’T TAKE MORE THAN TWO HOURS !! ”
And then he added “ I ’D DO IT MYSELF IF I KNEW HOW TO USE PHOTOSHOP !! ”
Yesterday , the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of Nick George , a Pomona College student who was detained and aggressively interrogated by Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) authorities , by the FBI and by Pennsylvania police when he tried to board a plane carrying Arabic language flash cards .
You heard right : Not liquids , not matches , not a bomb .
Flash cards .
George , a physics major who 's studying Arabic , was pulled aside for secondary screening at the Philadelphia International Airport as he tried to go through security .
When he emptied his pockets , the inspector saw his flash cards and he was arrested , handcuffed , locked in a cell for hours and aggressively questioned .
Because of some flash cards .
The following exchange took place between George and a TSA supervisor who questioned him :
TSA Supervisor : You know who did 9/11 ?
George : Osama bin Laden .
TSA Supervisor :
Do you know what language he spoke ?
George : Arabic .
At that point , the TSA supervisor held up George ’s flash cards — which had words such as " to smile " and " funny " and on them — and said : " Do you see why these cards are suspicious ? "
Ah , the smoking gun .
Here 's the problem : During George 's ordeal , no fewer than seven law enforcement officers took part in detaining and questioning him .
The unnecessary arrest , detention and questioning of someone who , like George , poses no threat to flight safety , makes everyone less safe by diverting resources away from real threats .
George said yesterday , “ As someone who travels by plane , I want TSA agents to do their job to keep flights safe .
But I do n’t understand how locking me up and harassing me just because I was carrying the flash cards made anybody safer .
No one should be treated like a criminal for simply learning one of the most widely - spoken languages in the world . ”
One of the FBI agents who questioned him put it best , we think .
At the end of his ordeal , he said to George : “ The police call us to evaluate whether there is a real threat .
You are not a real threat . ”
Something different , to leaven out these cryonics posts .
Newcomb ’s Paradox has been described as the most controversial dilemma in the history of decision theory .
As told , it starts with Omega , a superintelligence from another galaxy .
But yesterday it occurred to me to wonder : might a sufficiently skilled mentalist be able to do the same trick ?
The mentalist selects a member of the audience in some way that reassures everyone that they ’re not picking stooges .
They come onto the stage and chat for a bit , then the mentalist brings out an opaque box and puts it on a perspex table .
Next to it , they place a transparent box , in which a £ 10 note is clearly visible .
And they say to the volunteer : “ You can either have both boxes , or just take the opaque box , but you have to decide now , before you open either . ”
“ The snag is , I ’ve guessed what you ’re going to do .
If I think you ’ll take just the opaque box , you ’ll find £ 100 in it when you open it .
But if I think you ’ll take both boxes , then you ’ll find the opaque box empty .
Now choose : will you take one box , or both boxes ? ”
At which point the audience member announces their intent , and is invited to open the opaque box .
And to their mild astonishment , the audience see that the mentalist ’s prediction has once again come true .
Not being a mentalist , I do n’t know whether this trick could really be done , but I ’d love to find out .
Most people find the correct thing to do under these circumstances obvious .
The trouble is , about half the people think it ’s obvious you should two - box , because by the time you ’re deciding , the opaque box is already either full or empty , so what you do ca n’t make any difference except to net you an extra tenner .
And about half the people think it ’s obvious you should one - box , because night after night the one - boxers walk away with £ 100 while the two - boxers walk away with £ 10 .
Anyone know any good mentalists ?
Anyone good mates with Derren Brown ?
Kathy Griffin stars in an upcoming Law & Order SVU episode , playing an activist .
Sure , these parts are usually reserved for nobody actors , but not always !
And it ’s very important for Griffin to step up her brand , because My Life on the D - List is about to be on no list , as she grows increasingly tired with filming the Bravo series .
So , fine , give Griffin a new part , like this one where , while while in the arms ( okay , protective custody ) of lesbian lust object Mariska Hargitay , Ms. Griffin steals a kiss .
But homey do n’t play that .
UDPATE : Producers cut the kiss from air .
Consumers know Google primarily as a search engine , but for years the company has been trying to diversify into new products , including email , Web apps , mobile phones , and YouTube .
But in reality , Google is still the world 's biggest ad - driven media company .
And the vast majority of its ad revenue still comes from ads on Google sites , mostly Google Search .
( Gmail and YouTube also contribute , but not much ) .
During 2009 , Google reported $ 24 billion in gross revenue .
If you subtract the $ 6 billion Google paid out to partners as revenue splits and traffic acquisition costs , Google 's net revenue last year was $ 18 billion .
Almost all of this revenue came from ads .
Specifically , once you subtract the traffic acquisition costs , here 's where the company 's net sales come from :
A huge majority from Google - owned sites
A thin slice from the AdSense business
And a similarly thin slice from " licensing and other revenues , " which includes Google 's search appliances , Google Apps , etc .

A senior New South Wales policeman is under investigation by a corruption watchdog over allegations about the misuse of tickets for Sydney 's Big Day Out music festival .
The Police Integrity Commission ( PIC ) is investigating a complaint involving Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Wilkins .
It is understood a complaint has been made that the officer gave Big Day Out tickets to his daughter which were meant for plainclothes police working at the event .
A police statement says the officer is on annual leave and will return to his substantive rank as a superintendent .
It says the matter has been referred to the PIC and no further comment will be made .
Tomorrow , I plan to travel to the centre of London where I will take a huge overdose – in public – consuming an entire bottle of pills .
I will not be alone .
I 'll be joined by several hundred others in London and around the world who will also be overdosing .
No harm will come to us because the pills will be homeopathic , and therefore contain no active ingredient – just sugar .
This is the 10:23 campaign and our aim is to demonstrate to the public in the strongest way possible that these pills , sold to poorly customers by companies like Boots have , literally , nothing in them .
Boots for one sells homeopathic remedies even though it admits that there is no reason to believe they are clinically effective .
Some may argue that homeopathy is harmless , but that simply is n't the case .
The pills themselves may be ineffective , but their impact on public health can be toxic .
When the UK government ploughs more than £ 4 m of taxpayers ' money into homeopathy annually , and leading pharmacists stock their magic potions , it serves to legitimise the industry , to suggest that somehow homeopaths are on a par with real doctors .
The consequences of that can be disastrous , whether it's the suicide of a patient who should be taking antidepressants , delayed treatment for a serious illness , or a traveller packing " anti-malarial " pills that do n't actually work .
The online " What 's the harm ? " project lists numerous people who have been harmed by homeopaths who were deluded enough to believe they were offering genuine medical advice .
There has been a steady trickle of deaths , such as " Ms A " who died after a homeopath informed her she did not need to take her heart medicine , or the six - month - old baby who died after his parents , one of whom was a practising homeopath , refused to allow him to be given conventional medicine .
Senior homeopaths claim that this sort of thing is rare , but investigations tend to show otherwise .
Deluded homeopathic adventurers are setting up clinics and running research projects in places like Tanzania , claiming to be able to treat Aids and denouncing antiretroviral drugs as evil , behaviour that is estimated to have already been responsible for over a third of a million deaths in South Africa .
Shockingly , these sorts of activities are sanctioned and funded by at least one British homeopathic organisation , as revealed in the 2007 accounts of the registered charity the Homeopathic Action Trust and exposed by the blogger Gimpy .
Of course , senior homeopaths in Britain are happy to provide what they believe is scientific evidence for homeopathy , but when scrutinised , the evidence quickly falls apart .
The British Homeopathic Association lists numerous studies in a document on its website , claiming to offer evidence in favour of homeopathy , and yet many of the studies cited simply do n't .
To pick a random example , the fifth citation , a Cochrane review , concludes that " Current evidence does not support a preventative effect of Oscillococcinum - like homeopathic medicines in influenza and influenza - like syndromes . "
And yet the BHA cites this as evidence supporting the effectiveness of homeopathy in flu .
Even where trials are cited that do produce a positive result , the result is qualified .
The third reference , for example , is a trial reported in the BMJ that notes that the results are not sufficient to draw clinical conclusions from , and that more research would be needed .
The remainder of the document , and the BHA 's written evidence to parliament , is riddled with similar anomalies .
Indeed , the BHA seems to accept that the evidence is lacking .
Its written submission to a Commons cross-party science committee investigation into homeopathy last year makes the point that , due to poor methodology , the papers included in its review can't be used to demonstrate clinical significance .
In a press release last year , the BHA described the number of good trials in homeopathy as " minuscule " .
So not only have homeopaths been unable to produce good evidence that homeopathy works , but they 've actually admitted to parliament that the quality of evidence they have is seriously lacking .
This after 200 years of research .
No wonder then that Boots found itself in hot water last year after admitting to the science committee that it sells homeopathic remedies without having any evidence that they work .
Personally , I can't see how handing out treatments for which you admit you have no evidence can be compatible with being a registered pharmacist .
And as campaign members buy their pills ahead of the mass overdose tomorrow , some of the stories we 're hearing are downright disturbing .
One man spoke to a pharmacist explaining that he was buying pills to take part in a homeopathic overdose .
The pharmacist admitted to having no idea what homeopathy was , let alone whether or not it worked , but happily sold him six bottles .
Homeopathy does not work beyond placebo , it is a menace to public health and a drain on the limited resource of the NHS .
It is an 18th century quack medicine consisting of magical rituals practised by deluded , cargo - cult " doctors " that has no place in government thinking , and it should not be endorsed by the registered pharmacists who are at the frontline of public health in the UK .
As the Commons science committee prepares to submit its report on homeopathy to the government , now is the time for everyone who believes in evidence - based medicine to stand up and make this crystal clear .
Please join us at your nearest 10:23 event .

​ New Mexico ’s Legislature has been looking mighty hungrily at the state ’s medical marijuana program as a source of tax revenue .
But according the state ’s Tax and Revenue Department , such a tax could cause patients to turn to the black market .
A 25 percent excise tax on medical marijuana could potentially raise about $ 1.2 million for the state , according to the Legislative Finance Committee ’s fiscal impact report on Sen.
John Sapien ’s bill , SB 56 , reports Marjorie Childress at
The analysis estimated a typical patient spends $ 6,256 annually on medical marijuana , and would pay about $ 1,564 in excise tax per year .
​
There are 1,048 licensed patients in New Mexico .
Of those , 321 are also licensed to grow their own marijuana at home .
The rest depend on the state ’s licensed dispensary system , which last year ran out of pot and left patients not - high and dry .
While the tax is on the production rather than on the purchase of medical cannabis , the Tax and Revenue Department rightly pointed out in the report that the analysis assumes patients wo n’t purchase alternatives to licensed dispensary medical marijuana if the price is raised .
If the tax is passed on to the patients , it could instead push more patients to grow at home , or to purchase from the black market , the report says :
… while there might not be a substitute for medical marijuana , there are substitute sources for medical marijuana where this new tax would not be applied .
Most patients with the physical ability or resources available to grow their own medical marijuana may already do so ; however , a price increase of 25 percent could push more of the non-growing patients to grow their own or to turn to the black market .
Sen .
Sapien told
The Independent last week that it ’s not a given that non-profit producers would pass the tax on to consumers , but many patient advocates , including Paul Culkin , who recently organized the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Patients Group , assume that it would be .
Sapien said he had not heard of any other proposals to tax medicine or drugs recommended as treatments by physicians .
“ Most patients do n’t have the money to purchase equipment for a grow room , many are n’t physically able to grow their own , and many are on Social Security and fixed incomes , ” Culkin said .
Washington
Wire reported earlier today that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel privately apologized last week to the Special Olympics after the Journal reported that he used the word “ retarded ” in a derogatory manner .
But advocates for people with disabilities did n’t think that apology , coming in a phone call to Special Olympics head Tim Shriver , was enough .
Now , Emanuel is taking his contrition one step farther – hosting a delegation of advocates , including two people with mental disabilities , at the White House .
A statement from the Special Olympics issued late Tuesday described the session as a “ face - to - face discussion with Rahm Emanuel about the suffering and pain of people with intellectual disabilities that is perpetuated by the use of the terms ‘ retard ’ and ‘ retarded ’ as well as the damage that can be done by the casual use of the R - word – even if it is not directed toward people with intellectual disabilities . ”

A US president is again choosing to meet the Dalai Lama despite Chinese opposition .
But why is this Tibetan spiritual and political leader such a popular figure in the West ?
To the Chinese government and to many of its people he is an inciter of violence and a defender of a brutal , backward , feudalistic , theocratic society .
But to many politicians and people in the West , the Dalai Lama is a kind of smiling , spiritual and political superhero .
His monastic robes , beaming countenance and squarish , unfashionable glasses are the stuff of a thousand photo opportunities .
To some he is in a league of international personalities that contains only one other person - Nelson Mandela .
DALAI LAMA - KEY EVENTS
Born Tenzin Gyatso in 1935 Designated 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1937 Enthroned in 1940 , but his rights exercised by regency until 1950 - the year Chinese troops entered Tibet Forced into permanent exile in 1959 after China 's suppression of Tibetan national uprising Settled with other Tibetan refugees at Dharamsala , northern India Has since refused to return to Tibet Awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 1989
He is well - known for his contact with Hollywood supporters like Richard Gere and Steven Segal .
Those who have met him describe an intense personal charisma .
There is a " wonderful smiling face , cherubic looks , the infectious laugh " says Alexander Norman , who co-operated with the Dalai Lama on his autobiography as well as several other works after first meeting him in 1988 .
It is hard to escape the idea that the Dalai Lama is perceived almost as an avuncular " Santa Claus " figure by some , says Dr Nathan Hill , senior lecturer in Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies .
" He is very photogenic .
In the West we like stars .
He is an extremely engaging person , and an extremely smart man .
I find him extremely savvy politically , very forward looking . "
There are many in the West who are seeking an unthreatening spiritual boost in an age of materialism , suggests Norman , who recently wrote The Secret Lives of the Dalai Lama .
" There is a huge desire in the secular West a hunger for something other than the benefits that modern industrial society can supply . "
Search on Amazon for the Dalai Lama 's books and you see long lists of spiritual and self - help tracts .
" He is unstained by the world [ to some readers ] , " says Dr Hill .
" You want to read his books in order to find enlightenment yourself . "
Tibetan mystique
And the appreciation of the Dalai Lama taps into some older Western ideas about Tibet as a remote Shangri - La .
" Tibet had a policy from 1792 - 1903 not to allow Westerners into the country , " says Dr Hill .
" That fostered a mystique .
We have this nation that was almost completely closed to white people .
Friend to the stars , including Hollywood actor and Buddhist Richard Gere " When you start to get more information you get the notion of Tibet as a mystical hidden land of magic and wonder .
It is a kind of product of European adventure travel literature . "
There is a sense that the Dalai Lama is politically extrapolated in a way that may not be totally grounded in reality .
" He is a sort of pin - up boy for a lot of movements - the animal rights movement , religious syncretism , " says Norman .
" There is a lot of wishful thinking that goes on in connection with the Dalai Lama . "
Western confusion over the Dalai Lama is best illustrated by the attempts to analyse his position on gay rights .
He has expressed an aversion to gay sex , and even oral sex among heterosexual couples , and yet at other times has taken a more nuanced line , says Norman .
" He will say it 's your choice , it 's up to people 's own conscience .
He is very conscious of not giving people offence . "
There is criticism of him from some Tibetan exiles for sticking to a moderate , non-violent stance , says Norman .
There has also been criticism from religious opponents who say he has wrongly proscribed worship of a deity called Shugden .
Starry - eyed admirers " Among exiles there is an increasingly vocal minority that opposes him , but it's a small minority , " says Robert Barnett , director of Modern Tibetan Studies at Columbia University .
The Dalai Lama is a wolf wrapped in a habit , a monster with human face and animal 's heart
Widely reported translation of comments by Zhang Qingli , the Communist Party Secretary in Tibet " Inside Tibet there is near universal admiration for him , and for his attempts to get a non-violent solution . "
There is discussion about whether the Dalai Lama and his colleagues paint an accurate picture of Tibet before the Chinese intervention in 1950 , or whether any mythology is the invention of Western admirers .
There is even a belief among some starry - eyed admirers in a pre-1950 Tibet where " women enjoyed equal rights and everyone was in harmony with the environment " , says Dr Hill .
But the blame for any mythologising cannot be laid entirely at the door of the Dalai Lama , says Norman .
" On the one hand you could accuse him of peddling an unrealistic picture of what Tibet was actually like .
On the other hand Tibetans genuinely think of their country in those terms - this romantic image . "
Chinese criticism of the Dalai Lama , while predominantly concerned with the idea that Tibet is historically part of China , also lambasts the idea of a pre-1950 Shangri - La and focuses on serfdom , and poor living conditions .
" The Dalai Lama has been one of the harshest critics of ' old Tibet ' , " says Donald Lopez , Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan .
Cup of tea diplomacy " He is not a purveyor of the Shangri - La Syndrome .
There is evidence that he would have introduced political reforms if the Chinese had not invaded . "
Unafraid to see the funny side of himself
And the idea that the Westerners who venerate the Dalai Lama are unaware of the complexities of the Tibet Question is false , despite it being " very fashionable " says Prof Barnett .
Tibet 's place at the junction of three nuclear powers and with a key part in the world 's water supply will always make the Tibet Question more than a Western liberal hobby horse .
There is a clear rationale for the political leaders who meet him despite Chinese pressure .
For those who feel uncomfortable about Chinese human rights abuses it is a chance to irritate China without risking a full - on diplomatic incident .
" [ The Dalai Lama ] is an ideal opportunity for them , because as a political leader , he asks for very little - he seems quite happy to accept a merely symbolic gesture like a cup of tea and a photo , " says Prof Barnett .
" The more China complains , the more Western leaders look strong and principled when they meet him . "
It is perhaps understandable that he has met every serving US president since 1991 .
But to ordinary people , whether right or wrong , the Dalai Lama 's box office appeal is more about the charisma of the man and the ideas that they believe he is sympathetic to .
As Norman notes his Western fans see a " secular saint " or a " politically correct god for a godless world " .

Your article makes it sound like the Dalai Lama is popular because of clever PR .
You seem to forget that he is the legitimate ruler of Tibet , deposed by the expansionist and militaristic policies of the Chinese government , and that before the occupation , Tibetans were not subject to torture , random arrests , disappearances , and complete curtailment of all rights to free speech , assembly , or legitimate political representation .
Maybe the fact that the Dalai Lama represents truth and freedom , as opposed to lies and oppression , is the reason why he is popular .
Dominic Bradley , Sheffield , England The Dalai Lama is essentially a dictator who uses religion as a front in his quest to reinstate a system whereby the vast majority of people live in abstract poverty and are forced to give most of what little they have to the monasteries and monks who rule through religious indoctrination and violence .
Just because China is a bigger and more powerful oppressor does n't excuse the Dalai Lama in any way , and it 's pathetic to see the usual ignorant , rich , western do - gooders crowd round him because their own lives are so empty they will fall for any kind of spiritualist mumbo-jumbo .

We like the Dalai Lama because he preaches compassion and believes it does not matter what your religion is as long as you follow the truth with an open mind .
I met him for about an hour with 12 other people in 1981 and he was funny , understanding , knowledgeable and just great fun to be with .
Andrew Failes , Petersburg , USA Buddhism is not a monotheistic religion like Christianity , Judaism or Islam and the DL is not seen as a prophet or god 's representative on Earth .
He is just a man who found himself placed in the position of guardian of a spiritual philosophy which places each man and woman as the creator of their own karma , responsible to themselves and those around them .
Their " religion " is based entirely on humility , kindness and compassion without needing to reference the words of some supposedly almighty , judgemental entity .
Ross Rebbeck , Teignmouth , Devon , UK
The answer to your question is : throughout Chinese history we know that the West will do anything that will harm the integrity of the Chinese nation .
Western countries and leaders will always act together to weaken China .
This is just another instance of western destructive tendency towards China .

We love His Holiness because in the world full of hatred mongers and jingoists , he is a rare voice of peaceful right of freedom .
He has nurtured modernity in a tradition - driven religious order .
He has never spewed vitriol against the grave injustices done by the draconian and despotic Chinese regime .
Those of us who have had the luxury of witnessing his presence know the shear radiance of his face , innocence of his hapless smile , and balminess of his voice of reason .
He is the last beacon of hope against our cowardice to stand up to hegemony and tyranny of an opportunist , oppressive state that continues to thrive amidst our collective greed manipulated by market capitalism .
Sanjay Mishra , Nashville , TN ( USA ) I sincerely have to thank the Dalai Lama for his writings and wisdom .
In times of deep confusion and unhappiness , his writings led me to find my way back to being a more rational , balanced and happier human being who can appreciate things in life many people may find insignificant .
I have deep respect for the Dalai Lama and his wisdom .
E Wallace , Lanark , Scotland / UK
The West is scared of China and this article proves it .
You have trivialised his dedication and courage in taking on the biggest bully in world by concentrating on his personal appeal and smartness .
Their admiration of Dalai Lama is just to hide their fear of China - by showing admiration for the Dalai Lama , they sort of tease the bully and run .
They are afraid of opposing China on any issue be it democracy or support of Sudan / Iran / N Korea or any other renegade regime that may require support and provide benefits to China .
Arun , Dehradun , India I do not trust this man who " seems quite happy to accept a merely symbolic gesture like a cup of tea and a photo . "
He is and has been in direct league with some seriously bad people .
Louise , Holyoke MA USA Everyone loves an underdog .... especially a non-violent , smiling and charismatic one .
It makes it even more so if China , a powerful communist country , is the local bully .

Of all the controversies and kerfuffles involving Google of late , none has been more of a head - scratcher than the allegation that the search giant was protecting Islamic sensibilities by self - censoring its auto - fill function .
Early this month , a search on the phrase " Islam is " would produce no auto - fill suggestions , while the same search on other religions would return the expected list of popular search topics ... and sometimes vulgar taunts .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Google claimed it was a bug they would fix .
And now it 's apparent that they have , at least here at my desktop and according to various reports from various sources .
Type " Islam is " into Google and you should get a list of popular searches , most disparaging , one vulgar .
While the allegation of self - censorship received a relatively widespread airing in forums as diverse as Wired , SearchEngineLand , HuffingtonPost , The ( London ) Register , and atheists.org , news of the rectification has attracted precious little attention .
Google itself has acknowledged the fix , according to this story from the Science & Technology section of FoxNews.com ( who new Fox had such a section ? ) :
A Google spokesman tells FoxNews.com that " the bug fix is in the process of rolling out , and suggestions will be visible within the next few days . "
Twitter comments from readers across the country confirm Google 's statement ; reports from Florida , Ohio , New Jersey , Georgia and more concur that the fix is rolling out across the country .
When FoxNews.com had asked Google for an explanation on Jan. 8 , a company spokesman explained that the weird absence of results was just a software problem : " This is in fact a bug and we 're working to fix it as quickly as we can . "
But the company would not respond to requests for clarification , nor would it offer a timeline for repairing the problem .
Most but not all of the self - censorship allegations originated from the right - leaning corner of the political spectrum , although it 's worth noting that the conservative Washington Times seemed to mostly give Google a pass in an editorial .
And there were those who took a look for themselves and decided to take Google 's explanation at face value , including this blogger .
However , even after Google said they were working on a fix , skeptics remained skeptical ... and watchful .
And , even though Islam is now receiving the same software - defined if disrespectful treatment as other religions , you can be certain that voices will continue to contend that Google politics played more of a role in the reversal than Google engineers .
Personally , I 'll give Google the benefit of the doubt .
A final note , however : Listed at No. 9 among the newly restored auto - fill options for " Islam is " is ... " Islam is Google . "
Make of that what you will .
10 m illegal copies of Star Trek are said to have been downloaded in 2009 .
In the first case of its kind , an Australian court has ruled that an internet service provider cannot be responsible for illegal downloading .
iiNet , Australia 's third largest ISP , was taken to court by a group of 34 movie production houses .
The group included the Australian divisions of Universal Pictures , Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox .
They claimed that iiNet was guilty of copyright infringement for not preventing illegal downloads of films .
The movie group hired investigators to track the numbers of iiNet customers using BitTorrents to illegally download movies .
They wanted iiNet to warn the offenders and then cut them off if they continued to download .
The group also wanted certain websites to be blocked by the ISP .
However , the judge ruled iiNet was not responsible for the online behaviour of its customers .
" I find that the mere provision of access to the internet is not the ' means ' of infringement , " said Federal Court Justice Dennis Cowdroy .
" If the ISPs become responsible for the acts of their customers , essentially they become this giant and very cheap mechanism for anyone with any sort of legal claim . "
In Italy , meanwhile , the government is proposing new laws which would make video channels such as YouTube directly responsible for copyright infringement if their users upload copyrighted material .
The proposals would require YouTube , owned by Google , to acquire a broadcasting licence in order to operate .
The legislation was amended after lobbying by religious groups MPs have backed a government move to allow sex education to be taught in England in a way that " reflects " a school 's " religious character " .
The amendment to the Children , Schools and Families Bill was passed by a majority of 345 in the Commons .
Opponents had said ministers showed " cowardice " by making the amendment in the face of religious groups ' lobbying .
The government insisted there had been no " watering down " of plans to make all schools teach the biology of sex .
The " religious character " amendment to the bill was passed without debate due to a lack of parliamentary time .
' Major step forward '
The change follows what the Catholic Education Service claimed had been a period of " extensive lobbying " .
Opponents of the amendment have argued it could allow faith schools to teach sex and relationships educations in ways that are homophobic , gender discriminatory and in violation of principles of human rights .
Keith Porteous Wood , executive director of the National Secular Society , said the government had " once more bowed to pressure from the Catholic Church , betraying the children in faith schools who have a right to objective and balanced sex education " .
" This cowardice will blight many lives , " he added .
But Schools Secretary Ed Balls said the bill was " a major step forward " in requiring all schools not only to teach children about the biology of sex but also about relationships , and in lowering the maximum age for parents to keep their children out of sex education classes from 19 to 15 .
He said : " There is no watering down of what is actually an overdue change .
" There is no opt - out for any faith school from teaching the full , broad , balanced curriculum on sex and relationship education and that is a huge step forward . "
Mr Balls added : " Every school will have to teach the full curriculum in a balanced way that respects equality and is not discriminatory , but of course what we are saying is they can explain the views of their faith .
" Catholic schools can say to their pupils that , as a religion , we believe contraception is wrong , but what they can't do is therefore say they are not going to teach about contraception . "
The full , amended , bill was passed by a Commons majority of 91 and now goes to the House of Lords .

As the mass of baby boomers age , it seems our society as whole becomes even more obsessed with holding onto youth , at all cost .
Who 'd even heard of ‘ E.D. ' during the rocking ‘ 60s ?
But in our fixation with finding the fountain of youth , we might be facing some unintended consequences as we tone our abs and smooth our wrinkles .
A recent psychological study addressed the effects of a particular use of Botox , one of the prime weapons in the war against the calendar .
The study concerned a current theory in psychology called the " facial feedback " hypothesis .
It holds that people rely on a feedback loop to recognize their own emotions ; " reading " the feelings of their own facial expressions helps them to recognize that they are experiencing a particular emotion .
So , for example , people frown because they are sad , but to a degree , they also feel the sadness more fully and completely -- because they are frowning .
The study , conducted by David Havis and scheduled to appear in Psychological Science , looked at 40 people whose foreheads were injected with Botox ; thus deactivating a pair of muscles that cause brow - wrinkling frowns .
One result ?
The subjects were slower to understand sad and angry written statements .
A vital element in their emotion - recognition feedback loop had been removed , impairing their ability to experience their emotions as fully as they had before the injections .
A very real ramification of disabling this feedback loop with Botox is that people will experience less sadness and .
It 's not that the condition prevents them from having these emotions , but it limits the feedback that people use to decipher their feelings .
Taken a step further , disabling the facial feedback loop can also impair the ability to understand and be to others ' pain , because people perceive the pain of friends partly through their own empathic responses .
Being less in touch with our own ability to feel pain makes us less able to respond empathically to the pain of those we care about .
As a clinical psychologist , I can tell you that there are many people who are already way out of touch with their emotions .
And they struggle with this , even without Botox .
With less awareness of negative emotions , people are missing an important inner signal that flags when something is upsetting - to themselves or others .
Imagine being that much less in touch with your feelings after your boyfriend leaves you .
Socially , imagine not being able to relate to a friend as she grieves over the death of a parent .
If our ability to be empathic is impaired , so , too , is the ability to form healthy , supportive relationships .
The long - term implications could include unhappiness , distress , or a gnawing feeling that something is terribly wrong - even if those feelings exist only below the surface of a superficially " happy " person 's wrinkle - free face .
Botox is not the demon here , nor its skin - smoothing effects .
Looking younger can make you feel better .
And , being a little less aware of sadness and anger at particular times can be helpful .
But I see a lesson in Havis 's findings about the need to be careful in the we set for ourselves and how important it is for us to consider the long - term consequences of how aggressively we choose to pursue them .
Dr. Leslie Becker - Phelps is a clinical psychologist in private practice and is on the medical staff at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville , NJ .
Lots o’ Haiti hasbara .
O , where to begin ?
–" Very interesting piece on ABC News the other night .
Diane Sawyer and their medical correspondent did an extended and unflattering comparison between the activities of the Israeli medical team in Haiti and the lack of same by the U.S. military , " writes Mike Desch .
" Of course , it is great that the IDF responded to this disaster but the piece had a real feel of p.r. to it as well .
Israel ’s Hasbara crew understands that they have a huge p.r. problem post - Gaza and so they are always on the lookout for opportunities to present Israel in a more favorable light . "
– Cynical ?
Here ’s an Israeli doctor making the same analysis :
" The extreme right wing in Israel is using the Haiti operation to reframe the fallout from the Goldstone report in the eyes of the world , " Dr Yoel Donchin , an Israeli anesthesiologist and a veteran of Israeli rescue operations told The Media Line .
" They know the Haitians are not part of the agenda and this is just for propaganda .
But if it ’s good for Israel they do n’t care . "
" You ca n’t save everyone , and anyone who has studied mass casualty situations knows that the first thing you have to do is not rush in but to send a small team to evaluate what is the best way to help in the long run , " he said .
" So the fact that Israel wants to race to be the first to be there means nothing in the big picture , because Israel is usually the first to arrive but also the first to leave . "
" If , for example , Israel were to bring water purification systems and chemical toilets it would be much more helpful , " Dr Donchin said .
" But their logic is that then it would n’t get on the news . "
Richard Silverstein has a translation of Dr Donchin ’s op - ed on this theme in Yediot here .
– And today I received the following email : " HOW MANY NEWS REPORTS HAVE YOU SEEN ABOUT THIS ???????
Watch this news video from Haiti .
It ’ll make you proud to be an Israeli and a Jew . "
Well I ’m not an Israeli , but the link is to a CNN report by medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen about an Israeli field hospital in Haiti that is doing work other harum - scarum clinics are not .
" I ’m just amazed , I ’m amazed by what is here …
It ’s just amazing , " says Cohen ( and yes I wonder if she ’s pro-Israel ) .
– The other night on Hardball , Andrea Mitchell twice referred to Israel as providing important aid to Haiti , in her list of countries helping out .
( I found it disturbing .
I thought , She ’s Jewish and powerful , why is she thumping the hasbara ) .

Geologists say the seabed around the Falklands has substantial oil reserves
The UK has made " all the preparations that are necessary " to protect the Falkland Islands , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said .
However , the Ministry of Defence has denied reports that a naval taskforce is on its way to the Falklands .
Argentina has brought in controls on ships passing through its waters to the islands over UK plans to drill for oil .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague told the BBC the Royal Navy 's presence in the region should be increased .
The Sun newspaper reported that up to three ships were to join the islands ' regular patrol vessel .
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt understands the destroyer HMS York and the oil supply tanker RFA Wave Ruler are in the area , as well as HMS Clyde , which is permanently based there .
However , the MoD said Britain already had a permanent naval presence in the South Atlantic as well as more than 1,000 military personnel on the islands .
' Very clear '
Speaking on Gateshead - based Real Radio in the North East , Mr Brown said he did not expect to send a taskforce to the area .
ANALYSIS Caroline Wyatt , BBC defence correspondent
It 's clear that Britain has the military assets it needs in or around the Falkland Islands to back up its diplomacy with Argentina - on the principle that diplomacy succeeds best when a nation can talk softly but carry a big stick .
The MoD will only say that it is " maintaining " a deterrent force in the area , and that this is not a new taskforce - but it leaves little doubt that the UK has the means to defend the Falkland islanders already in place to back up its diplomatic stance .
But at the same time , the British government does not want to escalate the current row with Argentina , even as it remains firm on Britain 's right to explore for oil around the Falklands , with the prime minister and others emphasising that they see " sensible discussions " prevailing .
Earlier this week , Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton , the head of the Royal Air Force , drew attention to the situation in the South Atlantic in a speech to the International Institute of Strategic Studies , referring to the " increasingly tense situation " around the Falkland Islands to stress the need for maintaining air superiority .
Q&A : The Falklands oil row Oil boom or no boom ?
Have Your Say : How serious is row ?
' We always feel threatened '
He said he hoped " sensible discussions " with Argentina would prevail , adding : " We have made all the preparations that are necessary to make sure the Falkland islanders are properly protected . "
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said all UK oil exploration in the area was " completely in accordance with international law " .
He added : " We maintain the security of the Falklands , and there are routine patrols continuing . "
After Argentina 's invasion of the Falklands in 1982 , a UK taskforce seized back control in a short war that claimed the lives of 649 Argentine and 255 British service personnel .
The BBC's Andrew Harding in Buenos Aires said it was difficult to find anyone in Argentina who believed the Falklands were in danger of being at the centre of a military conflict .
But Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Victorio Taccetti said his country would take " adequate measures " to stop oil exploration .
Meanwhile , speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , Mr Hague called for " some sort of increased naval presence - it may just be one more ship visiting more regularly " in the region .
He added : " That kind of thing would show very clearly to Argentina - with whom , again , we want friendly relations - that we will be very firm about this .
It would send a signal not to misunderstand British intentions .
" One of the things that went wrong in the 1980s is that the Argentines thought we were n't really committed to the Falkland Islands .
So , we must n't make that mistake again .
Our commitment should be very clear . "
Buenos Aires claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands , which it calls Islas Malvinas .
It has previously threatened that any company exploring for oil and gas in the waters around the territory will not be allowed to operate in Argentina .
Ocean bed On Tuesday , Argentine President Cristina Fernandez signed a decree requiring all vessels travelling between Argentina and the islands , or those wanting to cross Argentine territorial waters en route to the Falklands , to seek prior permission .
But a drilling rig from the Scottish Highlands , the Ocean Guardian , is nearing the islands and is due to start drilling next week , the UK - based company Desire Petroleum has said .
Last week , a ship carrying drilling equipment was detained by Argentine officials .
Geologists say the ocean bed surrounding the Falklands could contain rich energy reserves .
Last year , Argentina submitted a claim to the United Nations for a vast expanse of ocean , based on research into the extent of the continental shelf , stretching to the Antarctic and including the island chains governed by Britain .
It is due to raise the issue at the UN next week .
On Thursday , an MoD spokesman said the government was " fully committed " to the Falklands , adding : " A deterrence force is maintained on the islands . "
Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said it was important not to lose sight of the fact that the UK and Argentina were " important partners " .
But he added : " ' We have no doubt about our sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and we 're clear that the Falkland Islands government is entitled to develop a hydrocarbons industry within its waters . "
The waters surrounding the disputed islands are considered by the UK to be part of the British Overseas Territories .
But Buenos Aires believes the UK is illegally occupying the Falklands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands .

There are a lot of things on TV that just do n't happen in the real world : Nobody lives in a huge apartment in New York for a hundred bucks a month ; single men do n't adopt adorable moppets to sass up their lives ; the ratio of fat guy to hot wife is substantially lower ; and when George Lopez tells a joke , nobody laughs .
But even unoriginal writing has to come from somewhere , and some of Hollywood 's most outlandish plot twists did n't come from the booze - soaked mind of a hack writer ; they came right from the damn newspaper .
6 Maternity Ward Screw - Ups
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Cheesy Plot :
If television and movies are to be believed , hospital maternity wards are a veritable breeding ground for incompetence and skullduggery .
Take the 1961 Disney classic ( or 1998 Lindsay Lohan atrocity ) The Parent Trap :
A light - hearted comedy about a divorce so bitter and hostile , the two parents split their twins at birth and lead them to believe that they are only children and that their other parent was murdered and fashioned into a stylish ottoman by Ed Gein ( at least that 's how we remember that movie , but we suffer from a bizarre mental condition that causes us to remember things as much more awesome than they actually were ) .

While you certainly can't blame the maternity ward for that wacky series of events -- the parents were assholes and the kids were identical twins -- what about babies that do n't look like each other ?
That 's a pretty common switcheroo in the entertainment world as well .
It 's happened multiple times on the soaps All My Children and One Life to Live , as well as The Ghost Whisperer .
It 's so common , TV Tropes has a whole section devoted to it .
Shit Gets Real :
It turns out there 's a creepy amount of truth to this one : Apparently maternity wards in real life are n't too discerning when it comes to what parent gets what child , just so long as the little crumbsnatchers are out of their sight eventually .

For example , Marti Miller and Sue McDonald had no idea their families had been switched until one mother fessed up ... 43 years later .
Or Kay Qualls and DeeAnn Angell , who were switched in 1953 .
One of their mothers even told the maternity ward that they had fucked up .
Unfortunately , she was ignored - - a fact that can be attributed to the 1950s being a much simpler time , when having a vagina meant you did n't get to be taken seriously .
As for twins being separated , it happens so often that a research center was opened to study how their lives are different .
Hell , even the classic " twins being mistaken for each other " gag has actually happened :
In Spain , a woman discovered she had been separated from her twin in a Canary Islands maternity ward 28 years earlier , when she randomly stumbled into a shop that her sister frequented .
And , since we stopped reading immediately after we verified our claims , we can only assume one turned out to be rather fussy and useless in a fight while the other spent her entire life relentlessly training in the art of kickboxing , and upon meeting decided to team up and avenge their master 's death while learning valuable lessons about life from one other and doing the splits .
Either that , or they just made out .
That 's pretty much all pop culture has taught us that twins do .
Kelly Taylor makes interesting , usual beers in Brooklyn , including Flemish - style sours , a beer brewed with Valrhona chocolate nibs and orange peel , and a collaboration with Blue Hill at Stone Barn that once included farm - fresh roasted beets .
Nice guy that he is , Kelly joined me for a beer and the following interview .
Name : Kelly Taylor
Location : Brooklyn , New York
Occupation : Brewmaster , Heartland Brewery and Kelso of Brooklyn
How did you learn to brew ?
I started as a home brewer in my college dorm room in 1989 .
Two years later I apprenticed at a local brewery ( Karl Strauss Breweries in downtown San Diego , California ) , and then started working my way up at different breweries , such as Eagle Brewery in Mukilteo , Washington ( my hometown ) , and Whidbey Island Brewing Company , both north of Seattle .
You 're from the Northwest — how did you find yourself in New York ?
I met a girl while working at Pyramid Breweries in Seattle .
She was from the Northeast and , after a year of dating , wanted to move back here ( thankfully , she wanted me to move with her ) .
I figured I would get a job that would allow me to use my college degree ( international business ) for once .
We 're now happily married with one child and another on the way .
Tell us about how you got the job at Heartland .
I was working at the Mitsubishi International Corporation on Madison Avenue , regularly traveling the country , and visiting the Far East on occasion , selling specialty chemicals and industrial synthetic and natural rubber .
Suit and tie every day .
Not my style , I eventually realized .
I started looking for a brewing job in the Tri-State area and noticed an assistant brewer position open up at the Heartland Brewery in Union Square .
For my interview , I brought a bottle of a home brew I made in my apartment and put my resume on the bottle as a label .
I was hired on the spot .
Around a year later , just after September 11 , Heartland 's brewmaster moved on and I was promoted .
Do you think being from the Northwest has affected your brewing style ?
It 's affected both my taste for good beer and my appreciation for the fact that the brewing can be both a viable business and a central part of a thriving community .
For instance , in 1995 , my home town of Mukilteo , WA , supported two breweries despite a population of only 10,000 people .
Moreover , both breweries were very active in the community ( e.g. participating in fundraisers ) so much so that the owner of Eagle was actually the mayor of the town .
Anyway , you can imagine my surprise when I came to NYC to find only five breweries in operation ( Chelsea Brewing Company , Heartland Brewery , Brooklyn Brewery and the now - defunct Taproom and Typhoon restaurants ) .
Even today , there are only five brands of beer made in NYC .
There is a lot of room for growth .
What do you have brewing right now ?
What seasonal beers are in the works ?
In terms of Heartland beers , right now we have the Not Tonight Honey Porter ( my resume beer ) in the tank .
We also have the Full Moon Barley Wine due out in a couple of weeks ; it 's a big , robust golden ale , about 10 % ABV , brewed on the summer solstice and served after the first full moon of the new year .
On the Kelso side , we have the Recessionator out now ; an 8 % ABV doppelbock with lots of toffee and plum notes .
It has a clean , dry finish and is deceptively strong .
What challenges do you face brewing in Brooklyn ?
Are there benefits to your location ?
Brooklyn is a great place to brew right now because the borough 's beer drinkers are very locally focused and the water is great , too .
The drawbacks are that the cost of getting grain to Brooklyn is a bit high ( e.g. trucks charge for bridges and tunnel tolls ) and , if you do n't already have a brewery , the real estate for building one can be hard to find for the right price .
What 's your favorite beer you 've brewed ?
The worst ?
The most experimental ?
My favorite is probably the Not Tonight Honey Porter .
I 've always loved porters and this one throws the kitchen sink at the beer : molasses , honey , licorice root , cane sugar , six different malts ; very tasty and fun to make , too .
When I was homebrewing , I would throw whatever dessert was around into the kettle , including even a big fat piece of chocolate cake once .
Another time I did an ancho chile beer that I was skeptical would come out well .
I was right .
The most experimental beer we 've tried at the brewery is perhaps the Kelso Kriek .
We took some leftover Cantillon slurry .
( Cantillon is a distinctive Belgian ale . )
We added a small amount of unfermented beer ( wort ) every day until we had a 200 - gallon batch .
We then aged the batch in bourbon barrels and added cherries for a secondary fermentation .
It was definitely a fun beer to make and was received well , but I have n't tried to replicate it since because there were just too many unknown variables in producing it .
How do develop a new recipe for a beer ?
First , I envision what I would like the beer 's general characteristics to be .
For example , will it be hop - centric , malt - focused , yeast - influenced , a combination of all three , or something else entirely ?
I then take a more granular look , backing my way into the recipe by focusing on how I want each ingredient to come through in the end .
In some cases , we 'll get samples of the ingredients to taste beforehand , especially if I have n't used them before , and evaluate them in the form of a tea ; it 's an effective way to get the essence of the flavor .
How much beer are you making these days in Brooklyn ?
How much of it is for Heartland ?
How much creative control do you have over Heartland 's beers ?
We 're making about 24,000 kegs at the Heartland Brewery ( its new official name ) .
Roughly half is for Heartland , the rest for a mix of other contracts , including Kelso .
I have a tremendous amount of control over Heartland 's beer production .
That said , Jon Bloostein , Heartland 's founder gives a lot of input , too , and is very clear about how he wants his beer to taste .
What are your plans for the brewery for 2010 ?
For the next five years ?
Heartland will soon be opening a Midtown West location at Eighth Avenue and 41st Street , so , from the perspective of the brewery , we 're focused on ensuring that we 'll have enough beer to supply this new location , which will feature 12 to 14 beers on tap .
Going forward , we 're going to be introducing more seasonal Heartland beers and rotating them more frequently .
There are some , such as our Not Tonight Honey Porter and Full Moon Barley Wine , that have become classics , however , we 're also introducing a lot of new ones such as a Blueberry Lager , an Imperial Nut Brown IPA , a Belgian Dubbel and , this spring , a New York State Wildflower Wheat , all of whose ingredients are from the Empire State .
Five years from now ?
I can barely keep up with our production schedule for this year .
Our volume has grown by about 50 percent a year , each year , for the past three years .
We can't sustain that growth over the next three years because we do n't have the space .
So will we need to move ?
I do n't know .
I need to chew on a Tums and think about it .
Do you have favorite Kelso or Heartland beer and food pairings ?
The Heartland Farmer Jon's Oatmeal Stout with BBQ ribs is sublime .
Roasted flavors play off each other , taking the combo to another level .
For Kelso , the Nut Brown Lager with a prime - aged steak from Peter Luger 's is a perfect marriage of contrasts : rich , bold meat with a crispy , dry beer .
Very satisfying .
Are there iconic beers that have been inspirational to you ?
In the early days of my career , the Sierra Nevada beers really did it for me .
They offered a full range of varieties , bright , distinct flavors , very drinkable brews and amazingly consistent quality .
What else is there in brewing , really ?
Are there any beers that you think all beer drinkers should try ?
I say , get into lambics .
Not the Lindemanns variety , which for me are too sweet , but rather Boon or Liefman 's , perhaps a Rodenbach , too , all of which are tart , refreshing , and intense ; it 's crazy how beer can simultaneously taste like balsamic vinegar and fruit , and still be delicious .
Do you have favorite craft breweries elsewhere in the country ?
Outside of our great New York City breweries , I am a huge fan of Pizza Port in Solana Beach , California ; Boundary Bay in Bellingham , Washington ; and Snoqualmie in Snoqualmie , Washington .
They all make creative , assertive , and complex beers that are also very drinkable .
Man , I 'm thirsty .
Thinking about beer and chocolate for Valentine 's Day ?
The Union Square location of Heartland Brewery has held back a few kegs of Taylor 's tasty limited - edition porters to pair with its gooey s'mores dessert .
I especially liked the silky Sumatra Porter brewed with fresh grounds from Oren 's Daily Roast , though the Belgian Chocolate L'Orange is also pretty tasty .
Growlers are available to take home .

A decade of pesky germs , from SARS to avian flu to H1N1 , has given rise to dozens of products bragging about their microbe - killing properties .
Everything from hand - sanitizing liquids to products like computer keyboards , shopping carts and tissues tout that they kill 99.9 % , or 99.99 % , of common bacteria and fungi .
But some of these numbers look like the test scores in a class with a very generous grading curve .
They often do n't include all pesky germs , and are based on laboratory tests that do n't represent the imperfections ...
' Not sure how they were planning on suspending the cycle lane ... strong wires perhaps ?
Either way it does n't seem to have worked , as it's still on the ground .
This is also probably one of the most dangerous cycle lanes in Horsham , as this is a one way street , but the cycle lane goes in the reverse direction .
Despite the double yellow lines on the other side of the road , they do not stop many people from parking there , this means that lorries and cars generally come straight at you and seem to have no intention of stopping or moving over . '

Sheen spent the better part of Christmas Day in a Colorado jail cell after being arrested on domestic violence allegations .
The 44 - year - old actor was arrested Friday morning by officers responding to a 911 call from a house in this ski resort town about 200 miles west of Denver .
An ambulance went to the house , but the accuser was not taken to the hospital .
Sheen , the star of CBS '
Two and a Half Men , was taken to the Pitkin County jail and booked for investigation of second - degree assault and menacing , both felonies , along with criminal mischief , a misdemeanour , Aspen police spokeswoman Stephanie Dasaro said .
He was released in the late afternoon after posting $ 8,500 ( U.S. ) bond and being advised by a county judge on the conditions of his release , she said .
Dasaro declined to name Sheen 's accuser , citing a department policy prohibiting the identification of potential victims in domestic violence cases .
Aspen attorney Richard Cummins said late Friday that he was representing Sheen in the case .
He declined to name Sheen 's accuser or discuss details , but he cautioned against any rush to judgment .
" I think at the end of the day it will be much ado about nothing , " Cummins told The Associated Press .
" I do n't think there 's any criminality about what went on . ''
Cummins said a court date was set for Feb .
8 . " That may be to determine whether a case goes forward or not , " he said .
Sheen 's publicist Stan Rosenfield also warned against making assumptions .
" It would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion , " he said .
Sheen is the son of actor Martin Sheen and brother of actor - director Emilio Estevez .
He is married to Brooke Mueller Sheen , a real estate investor who gave birth to the couple 's first children , twin boys , in March .
They married in May 2008 following Sheen 's bitter divorce and custody battle with actress Denise Richards .

movies has had run-ins with the law before .
In December 1996 , he was arrested and charged with attacking a girlfriend at his Southern California home .
He later pleaded no contest and was placed on two years ' probation .
In 1998 , his father turned him in for violating his parole after a cocaine overdose sent him to the hospital .
He was later ordered to undergo a rehabilitation program .
After some three and a half billion years of life ’s evolution on this planet – and after almost two million years since people recognizable as human first walked its surface – a new human burst upon the scene , apparently unannounced .
It was us .
Until then our ancestors had shared the planet with other human species .
But soon there was only us , possessors of something that gave us unprecedented power over our environment and everything else alive .
That something was – is – the Human Spark .
What is the nature of human uniqueness ?
Where did the Human Spark ignite , and when ?
And perhaps most tantalizingly , why ?
In a three - part series to be broadcast on PBS in 2010 , Alan Alda takes these questions personally , visiting with dozens of scientists on three continents , and participating directly in many experiments – including the detailed examination of his own brain .
Alda is uniquely qualified for this role .
As an actor and author , and as the long - time host of the PBS series Scientific American Frontiers , he has a passion for both the humanities and science .
He is bringing his trademark humor and curiosity to face - to - face conversations with leading researchers seeking the Human Spark , from archeologists finding clues in the fossilized bones and tools of our ancestors ; to primatologists studying our nearest living relatives to explore what we have in common and what sets us apart ; to neuroscientists peering into his mind with the latest brain scanning technologies .
In the first program , Alda witnesses the dazzling ( apparent ) debut of the Human Spark in the spectacular 30,000 year - old artwork carved and painted on the walls of caves in France .
He explores the world of our predecessors in Europe , the Neanderthals , who until we came along had done just fine .
The central question of this program :
What did we possess that the Neanderthals did n’t – and where did it come from ?
Did the Human Spark really burst into life in Europe , as archeologists have long believed ?
Or did it originate earlier , on another continent ?
Finding the answer involves research as disparate as exploring why long distance running gave us large brains ; reconstructing the weaponry that made possible – and relatively safe – the hunting of large animals ; scanning the teeth of Neanderthal children in a giant particle accelerator to see how quickly they grew up ; reading Neanderthal genes ; and discovering the beads that are the first evidence of our species ’ fascination with social status – and that provided our ancestors with a powerful new means of social communication .
In the second program , Alan joins researchers studying our fellow apes – mainly chimpanzees , our closest living relatives – to discover both what we share with them , and what we have that has evolved since we went our separate ways .
Alan observes and participates in experiments that reveal chimps ’ immense skills but also a striking indifference to how things work .
He sees how chimps use tools and have culture – but also how those tools and cultures are very different from ours .
He witnesses chimps showing signs of empathy and cooperation , but also sees how limited these characteristically human qualities are .
And , in an unexpected twist , he visits a “ dog lab ” in Germany where he participates in experiments that show how , in many areas of social understanding , dogs – separated from humans by tens of millions of years of evolution – are considerably more advanced than our nearest relatives .
In the third program , we literally peer into Alda ’s head with a variety of high - tech imaging techniques to see if we can find his Human Spark .
We discover the unique circuitry that provides us with what is our most prized ability , language , and with the insight provided by a family whose members have profound problems with speech , we untangle the complex story of the FOXP2 gene , which appears to have provided us with at least some of the brain mechanisms needed for language .
We find out what areas of Alan ’s brain allow him to use complex tools and understand the minds of others , both essential human attributes .
Alda will participate in tests of babies as young as three months for their ability to make moral judgments .
And we ’ll discover in Alan ’s brain a critical network that works best when he ’s just doing nothing and which , ironically , may in fact be a critical repository for the Human Spark .

The Afghan National Security Council has raised the stakes in the aftermath of this week ’s alleged Kunar massacre , calling for NATO to hand over the responsible parties immediately to Afghan authorities .
NATO continues to change its story on Tuesday morning ’s pre-dawn raid in the Kunar Province , which killed 10 Afghan civilians , eight of them children , and has led to massive protests against the international military effort .
Initially NATO officials insisted there were no operations going on in Kunar at all , though later they privately admitted US special forces were in the area .
This story morphed into claims that it was a US military operation that killed an “ IED cell ” and that they had no proof of any civilian deaths .
Now , NATO says the operation was not military in nature , but rather was a “ sanctioned ” operation conducted by “ non-military Americans ” and that the children were all killed in self defense .
Whether “ non-military Americans ” entails contractors , like Blackwater , or CIA agents as were attacked yesterday in Khost remains to be seen .
It is clear however that there is more than meets the eye to these killings , which locals insist involved the killers dragging the children out of bed and even handcuffing some of them before shooting them .
Well , that was a gimme .

Ooops ...
For President Obama and the people of Las Vegas it truly was a presidential version of Groundhog Day yesterday ( minus Ned Ryerson ) .
Just like the movie where Bill Murray wakes up every morning only to find he must relive February 2 day after day after day ( after day ) , President Obama has found himself in a bit of a time loop .
For the second year in a row , the president angered Nevadans by referencing Las Vegas in a way they 'd not prefer .
They like tourism .
It helps with the economy .
When Obama says spending money in Las Vegas is not the prudent thing to do , Nevadans get irate .
And for the second February in a row , that 's what happened .
" When times are tough , you tighten your belts , " Obama said while giving a speech at a New Hampshire high school Tuesday .
" You do n't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage , " he said .
" You do n't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you 're trying to save for college .
You prioritize .
You make tough choices . "
That makes sense .
What personal financial consultant would n't say the same thing ?
Well , maybe bestselling author Larry Winget .
He 'd probably throw in a " Do n't be an idiot " line first .
Regardless , embattled Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took offense .
" The President needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people should n't be spending their money , " Reid said in a statement .
" I would much rather tourists and business travelers spend their money in Las Vegas than spend it overseas .
Nevada Congresswoman Shelley Berkeley concurred with Reid although to illustrate her level of ire , she threw in an exclamation point .
" Enough is enough ! " Berkeley said in a statement .
" President Obama needs to stop picking on Las Vegas and he needs to let Americans decide for themselves how and where to spend their hard - earned vacation dollars . "
What 's surprising is that the Vegas line made it in his speech again .
Perhaps it was a different set of speechwriters this year .
Or perhaps they just did n't recall the firestorm from last year .
Whatever .
Obama gets it -- again .
He quickly sent a note to Reid offering a quasi-apology .
" I hope you know that during my Town Hall today , I was n't saying anything negative about Las Vegas , " Obama wrote .
" I was making the simple point that families use vacation dollars , not college tuition money , to have fun .
There is no place better to have fun than Vegas , one of our country 's great destinations .
I have always enjoyed my visits , look forward to visiting in a few weeks , and hope folks will visit in record numbers this year .
The influx of drugs money , mostly from the US in $ 100 bills , mostly finds its way on to the books of businesses including restaurants and construction firms as drug lords try to legitimise their cash through money laundering .
It has even believed to have propped up the country ’s banking system , helping it ride out the financial crisis and aiding the country ’s economy .
A new government should tear up " ineffectual " lending agreements with Britain 's taxpayer - owned banks and force them to lend billions of pounds more to small and medium sized businesses , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said today .
Agreements signed by the government last year with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were poorly implemented and had failed to generate the funds needed for British business to get back on its feet , he said .
In a move to distance himself from rival parties ahead of the election , Cable argued banks must put aside any thoughts of returning to the private sector , possibly for 10 years , while they perform a job for the wider economy .
" Restrictions on lending to sound companies by all banks is preventing a sustained economic recovery and thereby compounding the risk of growing bad debts , " he said .
" Behaviour which appears sensible to individual banks is disastrous when pursued collectively . "
Bonuses should also be effectively banned from the banking industry and banks broken up , he said , in a clear message to Barclays and HSBC that they would be forced to separate their investment banking arms from less racy retail operations .
The government has urged banks to increase lending , but has so far refused to loosen other requirements that could make funds available .
Cable argued concerns among nationalised and semi-nationalised banks that they should shun risky lending in favour of building up their reserve capital were " largely irrelevant " because government guarantees meant they " cannot go bust " .
Treasury officials have already admitted banks will miss lending targets .
A study by the Institute of Directors highlighted that six out of every 10 businesses was being " starved of capital " .
Those companies able to borrow were being asked to provide extra security and pay large arrangement fees and high interest rates , Cable said .
Without government intervention and the use of state - owned banks as tools of government policy , the UK risked slipping back into a long recession that would prove as disastrous over the longer term for bank profits as it would for the economy .
Last week Tory shadow chancellor George Osborne proposed selling shares at a discount in RBS and Lloyds at the earliest opportunity .
He put forward a plan for savers to buy shares in the banks after their share prices had recovered sufficiently for the government to recover its own shareholdings .
Cable ridiculed the plan , which he said would perpetuate the current obsession among banks to make profits , pay dividends to shareholders , horde cash and drive up their share prices .
Taxpayers should hang on to their shares for at least 10 years and following the Swedish model maintain a sizeable minority holding of 10 % or 20 % , he said .
A power plant under construction in central Connecticut exploded with earthquake force that shook homes across much of the state on Sunday as workers purged natural gas lines in preparation for the plant to open this year .
At least five people were killed and more than two dozen were injured as a section of the plant collapsed and burned .
Witnesses said the explosion at the Kleen Energy Systems plant in Middletown , 15 miles south of Hartford , occurred at 11:17 a.m. in a thundering convulsion of flames and smoke seen for miles around and felt as far away as cities and towns on the shore of Long Island Sound , 30 miles away .
As towering plumes of dark smoke poured into a dazzling blue sky , scores of ambulances , fire engines , police cars and helicopters streamed to the scene on the west bank of the Connecticut River on the southern outskirts of the city , the home of Wesleyan University .
Fire and rescue teams from Middletown , Durham , Portland , Cromwell and other towns converged as crews fought the blaze into the afternoon .
Aerial pictures showed a smoking , sprawling riverside site with buildings housing generators , fuel tanks and other power equipment , topped by two smokestacks .
The explosion apparently occurred in the largest building , called the Power Block , which was destroyed .
Every year , countless Americans stop exercising –or do n’t even start–due to leg and foot pain .
In response , athletic - shoe companies have poured millions of dollars into new cushioning , arch support , and shock absorbers .
But despite this technological firepower , as many as six out of 10 runners are estimated to get injured every year .
If shoes are not the solution , could they possibly be the problem ?
Evolution might hold the answer .
Daniel Lieberman , a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University , and Dennis Bramble , a biology professor at the University of Utah , argue that for the last 2 million years , humans have engaged in long - distance running .
And , for almost all of that time , humans have been running barefoot , coming down on the forefeet with toes spread and bending the ankles and knees to absorb the shock .
Lieberman believes that today ’s sneakers –with their fat heels , squishy soles , and stiff arch supports–may be causing us instead to land hard on our bony heels with our legs straight .
4 Tips for the Novice Runner
Irene Davis , a professor of physical therapy and head of the Running Research Laboratory at the University of Delaware , is a barefoot skeptic turned convert .
Like most sports - medicine practitioners , she has prescribed custom - made orthotic inserts for patients with heel pain .
When one of her chronically hurt patients wanted to go for a jog with a pair of barefoot - style running shoes , she told him he was nuts .
Despite the warning , he went ahead–and came back injury - free .
Davis herself tried running barefoot and now is logging up to four miles a day on asphalt .
Does n’t it hurt ?
“ No , ” she says .
“ The harder the surface , the more lightly you land and the more easily you spring back . ”
The human body instinctively modifies itself to different kinds of terrain– just think back to when you were a kid and how it felt to run barefoot on the grass , sand , or pavement .
How to Keep Your Feet Happy
Our legs are thickly woven with rubbery , elastic tendons that absorb shock and also use it as free energy , like a rubber ball ricocheting off pavement .
“ If you encase the foot in thick shoes , you not only lose ground awareness , you limit natural elasticity , ” says Robert Schleip of the Fascia Research Center at Germany ’s University of Ulm .
According to a study published in The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness in March , barefoot runners experienced significantly less impact than runners in shoes .
“ We ’ve gone too far with cushioning and arbitrary shoe designs , ” says Stephen Pribut , a leading sports podiatrist in Washington , D.C. Still , Pribut is not ready to tell all of his patients to go barefoot , though he agrees that no study has ever shown that barefoot runners are hurt more often than runners in shoes .
In a 2009 review article for the British Journal of Sports Medicine , researchers searched 30 years of studies and were unable to find one demonstrating that running shoes make people less prone to injury .
11 Stars Who ’ve Gone the Distance
Some of the major athletic - equipment companies already produce minimalist sneakers with little cushioning .
“ If this [ barefoot running ] is injury - preventive because it ’s natural motion , we ’re all for that , ” says Jim Weber , president and CEO of Brooks Sports , a running - shoe manufacturer .
Brooks has been working on a barefoot - type shoe for four years .
“ But one reason we did n’t rush it out is that retailers wo n’t carry it , ” he adds .
Barefoot - running coach “ Barefoot Ted ” McDonald believes that the easiest way to introduce the practice to people is to have them try it out themselves .
He has taught running classes on the Google and Microsoft campuses , and a few months ago in Palo Alto , Calif . , I watched as he led 30 people of all ages and fitness levels in a jog down a city street .
The trick to running barefoot , McDonald says , is remembering three points :
Be light , be quick , and be upright .
You want to land gently and then instantly lift that foot back up so it feels like you ’re in the air more than you ’re on the ground .
At the same time , keep your back straight with your feet right under your hips .
Gradually incorporate barefoot running into your workouts , giving your ankles time to get stronger .
It takes McDonald ’s students trial and error–and around 30 minutes –to get used to the sensation of running barefoot .
“ It ’s amazing , ” one woman reports .
“ I feel like I ’m floating . ”
Christopher McDougall is the author of the best - selling book “ Born to Run . ”
" There are some really strong opinions about that , " Vulgamore said .
" One of my jobs is to listen and align opposing opinions .
That 's true of the Philly Pops question .
That 's true of the music director search .
That 's true of the challenges of size and scope .
It 's down to your bankruptcy question .
I 'm here to align these and try to come up with a way of moving forward . "
Do we need touch events ?
One reaction I received about my touch research was :
Do we really need the touch events ?
Ca n’t we just fire the mouse events when a touch action occurs ?
After all , touch and mouse events are n’t that different .
That ’s a fair question .
It deserves a fair answer .
The problem
Right now , iPhone and Android support the touchstart , touchmove , and touchend events .
Let ’s say my advice is accepted and future browsers also support the touchenter , touchleave , and touchhold events .
The point here is that this series of events is n’t that different from the mouse events .
Respectively , mousedown , mousemove , mouseup , mouseover , and mouseout fulfill the same role as the first five touch events .
The touchhold event does not have a direct mouse equivalent , but it basically fulfills the same function as a right - click detection script .
So if mousedown is really the same as touchstart , why bother with new events ?
Ca n’t we just write a mousedown script that is triggered when the user depresses his mouse button OR touches the screen ?
The issues
As far as I can see there are three fundamental issues involved :
Touch interaction is different from mouse interaction .
Not hugely different , but different enough to warrant separate events .
It MUST be possible to write ONE single JavaScript file that works optimally in any circumstances , on the desktop , in a mobile browser , or in a widget manager , with the user using the touchscreen , the mouse , or the keyboard , as he sees fit .
That implies the web developer MUST be able to distinguish between mouse - driven and touch - driven interaction .
The mouse events have already been implemented as legacy events in all touchscreen browsers .
They all fire after the user releases the screen .
Let ’s study these issues a bit further .
Issue 1 : difference
Although at first sight it seems as it touchstart is equal to mousedown , touchmove to mousemove , and touchend to mouseup , this is not really the case .
Take a look at my second scrolling layer script .
It was written for touchscreen phones , and works perfectly if the browser supports the touch events .
Currently only iPhone and Android do .
I added the mousedown event to touchdown , mousemove to touchmove , and mouseup to touchup .
Try it in a normal desktop browser .
You ’ll find that , although the script works , the interaction just does n’t make sense .
The mouse events are n’t quite the same as the touch events , even though they ’re pretty similar .
For more fun , try using it with a touchpad .
If you really want to have fun , try the script on a Nokia S60v3 device , which has a pseudo - cursor and implements the mouse events exactly like desktop browsers .
The script works ... in a way .
Question to UX experts : how should the scrolling layer work when the user has a mouse ?
In other words , we need a different interaction model for desktop browsers .
That requires us to first make a distinction between mouse - driven and touch - driven browsers .
But how ?
Issue 2 : one file
There ’s one extra requirement : I absolutely want to be able to deliver one single JavaScript file that contains all the scripts necessary for all interactions .
And obviously I do not want to use a browser detect at all in order to determine whether a certain browser needs the mouse or the touch version .
So how do we distinguish between the two ?
Simple : see if a touchstart event fires .
If it does , the browser is certain to be a touchscreen device and we should disable the mouse events .
It would work something like this :
var testEl = [ the element you want to do something with ] ; testEl.onmousedown = function () { // initialize mouse interface } testEl.ontouchstart = function ( ) { testEl.onmousedown = null ; // initialize touch interface }
This works fine .
The touchstart event fires before the mousedown event , and therefore we can wipe the mousedown event handler before it ’s ever executed .
A really proper script would have a third interaction model for using the keyboard .
I have n’t written that yet because it ’s somewhat more tricky than the touch / mouse one .
I will have to deal with S60v3 , where the “ arrow ” keys guide a pseudo mouse cursor across the screen and both the mouse and the key events fire .
Besides , the user may alternate between the keyboard and either a mouse or a touchscreen .
Still , we can use a similar trick here : we know that the user is using a mouse if the mousemove event is detected .
More specifically , if two mousemove events are detected within a short period of time .
After all , all mobile touchscreen browsers will fire one ( and only one ) mousemove event when the user releases the screen , and that does not constitute evidence for a mouse - based interface .
Of course we can only distinguish them if keyboard use fires different events than mouse use .
As we know it does : the keydown , keypress , and keyup events have long been supported by all browsers .
Imagine a browser in which depressing a key would fire a mousedown event !
This sort of distinguishing between different interaction models is only possible if the three models use different events .
If the touch actions would also use the mouse events , it would be impossible to distinguish between the two .
Issue 3 : prior art
Finally , let ’s repeat it once more , all touchscreen browsers ( with the sole exception of the two Vodafone Widget Managers ) already fire all mouse events in one long cascade when the user releases the screen .
We should n’t require all browsers to change this behaviour .
First of all it does n’t make sense , and secondly they wo n’t all do it , leaving us stuck with an impossible situation where some browsers support the mouse events as if they ’re a desktop browser , and others as if they ’re a touch browser .
That ’s a recipe for disaster .
Separate touch events
So I strongly believe that all mobile touchscreen browsers MUST ( in the sense of RFC 2119 ) support separate touchstart , touchmove , and touchend events and relegate the mouse events to legacy status .
Web developers will benefit from this since they can easily distinguish between the various interaction modes and create scripts that are suited to every one of them .

A matter of business ( China Daily )
Updated : 2010-01-18 07:54
Is Google 's exit threat a matter of censorship and human rights ?
If it is , the move should have come much earlier or the Web giant should have never entered the Chinese market in the first place .
The statement posted by Google says that disputes with the Chinese government on Internet regulation and major cyber attacks on the company that allegedly originated from China have forced the company to consider leaving the nation .
We do n't yet know about its real intention to quit China .
But reasons in its statement are not convincing .
And it is too early and overly sensitive on the part of Western media outlets to play it up as a political issue and portray Google as a guardian of human rights and freedom of speech .
Every country has its own rules to censor particular kinds of information on the Internet .
We spare no efforts in cracking down on pornographic content on the Internet , which we believe and numerous examples have shown are detrimental to the healthy development of young people .
Google should have been quite clear of the Chinese government rules on the management of the Internet even before it entered the Chinese market .
In the four years since it was launched in China in 2006 , the Internet has been improving rapidly .
It has become an important channel for Chinese people to vent their grievances against corruption and whatever possible wrongs committed by the government at all levels .
If Google considered it feasible to develop its Internet business under Chinese law four years ago , it would be ridiculous for it to feel otherwise when the Internet environment here in China has improved tremendously in terms of censorship .
As far as the cyber attacks are concerned , such attacks happen everyday and there are no Internet portals that have not been attacked by hackers .
And the Chinese government has always considered such attacks as an online crime and has made strides in cracking down on such offenses .
Wherever Google operates , attacks from hackers will be a problem it has to deal with .
So this is undoubtedly not a plausible reason for the Internet giant to quit a market .
Whatever the real cause for Google 's possible move , this case is purely business in nature and it should have nothing to do with political ideology .
If this Internet giant has political values , it should never have been involved in such a business .
Nevertheless , this case provides some Westerners , who are biased against China 's political system , with an opportunity to point their fingers at the Chinese government and even play it up as a political debate in Sino - US relations .
Having turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the changes that have taken place in China , they grab any opportunity to do so .
If anything , this case will and should not have any impact on China - US relations .
Neither will it negatively impact the political openness the Internet has helped to create for this country in its steady advance to further democracy .

The Premier , Kristina Keneally , has warmly endorsed a plan to build one of Sydney 's biggest hotels more than 100 metres out over the harbour , insisting it will not create a precedent other developers will seek to follow .
And the British architect behind the Barangaroo proposal , Richard Rogers , said he had '' no reservations ' ' about going where no private developer had been allowed to develop before .

'' One of the problems we have had is this amazingly hard line - we call it the aircraft carrier .

Over at tree - hugging apologist mouthpiece , Media Matters they ’re getting their panties in a bunch over a Fox News story .
It seems Fox was biased for a “ stale retread ” over Climategate data rapist , Professor Phil Jones ’ shocking admission that there ’s been no statistically significant global warming for 15 years .
How outrageous of Fox , I hear you scoff .
But try and see it from Media Matters ’ point of view–little green journos all now go into apoplectic spasm at every mention of unpleasant and unarguable climate facts .
So , thanks to the prompting by Media Manglers , I ’ll now prove that the Associated Press ( AP ) is complicit in perpetrating further Climategate hype and lies .
Thereby , our readers may judge for themselves how deeply the green - loving press has sunk themselves into the greatest scandal in science .
First , keep in mind that Fox News is the only American TV news broadcaster that has reported the Climategate story from Day One .
Media Matters tries to spin the lie that the AP has been reporting on this epoch - changing event in a ‘ just - the - facts fashion . ’
But , as we shall see , in AP ’s case ‘ just the facts ’ means doling out hype and lies supportive of the global warming hysteria .
Astonishingly , it is the leaked Climategate emails themselves that expose the complicitness of the Associated Press in the Climategate scandal .
Keen eyes at that excellent skeptic blog , Watts Up With That ( WUWT ) , first uncovered the facts exposing media conspiracy in reporting Climategate .
Blogger , Anthony Watts , found that AP had a ‘ man on the inside ’ of information from the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research
Unit three months before the leaked emails surfaced .
It is those leaked emails that expose AP reporter , Seth Borenstein as a Climategate collaborator .
So it came as no surprise to bloggers when AP ran the following in a ‘ just - the - facts fashion ’ on December 12 , 2009 after the Climategate story broke :
“ E-mails stolen from climate scientists show they stonewalled skeptics and discussed hiding data — but the messages do n’t support claims that the science of global warming was faked , according to an exhaustive review by The Associated Press . ” source
And whom did AP put in charge of their “ exhaustive review ” ?
Yes , you guessed it , Seth Borenstein .
Borenstein has long been known among climate commentators as an avid green sympathiser .
As a sample of Borenstein ’s affiliations look no further than the leaked email dated Jul 23 , 2009 when Seth ‘ just - the - facts ’ Borenstein emailed his Climategate chums , Kevin Trenberth , Gavin Schmidt and Michael ‘ Hockey Stick ’ Mann , three months before Climategate :
“ It ’s Seth again .
Attached is a paper in JGR today that
Marc Morano is hyping wildly .
It ’s in a legit journal .
Whatchya think ?
Seth
Seth Borenstein , Associated Press Science Writer
sborenstein@xxxxxxxxx.xxx ”
Michael Mann ’s reply :
“ hi Seth , you always seem to catch me at airports .
only got a
few minutes .
took a cursory look at the paper , and it has all
the worry signs of extremely bad science and scholarship . ”
Thus speaketh Michael ‘ bad science ’
Mann always available for a buddy like Seth .
Whatchya think of that ?
To quantify how far AP journalism has fallen off it ’s integrity perch just take a look here at their own code of conduct
Laughably , AP claims that :
“ we avoid behavior or activities that create a conflict of interest and compromise our ability to report the news fairly and accurately , uninfluenced by any person or action . ”
So if readers are troubled by AP ’s “ exhaustive review ” you can phone or write and ask in a just - the - facts fashion at the following address :

ANAHEIM , Calif . —
Human ancestors that left Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago to see the rest of the world were no landlubbers .
Stone hand axes unearthed on the Mediterranean island of Crete indicate that an ancient Homo species — perhaps Homo erectus — had used rafts or other seagoing vessels to cross from northern Africa to Europe via at least some of the larger islands in between , says archaeologist Thomas Strasser of Providence College in Rhode Island .
Several hundred double - edged cutting implements discovered at nine sites in southwestern Crete date to at least 130,000 years ago and probably much earlier , Strasser reported January 7 at the annual meeting of the American Institute of Archaeology .
Many of these finds closely resemble hand axes fashioned in Africa about 800,000 years ago by H. erectus , he says .
It was around that time that H. erectus spread from Africa to parts of Asia and Europe .
Until now , the oldest known human settlements on Crete dated to around 9,000 years ago .
Traditional theories hold that early farming groups in southern Europe and the Middle East first navigated vessels to Crete and other Mediterranean islands at that time .
“ We ’re just going to have to accept that , as soon as hominids left Africa , they were long - distance seafarers and rapidly spread all over the place , ” Strasser says .
Other researchers have controversially suggested that H. erectus navigated rafts across short stretches of sea in Indonesia around 800,000 years ago and that Neandertals crossed the Strait of Gibraltar perhaps 60,000 years ago .
Questions remain about whether African hominids used Crete as a stepping stone to reach Europe or , in a Stone Age Gilligan ’s Island scenario , accidentally ended up on Crete from time to time when close - to - shore rafts were blown out to sea , remarks archaeologist Robert Tykot of the University of South Florida in Tampa .
Only in the past decade have researchers established that people reached Crete before 6,000 years ago , Tykot says .
Strasser ’s team cannot yet say precisely when or for what reason hominids traveled to Crete .
Large sets of hand axes found on the island suggest a fairly substantial population size , downplaying the possibility of a Gilligan Island ’s scenario , in Strasser ’s view .
In excavations conducted near Crete ’s southwestern coast during 2008 and 2009 , Strasser ’s team unearthed hand axes at caves and rock shelters .
Most of these sites were situated in an area called Preveli Gorge , where a river has gouged through many layers of rocky sediment .
At Preveli Gorge , Stone
Age artifacts were excavated from four terraces along a rocky outcrop that overlooks the Mediterranean Sea .
Tectonic activity has pushed older sediment above younger sediment on Crete , so 130,000 - year - old artifacts emerged from the uppermost terrace .
Other terraces received age estimates of 110,000 years , 80,000 years and 45,000 years .
These minimum age estimates relied on comparisons of artifact - bearing sediment to sediment from sea cores with known ages .
Geologists are now assessing whether absolute dating techniques can be applied to Crete ’s Stone Age sites , Strasser says .
Intriguingly , he notes , hand axes found on Crete were made from local quartz but display a style typical of ancient African artifacts .
“ Hominids adapted to whatever material was available on the island for tool making , ” Strasser proposes .
“ There could be tools made from different types of stone in other parts of Crete . ”
Strasser has conducted excavations on Crete for the past 20 years .
He had been searching for relatively small implements that would have been made from chunks of chert no more than 11,000 years ago .
But a current team member , archaeologist Curtis Runnels of Boston University , pointed out that Stone Age folk would likely have favored quartz for their larger implements .
“ Once we started looking for quartz tools , everything changed , ” Strasser says .

Researchers of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) in Innsbruck , Austria , used a calcium ion to simulate a relativistic quantum particle , demonstrating a phenomenon that has not been directly observable so far : the Zitterbewegung .
They have published their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature .
In the 1920s quantum mechanics was already established and in 1928 the British physicist Paul Dirac showed that this theory can be merged with special relativity postulated by Albert Einstein .
Dirac 's work made quantum physics applicable to relativistic particles , which move at a speed that is comparable to the speed of light .
The Dirac equation forms the basis for groundbreaking new insights , e.g. it provides a natural description of the electron spin and predicts that each particle also has its antiparticle ( anti matter ) .
In 1930 , as a result of the analysis of the Dirac equation , the Austrian Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger first postulated the existence of a so called Zitterbewegung ( quivering motion ) , a kind of fluctuation of the motion of a relativistic particle .
" According to the Dirac equation such a particle does not move in a linear fashion in a vacuum but ' jitters ' in all three dimensions , " Christian Roos from the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences ( ÖAW ) explains .
" It is not clear whether this Zitterbewegung can be observed in real systems in nature . "
Quantum simulation of a particle
Physical phenomena are often described by equations , which may be too complicated to solve .
In this case , researchers use computer simulations to answer open questions .
However , even for small quantum systems , classical computers have not enough power to manage the processing of the data ; thus , scientists , such as Richard Feynman , proposed to simulate these phenomena in other quantum systems experimentally .
The preconditions for doing this -- detailed knowledge about the physics of these systems and an excellent control over the technology and set - up -- have been set by the research group headed by Rainer Blatt by conducting experiments with quantum computers over the last few years ; they are now able to carry out quantum simulations experimentally .
" The challenges with these experiments are to recreate the equations in the quantum system well , to have a high level of control over the various parameters and to measure the results , " Christian Roos says .
The experimental physicists of the IQOQI trapped and cooled a calcium ion and in this well - defined state , a laser coupled the state of the particle and the state of the relativistic particle to be simulated .
" Our quantum system was now set to behave like a free relativistic quantum particle that follows the laws of the Dirac equation , " Rene Gerritsma explains , a Dutch Postdoc working at the IQOQI and first author of the work published in Nature .
Measurements revealed the features of the simulated particle .
" Thereby , we were able to demonstrate Zitterbewegung in the experimental simulation and we were also able to determine the probability of the distribution of a particle , " Gerritsma says .
In this very small quantum system the physicist simulated the Dirac equation only in one spatial dimension .
" This simulation was a proof - of - principle experiment , " Roos says , " which , in principle , can also be applied to three - dimensional dynamics if the technological set - up is adjusted accordingly . "
Simulation of antiparticles
Due to the extremely high level of control over the physical regime of the simulated particle , the scientists were able to modify the mass of the object and to simulate antiparticles .
" In the end , our approach was very simple but you have to come up with the idea first , " says Christian Roos , whose team of scientists was inspired by a theoretical proposal of a Spanish group of researchers .
The work was supported by the Austrian Science Funds ( FWF ) and the European Commission .
We ’ve added beta support for Versioning across all Amazon S3 Regions .
Versioning provides an additional layer of protection for your S3 objects .
You can easily recover from unintended user errors or application failures .
You can also use Versioning for data retention and archiving .
Once you have enabled Versioning for a particular S3 bucket , any operation that would have overwritten an S3 object ( PUT , POST , COPY , and DELETE ) retains the old version of the object .
Here ’s a simple diagram of Versioning in action :
Each version of the object is assigned a version id .
For example , each version of Robot.png has its own version id :
The actual version ids are long strings ; I ’ve used v1 , v2 , and v3 to simplify the picture .
You can retrieve the most recent version of an object by making a default GET request or you can retrieve any version ( current or former ) by making a version - aware request and including a version id .
In effect , the complete key for an S3 object in a versioned bucket now consists of the bucket name , the object name , and the version id .
S3 ’s DELETE operation works in a new way when applied to a versioned object .
Once an object has been deleted , subsequent default requests will no longer retrieve it .
However , the previous version of the object will be preserved and can be retrieved by using the version id .
Only the owner of an S3 bucket can permanently delete a version .
Normal S3 pricing applies to each version of an object .
You can store any number of versions of the same object , so you may want to implement some expiration and deletion logic if you plan to make use of this feature .
Enabling Versioning ’s MFA
Delete setting on your bucket provides even more protection .
Once enabled , you will need to supply two forms of authentication in order to permanently delete a version from your bucket : your AWS account credentials and the six - digit code and serial number from an MFA ( Multi - Factor Authentication ) device in your possession .

The story of the IPCC exaggeration of glacier retreat in the Himalayas has been growing worse and worse for Rajendra Pachauri head of the IPCC .
I ’ve received some emails regarding an ongoing investigation by Jonathan Leake of the London Times .
Apparently in there is financial benefit for exaggeration of climate facts after all .
To catch you up , it ’s recently been discovered that ;
1 – Glacier retreat was exaggerated dramatically in IPCC AR4 .
The very report used to document global climate change and make recommendations for policy and funding to the worlds governments .
Indeed the IPCC AR4 is the premier docment on which commuhagen was based .
2 – The IPCC was apparently warned of the lack of basis for the claims prior to publication of AR4 , however the warnings were rejected .
– I need someone to provide a citation for this .
3 – Rajendra Pachauri initially said criticisms were without merit , but they were in fact so far out of whack he was recently forced to admit that in fact the skeptics were right — - again .
4 – Large scale projects were started according to the recommendations of the IPCC and funded by the EU for the investigation into these glaciers .
These organizations substantial money to the TERI institute ALSO run by Rajendra Pachauri .
How fast are the glaciers melting ?
Professor Julian Dowdeswell , director of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University , said : “ Even a small glacier such as the Dokriani glacier is up to 120 metres [ 394ft ] thick .
A big one would be several hundred metres thick and tens of kilometres long .
The average is 300 metres thick so to melt one even at 5 metres a year would take 60 years .
That is a lot faster than anything we are seeing now so the idea of losing it all by 2035 is unrealistically high . ”
Now we find out that the IPCC “ scientist ” who made the claims is working in a high level position in the TERI institute !!
What has now come to light , however , is that the scientist from whom this claim originated , Dr Syed Hasnain , has for the past two years been working as a senior employee of The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) , the Delhi - based company of which Dr Pachauri is director - general .
Furthermore , the claim – now disowned by Dr Pachauri as chairman of the IPCC – has helped TERI to win a substantial share of a $ 500,000 grant from one of America ’s leading charities , along with a share in a three million euro research study funded by the EU .
source - Telegraph .
Rajendra Pachauri ’s Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) , based in New Delhi , was awarded up to £ 310,000 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the lion ’s share of a £ 2.5 m EU grant funded by European taxpayers .
It means that EU taxpayers are funding research into a scientific claim about glaciers that any ice researcher should immediately recognise as bogus .
The revelation comes just a week after The Sunday Times highlighted serious scientific flaws in the IPCC ’s 2007 benchmark report on the likely impacts of global warming .
The Carnegie money was specifically given to aid research into “ the potential security and humanitarian impact on the region ” as the glaciers began to disappear .
Pachauri has since acknowledged that this threat , if it exists , will take centuries to have any serious effect .
The money was initially given to the Global Centre , an Icelandic Foundation which then channelled it , with Carnegie ’s involvement , to TERI .
Here is a link to the High Noon website where the grant ’s are being directed and touted .
And apparently all the money of High Noon was n’t enough to find one single HONEST ice specialist to point out that the cliams were way beyond physically impossible .
The same lies were repeated to the EU commission , guess who was a keynote speaker .
Highnoon EU Glacier project
This is criminal in my opinion .
First the IPCC lets through a comment which has no basis in science , organizations are formed and nobody bothers to check a paper before the millions are spent ?
And the very same people who put the bogus comment in the IPCC report get the payout .
It ’s a damned lie !!
A scientist specializing in glaciers who does n’t bother to read the literature ……
BULLSHIT , YOU CROOKS !
THE IPCC DOESN ’T NEED RESPECT , IT NEEDS PRISON BARS .
It ’s false alarmism again and JUST LIKE THE TERMITES THEY ARE YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS THAT IF THERE’S ONE FOUND , THERE ARE A HELL OF A LOT OF OTHERS .
If you 're looking for a super - cheap way to squeeze some extra performance out of your guitar amp , this simple and inexpensive hack can help you turn something like a thrift store printer stand into a sound - boosting amp stand .

DIY - focused
Make magazine combined a little science with some elbow grease to make a stand that would boost the quality of sound produced by a basic guitar amp .
You can buy a commercial version of the stand they build , but the stands start at $ 150 .
The tinkerers at Make built a DIY version for $ 15 .
How does it work ?
In theory , a perfect speaker box would be a speaker mounted in the middle of a wall of infinite size , because that would let the sound from the front reach your ear without having been partially canceled by the inverse sound from the back , " he says .
" Mom wo n't let us build anything infinite anymore , not after what happened last time , so we approximate the infinite wall by putting speakers into sealed boxes , also known as infinite - baffle enclosures .
Unfortunately , infinite - baffle enclosures make it really hard for the speaker to move , so the sound is quieter .
And of course , quietness is not very rock ' n ' roll , is it ?
So designers make a lot of amps louder ( and a little funny - sounding ) by opening the backs .
This speaker stand bends the back sound around a corner , which makes it even less like the front sound , and then sends it out the front , where its slightly altered power is added to your already Majestic Volume in a rich and tonally pleasing way .

You 'll need some donor furniture to get hacked up ( you could use plywood , but finding old computer furniture at Goodwill is going to be much cheaper ) and some basic tools like a saw and screw driver .
With some careful cutting and application of caulk and weather stripping you can turn your cheap furniture into a sound - enhancing stand for your amp .

I 've written something for today 's G2 about Tim Hanni – that 's Han-eye , by the way – the turncoat American wine god who now says the industry that nurtured him is riddled with misunderstanding and greed .
Are you surprised ?
I 've long had my doubts about that murkily arcane world .
It 's not just the fraud and the folly : it 's that almost nothing is as fiendishly individual , as implacably subjective , as the taste of a glass of wine .
One person will tell you that such - and - such a bottle is better than another .
It might have a copperplate label , it might be French , and it'll almost certainly be more expensive .
But for all that , you could still hate it .
Depending on your palate , a wine can come with more gongs than a Tibetan health spa and still do nothing for you .
It 's happened to me , and it 's probably happened to you .
That 's why I think there might be a grain of truth , and perhaps more , in what Hanni 's saying .
He argues that nothing makes Moët objectively " better " than Lambrini : it 's all just pomp and profit .
And that should give punters who have been made to feel ignorant a shot of confidence .
Ignore the edicts thundering from Olympus , he says : just trust your senses and taste your way through .
If he 's right , a wine critic is just someone with a tongue and a thesaurus .
I must say I 've never seen the point of tasting notes that babble of wet slate and pencil shavings with abstract nouns sprinkled like pixie dust over the real , gluggable , sofa - staining plonk .
Most wine writing has all the grace and precision of carpet bombing .
And the might of Robert Parker , a man who moves markets with a sip and a spit , is unnatural , absurd , and resented by many of the wine - buffs and merchants I 've spoken with .
Something strikes me as equally odd about the methodologies and justifications for matching food and wine .
Hanni believes that red wine works with steak because salt on the meat improves the drink 's taste – it's got nothing to do with the cow .
So I tried this , tasting a Burgundy with salted and unsalted steak – and the wine was noticeably better when I 'd reached for the Maldon .
People will say that ' regionality ' is somehow crucial to matching food and wine , that Muscadet chimes with oysters because they come from the same wet and windy part of France , and so share undefined , ethereal bonds of time and terroir .
What tripe .
It would mean there was almost no point to New World wines at all ; it 's a horribly eugenic thought , antithetical to innovation and experiment .
For all that , though , I do prefer champagne to Lambrini .
I think I 'd say the same blindfolded .
But I 'll never know whether that 's because I was born that way , or if I 've been inculcated in a set of assumptions and cliches about image and class and price and value .
Ultimately , it seems we taste everything with our muscles , genes and memories , which explains why people foster a lifelong love of yum - yums or macaroni cheese .
What do you think - is Hanni right or wrong ?
Can we learn anything useful from wine critics , and is there anything in matching food and wine ?
Are expensive bottles worth the cash ?

Amy sez , " In 1955 Orson Welles created a BBC programme called Sketchbook .
In this episode he is shockingly contemporary when he talks about passports , privacy and personal rights ending in his assertion that all members of the human race deserve to maintain their dignity and privacy .
He also talks about about the role of police – interesting in light of recent invasions of privacy in the supposed interest of protecting citizens . "
I wonder why it is that so many of us look like criminals in a police lineup when we have our pictures taken for a passport .
I suppose it 's the unconscious foreknowledge of the scrutiny to which our likeness will be subjected that gives us that hangdog , guilty look .
Really , theoretically , a passport is supposed to be issued for our protection .
But on how many frontiers in how many countries I 've handed over my passport with all the emotions of an apprentice forger trying to fob off a five pound note on the Bank of England .
Guilty conscience , I suppose …
Think of all of those forms we have to fill out , for example , you know what I mean , by police forms , we get them in hotels , on frontiers , in every country all over the world we 're asked , state your sex , male or female , for example .
Well obviously , I 'm a male , I 'm a man , why should I have to answer that ?
State your race and religion in block letters ; well , now why should I have to confide my religion to the police ?
Frankly , I do n't think anybody 's race is anybody 's business .
I 'm willing to admit that the policeman has a difficult job , a very hard job , but it 's the essence of our society that the policeman 's job should be hard .
He 's there to protect , protect the free citizen , not to chase criminals , that 's an incidental part of his job .
The free citizen is always more of a nuisance to the policeman that the criminal .
He knows what to do about the criminal …
Sarah Palin 9/11 truther controversy explodes days after Texas Gubernatorial hopeful Debra Medina outcast as ‘ pariah candidate ’ for 9/11 comments
Aaron Dykes & Alex Jones
Infowars.com
February 17 , 2010
Days after Debra Medina ’s rising bid for Texas Governor was stung by controversy over comments about 9/11 on the Glenn Beck Show , it has emerged that former Vice Presidential candidate and “ Tea Party ’ darling Sarah Palin has done her one better– stating her support for a new 9/11 investigation just before the 2008 election , and going far beyond Medina ’s mild statement .
Yet , it is n’t the audacity to admit there are remaining questions about 9/11 when scientific polls have found that 84 % of Americans do not believe the official story and at least six of the 9/11 commissioners think their own report is flawed , or worse .
Instead , it is the hypocrisy of Glenn Beck and the media cretins who followed his lead in dismissing and defaming Medina outright for not immediately belittling 9/11 truthers while ignoring similar statements by GOP darling Sarah Palin .
9/11 Qs : MEDINA JOINED BY SARAH PALIN , DEM .
GOV .
CANDIDATE FAROUK SHAMI
The Statesman reported that Glenn Beck even grilled Medina on whether or not she would ‘ disavow ’ any advisers known to hold certain beliefs about 9/11 .
Medina responded .
“ I ’m certainly not into mind control or thought - policing people . ”
Furthermore , Medina ’s GOP challengers – incumbent Rick Perry and Sen. Hutchison blasted her in the media within mere minutes of her 9/11 comments .
Surely , they were fearful of Debra Medina ’s sharp rise in the polls , and seized on the opportunity to harm her politically .
Sitting Governor Perry , who was endorsed by Sarah Palin during a recent stump appearance at the Texas capitol , stated that Medina ’s comments were an “ insult ” :
“ Today ’s comments were an insult to the thousands of Americans who lost loved ones on Sept. 11 and the military men and women who are overseas protecting our country .
President Bush worked tirelessly to protect our nation from additional terrorist attacks and anyone who would suggest Sept. 11 is a conspiracy involving the Bush administration should be ashamed . ”
[ efoods ]
Will Gov. Rick Perry also rebuke Sarah Palin , his top endorsement , for her potentially “ insulting ” statement ?
It is doubtful , and until he does , arguably hypocritical .
Further , Medina is not the only gubernatorial candidate to question the events of 9/11 .
Democrat Farouk Shami went quite a bit further than anything Medina had said when he stated :
“ People have talked about it .
Professors have written books about it .
People overseas talk about it .
Whenever I go overseas , people ask me these questions about it .
Why are we questioned about it ?
Do they know something we do n’t know , the public ?
But you know , look , we still do n’t know who killed JFK – whose behind it , let ’s put it that way .
Would we ever find the truth about 9/11 ?
That ’s a very dangerous subject to get into , you know ?
So it ’s hard to make judgement .
I ’m not saying yes or no .
Because I do n’t know the truth . ”
Yet no fuss is made about these individuals .
Debra Medina is attacked , however , because she truly is a threat to the political establishment .
Perry , Hutchison , Beck and others pretend to want limited government , pretend to defend the 2nd Amendment and property rights , but really support new taxes , look the other way at corporate looting and otherwise refuse to stand for true Texas sovereignty and the rights of individuals .
When Medina proves that she really will change things and challenge undue Federal powers , she is attacked and cast aside as a pariah .
GLENN BECK DICTATES WHAT IS ‘ TRUTH ’
Glenn Beck , who has stated that he “ hates the 9/11 victims ’ families ” for asking questions , who has called 9/11 truthers “ dangerous anarchists ” , who has called Ron Paul and his supporters ‘ domestic terrorists ’ , has gone out of his way to politically assassinate anyone even loosely affiliated with questioning the official government account of September 11 .
Now that Beck has underhandedly tried to sabotage Debra Medina , will he also call out fellow FOX News personality Sarah Palin for daring to broach the subject that makes him come unglued ?
And , if Debra Medina is guilty of association with 9/11 truth , Sarah Palin is by definition more guilty .
She has stated support for an all - out new investigation of 9/11 ( the valhalla of the 9/11 truth movement )
All the more threatening because Beck and Gov. Perry have already branded themselves with Palin - agast , a truther in disguise ?.
After all , Glenn Beck went so far as to say that Medina ’s comments about 9/11 not only urged him to ‘ cross her off the list ’ but constitute to make her a “ Flat Earther . ”
Yes , Glenn Beck made an astounding appeal on his Feb .
16th program about the 9/11 truth “ takeover ” of the Tea Party movement .
He referred to Debra Medina as a “ flat earther ” and implied that she , like once White House Czar Van Jones , is somehow a cryptic - 9/11 truther who holds her beliefs in secret while attempting to infiltrate the halls of government .
This , Glenn Beck deduces , in an air reminiscent of McCarthy and HUAC , is why he felt the need to flush out Medina ’s true attitudes via a surprise question on Sept. 11 orthodoxy .
Since when did TV pundits decide what people are allowed to think , anyway ?
Beck “ The Inquisitor ” made an example out of Debra Medina and – in true Orwellian fashion – put his boot down firmly , demanding that those ‘ dangerous truthers ’ be purged or damned .
He then lectures on why the NY Times is linking the Tea Party with “ violence . ”
Why ?
Because of 9/11 Truthers who have ‘ infilitrated ’ the Tea Party he pretends to speak for .
Despite what Beck has alleged , the 9/11 Truth movement is committed to non-violence .
The only danger posed is in the questions it has raised .
Actually , the Tea Parties of the last decade were first those of 9/11 Truth , then Ron Paul , and only after the election of Barack Obama , hijacked by the Republican Party and FOX News as a vehicle for a party resurgence .
By contrast , Glenn Beck gave Sarah Palin a worshipful welcome to the FOX Network only weeks ago , embarrassingly comparing her to George Washington , reading aloud his diary entry anticipating their interview together , putting her on the “ most admired list ” and otherwise urging her to be a ‘ reluctant ’ candidate in 2012 .
( See below or Jon Stewart ’s lambast of the awkward interview )
But do not despair .
Debra Medina has not lost her potency in the race for Governor .
It is precisely because of her unforeseen quickening in the polls that the establishment media and candidates raced to shut down a viable candidate that stood for true issues .
Her campaign dies only if you let it .
They are afraid of a true Constitutional office holder ; do n’t let attack dogs like Beck practice duplicity – writing off Medina for 9/11 and praising Palin in spite of it .
Let Glenn
Beck know that the thought police will not tell us what to think or how to vote .

Cells that protect nerves are the likely origin of the Devil Facial Tumour Disease ( DFTD ) that has been devastating Australia 's Tasmanian devil population , an international team of scientists has discovered .
Devil Facial Tumour Disease ( DFTD ) is a transmissible cancer that affects only Tasmanian devils and was first reported in 1996 .
It is spread by biting and quickly kills the animals .
The disease is characterised by large tumours , mostly on the face and mouth , which often spread to internal organs .
The research collaboration , led by Australian scientists , has found that DFTD originates from cells called Schwann cells , which protect peripheral nerve fibres .
The results have been published in the journal Science .
Through the discovery , the team has now identified a genetic marker that could be used to accurately diagnose the perplexing cancer , which has seen the devil listed as endangered and facing extinction .
Lead author Dr Elizabeth Murchison from the Australian National University said the Schwann cell discovery was significant as there are currently no specific diagnostic tests , treatments or vaccines available for the disease .

" We took biopsies from devil tumours and extracted genetic data from them , " Dr Murchison said .
Dr Tony Papenfuss from Melbourne 's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute then led the team that determined which genes were switched on in the tumours and identified their genetic signature .
" When we compared the signature of the tumours to other normal tissues we found the tumours were most like Schwann cells , " Dr Papenfuss said .
Associate Professor Greg Woods from the University of Tasmania 's Menzies Research Institute said the Schwann cell find was an important step in the process to further understand the disease .
" Devils develop tumours of all different types and the genetic markers we have identified are useful for telling apart the tumours that occur in DFTD from other kinds of tumours , " Associate Professor Woods said .
The Schwann cell research was conducted as part of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program 's efforts to further explore DFTD .
It was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the University of Tasmania 's Dr Eric Guiler Tasmanian Devil Research Grant .

Happy Holidays Everyone !
I really hope you all had a great , restful end of December .
I was lucky enough to actually get to go on vacation , first one since I started The Guild over 2 1/ 2 years ago , SERIOUSLY !
I ’d been saving up all year for a trip , dangling the carrot of “ relaxation ” in front of myself as motivation to get through the 24/7 workload that ’s plagued me this year .
Not complaining , it ’s just being constantly online definitely strains the psyche , I ’ve decided constantly multi-tasking has degraded my concentration , and will make an effort to single - task more in 2010 .
Better for creativity perhaps ?
Sanity , definitely . 🙂
Usually I love to go to a place where I can research obsessively , learn a new language and plan excursions scheduled down to the minute .
Alas , the last few months have been so exhausting I did n’t even think I had the energy to GO on vacation !
But , on the spur of the moment , I decided to follow through , and I am SO glad I did .
Kauai is gorgeous , and I definitely would recommend visiting for a relaxing , beautiful time .
Many people inquired where I went on my trip , so I ’ll briefly outline some of the highlights !
First , I started looking for hotels , and they were either too $ $ ( Four Seasons ) , sold out , or one of those bohemoth resorts with hundreds of rooms , the kind I hate .
Finally I searched “ Boutique Hotel Kauai ” and came up with the Koa Kea Hotel .
I had no context for the location , it was a bit pricey ( although I found a deal on the website ) , but all I knew was that the pictures were GORGEOUS !
They ’d just renovated everything , and the decor was sleek and simple .
When we arrived everything was what it looked like in the pictures and more .
Small , quiet , GREAT rooms , lovely beach and boardwalk down to a pretty public beach , and a spectacular view to wake up to every day .
The pillow and sheets were high quality too , I know that ’s weird to say , but it ’s the thing that ’s most important to me at a hotel , that I sleep good !
And they have REALLY strong Mai Tais , hehe .
It was a great location on Poipu , the southernmost tip of the island , close to walk to several good restaurants and a general store , and convenient by car to most of the island .
I honestly could n’t have picked a better place .
The only complaint I had was breakfast was pricey , so we went elsewhere most the time .
The restaurant , Red Salt , was expensive , but the best food we had for dinner on the island , so I do n’t regret it at all , a lovely Christmas dinner !
I would definitely recommend this hotel again , so peaceful and intimate !
FOOD !
I have to say the island does n’t have SPECTACULAR food ( like Oahu ) , but we found many a good meal there .
Red Salt at our hotel , was very nice for DINNER ( pricey though , def a splurge ) .
Breakfast is too pricey though , so go only as a treat for the view ( which is BEAUTIFUL ) .
We had Christmas Eve dinner at Roy ’s , an institution that is very well reviewed but SO disappointing .
I ca n’t tell you how blah this food was , and at the price , ugh .
Get a hot dog at Puka Dog next door instead , much better price and YUMMY !
I had no idea that Hawaiian hot dogs were ENCASED in bread , it was weird and cool !
We did eat at Gaylord ’s the last night , and that was wonderful for a fancy dinner .
I would try it for lunch / brunch as well , the service was excellent and the food was great .
Cool location too .
The idea of going to Starbucks was AWFUL , so we went to the Kauai Coffee Company , where they actually grow the beans , which was quite cool to see .
You can sample all varieties of coffee and get a great latte for the road .
A nice side trip .
We had brunch at a small place called Grinds which was nice , they make their own bread , so their egg sandwich with Portuguese Sausage was awesome .
Two of my favorite places : A little cafe called Kalaheo Cafe , which was wonderful for breakfast and lunch and had great coffee .
We went there several times .
And my Achilles Heel was definitely Papalani Gelato .
Oh boy you guys , this stuff is AMAZING !
Waffle Cone + Papalani Sorbetto ( Guava , Blood Orange and Lilikoi mixed ) + Pineapple Sorbetto = JOY JOY !
The only thing that topped it was a shaved ice from a place called JoJo’s .
I got the island specialty called a “ Halo Halo ” , it had coconut syrup , azuki beans , macadamia nut ice cream , candied pineapple pieces , gelatin and azuki beans .
I ate ever bite of a HUGE portion , but did n’t regret anything after !
Now that I think of it , I guess I was on a sugar high the whole trip .
OH WELL !
As far as sights went , we Weimeia Canyon is a MUST SEE .
Its breathtaking to be driving up the mountain and , through the trees , glimpse a canyon that equals the Grand Canyon in majesty .
Here ’s a pic :
Also went hiking , but it was muddy and slippery .
Definitely did n’t do as much as we could , I guess more for next time !
We also drove to the northernmost part of the island , and I ’m just sorry we did n’t go back there once again , it ’s a MUCH different climate than the south of the island , greener and more tropical .
I see now why people stay several days on the north , then several days on the south .
I did n’t understand that from afar , it ’s such a small island !
But I definitely will remember the helicopter trip around the island forever .
We flew around the whole island , most parts you can never see from the car .
The sheer scope of the cliffs and secluded beachs is so breathtaking , and we saw whales in the ocean , which was a huge thrill for me !
Another highlight of the trip was an accident , stumbling on the National Tropical Botanical Garden on the last day .
We did the McBride tour , and it was raining , which could have been a drag but it was WONDERFUL .
Seeing all the different tropical plants , and all the effort this organization goes through to save endangered species , it was very spiritual and inspiring as well as educational .
I would definitely recommend doing one of the tours , and meeting the very educated tour guides who will open a new world of plants to you ( if you ’re not already familiar with them like I was ) !
MANY more pictures in my Flickr account if you like flowers !
Did n’t shop much , but I did impulse buy a pricey ukele ( the musician in me had to get a Koa one 🙁 ) .
I ca n’t play guitar , although I ’ve tried , but the size of a guitar has always held me back .
I definitely had more fun with the small violinish - sized uke , and learned a lot of bizarre public domain songs from the turn of the century ( only book I could get , haha ) .
Thx to the guy at Larry ’s Ukele ’s , I definitely enriched my trip musically .
Lastly I ’m linking a picture of me , not to be cheesecake , just to show my tan off .
My fake tan .
That ’s right , for the first time ever I got one of those fake spray on tans everyone in Hollywood uses .
I have to say I felt REALLY WEIRD with it on , but kinda confident , because usually I ’m hiding my pale legs from the world , haha .
I can say confidently though , that I ’m probably the only person to get PALER during a week in Hawaii .
I guess that ’s something to brag about .
🙂
Oh , and yes , that bikini was on sale for $ 1.99 a piece at Target , and it shows .
Guess I learned a lesson , do n’t be cheap with swimsuits .

Google Code Repository is a section of Google that , just like SourceForge , allows developers to upload their code for others to use under license .
The repository was launched in 2006 and after searching through its archives , I found a number of interesting scripts and other goodies that would be an asset in any website owner / website builder ’s arsenal .
All the code examples below are free to download and use .
They ’re released under a GPL , BSD , MIT or Creative Commons license .
This is a great series of tiny icons created by Paul Jarvis at twothirty .
There ’s a jumble of various - sized icons for everyday web design use and they also come in their Photoshop source files .
These three - layered images are easy to manipulate because of the included Photoshop files , so they are amazingly versatile for all purposes .
Most CMS these days come with the built - in minification functionality that strips white space and comments and allows for a faster browser load time .
For the times that you are hand - coding a website , there are also free web tools available for minifying your code , but this set of PHP files minifies , compresses and adds appropriate page headers to any JavaScript or CSS file .
It takes just minutes to set up and all work is done for you .
This project is an interesting and usable CSS sticky footer method created by Trevor Sheridan that does n’t over - rely on hacks or z - index positioning .
This ZIP package comes with over 1,500 multi-colour 16 × 16 icons .
There is also a CSS sheet that you can add to your the < head > of you document .
With a bit of extra HTML markup , and by using the images provided , you can incorporate buttons into your designs quickly .
It ’s easy to change the size and colour of the buttons , and they work in all common browsers .
This script is an advanced PHP email validation solution .
The project has been maintained and updated by Dave Child at AddedBytes.com since 2004 .
He placed it under a Creative Commons license and moved it to Google Code in 2009 in order to allow further development by others .
My advice is to use one of the built - in PHP filter functions first before you use a script like this .
They may not be perfect , but they are fine for most uses .
This offering is exclusively concerned with an aspect that we designers often forget about – a CSS sheet for print .
Hartija creates a clean , clear design style ideally suited for reading after being printed off by the user .
This is a jQuery slideshow plugin for version 1.3 and up .
This would work well for a banner and as an alternative to Flash slideshows .
Click here for a demonstration .
This is a clever jQuery plugin and a great way of presenting large pictures .
At first , it looks like just any other Lightbox script but closer inspection reveals that upon clicking on a thumbnail , the large image fits the browser size perfectly and grabbing the image with the mouse allows you to see all of it .
A demonstration of this script can be found here .
If you having spam problems with your PHP - built form , then it might be worth taking a look at Jesse Newland ’s form as this comes with WordPress ’ anti-spam Akismet functionality built in .
It looks easy enough to set up although it should be fairly simple for any PHP developer to integrate Akismet into their own forms without Jesse ’s little script .
Created by Constantinos Demetriadis , this CSS framework is based on 960.gs and has a plugin system for extending the framework .
Version 1.0 is released under a MIT license and the package comes with good documentation .
Check out the demonstration of this framework .
This is a JavaScript file to make CSS3 Media Queries work in all major browsers including Internet Explorer .
CSS3 Media Queries allow your styles to adjust depending on the user ’s viewport size , enabling designs that are flexible and viewable by a wide range of browsing methods .
This WordPress theme in the Google Code Repository is a general - purpose theme for WordPress versions 2.7 and up .
According to the coder Anton Shevchuk , it was developed so that users can " create a unique blog design quickly and effortlessly " .
This project is reputedly being downloaded at the rate of 1,000 + per day .
13 . mysql-db-php-class
Learning how to use PHP to connect to a MySQL database is quite basic and important stuff so , like the other PHP projects above , you should learn how to write you own code before using somebody else ’s .
However , this PHP class gives you a robust set of functions and methods for easily working with database - driven MySQL / PHP sites with support for memcached .
This could well be a very popular jQuery plugin as most bloggers want to integrate their Twitter profile with their blog , and this allows users to do just that .
See the demonstration of this plugin here .
Lastly , does anybody want to set up the new Pirate Bay ?
Well this PHP open source BitTorrent tracker will help get you started .
It was only released on January 20 , 2010 and it ’s only on version 0.1.3 , but the documentation is excellent so playing around with the files to see if they meet your needs should be fairly painless .

At my job , I do a fair amount of system administration scripting in Python .
For example , almost all the login scripts are written in Python ( with some of them ported from Kixtart ) .
Over the years , I ’ve been tasked with creating shortcuts to new applications that need to be placed on the user ’s desktop or in their Start Menu or both .
In this article , I will show you how to accomplish this task .
Note :
This is a Windows - only article , so if you do n’t use that OS , then this will probably bore you to tears .
Heck , it might do that anyway !
The first thing you ’ll need to do much of anything on Windows is Mark Hammond ’s PyWin32 package ( AKA : Python for Windows extensions ) .
I also recommend Tim Golden ’s winshell module as it can make finding the user - specific folders much easier .
I ’ll be using Python 2.5 for this article , but as I understand it , PyWin32 is compatible with Python 3 , so this tutorial could apply to those of you who use that too .
The simplest task I ’ve had to do is to create a URL link on the user ’s desktop .
Unless you need to specify a specific browser , this is a really simple task :
import os , winshell desktop = winshell.desktop ( ) path = os.path.join(desktop , " myNeatWebsite.url " ) target = " http://www.google.com/ " shortcut = file ( path , 'w ' ) shortcut .
write ( '[ InternetShortcut ]
') shortcut .write ( ' URL=%s ' % target ) shortcut.close ( )
In the code above , we import the os and winshell modules .
We use winshell to grab the current user ’s desktop path and then use the os. path ’s join ( ) function to connect the path and the name of the url shortcut .
Since this is Windows only , you really do n’t need to do it this way .
A string concatenation would work just as well .
Note that we need to supply a “ url ” extension so Windows knows what to do .
Then we write a file using the path we created before and write [ InternetShortcut ] as the first line .
On the second line , we write the url target and then we close the file .
That ’s it !
The next example will be a little more complex .
In it , we will use the win32 com module from the PyWin32 package to create a shortcut to Media Player Classic , which is a nice open - source media player .
Let ’s take a look at some code so we can see how to do this thing :
import os , winshell from win32 com.client import Dispatch desktop = winshell.desktop ( ) path = os.path.join( desktop , " Media Player Classic.lnk " ) target = r" P:\Media\Media Player Classic\mplayerc.exe " wDir = r" P:\Media\Media Player Classic " icon = r" P:\Media\Media Player Classic\mplayerc.exe " shell = Dispatch ( ' WScript .
Shell ' ) shortcut = shell .
CreateShortCut ( path ) shortcut .
Targetpath = target shortcut .
Working Directory = wDir shortcut .
IconLocation = icon shortcut.save ()
The main takeaway here is the shell part .
First you import Dispatch from win32 com.client , then you call Dispatch ( ‘ WScript .
Shell ’ ) to get a shell object ( sort of ) which you then use to create a shortcut object .
Once you have that , you can assign values to the shortcut ’s attributes , which are Targetpath , WorkingDirectory and IconLocation .
Note that WorkingDirectory corresponds to the “ Start In ” field in a normal shortcut ’s property dialog .
In the script above , the IconLocation can be an icon file or it can extract the icon directly from the executable .
One small got ’cha here is that if you do n’t call save , then the icon will not be created .
In the previous example , we do n’t explicitly have to call close on the file object because Python will take care of that for us when the script finishes .
Let ’s take these two examples and make a reusable function out of them so we can use them in any login script we want :
from win32 com.client import Dispatch def createShortcut ( path , target= '' , wDir= ' ' , icon= ' ' ) : ext = path [ - 3 :] if ext == 'url ' : shortcut = file ( path , 'w ' ) shortcut .
write ( '[ InternetShortcut ]
') shortcut .write ( ' URL=%s ' % target ) shortcut.close ( ) else : shell = Dispatch ( ' WScript .
Shell ' ) shortcut = shell .
CreateShortCut ( path ) shortcut .
Targetpath = target shortcut .
Working Directory = wDir if icon == '' : pass else : shortcut .
IconLocation = icon shortcut.save ()
One obvious improvement we could add to this would be to use the os. path .
dirname method to extract the Working Directory from the target and eliminate the need to pass that information in .
Of course , I ’ve seen some screwy shortcuts that do n’t specify the target or the Working Directory at all !
Anyway , I hope you will find this article helpful in your scripting .
Until next time !
Use these 10 facts ( or are they officially factlets yet ? ) at your next party or office meeting and you ’ll be guarantied an argument .
People will insist that you ’re wrong because , “ Everyone knows … ”
Incidentally , I use number 2 when I teach logic to get students to discuss the nature of truth .
10 The New Deal
The error : Franklin Roosevelt ’s “ New Deal ” was not built upon the ideas on John Maynard Keynes .
I put this one first since it is probably the most open to dispute .
Marriner Eccles was a prominent banker who saved his family bank from ruin when the Depression hit .
It was he who told the Senate in 1933 that the key to stopping the Depression was spending .
Roosevelt later rewarded Eccles with the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve and he wrote the Banking Act of 1935 , a post he held for fourteen years .
In honor of his work , the headquarters of the Federal Reserve is housed in the Eccles Building .
Although Keynes ’ papers had been around in some form for the three years before the New Deal , the evidence indicates it was not a major influence on national economies until 1936 .
Keynes work during the Depression consisted primarily with unemployment as a function of savings and investments ( 1930 ) and public spending ( 1933 ) .
His book “ General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ” did not come out until 3 years after Eccles ’ testimony and the New Deal had started .
9 King Charles III … or not
The error : Prince Charles will not be Charles III when he assumes England ’s throne
It has been officially denied ( imagine talking about what name you ’ll have when your mum dies ) , but it is believed by many sources based on reports from Charles ’ friends that he will take George VII as his regnal name when he assumes the throne .
There are many theories as to why with the two most popular being : Charles is an unlucky name for English monarchs ( Charles I was deposed and Charles II very nearly so ) and that George is to honor his grandfather George VI .
8 Prohibition
The error : The 18th Amendment to the Constitution ( Prohibition ) did not outlaw drinking .
Drinking alcohol was never outlawed – only making , transporting , and selling it .
Liquor could legally be consumed provided it was purchased before Prohibition .
If you want to get pedantic about it , the 18th Amendment did not even outlaw that .
It was the Volstead Act that implemented Prohibition that made making , transporting and selling alcohol illegal .
The 21st Amendment would later repeal this amendment but still make it illegal to transport alcohol in areas where it was still banned ( so - called “ dry counties ” ) .
From time to time , the 18th / 21st Amendment still is the basis for lawsuits between a state and the federal government .
For example , in South Dakota v. Dole ( 1987 ) , South Dakota claimed that the federal government ’s national minimum drinking age of 21 was a violation of the 21st Amendment but the federal government ’s position was upheld 7 - 2 under the Tax and Spend clause .
7 Paul Revere
The error : Paul Revere did not ride all the way to Concord on 16 April 1775 to warn American Minutemen that the English army was invading .
And Charles Dawes did n’t finish the ride either .
Dr. Joseph Warren sent Paul Revere and Charles Dawes to Concord to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams of the invasion and soon met Dr. Samuel Prescott returning home from an evening out .
All three were soon captured by the British , but Dawes and Prescott ( not Revere ) quickly escaped .
Some say that Dawes was then thrown from his horse and had to walk back to Lexington but others claim after the escape he was lost and had to ride back to Lexington .
Of the three , only Prescott finished the ride all of the way to Concord .
6 Honest Abe
The error : Abraham Lincoln was not a Republican when he won the 1864 election .
By changing the name of his party to “ National Union Party ” , Lincoln was able to court Copperhead ( War Democrat ) voters who would never vote Republican .
More than just a name change , he selected the only southern Democrat senator not to resign his seat , Andrew Johnson , to run as vice - president .
Despite a convention to raise support for mid-term elections , the Republicans in the party joined the ranks of the radicals .
By March of 1867 , Johnson was the only Unionist in office that had not defected and it became a splinter group of the Democratic Party although ironically the Republicans kept the name of National Union Republicans for a while and consider it part of their lineage .
5 Boston Tea Party
The error : American colonists did not protest the Tea Tax with the Boston Tea Party because it raised the price of tea .
The American colonists preferred Dutch tea to English tea .
The English Parliament placed an embargo on Dutch tea in the colonies , so a huge smuggling profession developed .
To combat this , the English government LOWERED the tax on tea so that the English tea would be price competitive with Dutch teas .
The colonists ( actually some colonists led by the chief smugglers ) protested by dumping the tea into Boston Harbor .
4 The Clermont
The error : Robert Fulton ’s famous steamship was not named the Clermont .
All of the official records list the boat as North River Steam Boat and even Fulton called it the North River .
A later biographer accidentally called it the Clermont , which was the city it was berthed at .
There were other steamboats before the North River and but like many inventors , Fulton is given credit because he made the first practical one .
His boat ferried passengers on the New York City / Albany run and usually took all day including an overnight stop .
Two side note : the engine for the North River was built by another famous inventor who took an existing idea and made it practical – James Watt .
Also , Fulton built a working submarine and called it the Nautilus .
3 Franklin Roosevelt ’s Depression
The error : The US President that dealt with the Great Depression by asking employers to reduce profits and not lower wages , promoted public works programs , and creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was not Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Despite the fact that he started federal programs that were the precursor of the New Deal , President Herbert Hoover never really felt that the Depression would last as long as it did .
Many people felt that Hoover was uncaring of the plight of the poor ; however Hoover was independently wealthy before entering politics and gave all of his government checks to charity .
He believed in charity as his work in Europe during and after World War I shows and when he became Secretary of Commerce in the United States he worked to foster ties between business and government to improve service throughout the nation .
Herein lies the fundamental problem that Hoover had with dealing with the Depression ; when the Great Depression hit , he counted on the generosity of all Americans to help the country through and unfortunately , he was sadly mistaken .
It ’s interesting to note that in Barack Obama ’s current handling of the Recession , he is more like Hoover than Roosevelt including counting on banks to increase loans ( which they were hesitant to do for both Hoover and Obama ) and running deficit spending ( it was campaigning against deficit spending that helped Roosevelt win the presidency in 1932 ) .
2 La Pucelle
The error : Joan of Arc was not convicted of heresy .
Joan denied all of the heresy charges and she was never convicted of that crime despite the many traps the prosecution laid for her .
During the trial , a prosecutor made a off - hand question and asked if it was true that she dressed like a man during battles .
Seeing no harm in telling the truth , she replied yes and this was enough to seal her doom .
This transvestism violated Deuteronomy 22:5 and was enough for the court to convict her of violating God ’s Law and since that particular law carries a death penalty , she was burned at the stake .
Great care was made to give the appearance of a trial in accordance with canon law , but many aspects , including the official record , were fraudulent .
Pope Callixtus III reopened the trail and she was exonerated and Bishop Pierre Cauchon castigated for using a religion court to settle a secular dispute .
1 Prince of Darkness
The error : In the Old Testament of The Bible , “ Lucifer ” does not refer to the fallen angel .
“ Lucifer ” ( light - bearer ) is a generic title referring to the morning star ( Venus ) .
As such , it has been used throughout history to refer to Satan , Christ , and others .
With this in mind , Isaiah 14:12 starts out “ How art thou fallen from heaven , O Lucifer , son of the morning ! ” .
Taken as a separate verse , this appears to refer to the battle of angels – however , the PASSAGE starts at Isaiah 12:4 “ Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon ” and towards the end is Isaiah 14:22 “ For I will rise up against them saith the Lord of hosts , and cut of from Babylon the name , and remnant , and son , and nephew , Saith the Lord . ”
Thus Lucifer in the Old Testament refers to some unnamed Babylonian king .
Numbers sometimes tell a story better than words can .
First : 86 million .
That 's the number of acres planted with corn in the U.S. Next : 4.35 million -- the total number of U.S. acres planted with vegetables ( 130,000 of those acres are broccoli ) .
This means that the acreage of U.S. farmland apportioned to growing vegetables is a mere 5 percent of what 's devoted to growing corn .
That 's a real problem , since a majority of that corn wo n't feed people , but rather animals -- specifically , the approximately 10 billion farm animals raised and slaughtered in the U.S. each year .
This monoculturization and intensification of U.S. agriculture has had dire effects on farm animals , almost all of whom are raised in factory farm systems .
But it 's also had devastating effects on the environment .
And , this system of mass - producing " cheap food " ( at just about any cost ) is spreading around the world .
American agribusiness is looking for new markets , while emerging middle classes in developing countries are seeking to eat more meat and dairy -- something they associate with affluence and the consumer lifestyle of the U.S. Americans , generally viewed as the richest people on Earth , each eat more than 200 pounds of meat a year on average .
If current trends persist , by 2050 , 120 billion farm animals could be raised and slaughtered every year .
But the realities of climate change , which will mean harsher conditions for agriculture in many developing countries , along with degradation of ecosystems , water , land , air , and species and a rising world population ( set to top nine billion by 2050 ) , make prospects for food security and environmental sustainability globally bleak .
In a 2006 report , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) concluded that " The livestock sector emerges as one of the two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems , at every scale from local to global . "
For evidence , one has only to look at the U.S.
It 's estimated that animals inside concentrated animal feeding operations ( or CAFOs ) produce 500 million tons of waste a year , far outpacing human levels .
Pound for pound , pigs produce about four times as much waste as people .
In 2007 , corn and soy , both central to animal feed , accounted for 50 percent of harvested acres in the U.S. , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
These crops require large quantities of pesticides and chemical - based fertilizers , much of which run off into waterways , and , in some cases , ground - and drinking water .
Each year , 270 million pounds of pesticides and 21 billion pounds of synthetic fertilizer are used to grow corn and soy .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , U.S. agricultural facilities , including CAFOs , are a significant source of water pollution .
The technical term for a body of water losing its ability to provide a full range of ecological services is " impairment . "
States in the U.S. report high levels of impairment from agricultural wastes and run-off : nearly 175,000 miles of rivers , more than three million acres of lakes , and nearly 3,000 miles of estuaries .
Animal agriculture also requires huge inputs of water and energy .
Eighty - seven percent of U.S. freshwater is used in agricultural operations , according to Cornell University professor David Pimentel .
Much of this is for irrigation , with significant amounts consumed by feed crops .
Another Pimentel study found that 420 gallons of water are required to produce one pound of grain - fed " broiler " chicken .
In terms of energy intensity , meat ranks high .
Using fossil fuel energy as the unit of study , Pimentel calculated that the average agricultural product in the U.S. requires three times as much energy to produce as it provides ( so a ratio of 3:1 ) .
For meat , the ratio is up to 35:1 .
Then there 's climate change .
In 2006 , the FAO concluded that 18 percent , or nearly one - fifth , of global greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) come from the livestock sector .
That 's more than the GHGs from all the transportation systems the world over ( about 14 percent ) and just slightly less than those from deforestation ( estimated at 20 percent ) .
Global warming will have significant effects on weather patterns , and , by extension , land , water , forests , human communities , and other animals .
Some of these are already being felt in multi-year droughts in the U.S. southwest and East Africa , and dire floods in Asia and , a year ago , in Iowa , where Farm Sanctuary rescued 69 stranded pigs , many of them gestation sows from factory farms .
A recent study done at Carnegie - Mellon University sought to unravel the " climate footprint " of food .
While eating local to avoid the fossil fuels burned to transport food over long distances has gained currency as a climate cooling strategy , it turns out that meat and dairy consumption are the real diet " hotspots , " not distance .
Fifty - eight percent of diet - related GHGs come from meat , dairy , eggs , and fish .
Eating all of one 's food from local sources for a year -- challenging to do in a cold climate -- reduced an individual 's GHG emissions by the equivalent of 1,000 miles of driving .
But eating vegetarian , with no dairy , just one day a week reduced those emissions even more : the equivalent of 1,163 miles of driving a year .
Still , livestock and climate are n't mainstream issues in the public or policy discourses on global warming .
At least not yet .
There are some encouraging signs of a slight shift .
Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , who heads the main global climate change body , has urged people to eat less meat .
Ezra Klein , an influential economics writer for the Washington Post recently urged Americans also to eat less meat as a powerful individual action against global warming outweighing many of the other steps often recommended .
" Compared with cars or appliances or heating your house , eating pasta on a night when you 'd otherwise have made fajitas is easy , " Klein wrote .
Citizens , too , are taking stands in municipalities ( see sidebar on NYC Foodprint resolution ) .
But two final examples illustrate the work ahead .
A recent report by the European Parliament sought to set ambitious targets for GHG reductions in industrialized countries : between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 ( and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 ) .
However , while acknowledging the " substantial " GHG emissions from the livestock industry , the Parliament deleted a call for a cut in worldwide meat consumption , particularly in industrial nations .
And , at a recent dinner for leaders of the G - 20 countries , the world 's leading economies , British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver cooked lamb ; mint jelly was served on the side .
You Can Help : Introduce a Green Food Resolution in Your City !
Most people have never been to a factory farm , but each of us is still impacted environmentally , economically and ethically by how they operate every single day of our lives .
Even though we may refrain from eating animal products , the government routinely uses hundreds of millions of our tax dollars to subsidize an industrialized agribusiness industry that wastes natural resources and pollutes the environment while cruelly slaughtering billions of farm animals .
That 's why Farm Sanctuary wants your help in planting perennial seeds of sustainable eating by bringing a Green Food Resolution to your city !
Introducing a local resolution enables you to address global issues in your own backyard through the power of local government .
Though the specifics of each city 's resolution may differ , the general goal behind a Green Food Resolution is to have your city officially recognize the importance of promoting and supporting a sustainable food system .
That means encouraging citizens to eat a healthy plant - based diet of fresh , local , organic foods that leaves a smaller carbon footprint than a conventional animal - based diet .
A Green Food Resolution campaign creates an incredible opportunity to connect with fellow activists , build relationships with local government officials , and , most importantly , educate the public by getting people to think about the crucial , but too often overlooked connection between farm , food and environment .

Enhancements to the ALSA code for HD audio codecs , a V4L / DVB driver for the Mantis TV chip , drivers for MSI laptops and drivers for newer AMD CPUs are just some of the improvements to Linux hardware support .
Android drivers have now been escorted from the staging area , while Ramzswap ( formerly Compcache ) framework for compressing RAM has been added .
Linux Torvalds , as of the end of last week , has now released Linux 2.6.33 - rc8 , the eighth pre-release version of Linux kernel 2.6.33 .
The release announcement indicates that he expects it to be the last pre-release version , suggesting that the next kernel version from the main development tree is likely to see the light of day late this week or early next .
It is not , however , unknown for Torvalds to slip out another version despite pronouncements to the contrary , pushing back the final kernel release by three to seven days .
The description of drivers and driver infrastructure - related changes which follows completes our reporting on the major changes in Linux 2.6.33 in our " Coming in 2.6.33 " series .
Parts one , two , three and four of the series looked at changes in network support , file systems , the storage subsystem , graphics hardware , architecture , tracing and virtualisation and the drivers residing in these areas of the kernel .
Audio and video
According to an e-mail from Takashi Iwai in which he summarises the most important changes in 2.6.33 , this time round the number of changes was not quite as high as in 2.6.31 or 2.6.32 .
He highlights the code for supporting HD audio codecs , which is now stabilising , although this has nonetheless seen a number of changes .
He also considers support for Intel HDMI audio codecs and code for addressing numerous VIA HD audio codecs worthy of mention – codec names and links to these and other commits can be found in the ' Minor Gems ' section in the second half of this article .
The latter also lists a number of system - specific quirks , for various motherboards either sold separately or used in PCs and laptops , which have been merged by kernel developers .
The kernel hackers have removed the OSS audio drivers for Ensoniq SoundScape hardware .
Of the more than ten thousand commits undertaken in the main development tree since the release of Linux 2.6.32 , more than 330 are located in the audio subsystem .
While the V4L / DVB subsystem easily beats this , with more than 600 major or minor changes .
Subsystem maintainer Mauro Carvalho Chehab highlights some of the key changes in his main git pull request .
New drivers include the new pac7302 and stv0680 Gscpa sub - drivers for webcam chips from a range of manufacturers .
The infrastructure for addressing infra-red receivers for remote controls has seen some major changes .
The Mantis driver , which supports a chip - set used in various TV cards , was merged just prior to the release of the fifth pre-release version .
Laptops , input devices and hardware monitoring
The msi-wmi driver , which should allow the function keys for changing sound volume and brightness on some MSI laptops to work under Linux , has been merged into the kernel .
The classmate - laptop driver for Intel 's Classmate PCs is another new arrival .
Kernel hackers have also revamped various audio support - related components of the driver for IBM and Lenovo Thinkpad laptops ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Kernel developers have added support for Wacom 's single and multi touch LCD ISD v4 tablets with ID codes 9 F , E2 and E3 to the Wacom driver .
Developers have improved support for devices such as Dell Latitude E6x00 series laptops , which include both touchpads and trackpoints from ALPS .
The ALPS driver code now offers better support for the touchpads with 4 - directional buttons , occasionally found on Acer laptops .
The k10 temp driver , newly merged into the kernel , is able to read temperature sensors in various recent AMD chips .
Because many CPUs deliver erroneous figures , the code only works after entering a special parameter given in the documentation .
The via -cputemp driver is another new arrival and returns temperature sensor data from recent VIA CPUs .
USB and FireWire
A driver , developed largely by Nokia , for the OMAP 34xx processor 's USB EHCI controller has been merged into the USB subsystem .
Various additional changes in the USB subsystem can be found in the links listed in the second half of this article and in the USB subsystem maintainer 's git pull request .
Via a git pull request and changes in the help text displayed during kernel configuration , Stefan Richter , maintainer of the Linux FireWire code , is advising distributions to move to the new Juju FireWire stack .
Details on the required steps can be found in the Linux FireWire developer wiki , which also lists a number of further corrections and enhancements to the Linux 2.6.33 FireWire code .
Staging
As mentioned in the first part of the " Coming in 2.6.33 " series , kernel developers have merged the rtl8192u driver ( easily confused with the rtl8192e and rtl8192su drivers incorporated in earlier kernel versions into the staging area for unfinished and ' dodgy ' drivers ) into the staging area .
The rtl8187se driver has been renamed to make way for a future fit and proper Linux driver with the same name .
There have also been big changes to the staging drivers for newer Ralink WLAN chips , with , for example , the rt3090 driver removed due to the fact that its functionality is now fulfilled by the rt2860 staging driver .
The latter is based on a driver developed by Ralink itself and released under the GPL , which the company has recently updated .
A number of the recent changes have now been incorporated into the staging driver .
The Ramzswap framework ( formerly Compcache ) has also found its way into the staging area .
This stores data stored on a virtual swap device in compressed form in RAM for greater efficiency .
Background information on the technology can be found in the Ramzswap documentation and in an LWN .
net article from last May .
Also new is code to support the B.A.T.M.A.N. ( Better Approach To Mobile Ad- Hoc Networking ) protocol , which enables the creation of ad - hoc mesh networks .
Details can be found at open - mesh.org .
As anticipated , code for distributed storage ( DST ) and various drivers for Google 's Android have been removed from the staging area , as no - one has been looking after the code .
As previously reported , staging maintainer Greg Kroah - Hartman has commented on the Android drivers situation in a blog post
A second blog entry by Kroah - Hartman gives an overview and background of further changes in the staging area and threatens other drivers with impending ejection .
The latter include drivers for supporting Hyper - V , due to the fact that " The developers again seem to have disappeared , this is getting old " .
Kroah - Hartman previously threatened to eject these drivers for the very same reason back in September , but the developers then reappeared .
History looks to be repeating itself and the risk of ejection appears to have receded for now at least .
Minor gems
Many further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below , which contains the commit headers referring to the respective change .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commit in the web front end of the Git branch for the kernel sources maintained by Linus Torvalds at kernel.org .

Latecomers
The previous five parts of the Kernel Log mini series have already given a detailed overview of the many changes in of the Linux kernel .
All of the major enhancements have already been mentioned there , as they entered the main development branch during the first phase of the development cycle .
But some small , usually not quite as important changes that fall in the " minor gems " section , were late entries to the kernel – for completeness , we have included these changes in the following list .
One of the latecomers was the " Firmware download driver " ath3 k for Atheros Bluetooth chips .
Some others – including TCP_NODELAY - Support for CIFS , a new Mount Option for BTRFS and performance improvements for CFQ – can be found via following list :

Men at Work 's Colin Hay has hit back at a ruling that his song Down Under rips off a popular children 's tune , calling it a win for corporate greed .
The Federal Court found the flute riff in the song was originally from the tune of Kookaburra Sits In An Old Gum Tree .
In an open letter to fans , Hay maintains the ruling will not change his feelings for the Australian classic , which he penned with Ron Strykert over 30 years ago .
While Hay went on to maintain the flute riff was not part of the original song so therefore should not be considered an infringement of copyright , the statement focuses on his anger at how the case has been publicised .
" The copyright of Kookaburra is owned and controlled by Larrikin Music Publishing , more specifically by a man named Norm Lurie .
Larrikin Music Publishing is owned by a multi-national corporation called Music Sales , " he said .
" I only mention this as Mr Lurie is always banging on about how he 's the underdog , the little guy .
Yet , he is part of a multi-national corporation just like EMI Music Publishing .
It 's all about money , make no mistake . "
He says Marion Sinclair , who wrote Kookaburra , never complained about the similarities and there were enough differences between the riffs to consider them separate tunes .
" It is no surprise that in over 20 years , no one noticed the reference to Kookaburra .
There are reasons for this .
It was inadvertent , naive , unconscious , and by the time Men At Work recorded the song , it had become unrecognisable , " he said .
" It is also unrecognisable for many reasons .
Kookaburra is written as a round in a major key , and the Men At Work version of Down Under is played with a reggae influenced ' feel ' in a minor key .
This difference alone creates a completely different listening experience .
" The two bars in question had become part of a four - bar flute part , thereby unconsciously creating a new musical ' sentence ' harmonically , and in so doing , completely changed the musical context of the line in question , and became part of the instrumentation of Men At Work 's arrangement of Down Under . "
Hay also says the ruling will hamper musical creativity across the industry .
" What was born out of creative musical expression , became both a technical and mathematical argument .
This ruling will have lasting repercussions , and I suspect not for the better , " he said .
His statement ends on a defiant note , reaffirming his commitment to the song .
" This outcome will have no real impact upon the relationship that I have with our song Down Under , for we are connected forever .
When I co-wrote Down Under back in 1978 , I appropriated nothing from anyone else 's song .
There was no Men At Work , there was no flute , yet the song existed , " he said .
" That 's the truth of it , because I was there , Norm Lurie was not , and neither was Justice Jacobson .
Down
Under lives in my heart , and may perhaps live in yours .
I claim it , and will continue to play it , for as long as you want to hear it . "
Victoria 's Public Transport and Arts minister , Lynne Kosky , has resigned from State Parliament .
Ms Kosky has cited health problems within her family as the reason for her decision to step down from politics .
At an emotional media conference this morning , Ms Kosky said she agonised over the decision , but realised she had to put her family 's health before politics .
" I 've thought long and hard about my capacity to provide the support to my family that they deserve , particularly at the moment , along with the close attention that my job demands , and I 've come to the conclusion that it 's not possible for me to do both , " Ms Kosky said this morning .
" I do leave with some sadness , but no regrets .
" This is a decision I 've not taken lightly but it 's the right one for my family and for me . "
The Premier , John Brumby , says Lynne Kosky has made an extraordinary contribution as a minister , but she has to put her family first .
" It 's the right decision for her and her family to resign the Ministry and to retire from Parliament , " Mr Brumby said .
" The view that I put to her was that in this business , you must always put your family first .
" In a sense , it 's no good looking back in five or 10 years time and saying , ' I should have done that at the time , and I did n't . '
" You only get one chance to get it right . "
Mr Brumby will announce his new cabinet on Wednesday .
Tributes
The Opposition 's public transport spokesman , Terry Mulder , says he respects Ms Kosky 's decision .
" We wish Lynne well , we understand that she 's made her decision based on family reasons , " Mr Mulder said .
" Family must come first .
" We respect the decision that she 's made .
" I 've had I believe a good working relationship with Lynne Kosky , as much as you can from Opposition . "
Ms Kosky was first elected to the Victorian parliament in 1996 in the seat of Altona , in Melbourne 's west .
A by - election will be held to elect a new Altona MP , before the Victorian state election later in the year .
Mr Brumby says he would rather not fight two campaigns in one year .
" But obviously we 'll contest that , " he said .
" We 'll aim to win that by - election and we 'll run the best possible candidate . "
Ms Kosky 's state electorate overlaps with the federate electorate held by the Deputy Prime Minister , Julia Gillard .
Ms Gillard has paid tribute to Ms Kosky .
" She 's made a significant contribution to Victorian politics , to the life of this state and of course to the people of Altona , the electorate that she represents , " Ms Gillard said .
" So from my point of view , she will be missed . "
Public transport woes
Ms Kosky took over the public transport portfolio after Labor 's 2006 state election win .
Her term as Transport Minister has been overshadowed by widespread faults on the public transport system , including massive delays and cancellations on the metropolitan rail network and the troubled introduction of the Myki ticketing system .
Ms Kosky says her portfolio challenges did not influence her decision to leave politics .
" I have hopefully made a significant different , a significant improvement , to public transport in this state , " she said .

Update : Facebook released a statement .
See it here : Facebook : We Did Not " Force " Sales Rep To Quit ABC's " The Bachelor "
Earlier : A Facebook sales rep named Ali Fedotowsky quit her role as a contestant on ABC 's matchmaking reality show " The Bachelor , " Monday night .
Ali quit the show after Facebook gave her an ultimatum : quit the show or quit Facebook .
In a greater testament to the worth of Facebook options than SharePost could ever demonstrate , Ali tearfully said good - bye to this year 's " bachelor , " limo - business - owning pilot , Jake Pavelka .
In an on - camera interview after Monday 's show was over , Ali said , " Jake absolutely deserves to be happy .
He deserves a woman that would give up everything for the chance to be with him .
I 'd give up everything to be with him .
Sticking around here on a gamble , I can't justify that to myself . "
Aw .
A site called Reality Steve first reported that Ali is a Facebook employee , but fans figured it out pretty quick themselves .
There are some indications
Ali may not have quit the show for good .
Bachelor host Chris Harrison told TV Guide , " You have n't seen the last of Ali and Jake and their situation is not over .
Obviously you could tell when she left , on both sides , they 're not done .
I 'm really proud of the way they handle what 's to come . "
We 've reached out to Facebook and will obviously update readers when we hear back .
In the meantime …

A composite image of Joe Biden on ‘ Meet the Press ’ and Dick Cheney on ‘ State of the Union . ’ | AP photo composite by POLITICO W.H. counters Cheney with Biden
Vice President Joe Biden 's appearances on two Sunday morning talk shows this week are part of a White House strategy to both pre-empt and potentially respond to former Vice President Dick Cheney 's interview on ABC's " This Week , " where administration officials expect he 'll continue to advance his sharp critique of President Obama 's record on national security .
Cheney has been one of the strongest critics of Obama 's handling of national security and foreign policy issues , and his interview comes amid an intense debate over the administration 's handling of the accused Christmas Day bomber and the trial of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Advertisement
After Cheney 's interview was announced Thursday , the White House lined up Biden for NBC's " Meet the Press " and CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
Sunday 's VP vs. VP lineup is a first , and the closest Biden and Cheney have come to an actual debate .
The pre-emptive part of the programming starts with " Meet the Press . "
Biden is scheduled to tape his " Meet " interview with David Gregory on Saturday evening from Vancouver .
A White House official said that in the segment Biden will make the case for how aggressive the Obama administration has been in taking on al Qaeda .
An excerpt of Biden 's interview will be released later Saturday evening under an embargo that will lift just as Cheney ’s live sit - down with Jonathan Karl begins Sunday at 9 a.m .
If Biden does n't watch the interview from his perch in Vancouver , the official said , the vice president will most certainly be informed on what his predecessor says by someone who does .
Then at 10:30 , Biden will be interviewed live by Bob Scheiffer on " Face the Nation , " giving the vice president a chance to directly reply to whatever charges his predecessor had leveled earlier in the morning .
" If the former vice president wants to discuss the record on fighting al Qaeda and keeping America safe , then we thought it made sense for the current vice president to make the case for what the Obama administration has succeeded in doing , " a White House official said .
Already the White House has started to leak more information to the press about its efforts to combat terrorism , something the White House believes Obama has not received enough credit for .
An Associated Press story Friday included some of the most detailed accounts yet of the administration 's counterterrorism efforts , attributed to senior intelligence and law enforcement officials .
The story highlighted the administration 's belief that the war on terrorism campaign " can be waged even more aggressively than its predecessor's . "
While Cheney has appeared on the Sunday talk shows several times since leaving office to blast the Obama administration , until now the White House has left push - back to lower - profile administration officials in the following hours or to Monday from the press secretary 's podium .
The vice presidents have exchanged barbs in the media for over a year now .
Asked last December about Biden 's comment that Cheney was " the most dangerous vice president we 've had probably in American history , " the Republican fired back that it seemed Obama " does not expect Biden to have as consequential a role as I have had during my time . "
Biden said Cheney was " dead wrong " last spring when he said the Obama administration 's policies made the country less safe .
And when Cheney said Obama was " dithering " on his Afghanistan strategy , Biden said his predecessor 's opinions were " irrelevant . "

Series : Nerf N Strike
Nerf N Strike Ammo capacity : 6 darts
6 darts Range : 25 - 30 feet
25 -30 feet Released : 2010
The first thing I noticed when took the Deploy out of the box is that it comes with a strap .
Finally !
I do n’t know why it took so long to get a strap on a Nerf gun , but it ’s definitely a welcome feature .
At this point , I ’d planned to play around with transforming the Deploy from gun to flashlight and back again , but I just could n’t resist — I had to see how far it shoots before I could do anything else .
The results of the range test were about as I expected .
Shots ranged from 25 - 30 feet , which is not surprising at all , given that it uses a reverse plunger system like the one found in the Nerf Recon and Raider .
The Deploy ’s clip holds a maximum of six darts .
Of course , this clip is interchangeable with other N - Strike clips , including the drum ( which looks really ridiculous on the Deploy and feels plain silly ) .
Unfortunately , the pump-action firing method is a bit of a mixed bag .
The pump itself slides very smoothly and is easy to use , but the Deploy ’s handle feels really flimsy ( this is what happens when you make a collapsible handle to accommodate a transforming design ) .
Though it ’s a little flimsy , overall the Deploy feels solid in my hands .
It ’s light and well constructed , as you would expect from a Nerf product .
As advertised , you can use components from other N - Strike guns on the Deploy .
As I ’ve said in the past , most of the components are purely cosmetic in nature , but it ’s undeniably cool that you can customize the appearance of your blaster as you see fit .
Now to the flashlight transformation element .
First things first , using the flashlight requires 3 AAA batteries ( the same batteries operate the ‘ laser ’ targeting system ) .
Folding up the Deploy is simple enough — just fold up the handle and slide the shoulder stock forward , and you ’ll end up with a device that resembles a briefcase – with a flashlight at the end of it .
Transforming the Deploy back into a blaster again is the best part , as you only have to press a button on the top .
All in all , the Deploy is a solid gun , and I ’d heartily recommend it to avid Nerf fans and kids who would get a kick out of the flashlight part .
However , if you ’re new to Nerf and just want to have some casual wars around the house or office , there are better guns out there .
Below is a picture of the back of the box ( found via Adult Fans of Nerf ) .
This week 's Product Story showcases nVent and how they utilize Stratasys 3D printing to create a custom solution to an intricate problem .
An electrical solutions company , nVent , specializes in solving unique problems across different industries and faces multiple challenges with needing custom parts created based on each project .
Just like any other company that services a wide variety of industries , they face manufacturing constraints with creating specific parts for each client .
Machined components are the traditional way of acquiring these parts and can be costly and can take weeks to produce .
Let 's dive in to how they utilize Stratasys 3D printers to build the part on demand .
A car bomb exploded outside a Civil Guard barracks in the northern Spanish city of Burgos early on Wednesday , injuring 46 people in an attack authorities blamed on Basque separatist rebels ETA .
The blast ripped away most of the outer wall of the multi-storey barracks in of the biggest attacks for some time by ETA , whose ranks have been decimated by arrests .

" It ’s almost a miracle no one was hurt more seriously , “ an emergency services spokesman said , adding that the barracks had been evacuated and fire fighters were going through the building .
Most of the injured , who included children , suffered cuts and bruises and although no one was in serious condition , 38 had been transferred to hospital in the historic cathedral town , according to the spokesman .
The car packed with explosives had been parked outside the barracks , home to members of Spain ’s paramilitary police force and their families .

" Those who do this sort of thing will end up in jail , “ said Manuel Chaves , one of Spain ’s deputy prime ministers .
Authorities believe ETA is under pressure to show it can still mount attacks despite having been weakened by a series of arrests including that of its suspected top commander , Jurdan Martitegi , in April .
His capture brought to four the number of commanders caught in less than a year .
ETA is held responsible for killing more than 800 people in the past 40 years in a campaign to carve out an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southern France .
It typically employs shootings and car bombs , often targeted at police and army barracks .

Polls indicate most Basques in Spain would favour some sort of independence , although support for ETA violence is confined to a diminishing minority .
The most recent killing blamed on the group was on June 19 , when a police inspector died in a booby - trapped car in the northern city of Bilbao .
Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero ’s Socialist government broke off peace talks with ETA after the rebels killed two people with a car bomb at Madrid airport in December 2006 .

Eighteen more alleged ETA members were captured in a three - week period in June and July .

Multithreading in C , POSIX style
Multithreading —
An Overview
In most modern operating systems it is possible for an application to split into many " threads " that all execute concurrently .
It might not be immediately obvious why this is useful , but there are numerous reasons why this is beneficial .
When a program is split into many threads , each thread acts like its own individual program , except that all the threads work in the same memory space , so all their memory is shared .
This makes communication between threads fairly simple , but there are a few caveats that will be noted later .
So , what does multithreading do for us ?
Well , for starters , multiple threads can run on multiple CPU s , providing a performance improvement .
A multithreaded application works just as well on a single - CPU system , but without the added speed .
As multi-core processors become commonplace , such as
Secondly , and often more importantly , it allows the programmer to divide each particular job of a program up into its own piece that operates independently of all the others .
This becomes particularly important when many threads are doing blocking I /O operations .
A media player , for example , can have a thread for pre-buffering the incoming media , possibly from a harddrive , CD , DVD , or network socket , a thread to process user input , and a thread to play the actual media .
A stall in any single thread wo n't keep the others from doing their jobs .
For the operating system , switching between threads is normally cheaper than switching between processes .
This is because the memory management information does n't change between threads , only the stack and register set do , which means less data to copy on context switches .

Multithreading — Basic Concepts Multithreaded applications often require synchronization objects .
These objects are used to protect memory from being modified by multiple threads at the same time , which might make the data incorrect .
The first , and simplest , is an object called a mutex .
A mutex is like a lock .
A thread can lock it , and then any subsequent attempt to lock it , by the same thread or any other , will cause the attempting thread to block until the mutex is unlocked .
These are very handy for keeping data structures correct from all the threads ' points of view .
For example , imagine a very large linked list .
If one thread deletes a node at the same time that another thread is trying to walk the list , it is possible for the walking thread to fall off the list , so to speak , if the node is deleted or changed .
Using a mutex to " lock " the list keeps this from happening .
Computer Scientist people will tell you that Mutex stands for Mutual Exclusion .
In synchronized keyword .
Technically speaking , only the thread that locks a mutex can unlock it , but sometimes operating systems will allow any thread to unlock it .
Doing this is , of course , a Bad Idea .
If you need this kind of functionality , read on about the semaphore in the next paragraph .
Similar to the mutex is the semaphore .
A semaphore is like a mutex that counts instead of locks .
If it reaches zero , the next attempt to access the semaphore will block until someone else increases it .
This is useful for resource management when there is more than one resource , or if two separate threads are using the same resource in coordination .
Common terminology for using semaphores is " uping " and " downing " , where upping increases the count and downing decreases and blocks on zero .
Java provides a Class called Semaphore which does the same thing , but uses acquire ( ) and release ( ) methods instead of uping and downing .
With a name as cool - sounding as semaphore , even Computer Scientists could n't think up what this is short for .
( Yes , I know that a semaphore is a signal or flag ;)
Unlike mutexes , semaphores are designed to allow multiple threads to up and down them all at once .
If you create a semaphore with a count of 1 , it will act just like a mutex , with the ability to allow other threads to unlock it .
The third and final structure is the thread itself .
More specifically , thread identifiers .
These are useful for getting certain threads to wait for other threads , or for getting threads to tell other threads interesting things .
Computer Scientists like to refer to the pieces of code protected by mutexes and semaphores as Critical Sections .
In general , it 's a good idea to keep Critical Sections as short as possible to allow the application to be as parallel as possible .
The larger the critical section , the more likely it is that multiple threads will hit it at the same time , causing stalls .
In POSIX , the types we 'll be dealing with are pthread_t for thread identifiers , pthread_mutex_t for mutexes , and sem_t for semaphores .
We use the word " pthread " a lot because it stands for POSIX Threads .

We use the word " pthread " a lot because it stands forOSIX
Compiling Multithreaded Programs Compiling multithreaded applications will require a few minor tweaks to our build setup .
First , we 'll need to include the appropriate header file .
For POSIX systems , this header is called pthread.h .
This header defines all the functions we 'll be using to make threads .
If we 're using semaphores we 'll also need to include semaphore.h .
#include < pthread .h >
#include < semaphore .h>
The next change is that we 'll need to link our program with the pthread library to use its functions .
For a compiler like gcc we simply use the -l option , like this :
gcc myProgram .o -o my Program - lpthread
Now that we 've got the header in place , and we know how to link our program , let 's get started .
Creating a thread Creating a pthread is fairly easy .
The function pthread_create is used , and it takes 4 arguments .
int pthread_create ( pthread_t * pth , pthread_attr_t * att , void * ( * function ) , void * arg ) ;
The first argument is a pointer to a pthread_t , where the function stores the identifier of the newly - created thread .
The next argument is the attribute argument .
This is typically NULL , but can also point to a structure that changes the thread 's attributes .
the third argument is the function the new thread will start at .
If the thread returns from the function , the thread is terminated as well .
You can think of the function as main , since it behaves similarly .
The final argument is passed to the function when the thread is started .
this is similar to the argc / argv command line arguments to main , but it can be any data type .
Zero is returned on success , otherwise a failure of some variety happened .
Inside the thread function , a thread can terminate itself by returning from the thread function or by calling pthread_exit .
They behave identically .
A thread can also be " detached " , which frees all the resources the thread acquired while it was running as soon as it terminates .
This is accomplished with pthread_detach .
A detached thread can't be waited on .
Stopping a thread Sometimes an application may wish to stop a thread that is currently executing .
The function pthread_cancel can help us accomplish this .
int pthread_cancel ( pthread_t thread ) ;
The only argument to pthread_cancel is the thread identifier for the thread to be cancelled .
It returns zero if successful , or an error code otherwise .
A thread can set whether or not it can be cancelled by using int pthread_setcancelstate .
Mutexes and Semaphores Mutexes are fairly easy to create .
The function we use is pthread_mutex_init , which takes 2 parameters .
The first is a pointer to a mutex_t that we 're creating .
The second parameter is usually NULL , but can also be a pthread_mutexattr_t structure that specifies different attributes for it .
To lock and unlock a mutex , use pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock .
These both take 1 parameter : a pointer to the mutex being operated on .
pthread_mutex_trylock is similar to pthread_mutex_lock , except that if it can't lock the mutex , it returns a error instead of blocking .
When the mutex is no longer needed , it can be freed with pthread_mutex_destroy .
Semaphores follow a similar paradigm .
They are initialized with sem_init , which takes 3 parameters .
The first is a pointer to the semaphore being initialized .
The second is always zero .
This argument is used to denote semaphores shared between processes , but it is n't always supported .
The third argument specifies the initial value of the newly created semaphore .
To " Up " a semaphore , use sem_post .
To " Down " a semaphore , use sem_wait .
These kind of parallel pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock .
sem_destroy is used to destroy a semaphore once it is no longer needed .
Multithreading — Waiting for other threads
It is also possible to make one thread stop and wait for another thread to finish .
This is accomplished with pthread_join .
This function takes a pthread_t identifier to pick which thread to wait for , and takes a void ** parameter to capture the return value .
Joining a thread that has already exited is possible , and performing this will free any resources the thread had not already deallocated .
In zombies .
Note that only 1 thread can wait for any other thread .
A detached thread ( with pthread_detach ) can't be waited on either .
Here 's some example code to illustrate pthread_join :
#include < stdio.h > # include < pthread.h > /*
This is our thread function .
It is like main ( ) , but for a thread */ void * thread Func ( void * arg ) { char * str ; int i = 0 ; str=( char * ) arg ; while ( i < 10 ) { usleep ( 1 ) ; printf ( " threadFunc says : %s
" , str ) ; ++i ; } return NULL ; } int main ( void ) { pthread_t pth ; // this is our thread identifier int i = 0 ; /* Create worker thread */ pthread_create ( &pth , NULL , threadFunc , " processing ... " ) ; /* wait for our thread to finish before continuing */ pthread_join ( pth , NULL /* void ** return value could go here */) ; while ( i < 10 ) { usleep ( 1 ) ; printf ( " main ( ) is running ...
" ) ; ++i ; } return 0 ; }
Running this code will produce a bunch of text from threadFunc( ) , and then a bunch from main ( ) .
It is also possible to make one thread stop and wait for another thread to finish .
This is accomplished with .
This function takes aidentifier to pick which thread to wait for , and takes aparameter to capture the return value .
Joining a thread that has already exited is possible , and performing this will free any resources the thread had not already deallocated .
In GNU / Linux , as well as other UNIX - like operating systems , these unjoined threads are calledNote that only 1 thread can wait for any other thread .
A detached thread ( with ) can't be waited on either .

Multithreading — Example Source
Here 's some example code to illustrate thread creation :
#include < pthread.h > # include < stdio.h > /*
This is our thread function .
It is like main ( ) , but for a thread * / void * thread Func ( void * arg ) { char * str ; int i = 0 ; str=( char * ) arg ; while ( i < 110 ) { usleep ( 1 ) ; printf ( " threadFunc says : %s
" , str ) ; ++i ; } return NULL ; } int main ( void ) { pthread_t pth ; // this is our thread identifier int i = 0 ; pthread_create ( &pth , NULL , threadFunc , " foo " ) ; while ( i < 100 ) { usleep ( 1 ) ; printf ( " main is running ...
" ) ; ++i ; } printf ( " main waiting for thread to terminate ...
" ) ; pthread_join ( pth , NULL ) ; return 0 ; }
The output will be ( mostly ) alternating lines as the main ( ) and threadFunc ( ) threads execute and pause .
Without the usleep ( ) 's they 'll not switch because we are n't doing anything that takes long enough to consume our whole time slice .
We could capture the return value in the pthread_join ( ) call if we used a variable instead of NULL for the second argument .

Performance Considerations
When designing an application for threads , or converting an existing program , there are some considerations to keep in mind when it comes to threads .
First , thread creation tends to be expensive -- spawning thousands of threads with short lifetimes usually is n't time - effective .
If you need to create threads frequently , a common pattern used to reduce this cost is a " Thread Pool " .
At startup , the application will spawn a number of threads and supply them on demand .
When the thread task completes , the thread returns to the pool for reuse later .
Fancier implementations will dynamically close threads when there 's too much of a surplus , or spawn additional threads when there 's a shortage .
Each additional thread also gets its own stack .
This stack space can be large , which can consume a lot of memory space ( especially in 32 bit applications ) .
There are methods to reduce a thread 's stack size using the pthreads API .
For small numbers of threads this usually is n't a concern , but it 's something to keep in mind .
Lock contention ( when two or more threads are trying to acquire the same lock ) requires skillful design to keep as many threads operating in parallel as possible .
There are several volumes of literature on ways to design locks , lock heirarchies , and other variations to mitigate this cost .

Scientists have built a clock which is 37 times more precise than the existing international standard .
The quantum - logic clock , which detects the energy state of a single aluminum ion , keeps time to within a second every 3.7 billion years .
The new timekeeper could one day improve GPS or detect the slowing of time predicted by Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
" It could it be a real contender for the next frequency standard , or next timekeeper , " said physicist Chin-wen ( James ) Chou of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , lead author of a study to appear in a forthcoming Physical Review Letters .
Chou 's team is one of several racing to build an atomic clock that can replace the current international standard , the cesium fountain clock .
The cesium clock loses one second every 100 million years .
Chou 's is not the first quantum - logic clock , but his uses aluminum and magnesium ions , which makes it twice as precise as its predecessors that used aluminum and beryllium .
To keep time , quantum - logic clocks measure the vibration frequency of UV lasers .
Unfortunately , the best lasers we can build veer off their normal frequency by about one tick every hour , Chou said .
To keep the laser 's timekeeping precise , its vibration must be anchored to something much more stable .
That anchor is the vibration of an electrically charged aluminum atom , which vibrates at 1.1 Petahertz , or 1.1 quadrillion times a second .
The first step in measuring the ion's vibration is to hit it with UV lasers , which are tuned to the charged atom 's rate of vibration .
The aluminum ion can be in either a low - or high - quantum energy state .
" If the laser frequency is right on the ion frequency , then the ion will change state , but if the laser frequency is off a little bit , then the ion does n't change state as efficiently , " Chou said .
" This efficiency is a signal that tells us , this signal is off by so much , and we should steer the frequency so it stays on the frequency of the aluminum ion . "
But they can't tune the laser frequency to the aluminum ion state unless they can actually detect that state .
To do that , the group couples the aluminum ion to a magnesium ion .
A separate set of laser beams shine on the pair .
If the aluminum ion changes state , then both ions start to move .
Detecting that motion requires a third set of lasers to focus on the magnesium ion .
If the magnesium ion is in motion , it emits a photon of light .
Otherwise , it stays dark .
" That ’s the beauty of it , we can see just one ion emitting light , " Chou said .
In a weird twist , the team can't actually tell how many times the clock ticks per second .
That 's because the definition of a second is currently based on the cesium fountain clock , which simply can't measure the precision of a more precise machine .
It works using a similar principle as the aluminum clock , but uses the vibration of a cesium atom to anchor the frequency of a microwave source .
The clock could help resolve questions about the universal physical constants , such as the speed of light in a vacuum , or Planck 's constant , an important value in quantum physics .
Physical constants are supposedly fixed over time , but some theories suggest they may vary slightly , he said .
" Optical clocks are one of the candidates that might be able to see that really tiny variation over time , " he said .
Global positioning devices also rely on extremely precise atomic clocks , so " if we have better and better clocks then we can tell our position , to a better and better precision , " Chou said .
And the clocks could also show the effects of general relativity by detecting how much gravity warps time .
There 's no plan to adopt the aluminum - ion clock as the formal international standard yet .
To do so , the clock ticks need be transmitted around the world .
That is normally done with optical cables , but those can only transmit such a stable frequency for around 60 miles , Chou said .

After years of research , professional infighting and maneuvering from various interest groups , the nation ’s psychiatrists Tuesday unveiled proposed changes to the manual used to diagnose and treat mental disorders around the world .
The draft document , released by the American Psychiatric Assn. , for the first time calls for binge - eating and gambling to be considered disorders , opening the way for insurance coverage of these problems .
But it refrains from suggesting a formal diagnosis for obesity , Internet addiction or sex addiction , as some professionals had proposed .
The document also recommends a single category for autism spectrum disorders , unifying what has been a multifaceted and complicated diagnostic scale .
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders will be published in 2013 .
The book , which serves mental health professionals , is also used by insurance companies making decisions on treatment coverage and in courtrooms and schools .
It was last revised in 1994 .
Advertisement
The draft of the document will be displayed for public comment from Wednesday until April 20 at www.dsm5.org, allowing for input from individuals and organizations who may feel they ’ve been left out of the revision process .
“ This has been a massive effort on the part of a very dedicated team , ” Dr. David Kupfer , chairman of the DSM - 5 task force , said Tuesday at a Washington news conference .
“ Their priorities were to make sure the manual is based on scientific evidence , is useful to clinicians and maintains continuity with the previous edition wherever possible . ”
DSM - 5 is likely to list fewer diagnoses than the previous manual .
Experts have proposed folding several disorders into single categories based on studies that suggest some disorders have similar origins , symptoms and treatments but only vary in severity .
For example , the four separate diagnoses related to autism -- autistic disorder , Asperger ’s disorder , childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified -- would now be referred to as autism spectrum disorders .

And the current categories of substance abuse and dependence will be referred to as “ addiction and related disorders ” -- a reflection that these problems cannot be easily categorized as mild or severe but occur on a continuum .
The loss of some categories is expected to be heavily criticized .
People with Asperger ’s disorder , considered a mild form of autism characterized by difficulty with social relationships , see their condition as distinct , said Geraldine Dawson , chief science officer for Autism Speaks , a research and advocacy organization in New York .
“ These different labels become part of a person ’s identity .
I think we need to be sensitive to that , ” Dawson said .

Similarly , the proposal to place personality disorders in one category will not be welcomed by patient groups such as The Treatment and Research Advancements Assn. for Personality Disorders , which has championed specific research and treatment for one of these , borderline personality disorder .
“ This will be a disaster , ” said Valerie Porr , founder and president of the New York - based organization .
“ It kind of trivializes the personality disorders . ”
Another possible point of contention is the suggestion of a category titled “ risk syndromes ” to describe what may be early signs of a mental disorder .
For example , 25 % to 30 % of people diagnosed with psychosis have early symptoms that include being suspicious of others and speaking nonsensically .
Advertisement
Some critics fear that categorizing people as “ at risk ” when they do n’t yet have a full - blown disorder may lead to misdiagnosis and possible stigmatization .
But the category will not be used to screen the general public , only to diagnose people who are already in some distress and seeking help for their symptoms , said Dr. William T. Carpenter , Jr. , chairman of the DSM - 5 psychotic disorders work group .
For a person to even receive an “ at risk ” diagnosis , there must be some treatment known to help , he said .
Flagging and treating people early , Carpenter added , may stop a condition from developing into a serious impairment .
Advertisement
Other proposals , such as the addition of gambling disorder and binge - eating disorder , have been long endorsed .
“ About 15 million people have binge - eating disorder , ” said Lynn Grefe , chief executive of the National Eating Disorders Assn .
“ Hopefully , [ this ] would help them get the help that they need . ”
One new category -- temper dysregulation with dysphoria -- is proposed to prevent misdiagnosis of children who have bursts of rage and can be moody , anxious and irritable .
Such children are often diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and treated accordingly , sometimes with powerful medications .
The diagnosis of bipolar “ is being given , we believe , too frequently , ” said Dr. David Shaffer , a member of the work group on disorders in childhood and adolescence .
In reality , when such children are tracked into adulthood , very few of them turn out to be bipolar , he said .

In some ways , the manual reflects a disappointing reality for psychiatrists .
Despite many scientific advances , there are still no biological tests -- based on genes , blood markers or brain scans -- to help diagnose mental illness .
Thus , diagnosis is based on description , a process that is , by its nature , subjective and vulnerable to criticism .
Work on DSM - 5 began almost 10 years ago , and the draft reflects the work of 13 subcommittees in different areas of psychiatry .
The project has generated criticism for its secrecy .
To limit influence of the pharmaceutical industry , DSM - 5 committee members agreed to limit their income from industry sources to $ 10,000 per year while they work on the manual .

In this image obtained via Twitter , astronaut Soichi Noguchi aboard the International Space Station posted this picture showing the Sahara Desert , the first view out of the cupola 's windows on the observation deck of the Tranquility module station .
Astronauts unveil phenomenal new window on world CAPE CANAVERAL 
In a highly anticipated grand finale to their mission , astronauts opened the shutters on the International Space Station 's new observation deck Wednesday and were humbled by " absolutely spectacular " views of Earth from inside the elaborate atrium of windows .
The $ 27 million lookout opened each of its seven eyes one window at a time as the crews of the station and shuttle Endeavour carried out their third and final spacewalk .
It was the moment everyone had been waiting for :
The round central window — the largest ever flown in space — was the first exposed as astronauts inside cranked open the shutter as they sailed 220 miles above the South Pacific .
" As expected , the view through window seven is absolutely spectacular , " space station commander Jeffrey Williams said .
" When we have the others around it open , it will give us a view of the entire globe .
Absolutely incredible . "
Mission Control set the night 's mood by beaming up a recording of Jimmy Buffett 's " Window on the World . "
" I do n't think space station 's ever going to be the same after this , " Mission Control said in a congratulatory call .
The astronauts closed the round shutter covering the window , which measures 31 inches across , after three minutes to test the mechanisms .
They repeated the process until all the windows were checked , opening the last two as the linked shuttle and space station flew above France and Greece .
It was a satisfying conclusion to this construction mission for the 11 astronauts .
Though Nicholas Patrick and Robert Behnken completed a multitude of other chores during Tuesday night 's spacewalk , including opening valves on an ammonia coolant line they previously installed on Tranquility , a new room that the astronauts connected to the space station last Friday .
" Great job raising the curtains on the bay window to the world , " astronaut Kay Hire called out to the spacewalkers .
" I look forward to the view from inside , " Patrick said .
Mission Control wanted the shutters opened while the spacewalkers were still floating outside so the two men could intercede if something jammed .
Behnken and Patrick stayed a safe 10 feet or more from the windows while the shutters were raised .
The last thing NASA wanted was to have one of them inadvertently kick a window or bang it with a tool bag .
The observation deck is part of Tranquility , a more than $ 380 million addition .
Space shuttle Endeavour delivered the European compartments last week .
The Italian - built dome — 5 feet tall and nearly 10 feet in diameter — is designed to offer sweeping 360 - degree views of the home planet and outer space , as well as the space station itself .
It 's not just for the crew 's viewing pleasure ; a robotic work station will be installed early Thursday , providing direct views for astronauts when they operate the station 's big mechanical arm .
Six trapezoid - shaped windows encircle the dome .
In the middle is the circular window .
During normal operations , the space station crew will be able to keep the round window unshuttered most of the time , along with a couple others .
But the windows facing along the direction the outpost is orbiting will need to be closed , except during robotic operations , to protect the fused silica glass against micrometeorite strikes .
Each window has four panes .
The shutters swung open when the spacewalkers were back inside .
The nearly six - hour excursion ended a little early because of the risk of elevated carbon dioxide levels in Behnken 's suit ; he was fine , but flight controllers did not want to take any chances .
Endeavour and its crew of six will depart the space station Friday and return to Earth on Sunday .
The next shuttle visit has been delayed .
Discovery had been scheduled to blast off in mid-March with spare parts and science experiments , but a string of unusually cold weather stalled preparations .
The launch is now targeted for April 5 .
Only four more shuttle flights remain .

How Ireland Lost Its Faith
There was a time when Irish Catholics might have been delighted to see the pope lavishing attention on their bishops .
On Feb. 15 and 16 , however , when Ireland ’s bishops were at the Vatican to discuss an ongoing child sex abuse scandal , Catholics back home were furious .
Catholics were already upset about Pope Benedict ’s refusal to apologize to the thousands of abuse victims in Ireland or even hint that he would meet with them , as some had requested .
But what really set them off seems to have been the images of their bishops kissing the pope ’s ring .
Photos of the traditional greeting were plastered across broadsheet front pages and TV broadcasts over the following days .
These , combined with images of the Vatican ’s opulent Apostolic Palace — where the bishops met the pope and senior cardinals — as well as the regalia of all those elderly men and the complete absence of lay people or any woman , had a profoundly negative effect .
The response was unqualified rage .
Andrew Madden , the first person in Ireland to go public about his abuse by a priest , described the meetings at the Vatican as " a complete waste of time " and the greatest act of window dressing he had ever seen .
Abuse survivor Marie Collins said it was an insult that the resignation of bishops did n’t even make the agenda .
Additionally , she said it was deplorable that the pope ’s statement was " so far away from accepting that there was a policy of coverup . "
Of course , it ’s not unusual for bishops to kiss the pope ’s ring , and the Vatican has always been heavily male and ornate .
The difference now is that Irish Catholics , after decades of alienation from the church , are finally nearing a breaking point .
Not so very long ago and for the great majority of Irish people , their Catholicism was synonymous with their national identity .
To be Irish was to be Catholic .
It was something of which most Irish were very proud .
In the latter part of the 19th century , the church grew to become the most powerful civic institution on the island , controlling most of Ireland ’s schools and the greater number of its hospitals .
This allowed the church unparalleled influence throughout most of the 20th century in what is now known as the Republic of Ireland .
That continued to be the case until the latter decades of the last century when its influence began to wane due to increased affluence and a better - educated population .
With the events of the last few years , church leaders can no longer ignore the extent to which they ’ve lost control of Irish society .
The most recent scandal has centered on a series of damning government reports into the physical , emotional , and sexual abuse of children by clergy members .
The Murphy Commission report , published last November , found that in Dublin ’s Catholic archdiocese , by far Ireland ’s largest , " clerical child sex abuse was covered up " by church authorities from 1975 to 2004 .
It also found that all four archbishops of Dublin over that period investigated sexual abuse complaints and that many of the auxiliary bishops handled these complaints badly .
None of the four archbishops reported their knowledge of abuse to the police " throughout the 1960s , 1970s or 1980s . "
The report also found that church authorities used the concept of " mental reservation , " which allows clergy to mislead people without being guilty — in the church ’s eyes — of lying , and that , though some courageous priests had brought complaints to their superiors ’ attention , in general there was a " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " policy on the issue .
The Murphy report was been the most widely publicized investigation of sex abuse in Ireland , but it was n’t the first , and it wo n’t be the last .
The first notorious sex - abuse case in Ireland hit the headlines in 1994 , when it was disclosed that church authorities had dealt with a serial abuser , Father Brendan Smyth , by moving him from parish to parish in Ireland , Scotland , and the United States — over a period of 40 years .
The attorney general ’s mishandling of an arrest warrant for Smyth eventually led to the collapse of the Irish government .
More recently , the Ryan Commission report , published last May , found that thousands of children suffered physical and sexual abuse over several decades in residential institutions run by 18 religious congregations during the last century .
To date , almost 14,000 of those victims have been compensated by the Irish state .
And the Murphy Commission is currently investigating the handling of clerical child sex abuse allegations in Cloyne diocese and will publish its results by the end of this year .
Not surprisingly , the combined effects of these sex scandals have driven Irish Catholics away from the church at a time when many were already drifting away .
For instance , according to recent surveys , 43 percent of Irish Catholics attend weekly Mass , a drop of 52 percent since 1973 , though still about twice the average for most Catholic countries in Europe .
Meanwhile , fewer and fewer young men are entering the priesthood .
For people of a certain age , the very idea of an Ireland without Catholic priests is truly beyond imagination .
The bishop of Killaloe , Willie Walsh , recently recalled that of the 50 students in his Leaving Cert class ( equivalent to the U.S. 12th grade ) in 1952 , 20 went on for the priesthood .
In 1961 , Pope John XXIII even said : " Any Christian country will produce a greater or lesser number of priests .
But Ireland , that beloved country , is the most fruitful of mothers in this respect . "
Almost 50 years later the situation is dramatically different .
The archbishop of Dublin , Diarmuid Martin , has said his archdiocese will soon have barely enough priests to serve its 199 parishes .
" We have 46 priests over 80 and only two less than 35 years of age .
In a very short time we will just have the bare number of priests required to have one active priest for each of our 199 parishes , " he said in November .
The average age of Irish Catholic priests today is 63 .
Members of religious congregations have an average age in the early 70s .
Each priest must retire at 75 .
As the Americans say , you do the math !
But even the lack of priests does not completely explain the falling away in religious practice .
That began as far back as the 1960s , when two events heralded the death knell for what has been referred to many times as " the long 19th century of the Irish Catholic Church . "
Those were the Second Vatican Council , when things apparently immutable for all time were seemingly changed overnight , and the introduction of free second - level education as well as the introduction of state university grants in 1967 .
Both produced skeptical Irish Catholics , less credulous than previous generations and demanding more sophisticated answers to age - old questions .
Those answers were not always forthcoming .
In a 2003 article for the Irish Times , Father Vincent Twomey , a retired professor of moral theology at St. Patrick ’s College who studied with Pope Benedict himself at a postgraduate program in Germany , wrote , " Irish writers in the early part of the 20th century … sensed that something was seriously wrong with ‘ traditional Irish Catholicism ’ .
They saw it as narrow - minded , anti-intellectual and rigorist on morality .
They were right . "
In the 1960s , cultural influences also came into play — television for instance .
Irish state television , RTE , began broadcasting in 1961 .
Later in that decade , Oliver Flanagan , a well - known and outspoken politician , stated that " there was no sex in Ireland before television . "
The cultural revolutions of the second half of the 20th century hit Ireland just as hard as they did every other Western country , and so began Ireland ’s culture wars , known as Ireland ’s " moral civil war " and fought between younger liberal elements and the Catholic Church over contraceptives , divorce , and abortion , among other social issues .
Ireland ’s younger and more - educated Catholics began to assert independence from Rome ’s teaching on sexuality , particularly following Pope Paul VI ’s " Humanae Vitae " encyclical in 1968 , which banned all artificial means of contraception .
Many Irish Catholic women ignored " Humanae Vitae . "
They took contraceptive pills and found that the heavens did n’t fall .
Doctors got around Irish law , often with the tacit approval of priests , by prescribing the pill as a regulator for the menstrual cycle rather than as a contraceptive .
In 1979 , contraception finally became legally available in Ireland , but only to married couples and on prescription .
It was 1992 before contraceptives became freely available to everyone .
That same year , coincidentally , the church had its first major sex scandal when it was revealed that the bishop of Galway , Eamonn Casey , had a 17 - year - old son ; a favorite T - shirt at the time featured a condom and the caption , " Just in Casey . "
Divorce was also an extremely pivotal issue , not becoming legal until 1995 .
Abortion remains banned in Ireland despite referendums in 1983 , 1992 , and 2002 .
Although opinion poll after opinion poll over recent years has indicated a great majority now favor legalizing it , Ireland ’s politicians run scared from yet another bitter and divisive abortion referendum campaign .
With Irish society largely lost to it , the church ’s final frontier may be the primary - school system , of which it controls 92 percent .
But now , the child sex abuse scandals , along with substantial immigration into Ireland over the past 10 years , have significantly increased pressure toward more pluralist control of primary education , something which — to the surprise of many — the Catholic bishops now say they favor .
Archbishop Martin even called the Catholic control of schools a " historical hangover that does n’t reflect the realities of the times and is , in addition , in many ways detrimental to the possibility of maintaining a true Catholic identity in Catholic schools . "
If this is the case , it seems the last great battle of Ireland ’s moral civil wars — that over control of education — may be avoided .
And the Catholic Church in Ireland will continue its retreat from a position of unquestioned dominance in society for more than a century and a half , to a more humble role on its margins .
" In the painful solitude of the desert , the church must learn how to return to its fundamental mission , " Archbishop Martin has said .
Some might suggest that is exactly where it belongs .
Republicans are starting to sour on GOP closet case Mark Kirk
In the radio ad , which aired Monday on WGN - AM and WBBM - AM , Martin attributes a " solid rumor that Kirk is a homosexual " to conservative Republican businessman Jack Roeser .
Martin's ad also claims that Raymond True , the chairman of the conservative Republican Assembly of Lake County organization , says Kirk has surrounded himself with homosexuals .
The ad says Kirk should address the rumors .
Eric Elk , the campaign manager for Kirk , said in a statement that " the ad is not true and is degrading to the political process .
The people of Illinois deserve better . "
Pat Brady , chairman of the Illinois Republican Party , issued a statement disavowing Martin 's ad .
" His statements today are consistent with his history of bizarre behavior and often times hate - filled speech which has no place in the Illinois Republican Party , " Brady said .
" Mr. Martin will no longer be recognized as a legitimate Republican candidate by the Illinois Republican Party . "
And just in case Fortas still refused to quit , Hoover held additional ammunition in reserve : the dubious claim of " an active and aggressive homosexual who has been an informant in the Washington Field Office " and who " over the years has provided a great deal of reliable information " that " he had ' balled ' with Abe Fortas on several occasions prior to Mr. Fortas becoming a Justice of the United States Supreme Court . "
Hoover did n't need to release it .
Fortas announced his resignation the morning of May 15 .
Champion News proudly endorses this event .
We all need to spread the word near and far about the importance of stopping the gun-grabbing , cap & trading , homosexual agenda promoting , partial birth abortion advocating Mark Kirk .
It ’s time for conservatives and tea partiers to get serious .
If an ultra-liberal like Mark Kirk coasts through with the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate ( and that ’s how it ’s shaping up ) , the conservative / tea party movement is going to look like a paper tiger .
If conservatives wo n’t rally to stop Mark Kirk , what battle will they join ?
The good news is there are serious conservatives out there .
This Will County Tea Party Alliance is made up of real doers .
This is the same group that hosted America ’s largest Tea Party Express Rally over the summer ( over 10,000 people ) in New Lenox .
And over 1,000 attended their forum with the candidates for Governor on November 4th .
Now that Christmas is over , it ’s time to light a fire under our conservative friends .
Tell them the time for playing pretend and partying with Mark Kirk ’s Log Cabin buddies is over .
Illinois has enough enablers .
We need Republican leaders .
The February 2nd Primary Election is just five weeks away .
If conservatives wo n’t fight , Mark Kirk wins - by a lot .
That ’s a guarantee .
The Will County Tea Party Alliance gets it .
Now it ’s time to educate the rest of Illinois .
Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) and Mitch " Miss " McConnell ( R - KY ) have been working very hard to clear the Republican field in Illinois for Rep.
Mark Kirk , despite all the trouble the Inside the Beltway GOP has gotten into by interfering with primary elections , especially on behalf of mainstream conservatives like Kirk when they 're being challenged by far right - wing teabaggers .
Why would Graham and McConnell stick their necks out for Kirk ?
According to another Republican candidate , Andy Martin , Kirk , like Graham and McConnell , is a closet case Hate - filled speech has no place in the Republican Party ?
Really ?
Yesterday I spent many hours on planes and in airports returning to L.A. from Albania .
I had lots of time to re-read historian Rick Perstein 's brilliant tome , Nixonland and saw that even back then Republicans sought to undermine their rivals by playing the " gay card . "
Henry Kissinger , then National Security Advisor , and Nixon ran foreign policy without even keeping Secretary of State William Rogers in the loop .
Nevertheless , it drove Kissinger crazy that Rogers had the title , if not the power , he coveted .
He did many thing to undermine Rogers including , according to Perlstein " once spreading the rumor that Rogers was a ' fag ' who kept a hot , young stud in a Georgetown town house .
" Later , when Nixon was eager to appoint Supreme Court judges , he engineered the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas by having FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover -- himself a closeted gay Republican -- threaten to expose Fortas as having had sex with another man .
Perlstein : Is Kirk gay ?
People " in the know " in DC gay circles say he is but that he was never outed because he has n't been a hypocrite on gay issues -- or at least not a real virulent one .
On April 29 , 2009 , for example , he voted for H.R. 1913 , a hate crimes prevention act , one of only 18 Republicans to vote yes .
In fact , the other commonly well - known Republican closet cases -- David Dreier ( R- CA ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Patrick McHenry ( R-NC ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R- CA ) , Aaron Schock ( R- IL ) and Adrian Smith ( R - NE ) -- voted against the bill , opening themselves up to the hypocrisy charges often leveled at them .
But it does n't matter if Kirk is gay or not -- unless you 're a teabagging bigot or a primitive religionist fanatic , a segment that makes up a substantial part of the GOP base .
Or if you are working for the Navy and forced to investigate him for violations of DADT , since he's in the Naval reserves .
William Rogers was n't gay , but that did n't stop Kissinger .
Fortas was a married man but he never had any children and ... he played the violin .
Truth does n't get in the way in these kinds of matters ; smearing someone in this manner is usually enough to accomplish the smearer 's goal .
And most Republican politicians do n't really care if someone is gay or not .
Even when the entire GOP congressional leadership -- from Hastert to Boehner and Blunt -- were aware that Mark Foley ( R - FL ) was not just gay but molesting young male congressional pages , they urged him to keep running for re-election when he tried to resign , fearful that a Democrat could win the seat .
Similarly , the NRSC recruited barely closeted Charlie Crist to run for the open Florida Senate seat .
Much earlier , even after Mississippi Republican Congressman Jon Hinson admitted he had had engaged in inappropriate behavior with a male undercover cop at the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery -- excusing himself based on alcoholism -- he was actually re-elected to his seat !
It was n't until he was arrested ( in 1981 ) for two much bigger sins in the eyes of Republican southerners -- having sex with Black men and taking the passive role -- that he was finally forced to resign .
( David Rosen 's new book , Sex Scandal America -- Politics & the Ritual of Public Shaming , goes into some depth about the culture of outings in Washington , DC . )
Meanwhile , teabaggers will be rallying against Kirk on Tuesday , January 5 in Woodbine , near Homer Glen , Illinois .

Women who suffer from chronically low levels of sexual desire may soon be able to fix the problem with a pill .
In a review of three recent clinical trials , scientists determined that after 24 weeks of treatment with the drug flibanserin , women reported significantly more sexual desire and an increase in satisfactory sexual encounters .
The drug was initially developed as an antidepressant , and although it failed to alter mood in trials , researchers noticed it seemed to be helping women with low sex drives .
How the drug works is not yet entirely clear , but it is known to alter the levels of serotonin in the brain .
Although more trials are needed before flibanserin could become available commercially , it shows promise as the first drug demonstrated to treat low libido in women — the most common sexual problem in females — by targeting the brain .
Today I ’m going to show you how to make the awesomest “ regular ” ( not flavored or stuffed or anything ) pancakes you will ever eat ( I ’m not
kidding , I tried this recipe yesterday morning and I was blown away –they ’re better than any pancakes I ’ve had before , and I ’m quite a pancake aficionado so that ’s saying something ) .
What really makes this recipe special are two little tricks that are occasionally used
in restaurants that serve top- quality pancakes and will end up making all the difference when you make yours .
Plus , they ’re very easy to do and do n’t require any expensive or hard - to - find ingredients or equipment .
As an added bonus I ’ve picked my favorite “ customized ” pancake recipe for you to try as well ( it involves cheese and peaches–it ’s awesome , trust me ) .
Let ’s get started .
The greatest pancake recipe in the world
The two things that really make the difference here are how he handles the eggs and the addition of the malted milk powder , plus I love that nifty little trick that solves the problem of cold pancakes ( cold pancakes wo n’t melt butter 🙁 )
I ’ve always had where you have to put the pancakes you just cooked aside so you can cook more , but by the time you ’re done cooking most of your pancakes will be cold , so how do you keep all the batches that came before the last one warm ?
Check this out , it ’s only about 3 minutes :
Bonus : Cinnamon - Peach Cottage Cheese Pancakes
Cheese ?!
Yes , cheese .
Cottage cheese ?
Yes , cottage cheese … and cinnamon … and peaches … and butter …and maple syrup … and then you have an orgasm .
Look , they ’re good , I promise , just at least have a look at the recipe before you pass judgment :
Intro and Ingredients :
Alright this will take about 10 minutes of prep and 30 minutes of cooking time , so yeah you ’ll have to make do with pop-tarts if you ’re late for work , but otherwise they ’re not that difficult or time - consuming .
This makes around 12 pancakes , and you ’ll need the following ingredients :
1 cup of cottage cheese
1 shredded peach
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
4 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1/2 cup of milk
2 tablespoons of white sugar
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup of all - purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon of baking soda
a pinch of salt
Directions :
Mix the cottage cheese , milk , butter , vanilla , eggs , and shredded peach in a large bowl .
Then , combine the sugar , flour , baking soda , salt , and cinnamon in a small bowl .
Stir the second mixture in the small bowl ( flour , sugar , etc. ) into the cottage cheese mixture in the large bowl just enough so that they ’re combined .
Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium - high heat .
Plop the batter in by large spoonfuls ( a 1/3 cup measuring cup as used in the first recipe works well ) onto the griddle , and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry .
Flip , and cook until browned on the other side , then simply repeat with remaining batter .
Now , just slather them with butter , douse them with maple syrup ( I hope you ’re using real Vermont maple syrup–please , please , please do n’t use the fake stuff made almost entirely out of corn syrup , the real stuff from real Maple trees is more expensive but it ’s so totally worth it , I promise ) , and then proceed to gain 5 pounds and collapse into a diabetic coma for 12 hours afterwards .
Awesome , huh ?
P.S. If you want a recommendation and example of good - quality Vermont maple syrup , check this stuff out : Highland Sugarworks 100 % Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup ( Grade A is the best grade , and I prefer the Dark Amber over the lighter stuff because it has a bit stronger flavor to it ) –if you ’ve got a Whole Foods nearby you , they ’ll have all sorts of high - quality maple syrups to choose from , and even my local Albertson ’s has some , so most grocery stores should have at least one or two brands of the real stuff .

The investors , who have not been revealed but Barclays said consisted of one US and one UK fund , and the bank will be paid from the assets ' cashflow .
Mr Lucas said : " What we are trying to do is get a stable return profile for shareholders .
We rely on those cashflows , so why not undertake a restructuring to show we rely on them and maximise shareholder value ? "
George Soros , the hedge - fund billionaire who made a fortune from speculating on sterling 's weakness in the early 1990s , has warned that the outlook for the UK economy is " bleak . "
Click here for a transcript of the interview
In an interview with me this morning , he warned that growth prospects for the UK and US were poor -- because households and governments in both countries had borrowed far too much and would have to repay their debts in coming years .
Soros said that the prospects for the UK were worse than the US , because the British government is approaching the limits of what it can comfortably borrow from investors to finance public spending .
He added - which will not come as a surprise to readers of this column - that the sources of the UK 's financial weakness were excessive borrowing by individuals for house purchases and a financial sector that had also borrowed and lent too much .
Mr Soros - who was one of the few financiers to predict the 2008 financial crash - says that the UK and the US face many years of low growth .
Citing Japan 's fifteen years of recession that started in the early 1990s , he said that the return of normal economic conditions in the US and UK was happening perhaps twice as fast as in Japan - which meant , he said , that anaemic growth may persist in America for up to seven years or so .
He said that the British government would have to tighten spending within the next year .
However he also warned that cutting public spending too soon could tip the UK back into recession .
In that sense he probably can't be seen as backing either the " cut-early " Tories or the " delay - cutting " Labour Party .
He also made a number of other fascinating observations :
1 ) he said China had a serious problem of incipient inflation and should allow its currency to appreciate ;
2 ) while welcoming President Obama 's proposal to limit the size of banks and limit their speculative activities , he said that the reforms did not go far enough ;
3 ) he would insist that banks that engage in so - called proprietary trading - or speculating in financial markets for their own account - should hold as much capital as typical hedge funds , which would mean that the likes of Goldman Sachs would have to massively increase the capital they hold as a buffer against potential losses ;
4 ) like President Sarkozy yesterday , he talked about the need for a new " Bretton Woods " - or a revised system of controls on exchange rates and capital flows that would phase out the dangerous imbalance between the excessive saving and reserves of China and Asia and the huge indebtedness of much of the west .
But Ms. von der Leyen seems to have the swelling support of middle - class Germans who can no longer afford to have a woman stay home and raise children .
Above all , she voices no doubt that Germany would be better off if more women were like her .
“ I know I am a good mother , ” she says , smiling .
She was not always so certain .
Back when she had three children and was a part - time doctor trying to work around a village kindergarten in northern Germany that closed at 1 p.m. , her husband got a scholarship to Stanford University .
The family moved to California for four years , carrying emotional baggage .
“ We arrived from Germany ridden with guilt , ” she recalls .
“ I was worried about being a bad mother .
My husband was worried about whether he should work even harder . ”
The years in California , where she studied health economics and did research at Stanford , were a turning point .
“ It was the first time that I was not criticized as a mother for wanting to work or as a professional for having children , ” she said .
“ On the contrary , the attitude in America was :
You have children , that ’s great .
Now get to work because you have to pay for college . ”
“ It was liberating , ” she said .
So liberating that she had another four children and in 2001 , went into politics .
A year later , she was family minister of her home state of Lower Saxony , and in 2005 Chancellor Angela Merkel brought her to Berlin .
Ms. von der Leyen became a national star , overtaking many in her party who had served years in hopes of a similar career vault .
Since then , she has striven to remake her country somewhat in her image .
If Germany does not accommodate educated women who want children and a career , those women will quit Germany .
“ When the signal is : If you have children , you ’re out , then women who want to work have two options :
Either they have no children or they emigrate , ” she said .
She hopes the “ female brain drain ” is averted .
“ Things are changing dramatically .
When my daughters are grown up , they will say : ‘ Where was the problem ? ” ’
Ein Mitarbeiter des NDR hat offenbar eine Rechtsanwaltskanzlei damit beauftragt , den Hamburger GEZ - Kritiker Bernd Höcker abzumahnen .
Der Streitwert wurde auf satte 50.000 Euro angesetzt .
Gilt hier etwa die Devise : Lieber eine Person bestrafen und damit Tausende erziehen ?
In seinem Blog „ Meine Zwangsanmeldung “ sprach er sich bislang sehr offen gegen die Methoden der Gebühreneinzugszentrale ( GEZ ) aus .
Im Schreiben der gegnerischen Rechtsanwaltskanzlei wurde er aufgefordert alle Teile seines Blogs zu löschen , wo er über vergangene Auseinandersetzungen mit dem Norddeutschen Rundfunk ( NDR ) berichtet .
( Zitat von gulli.com )
Wie gulli.com oder MMnews heute berichten , ist das eher streitbare Weblog „ Meine Zwangsanmeldung “ seit dem 31 .
Dezember offline .
Mir selbst fehlt der juristische Hintergrund , um die Angelegenheit inhaltlich kommentieren zu können , auch wenn die Pressekammer des Landgerichts Hamburg , an der das Urteil gefällt wurde , den meisten hinreichend bekannt sein dürfte .
In den Kommentaren wird darauf hingewiesen , dass ich damit wohl knapp den falschen Richter „ getroffen “ habe .
Sorry .
Zur Erklärung des Weblogs .
Ob die „ Kunstaktion “ , zu der dort anschliessend aufgefordert wird , der Sache dienlich ist halte ich allerdings für eher zweifelhaft .
Peter Curran meets the mathematicians of the Isaac Newton Institute of Mathematics in Cambridge , where there are blackboards in the lifts and the loos .
Series in which Peter Curran visits members of the many and varied disciplines of science , from astronomy to zoology , to explore their habitat , customs , rituals and beliefs .
Peter meets the mathematicians of the Isaac Newton Institute of Mathematics in Cambridge .
There are blackboards in the lifts and in the loos to encourage communication between visiting professors , but not everyone shares their mathematical insight .
A few members of the mathematical tribe do wear the same t- shirt for six months and it's often inside - out , but not all the stereotypes hold true .
Among these mathematicians , Peter finds passion , humour and an enviable sense of purpose .
Did anyone expect this Obama character to be such a card ?
I seem to remember speeches and quips about judgment and its importance in leadership .
No quibbles about that , it ’s true and i would take a man of good judgment over one of ossified , bureaucratic experience in most cases but especially situations of threat or upheaval .
As an American , i should be well - trained in this game ; i’ve eaten enough Big Macs to know that they look nothing like the advertising picture used to entice me .
Lukewarm , grey “ meat . ”
Ah yes , move over Big Dog , Big Mac is running the show now .
I think that i’m supposed to be comforted by his “ surge ” of federal air marshals .
What is it with this guy and surges ?
See that problem , a surge will fix it .
Hell , only a surge will fix it .
I feel the same way about hammers , but i do n’t act on it .
There ’s also a time for duck tape and plumber ’s strap .
And as fun and challenging as doing a job with the wrong tools is , if money ’s no object it ’s stupid .
Buy a router , a set of fine chisels or even one of those 1000 - tool Dremel sets .
Nope , hammer it is .
We do n’t have time for anything but a hammer – fuck , man , we ’re in a “ race against time ” itself .
Do you know how many billions live in hovels on this planet ?
Every one of them is a possible suicide bomber heading into the pipeline .
They ’re coming to get us , those damned tired and poor huddled masses are after us …yearning to make us eat halal !
Our only hope is to covertly militarize civilian air travel .
This is the “ judgment ” we got .
Just what are these air marshals going to do in the event that another underwear bomber strikes , or there ’s an irritated man of Middle - Eastern descent complaining in row 27 ?
Start shooting in crowded airplane ?
Go all Chuck Norris on some bitches ?
Wait , i’ve got it .
They ’ll be armed with box cutters .
Everybody knows that a few hundred people in an airplane are no match for a couple of guys with razor blades .
Let ’s take stock of Obama ’s first big test in the War on Terror® :
Hapless , depressed Nigerian attempts to blow off his own legs in the hopes that it will kill the few people around him and maybe pop a hole in the side of a plane .
Media and power players have a collective freak out .
President plays it cool .
Media and power players throw a collective tantrum .
President freaks out .
We must have new regulations to prevent another “ systemic failure . ”
We must black - list certain nationals .
We need undercover gunslingers .
Christ , what would happen if al Qaeda actually scored a hit ?
Oh yeah , they did .
They killed seven CIA agents in Afghanistan .
Double crossed the masters of deception , walked right up to ’em and and boom .
Maybe the President needs to send a surge of air marshals to protect American lives in Afghanistan .
Frankly , the Afghan event looks far more dangerous to our prospects in the War on Terror® than the burnt weeny terror plot .
In that we have a double agent who had built his credibility with several pieces of actionable intelligence .
Drone targets .
Theoretically , this guy gave up al Qaeda baddies , which probably amounts to settling Afghan scores on the CIA ’s dime .
I wonder if he ever sent the drones to a wedding party ?
From the sound of it — though it might just be institutional pit fighting — the CIA does n’t really know what ’s going on in Afghanistan ; ergo the agency probably relies on local sources .
Exactly how reliable are these local sources and “ allies ” ?
I ’m trying not to worry , because our man of sound judgment has a surge for that , too .
Maybe we ’ll have better luck in Yemen , but until then we need to do everything we can to stop another near - tragedy .
There are innocent lives at stake that can only be protected by agents of the Commander - in - Chief ( who reserves the right to indefinitely detain and torture whomsoever he pleases ) .
Thank god we ’ve got a guy with good judgment keeping us safe .
Yessir , a steady hand at the wheel …at least until a bunch of cowardly Republican pundits and politicians start yelling .
Then he screams and runs like a little girl .
Why does n’t the Big Mac drop a surge on the Republicans ?
The Church of Scientology is planning its first above - the - line advertising push in Australia in a bid to turn around its public image .
TV and cinema are among the media being contemplated .
A spokesman for the controversial organisation confirmed to Mumbrella that the campaign is being planned but said it was dependent on the campaign receiving funding from the US .
She referred inquiries to Sydney agency Frontier Media , which declined to comment .

In November , independent Senator Nick Xenophon accused the Church of being a “ criminal organisation ” .
Prime Minster Kevin Rudd also told the Herald Sun “ I share some of those concerns ” , but has reserved further judgement pending the review of material provided by Senator Xenophon .
At the time the Church released a statement in response to Xenophon .
“ Senator Xenophon ’s attempt to marginalise Scientologists by saying that they should not be believed , is fascistic and violates freedom of speech and the right to religious beliefs , ” the statement said .
Gerry Armstrong , another vocal critic of the Church and a former member , is travelling to Australia to support Senator Xenophon ’s campaign for an inquiry into the Church .

Alvin and the Chipmunks
Three musical chipmunks are discovered by an aspiring songwriter who wants to use their amazing singing abilities to become famous .
There 's an igneous rock called peridotite that can sponge carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in mineral form .
Weirdly , almost no one is talking about it .
Advertisement
Peridotite is n't one of the better - known rocks , but it 's got a number of properties that could place it right at the center of the climate - change conversation .
Some quick facts :
1 ) Peridotite is one of the most abundant rocks in the Earth 's mantle , and exists in surface deposits all over the world .
Advertisement
2 ) When peridotite reacts with carbon dioxide , it forms a solid mineral not unlike limestone , trapping the carbon in the molecular structure of the rock .
3 ) Geologists believe there 's enough peridotite in Oman alone to absorb four billion tons of carbon each year .

4 ) Columbia University recently received a modest federal grant to study peridotitic reactions .
Aside from that , practically no one has expressed any interest in the rock 's potential .
An excellent essay by Sam Kornell in Miller - McCune goes into more detail about peridotite 's odd elision from the environmentalist dialogue .
The process of storing greenhouse gases in some form that wo n't clog the atmosphere , known as " sequestration , " is something scientists and policymakers have been talking about for a while .
That discussion , though , is largely focused on capturing emissions as they 're produced and storing them as a gas , an expensive stopgap measure that is n't guaranteed to work .
Advertisement
Last year , a research team at Columbia 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory determined that the natural peridotite reserves in Oman are removing at least ten thousand tons of atmospheric carbon each year , and maybe as much as a hundred thousand tons .
It 's not enough to offset the annual thirty billion tons of carbon that human activity introduces into the atmosphere , but there 's a lot more peridotite lying around , and whatever carbon gets incorporated into the rock structure will stay there for good .
The biggest problem with peridotite — and likely the reason more people have n't considered it as a possible supplement to emissions - reduction measures — is that the gas - to - solid reaction takes a long time to happen .
Millennia , in fact .
The Department of Energy briefly funded some research into speeding up this process in 2003 , but the issue was dropped soon after .
Sam Krevor , a doctoral student at Columbia , has said that there 's no physical law preventing an expedited reaction process ; all that 's needed is the time , and the resources , to figure out a way to bring it about .

Since then , there 's been little activity on the peridotite front until this past September , when about $ 300,000 of federal money went toward a Columbia study on carbon capture in minerals .
According to a recent DoE press release , the project will look for carbonation catalysts and encourage positive - feedback cycles in peridotitic and basaltic rocks , and " support at least 2 graduate students during the research efforts . "
Three hundred grand is n't a huge amount of money , but if it gets two more people talking about the vast , untapped usefulness of these rocks , it 's a start .
A Rock That Helps Out In a Hard Place [ Miller - McCune ]
Technicians seeking the source of a leak of radioactive tritium at the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant have found concentrations in groundwater there that were three times higher than what was discovered last week , a plant spokesman said Monday .
Tritium was measured at 70,500 picocuries per liter , which the spokesman , Rob Williams , characterized as a low level .
The highest level discovered so far “ does not present a risk to public health or safety whatsoever , ” he said in a statement .
But it does put Vermont Yankee over the threshold at which it is obligated to make a report to federal regulators within 30 days , and say what it will do about the problem .
The limit , 30,000 picocuries , was crossed on Sunday .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already been at the site to study the problem , and Vermont Yankee is well into an attempt to find the leak and map the pollution .
Despite being killed by NBC , Top Gear USA lives on at The History Channel .
Sources there tell us they 've ordered between 10 and 12 episodes and they 're currently interviewing candidates for the hosts .

If you 'll remember , NBC killed the idea for a Top Gear USA show starring Carolla , racer Tanner Faust and dapper doily designer Eric Stromer at about the same time they realized the Carpocalypse was gonna kill any chance they 'd have of advertising .
Also , there was the whole Knight Rider fiasco .

The History Channel 's an interesting choice for Top Gear .
The positive is they 've got a lot of cash to throw around thanks to their very high net worth viewers .
The negative is it still wo n't be the UK version .
Still , there 's good people involved in the production of the show .
In fact , much of the impetus for our decision to provide a bounty for the unaired pilot of the NBC version of Top Gear USA ( more on that later ) was because we knew from our sources that History had picked up the rights and was actively working on production .

Now we hear on top of this is news Carolla announced on his CarCast show that he 's up for one of the three hosting jobs and we 're crossing our fingers someone we know very well makes it too .
Carolla even mentions our bounty ( they call us one of those " odd sites " ) at around 17:30 in the podcast .
Are you hungry for awesome “ go - to ” Android applications to put on your shiny new Droid ?
Or maybe on your dusty G1 ?
Well one of the largest restaurant review sites in all the world – Yelp – today launched their Android application on the market .
Sounds delicious but not quite nom - nom - worthy just yet .
The application is free which comes as a nice alternative to the competing $ 10 Zagat app , but in this case you get what you pay for .
You can search for restaurants and businesses nearby , call them or map them with the press of a button , and read reviews and tips from Yelp contributors .
Unfortunately the interactive features are missing .
You ca n’t submit your own reviews , pictures , tips and other material from your Android Phone .
This is kind of a bummer because when you ’re AT the restaurant and have JUST had a delicious meal or maybe just seen the chef put his hands down his pants before cooking your meal …
THAT is the best time to submit your review .
It is top of mind .
It is happening at that moment .
It encourages participation and creates more honest feedback .
I have no doubt this functionality will come at some point in the near future , afterall these capabilities are already found on the iPhone .
It ’s more just a matter of time … as Eric ( Product Manager ) even promises updates before the new year :
The Yelp for Android app is the 5th member of Yelp ’s mobile family joining the iPhone , Blackberry , Palm Pre and WAP .
Like all new Yelp mobile applications , we focus on releasing a useful and awesome product first and then add more bells and whistles over time .
We particularly wanted to make sure that all you Droid lovers got your wish answered this holiday season and had Yelp guiding your way as you shop , travel and be merry .
You can plan for more updates before the New Year , but immediate features include : * By leveraging location - aware technology , the Yelp for Android app determines your current location and then lets you search for nearby businesses , read reviews and access a moveable Google map that enables you to easily zoom in / out on a location and redefine your search based on that geographic area .
* In addition to searching nearby businesses , you can also filter reviews by “ Price , ” “ Open Now , ” “ Special Offers ” and browse “ Hot on Yelp ”
* Like all our other mobile applications , Yelp for Android works everywhere Yelp is available ( US , Canada , UK and Ireland )
* It is available for download on Android Market via your handset .

Hard to imagine a better evening for candidate Sarah Palin .
She was paid a reported $ 100,000 to insult Obama in front of a cheering crowd of rich tea-partiers who broke out in chants of " Run , Sarah , Run ! "
And because she has n't declared her candidacy yet , she gets to keep the money !*
No wonder she quit her annoying government job .

* “ Avatar ” earns $ 1.84 billion worldwide
* Sci-fi film biggest international release of all time
* Harrison Ford ’s new film bombs ( Recasts , updates foreign sales for “ Avatar ” and details of new releases in North America )
LOS ANGELES , Jan 24 ( Reuters ) - “ Titanic ” just hit an iceberg named “ Avatar . ”
James Cameron ’s sci- fi spectacular replaced his maritime melodrama as the biggest international release of all time during the weekend and is on the verge of claiming its worldwide crown , which also includes North American receipts , distributor 20th Century Fox said on Sunday .
The News Corp NWSA.O - owned studio said " Avatar " has sold $ 1.841 billion worth of tickets worldwide during its unbroken six - week reign , and was a day or so away from surpassing the seemingly insurmountable $ 1.843 billion racked up by " Titanic " in 1997 - 1998 .
The international portion stands at $ 1.288 billion , eclipsing the $ 1.242 billion haul of “ Titanic . ”
In North America , “ Avatar ” may have to wait up to two weeks to sink the $ 601 million total of “ Titanic , ” Fox said .
Moviegoers in the United States and Canada have chipped in $ 552.8 million , enough to replace 2008 ’s “ The Dark Knight ” ( $ 533 million ) as the second - biggest movie of all time .
Data are not adjusted for inflation , and " Avatar " ticket sales got an additional boost from premium pricing for 3 - D screenings .
Imax Corp IMAX.O said its big - screen engagements have sold a record $ 134 million worth of tickets worldwide .
The biggest movie of all time in North America -- adjusted for inflation -- is 1939 ’s “ Gone with the Wind , ” with sales of almost $ 1.5 billion , according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo .
“ Avatar ” ranks No. 26 by that measure .
“ AVATAR ” RULES IN FRANCE , CHINA
During the latest weekend , “ Avatar ” earned $ 36 million in North America and $ 107 million from 111 international markets , far outpacing other offerings .
It led the field in at least 29 foreign markets , including France ( $ 123 million to date ) , China ( $ 102 million ) , Germany ( $ 96 million ) , Russia ( $ 95 million ) and Britain ( $ 93 million ) .
In North America , “ Avatar ” was trailed by the new supernatural action thriller “ Legion ” at No. 2 with $ 18.2 million , while the Denzel Washington drama “ The Book of Eli ” slipped to No. 3 with $ 17 million in its second weekend .
" Legion , " released by Sony Corp 's 6758 .
TSNE .N Screen Gems budget label , cost about $ 25 million to make , and played primarily to men , the studio said .
Paul Bettany , Lucas Black and Tyrese Gibson star in the tale of an of - the - way diner that becomes the unlikely battleground for the survival of the human race .
" Eli , " a similarly themed apocalyptic drama released by Time Warner Inc's TWX.N Warner Bros .
Pictures on behalf of independent producer Alcon Entertainment , has earned $ 62 million after 10 days .
Two other films opened in the top - 10 : Fox ’s Dwayne Johnson family film “ The Tooth Fairy ” at No. 4 with a promising $ 14.5 million , and the Harrison Ford medical drama “ Extraordinary Measures ” at No. 7 with a disappointing $ 7 million .
" Extraordinary Measures " is the debut release of CBS Corp's CBSa . N CBS Films , which said its fact - based storyline about a father trying to save the lives of his children made it a tough sell .
Older audiences in the Midwest and mountain areas were the primary demographic , the studio said .
Fox said “ Tooth Fairy ” played well across the board , despite or because of its depiction of former wrestler Johnson , a.k.a .
“ The Rock ” in a tutu and wings .
“ It ’s a very sweet , wonderful message movie , ” said Chris Aronson , Fox ’s senior vice - president of domestic distribution .

Girl Rubs Her Boobs on Glass During Hockey Game ( Video )
One of the perks that comes with sitting front row at a hockey game is banging on the glass as the players skate past .
The boards also serve as an applause device , so any time something is worth cheering for , you can bang your little palms out on the glass .
It ’s louder and it ’s a good way to try and get the attention of your favorite players .
Well , if I had glass seats at this Ottawa Senators / Montreal Canadiens game , I would have been pounding on the glass in applause for the gratuitous pair of melons I would have seen .
As the final seconds ticked off the clock of the second period , a young puma stood up in her front row seats and started waving mercilessly , announcing the imminent presence of her loins .
Waving and shrieking was n’t working to get everyone ’s attention and she was n’t willing to break her nails slapping the glass , so she went ahead with the ultimate attention grabber : show the players just how cold it was sitting so close to the ice .
Yes , you read into that correct .
The most nudity at a hockey game since Cuba Gooding Jr. Unfortunately , you ca n’t see from the video , but you ’re more than welcome to hit up your favorite ‘ leisure ’ site after .

When the the Marines currently stacked up in Afghanistan 's Helmand province waiting for a long - planned offensive against the Taliban finally make their move , they 'll be coming with a powerful new weapon that looks like a cross between a tank and hell 's own backhoe .
The Assault Breacher Vehicle , or ABV , has been in the works since the late 1990s , and it combines the brawn of an Abram 's tank and its 1,500 horsepower engine with a specially designed 15 - foot wide plow to safely clear the minefields and improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) that the Taliban have laid around Marjah in preparation for the assault .
The heavily armored breacher barely shudders when a typical mine detonates on its plow , and when the plow is n't sufficient for the job , the breachers also carry over 5,000 pounds of specially designed explosives that can be fired into mine fields and safely detonate their deadly contents at a distance .
The behmoths were first rolled into combat service in December , but Marjah promises to be the stiffest challenge yet for a platform that the Marines hope is the latest answer to the mines and other hidden explosives that have proved the greatest dangers to infantry in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
In particular , it 's expected that they 'll reduce the need for combat engineers to make their way into mine fields and set clearing charges by hand .
The $ 3.75 million machines are so valuable at this point that they are n't operated outside of bases unless an even more powerful tank recovery vehicle – aka a big tow truck – is n't along to drag home the 70 - ton breacher if anything goes wrong .
The main body of the breacher is built on the General Dynamics chassis that is used for the Abrams , with Pearson Engineering of the UK providing the specially designed plow and the other mine - clearing accessories that the Marines are looking forward to using in Helmand .
Video of the breacher in action ( warning : cheesy rock music accompanies the video ) .

Bill Gates and others first envisioned that tablet computers would be the future of computing for everyone .
So far , they have only caught on in niches , such as with e-readers or in specialized industries including healthcare or construction .
Apple Inc.'s iPad wo n't take tablets mainstream , but it will help legitimize and drive a new , fast - growing niche of " media tablets , " one analyst said on Tuesday .
Market research firm ABI defines media tablets as touchscreen PCs with either Intel x86 or ARM processors , screens of between 5 and 11 inches in size , Wi-Fi connectivity and video and gaming capabilities .
That gives them full - fledged entertainment capabilities that e-readers such as Amazon 's Kindle lacks , said ABI analyst Jeff Orr in an interview .
Moreover , these capabilities , such as watching videos , Web surfing , using Facebooking or IM and reading e-mails , would be done primarily at home , Orr said .
That subtle but key point differentiates media tablets significantly from the most other recent stab at tablets for consumers , Mobile Internet Devices , or MIDs .
As the name implies , MIDs unsuccessfully tried to leverage their keyboard - less portability to attract the growing class of digital nomads .
But only 1 million MIDs shipped worldwide last year , ABI says .
ABI expects media tablets to zoom past MIDs this year .
Media tablets will gain popularity in developed nations with strong access to wired and wireless broadband , and consumers with an " early adopter mentality , " Orr said .
Translation : Expect them to thrive in the U.S. and Canada , western Europe , Japan and South Korea , but nowhere else .
Even limiting to those geographies , Orr forecasts that 4 million media tablets will be sold this year .
That number should grow to 57 million in 2015 , Orr said with confidence .
" It 's about middle - of - the - course , not too aggressive , " he said of the projected sales .
He declined to comment on which models or brands would take significant market share .
Orr says the growth of media tablets wo n't cannibalize netbook growth , which Orr says will continue to be strong in 2010 as vendors bring out sub - $ 200 , and even sub -$ 150 , netbooks overseas .
Media tablets may hurt dedicated e-readers like the Kindle , though he said that market , even without the iPad 's arrival , was not destined " for hockey - stick growth . "

Slackware is the most stripped down and UNIX - like of Linux distributions and is designed to be a workhorse for developers or sysadmins , who do not want " to be met with GUI greeters , setup wizards , beginner - oriented defaults , and enabled - by - default automatic updates . "
What you get from Slackware is a clean system that expects more of the user , at the command line and in the configuration process .
There are virtues to this approach .
As Patrick Volkerding , the guiding light of Slackware , sees it : " I think the more you try to second guess the user , the more you put up barriers .
So we like to keep things uncomplicated as much as possible . "
Slackware is n't for everyone , and will never win the race for the Linux desktop , where fancy gizmos , music players , office suites and games are at a premium , but works for users who want " a system that makes a good server - where you are n't even required to install X if you do n't want it - or a good desktop workstation if you do a full installation with KDE " or Xfce or Fvwm or Windowmaker or Fluxbox .
The masters of Slack Slackware does n't have a picturesque , simple - choice , resource - hogging GUI installer , but for all that , many would argue that Slackware is just as easy to install , that the installer has more clarity than most , is more flexible , and that it is easier to customise a Slackware installation for the precise requirements of more advanced users and system administrators .
The Slackware user would claim that other distributions will install superfluous packages and tools that have to be removed after the installation is complete .
Slackware , more than most Linux distributions , has a feel that is similar to a commercial Unix , and feels like home to the experienced Unix user , in installation and in practice .
The asset most valued by the Slack user , and most often claimed for Slackware Linux , is system stability .
If you install Slackware on a backroom server you expect it to stay there , and be unnoticed .
Slackware is for developers and sysadmins , for those who want to become masters of their own domain , and those who want to understand how their system works .
As the anonymous coward once said " if you use Ubuntu , you 'll learn Ubuntu .
If you use Slackware , you 'll learn Linux , " and there are Slackware derivatives , Vector Linux or Zenwalk , for other kinds of users .
The stripped - down cleanliness and utilitarian straightforwardness of Slackware Linux may explain why there is still an extensive user base of loyal and trusting Slack users , despite its lack of apparent commercial appeal .
Other distributions may come with a greater range of options but Slackware comes with all the tools that are essential to run a clean system in a production environment , as a server or as a development platform .
You do n't need the latest and greatest music software to run Apache or Samba .
In the world of Slackware less is often more .
Soft landings for Linux users Slackware has been around since the early nineties , before the Linux kernel reached its first point release , when Patrick Volkerding , the one and only maintainer of Slackware Linux , cleaned up a version of SLS , ( SoftLanding Linux Systems ) for his professor at MSU ( Michigan State University ) to use in teaching LISP .
SLS was the earliest popular distribution of Linux , but had its problems .
In the Debian Manifesto , Ian Murdock , the founder of Debian , was moved to say of SLS : " It is quite possibly the most bug - ridden and badly maintained Linux distribution available ; unfortunately , it is also quite possibly the most popular . "
SLS was a compilation of the latest software available , but was n't always usable straight out of the box .
Slackware went some way to addressing this problem , by ensuring that the packages included in a distribution were not just the latest and greatest , but the best available , and " adding a feature that installed important packages like the shared libraries and the kernel image automatically . "
The first release of Volkerding 's reworking of SLS was distributed on ftp and announced with a post entitled " Anyone want an SLS - like 0.99 pl11A system ? " , and Slackware rapidly gained a reputation that has stayed with it , for stability and lack of bloat .
The good names were taken Slackware owed its self - deprecating name to Volkerding 's obsessions .
The name was n't chosen to win over the buyers and sellers of hardware systems .
Volkerding was a fan of the satirical Church of the Subgenious and a Deadhead , a follower of the Grateful Dead , who had an ethos not unlike the hacker cultures of that gave rise to Linux and free software , allowed and encouraged their fans to record and share tapes of their concerts , and eschewed the trappings of commercial success .
Deadheads formed one of the earliest net communities around the bulletin boards of Stewart Brand 's well.com in the 1980s .
John Perry Barlow , one of the Grateful Dead songwriters , went on to found the Electronic Frontier Foundation and wrote an essay called The Economy of Ideas , subtitled " a framework for patents and copyrights in the Digital Age " , which could be seen as an early manifesto for the culture of sharing ideas , software and music across the Web , a culture which the nascent Linux and hacker communities were fully plugged into .
Slackware took its name from the mythical J.R. " Bob " Dobbs , the charismatic leader and figurehead of the Church of the Subgenius , whose message to the peoples of America was to " Get Slack " .
Score one for Focus on the Family in the Social Values Super Bowl -- the advocacy advertising contest that will fill the airwaves between scattered moments of NFL football February 7 .
CBS has rebuffed the publicity - seeking entry from a new gay dating service , Mancrunch .
The company had pounced on a chance to present their ad when they heard time was still for sale for the big game .
Ah , but they missed the fine print : CBS 's newly announced ad standards are for advocacy ads promoting a point of view .
So far , the only one booked for the family audience is one starring Tim Tebow and underwritten by conservative evangelical Focus on the Family .
CBS spokeswoman Shannon Jacobs is quoted by CNN Money saying :
After reviewing the ad , which is entirely commercial in nature , our standards and practices department decided not to accept this particular spot ...
We are always open to working with a client on alternative submissions .
OK folks , if you want to advocate for gay rights or marriage , perhaps -- but do n't appear to enjoy same sex contact in an ad airing during a game where grown men will be knocking each other nearly senseless -- you still have an opening .
One reader , who posts as Belmont Scott , commented on my earlier postthat
... advocacy commercials should be banned .
There are plenty of programs that discuss controversial topics and display controversial behavior .
The people who want to watch that sort of thing can watch it there .
Who do you think will be next to spend $ 2.5 million + to push a point of view to your family ?
Or do you agree with Belmont Scott and hope they all go away ?
For any successful building services company , the mechanical services are of utmost importance .
These are directly related to the systems which are installed once the building has been completed .
It also leads to the successful design of the building and therefore it is very important that these services are always considered before moving forward with the construction process .
The HVAC systems and the internal cabling cannot be installed successfully if the mechanical services are not considered .
The best part of such services is the precision on which these are based .
The mechanical engineers are highly qualified professionals and they always maintain the building even when it has been completed .
Successful and qualified companies should be handed over the task so that they can get the work done .

After saying the president was " downplaying " security , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) now says Barack Obama is using " the right approach " in fighting terror .
Appearing on MSNBC Monday morning , DeMint still stressed that the administration needed to buckle down further in the war on terror .
The conservative senator has been one of the White House 's chief critics amid the fallout of the failed Christmas Day airline bombing .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Instead of focusing on the blame right now , the president seems to be on the right approach , " he said on MSNBC .
" He ’s recognizing we ’ve got a terror problem .
What he is doing in Yemen is good . ”
DeMint said Sunday on CNN that Obama is too " distracted by other things " to deal seriously with national security issues .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee member was one of the first to criticize the White House for what he deemed an insufficient response to the attempted attack by a 23 - year - old Nigerian national .
One of the president 's other main critics , House Intelligence Committee ranking member Pete Hoekstra ( R - Mich . ) , also indicated that he is now satisfied with the administration 's response to the failed attack .
When asked , DeMint declined to say if the U.S. should invade Yemen — the country in which the al Qaeda cell the accused bomber contacted is based — but said that intelligence - gathering was key to preventing future attacks .
The Obama administration and many Democrats have defended its response to the attacks from the outset , saying that it properly initiated probes into airline security practices and the intelligence gathered on the alleged perpetrator .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs also said last week that the attack should be a " nonpartisan " issue .
A New Kind of War
The end result of Operation Cast Lead , last year ’s conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip , was quite clear .
During three weeks of fighting over December 2008 and January 2009 , more than 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed and at least 2,500 houses in the strip were demolished .
There is an ongoing debate about the number of armed Palestinians killed , but even Hamas does not contest that hundreds of its men died , among them three of the Islamist organization ’s senior leaders .
The Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) penetrated to the heart of the strip — the center of Gaza City , where most of Hamas ’s major compounds are located .
The organization ’s defensive infrastructure , which had been painstakingly built over three years and included hundreds of booby - trapped houses , tunnels , landmines , and smuggled anti-tank rockets , was destroyed .
Hamas fighters had no answer for the IDF ’s technological and military edge .
Their attempts to kidnap Israeli soldiers failed and , though Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory , only a few civilians were killed .
More than a year after the fighting , the strip is still under siege by both Israel and Egypt .
Most Gazans are forbidden from traveling abroad , while their supply of goods depends primarily on smuggling through tunnels from Egypt .
So how , you might ask , did Hamas mark the first anniversary of this colossal failure ?
By celebrating , of course .
In a number of rallies , Hamas leaders proudly reminded their supporters of the organization ’s achievements during the conflict .
For them , the fact that Hamas had stood its ground against the strongest army in the region and continued shooting rockets until the last day of the war was more than enough to declare victory .
Survival was the goal , and it had been achieved .
Such bizarre and dissonant remarks are widely accepted in the Middle East as a part of the regional game .
Hezbollah , which had suffered heavy losses in the second Lebanon war against Israel in the summer of 2006 , still describes that conflict ’s outcome as a " Victory from God " ( Nassr Min Allah ) .
The Arab media , led by Al Jazeera , repeated this message enthusiastically , despite Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah ’s admission , a few days after the war ’s conclusion , that he would not have gambled on an attack against Israel had he known that the Israeli reaction would be so severe .
It ’s not that the leaders of these organizations do n’t actually know what happened in Lebanon and Gaza .
Hezbollah and Hamas fired senior commanders after the wars .
But both groups understand that asymmetric conflicts are very different from conventional warfare .
In these battles , perception — even marketing — is far more important than results .
The images that organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas manage to sell to their publics , to their enemy , and to the international community have a far greater effect than actual events on the battlefield .
In fact , Israel ’s military victory in Gaza was far from complete , and the battle of perceptions is still a draw .
A certain level of deterrence was achieved , but Hamas still remains in full control of the strip .
And Israel ’s overwhelming force , applied against an enemy fighting from within the civilian population , resulted in hundreds of innocent victims .
This in turn led to the extremely harsh ( and biased ) Goldstone Report , along with the fear that senior IDF officers would be brought to trial in some European countries for alleged war crimes .
Israel is now considered by many in the international community as the regional " disturbed child , " requiring immediate restraint if a new war breaks out .
Nevertheless , despite their victories on the battlefield of opinion , Hamas and Hezbollah might be celebrating a bit prematurely .
The military stakes have risen recently , due to Iran ’s involvement and some technological evolutions on Israel ’s side .
After Israel ’s impressive military success against Palestinian terrorism in the second Intifada , from 2000 to 2005 , Hezbollah , with Hamas following closely behind , developed a new tactic to circumvent Israel ’s increased security precautions .
During the 2006 war , Hezbollah bombarded Israel with 4,200 rockets , fired from South Lebanon .
These rockets were aimed at Israel ’s underbelly , its civilian population .
Israel was caught unprepared , because plans for developing an interception system to defend against medium - range rockets and missiles ( those with a range of under 160 miles ) had been aborted for cost reasons in 2000 .
Recently , however , Israel has come up with a partial solution : the " Iron Dome " system .
A sufficient number of such systems will only be deployed in two or three years , a fact that has led some Israeli leaders to conclude that no further withdrawals from Palestinian territories are possible in the near future because it would expose Israel ’s major population centers , such as Tel Aviv , to rocket fire on a daily basis .
Meanwhile , Iran has absorbed Syria , Hezbollah , and Hamas into a coordinated system fighting Israel , disregarding ideological and ethnic differences .
Hamas , worried about its independence , hesitated before giving in to Iran ’s advances five years ago .
But the Iranians were willing to offer huge financial support to the Gazans at a time when help from the Gulf states was dwindling .
Syria , which has historically nurtured aspirations of becoming a regional power , also accepts Iranian supremacy .
Western intelligence sources claim that terrorist training camps in Iran and Syria now host students from Lebanon and Gaza for months at a time , exchanging lessons learned while fighting Israel and on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Iran uses Hezbollah and Hamas for a campaign " by proxy " against Israel , hoping to gradually erode the Jewish state ’s resistance while steadily stockpiling thousands of rockets in Gaza and in Lebanon .
These weapons are also intended to deter Israel from any attempt at striking Iran ’s nuclear sites .
Israel is fighting a long and difficult battle against Iran - controlled terrorism .
Having frustrated most suicide - bombing attacks , Israel now faces the complicated challenge of rocket warfare , for which no comprehensive strategic solution has yet been achieved .
Therefore , military counterattacks will remain part of Israel ’s strategy , meaning that another round of fighting in the near future , in either Gaza or Lebanon , seems almost inevitable .
As they listen to the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah glorify their accomplishments in the recent wars against Israel , the Gazans and Lebanese should think long and hard about whether these propaganda victories have been worth the human cost .
The revelations have been nothing short of jaw dropping .
Dozens - yes dozens - of claims made in the IPCC 2007 report on climate change that was supposed to represent the " consensus " of 2500 of the world 's climate scientists have been shown to be bogus , or faulty , or not properly vetted , or simply pulled out of thin air .
We know this because newspapers in Great Britain are doing their job ; vetting the 2007 report item by item , coming up with shocking news about global warming claims that formed the basis of argument by climate change advocates who were pressuring the US and western industrialized democracies to transfer trillions of dollars in wealth to the third world and cede sovereignty to the UN .
Glaciergate , tempgate , icegate , and now , disappearing Amazon forests not the result of warming , but of logging .
And the report the IPCC based their bogus " science " on was written by a food safety advocate according to this Christopher Booker piece in the Telegraph :
Dr North next uncovered " Amazongate " .
The IPCC made a prominent claim in its 2007 report , again citing the WWF as its authority , that climate change could endanger " up to 40 per cent " of the Amazon rainforest - as iconic to warmists as those Himalayan glaciers and polar bears .
This WWF report , it turned out , was co-authored by Andy Rowell , an anti-smoking and food safety campaigner who has worked for WWF and Greenpeace , and contributed pieces to Britain 's two most committed environmentalist newspapers .
Rowell and his co-author claimed their findings were based on an article in Nature .
But the focus of that piece , it emerges , was not global warming at all but the effects of logging .
A Canadian analyst has identified more than 20 passages in the IPCC 's report which cite similarly non-peer - reviewed WWF or Greenpeace reports as their authority , and other researchers have been uncovering a host of similarly dubious claims and attributions all through the report .
These range from groundless allegations about the increased frequency of " extreme weather events " such as hurricanes , droughts and heatwaves , to a headline claim that global warming would put billions of people at the mercy of water shortages - when the study cited as its authority indicated exactly the opposite , that rising temperatures could increase the supply of water .
This is a great story .
It has everything a media outlet could desire ; scandal , conflict of interest ( IPCC head Pauchuri runs companies that benefited from climate scare stories ) , government cover ups - why then , has this unraveling of the basis of climate science that posited catastrophic man made warming not been making any news at all in the United States ?
It 's too easy to simply claim " bias . "
Media outlets do n't pass up juicy stories that could potentially increase their readership and revenue for ideological purposes ( except the New York Times - and even they could spin all of this to show skeptics to be using flawed arguments like the liberal Guardian is doing in England ) .
Perhaps its time to ask why this story being revealed overseas with new revelations almost daily in the Daily Mail , the Telegraph , the Timesonline , and other Fleet Street publications can't get any traction here .
Blogs like Watts up with That and Climate Depot are keeping us informed of the latest from England but we hear crickets chirping when it comes to stories from major newspapers and - outside of Fox News - the cable nets .
As global warming the political movement is losing its scientific justification , the American people - who will be asked to foot the bill to the tune of trillions of dollars if Obama goes ahead with his " green " plans - are grossly uninformed about the state of the debate .
Until the media starts to give this story the coverage it deserves , that state of affairs will not change .
Riyadh : US Energy Secretary Steven Chu expects that Saudi Arabia will emerge as a major exporter of solar energy and this could reach the current level of the kingdom 's oil exports .
He also dismissed fears of a looming crisis caused by dwindling oil production .
Chu , a strong backer of alternative energy , said that there is big scope for Saudi Arabia to tap into its vast solar energy sources .
" The kingdom 's drive to invest a portion of its oil revenue on scientific and technical research will enable it to strengthen diversification of energy sources and promote renewable energy programmes .
" This will contribute to achieving remarkable growth in its industrial output and increasing productivity potential , " he said .
Chu made these remarks during his meeting with a number of senior government officials and media persons following a lecture at the office of the International Energy Forum here on Monday .
He also held talks with King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz .
Speaking to reporters with regard to oil supply , Chu said the market would adjust even if supplies were to decline .
" I do n't see any peak in oil , " Chu said , dismissing the idea that global oil production was at or near a peak and is expected to slide because depletion was outrunning new discoveries .
" I see a transition to more expensive forms of oil like that produced from harder - to - access fields and secondary recovery schemes .
Tighter supplies
" If tighter supplies drive up prices , countries would cut back on oil and seek alternative energy sources like solar and nuclear power , " Chu said , adding that there will be a renaissance in nuclear energy because it is cleaner .
The top US energy official said that the two countries have common interests in the energy sector .
" We want to improve our energy efficiency and use it in the best possible manner to develop the economy , " said Chu , adding that both are interested in diversifying energy resources .
" This is an area where we both can cooperate for each other 's benefit through research and technical programmes , " he noted .
Chu voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear programme while emphasising that all countries should respect the treaty of non-proliferation .
Anybody violating these regulations will affect the rhythm of security , and economic and political activities in the global and regional arenas , he said .

( CNN ) --
It seems that now someone called " Barack Hussein Obama " can be pulled aside and patted down merely because of his name .
But while our president has the benefit of Air Force One , millions of us with a " funny name " ( Muslim and otherwise ) do not .
Like me .
I 've consistently faced " random " selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab , or Muslim head covering .
I 've been told to take my head scarf off or have my head probed while the passengers in front of me offered pitying smiles as they rushed to their flights .
One time , the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could .
Muslim women wear the hijab as a symbol of modesty , to be judged not by their appearance .
The Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. dreamed that people would be judged for " the content of their character . "
However , the Transportation Security Administration is judging me and other Muslims by the way we look .
The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women , and passengers can now expect a full - body pat - down , an appallingly invasive " enhanced pat - down search that could include the chest and groin , or a planned " mind - scan " that would track people 's reaction to terrorist symbols .
What 's next , palm reading ?
At an airport with a full body scanner , I can have the image of my body displayed before a stranger -- virtual nudity .
Do they seriously have a blank check on our bodies ?
Of course I care about profiling partly because I 'm affected .
But does one have to face this issue to feel that it 's wrong ?
After all , it is difficult to imagine ourselves in other people 's shoes when we do n't have to .
It 's hard for me too .
Especially over the past month , I 've been shocked at the comments about my faith , and the sometimes - prejudiced support for racial profiling .
Radio host Mike Gallagher said , " There should be a separate line to scrutinize anybody with the name Abdul or Ahmed or Mohammed . "
Sorry Paula Abdul and Muhammad Ali , or anyone with the world 's most common name , Muhammad .
For people who are n't affected by racial profiling at airports , imagine this :
The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving , which kills over 13,000 Americans every year .
People who are not Muslim have to go through a Breathalyzer test before they can enter their vehicle .
Muslims do n't drink alcohol and are , therefore , exempt .
Ridiculous ?
I agree .
I know that what I am going through is just the tip of the iceberg of racial profiling in our country .
Thirty - two million Americans report that they have been the victims of racial profiling .
Racial profiling violates the U.S. Constitution , is ineffective and trickles down to the workplace , schools and elsewhere .
You also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world .
There are Muslims of every possible race , making profiling practically futile .
Fareed Zakaria said it best : " When you 're trying to find a needle in a haystack , adding hay does not help you . "
Putting ethical and pragmatic reasons aside , it 's hard to justify not caring .
Even if racial profiling does n't affect us , it affects our friends , family members , co-workers , doctors , television personalities -- the list goes on .
There are some people who do n't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling .
Therein lies the problem .
According to the Pew Research Center , people who know Muslims are less likely to have negative views of them .
Co-existence is a dismal possibility unless people go to the source to find out about Islam , not skewed Web sites .
And Muslims , here 's something to think about :
If your knowledge of Islam came from common stereotypes , would n't you also be misinformed about the faith and its followers ?
The Quran says , " [ God has ] made you into nations and tribes , so that you might come to know one another ( 49:13 ) . "
So get to know your fellow Americans .
There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant .
Neither group deserves such a label .
Psychologist Henri Tajfel , who was a Holocaust survivor , explained how we isolate ourselves into an " in-group " and facilitate discrimination of an " out - group . "
Religious profiling boxes Muslims into a category separate from Americans .
We can't accept that distinction .
Let 's all think outside of the box .
It 's essential for U.S. security that airport screening be done .
But we need to stop the inflation of procedures that make our society more afraid and less secure .
The TSA needs to stop and evaluate methods that are more effective , less invasive , and do n't discriminate based on religion or race .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
The fiscal splintering of the euro zone has increased pressure on the bloc to toughen its rules on public finances , and economists say a failure to make changes could expose it to more speculative attacks in the months and years to come .
The European Union ’s Stability and Growth Pact , designed to enforce fiscal discipline , sets debt and deficit ceilings for member states and gives Brussels the right to warn , and ultimately sanction countries who violate these limits .
For much of the past decade it has done its job -- keeping the euro area on a single track and , more importantly , convincing markets the bloc could manage the fiscal and economic differences among its members .
The economic crisis has changed all that .
Single currency members Greece , Portugal and Spain are under acute pressure because of their swollen deficits , a situation economists say has highlighted the need for new measures to strengthen or even replace the stability pact .
In a research note this weekend , economists at UniCredit described the pact as a “ spectacular failure ” and urged policymakers to replace it with something “ tougher and more enforceable ” in order to prevent turbulence in the future .
“ Volatility and tensions on euro zone sovereign markets could easily become a constant feature of 2010 , ” the bank ’s chief economist Marco Annunziata wrote .
STRENGTHENING THE PACT
To strengthen the pact , economists say Brussels should have new powers to monitor statistical data from euro zone members .
The European Commission admitted last month that Greece had deliberately misreported deficit data for years .
And in October the government in Athens shocked markets by revealing the budget deficit would be twice as large as previous estimates .
Brussels is now closely monitoring how Greece implements its austerity plan , but much of the damage has already been done .
“ Brussels needs to be sending officers from Eurostat to individual countries to do proper checks , ” said Juergen Michels , an economist at Citigroup .
“ If you have rules you need a referee -- at the moment we do n’t have that . ”
In addition to a better monitoring mechanism , economists say the crisis has also exposed the need for member states to move beyond the rules contained in the pact and coordinate their economic policies more closely .
But this is likely to meet resistance from countries like Germany , who fear a loss of sovereignty over economic policy and suspect some member states could exploit such a forum to try to influence the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made it clear that she blames the fragmentation of the euro - zone economy not on the inadequacies of the stability pact itself , but on the failure of certain member states to respect it .
Berlin fears that establishing new economic rules for the euro zone would be akin to opening Pandora ’s Box .
Critics say Germany ’s economic policy model , based on wage moderation , high private savings and export - driven growth , itself has weakened domestic demand and helped create the very imbalances the euro zone is now struggling to cope with .
“ Right now there is nothing to force adjustment on Germany , whose surpluses are the flipside of the Greek deficits , ” said Simon Tilford , chief economist at the Center for European Reform .
“ I ’m not sure we will see the changes that would prevent future crises .
Countries with big trade surpluses first need to realize they are part of their problem . ”
LISBON FATIGUE
Jacob von Weizsaecker , a research fellow at the Brussels - based think tank Bruegel , believes opposition to greater economic coordination might not be so high were it not for the EU ’s struggles with the Lisbon Treaty .
Merkel herself led the drive to pare down the bloc ’s ill - fated “ constitution ” into a less - ambitious document that was acceptable to all members , only to see it rejected by Irish voters and savaged by euro - skeptics at home and abroad before finally stumbling into force late last year .
The memory of the years - long struggle to push through Lisbon , and the damaging divisions it exposed within the broader EU , still haunt leaders in Berlin and Europe ’s other capitals .
“ If it had n’t been for the painful process of the Lisbon Treaty , I think people would be much more adventurous , ” Weizsaecker said .
“ There is a reluctance in Germany and elsewhere to engage in more institution building . ”
Still , economists say the risk of ignoring the need for new rules is significant -- not just for fiscally challenged euro countries like Greece and Portugal , but for Germany and the currency bloc as a whole .
Some believe the market pressures seen over the past weeks , in which yield spreads between German bonds and those of weaker bloc members have shot to records , could be just a foretaste of those the bloc will face in the coming year if it fails to act .
“ The market appears to be taking over from the European Commission the role of enforcer of fiscal discipline , and it could prove far more efficient and brutal than the Stability and Growth Pact , ” said Unicredit ’s Annunziata .

Mass Effect 2's tamer ( and sideboobless ) sex scenes led some to believe that BioWare held something back , after the 2008 uproar over Mass Effect started by the Network That Must Not Be Named .
But a dev sternly denies that charge .

User Menelaos1971 opened a forum thread on the subject , calling the sex scene in Mass Effect 1 " a step in the right direction for Rated M games , " but implied that the uninformed uproar over it chilled BioWare 's intent to extend the theme in the sequel .
He also alleged that BioWare was given orders from EA that an M for violence was OK , but not nudity , because it might affect sales .
" Or was it just EA lawyers , " Menelaos1972 wrote .

Stanley Woo , a member of the QA story team for the game , replied forcefully :
It 's kinda funny that this topic keeps coming up over and over again .
People who claim to be old enough and mature enough to handle sex and nudity in a game seem to believe that any lack of sex and nudity in the game is a sign of self - censorship .
They generally do n't believe that a game can be called " mature " without explicit sex and / or nudity .
Let me tell you , folks , that as a developer full of mature individuals , we are also free to not have explicit sex and / or nudity in our games , no matter what you , Fox News , the government , or Bunky the Wonder Clown has to say about it .
We have never considered it a " problem , " it is simply a choice we have made and we have every right to make that choice .

Later on , answering another forum poster who dragged parenting into the discuss , Woo continues :
You are absolutely correct .
It is not our job to parent the child or determine what content is acceptable or unacceptable for our players .
But on the other hand , it is not your job to dictate what content we include or do n't include in our games .
Game development is not a collaborative effort between developers and gamers ; it is a dictatorship , where we alone determine what content goes into our game .
You the player make the choice whether that content is acceptable to you ( and / or your family ) or not .

It was love at first fight .
In front of an Air Canada Centre crowd desperately in need of something to cheer , the biggest name in the Maple Leafs ’ latest makeover punched in for work Tuesday and was a hit .
Or several hits if you ask Colin White ’s face .
In truth , Dion Phaneuf had them at the introduction .
Then , building on that thank - heavens - you ’re - here welcoming ovation , the former Flame began forging anew his reputation for cast - iron leadership , whether it be with his shoulder , his right fist or his relentless chirping .
Three minutes in , he laid his first big hit on Travis Zajac .
Seven minutes in , he dropped the gloves when White took exception to his hit on Zach Parise .
Finally , a bit of truculence that meant something .
“ I made the hit and ( White ) came over .
He ’s sticking up for his teammate .
I was n’t going to say no , ” said Phaneuf , with the kind of logic that Leafs fans , always enamoured of their tough guys , appreciate .
In the midst of a 3 - 0 Toronto victory over the high - flying New Jersey Devils , a local hero was born .
“ I want to be known as a guy who leads on the ice , whether that ’s practice or games .
I want to work as hard as I can to help this team by playing my game and that ’s hard every shift , ” said the 24 - year - old , making it clear the affection was mutual .
“ It was a great honour to put this jersey on tonight and be a part of this organization .
The fans were unbelievable .
To be on this side , playing in front of them , it meant a lot to me .
It was a very special game in my career . ”
The Leafs won .
But , more important , they showed all is not lost .
With this season a washout and the Leafs in the long - standing business of selling hope instead of playoff tickets , they actually provided some .
The new blood came as advertised with the three players who arrived in weekend trades contributing to the victory .
Phaneuf was tough in his own end , showed good wheels , fired rockets from the blue line - “ in the general direction of the net , ” coach Ron Wilson chided - and seemed to instantly make defensive partner Francois Beauchemin more at ease .
Goaltender Jean - Sebastien
Giguere was n’t overly challenged by a Devils team that pumped five shots past Toronto netminders on Friday in an overtime win , but a shutout is a shutout and he , undoubtedly , stopped a couple that would have slipped past predecessor Vesa Toskala .
He was only the second Leafs goaltender to record a shutout in his debut , following in the footsteps of Ed Belfour .
Fredrik Sjostrom , the add - on winger when the Leafs cleaned house on Sunday , indeed looks very fast , helped on the penalty kill - a unit that desperately needed help - and picked up as assist .
Perhaps most heartening was the trickle - down effect from the presence of both Phaneuf and Giguere .
With Beauchemin as exhibit A , the Toronto defence simply looked more controlled and patient .
Luke Schenn , with some attention deflected , continued his recent calm , steady play and now has a role model in Phaneuf for his style of game .
And Carl Gunnarsson - we ’re back to that hope thing again - also made some clever plays with puck while teamed with Schenn .
A blueline corps that looked like a disaster some nights - such as the last time it faced the Devils - did n’t Tuesday night .
Phaneuf ’s leadership extended beyond the on-ice belligerence .
He talked incessantly on the bench and in the dressing room between periods , helping to keep his teammates pumped .

“ He ’s gung - ho .
He seems to love hockey .
It rubs off , ” said Wilson .
“ You could hear him talking between periods in our coaches ’ office which is almost two rooms and three doorways away .
You could hear him the whole time .
Which I do n’t think anybody in the Leafs ’ room , especially the younger guys , has experienced . ”
“ I ’ll pay him by the word .
He ’s full of energy . ”

As the Ars team convenes for two days of meetings in Chicago , we 're reaching back into the past to bring you some of our favorite articles from years gone by .
This story originally ran in January 2010 .
The latter half of the 1990s was a dark time for the company then known as Apple Computer , Inc. Windows 95 had dashed any remaining hopes of mass - market desktop dominance for Apple .
The big profits of the earlier part of the decade had given way to some huge annual losses .
The future of the entire company was in doubt .
Like injured animals , corporations are adept at hiding the true magnitude of their injuries .
As grim as things appeared from the outside , few Apple enthusiasts knew at the time just how close the company came to fiscal ruin .
But the software picture was always crystal - clear — clear , and terrifying .
The Mac operating system lacked two important features essential to remaining competitive past the end of the decade : memory protection and preemptive multitasking .
Over the course of many years , Apple made several abortive attempts to create a modern successor to the classic Mac operating system , all of which crashed and burned before the horrified eyes of Mac fans everywhere .
Regardless of its financial issues , it was clear to the geeks that Apple was on the road to technological ruin .
Apple made its final play for salvation in 1997 when it purchased NeXT and , after one more false start , announced at WWDC 1998 what would be , blessedly , its last next - generation operating system strategy : Mac OS X .
By all rights , the Mac faithful should have been , if not ecstatic , then at the very least relieved at this turn of events .
Finally , a modern operating system for the Mac .
But there was another , equally common reaction : fear .
As a body of code , Mac OS X was not an evolution or enhancement of the Mac operating system that we knew and loved .
It was an entirely different — albeit not exactly new — operating system to which the Mac name and , presumably , user experience were to be retroactively applied .
Fear of just how badly this undertaking could turn out is a big part of what motivated me to not only learn as much as I could about the future of Mac OS , but also to write about it .
As a freshly - minted Unix nerd , I could n't help but be somewhat excited at the marriage of my two favorite operating systems .
But laid over that optimism was a blanket of mild hysteria regarding every part of the project above the core OS .
Now here we are , a decade later , and Mac OS X has matured into a fine product .
This ten - year marker presents an opportunity to do something technology writers usually avoid .
I 'm going to look back at some of my hopes and fears from the early days of Mac OS X's development and compare them to the reality of today .
Was I right on the money , shrewdly warning of future disasters that did , in fact , come to pass ?
Or do my predictions now read more like the ravings of a gray - bearded lunatic ?
It 's judgment day .
1999 : Mac OS X DP2
The path to the Mac OS X project was littered with broken technological promises and missed ship dates .
As it turns out , Apple was about to turn the corner and start actually hitting its dates and keeping its promises .
But in 1999 , I still had my doubts .
The current party line has Mac OS X on store shelves some time in 2000 .
I fearlessly predict that it will not appear until 2001 at the earliest .
( " Nailed it " … though predicting that a software product will be late is n't exactly a tough call . )
It was n't really fair to make any sort of judgement about Mac OS X based on the second " developer preview " release , which Apple acknowledged upfront existed only to help developers begin their work and did not represent the final user interface .
That 's a good thing , because my evaluation of DP2 was not kind .
Actually using DP2 is akin to logging into a demented Xterm running a poorly designed window manager theme meant to look something like Mac OS .
Launch a Cocoa application and you feel like you 've been warped into NEXTSTEP , again running that funny window manager .
Run a classic applications and it's like being in a slightly odd version of Mac OS 9 , with that alternate NeXT universe still visible in the background .
Pull up the command line and you start to think that all of this is one big facade running on top of good old Unix .
Given how far the final Mac OS X user interface diverged from the one in DP2 , this harsh criticism hardly seems relevant .
But none of us knew what 10.0 would look like back then .
Something called Mac OS X Server 1.0 did exist as a shipping product in 1999 , and it and looked a hell of a lot like Mac OS X DP2 .
It was not beyond the bounds of reason to imagine that the final Mac OS X user interface might be a cleaned up , refined version of this very same interface — and that would have been a bad thing .
Ever looking for the silver lining , I went on to opine that " I 'd much rather be stuck using Mac OS X DP2 on a daily basis than Mac OS X Server .
They both completely fail the ' Mac - like ' litmus test , but DP2 is closer to that goal . "
Reading that now , it 's clear to me just how desperate I was to find something good to say about the UI of this new OS .
The image below is a good distillation of my already slightly desperate attitude towards the Mac OS X user experience .
Practically speaking , it compares the mouse movement allowed by Mac OS ( green ) when selecting an item from a sub-menu to the movement required by Mac OS X DP2 ( orange ) .
( Following the green path in DP2 caused the sub - menu to immediately disappear . )
The subtext was this : " Hey , NeXT guys .
This is just one example of the kinds of things we Mac users appreciate — nay , expect — in an operating system that bears the Mac name .
Slapping a Platinum coat of pixels on your existing NeXT code base is obviously not going to cut it .
User interface design is not just what it looks like ; design is how it works . "
Internals intrigue
The technical underpinnings of Mac OS X were considerably more interesting .
Even ten years ago , I could n't help but dwell on the possibility of an x86 future .
The OpenStep APIs are cross platform .
Mach is cross-platform .
WebObjects is cross-platform .
x86 builds of Rhapsody , Mac OS X Server , and Mac OS X inside Apple have been all but confirmed .
Rumor has it that Apple routinely synchronizes all changes to Mac OS X across both PowerPC and x86 builds of the OS .
Clearly , Apple 's choice of where to deploy its new operating system is not limited by the technology .
If they decided to try releasing a version Mac OS X for x86 processors , it would be technologically within their means .
Before you congratulate me for my amazing prescience , consider the next two sentences I wrote : " But will they do it ?
I seriously doubt it . "
If you 'd asked me to place money on the question , I 'd have bet heavily against Apple moving to x86 .
But I now realize I would have been betting with my heart , not my mind .
My brain did get in the final word , however :
The cross -platform card is something to watch for .
For the first time , the only thing keeping Apple off of the " PC " platform will be its business plan .
And hey , with Steve Jobs calling the shots , anything is possible .
It 's interesting to note that only two short years after his return to Apple , Jobs had already ( re) cemented his reputation as a fearless and often unpredictable leader .
Age had not slowed him down one bit .
File system metadata ( which I was then calling " meta - information , " for some reason ) was also tickling my brain , though mostly in a positive way , believe it or not .
I was intrigued by the concept of bundles , especially their use of this shiny new " XML " data format .
But while storing metadata in separate flat files within bundles could work for applications , the future of plain file metadata was still in doubt .
How will Mac OS X identify the file type and creator of " regular " files ?
By file name extension , that concept so alien to traditional Mac OS ?
Or will HFS / HFS +- dependent type / creator meta-information soldier on into the future ?
Time will tell .
Note the blithe dismissal , the seemingly complete lack of concern .
" Oh well , time will tell . "
Indeed it would .
Abundant solar and wind power lies across America ’s vast plains and deserts , but getting that distant renewable energy to cities without wrecking vistas and raising lawsuits over transmission lines is a sizable hurdle for green - leaning utility companies .
Thousands of miles of towering electrical lines will be needed before big alternative - energy projects can take hold .
Yet such power lines portend years of legal snarls over the not - in - my - backyard problem .
Into this fray comes Phil Harris and his pioneering plan to use underground superconducting cables that will be both hidden from view and more efficient than traditional lines .
Mr. Harris wants to build a virtually invisible network that would create a national renewable - energy hub located in the Southwest .
Today , the nation ’s power grid is in three disconnected pieces – Eastern , Western , and Texas .
Harris ’s project , called Tres Amigas , would use superconducting cable to provide the first large - scale commercial trading link between those big grids – opening up new markets for renewable wind and solar power in the American East and West .
These superconducting cables contain special materials chilled to superlow temperatures , allowing electricity to flow efficiently , with no resistance .
The only lost energy goes toward refrigerating the cables .
While Harris ’s “ hub ” would run in a loop , it would demonstrate the potential for superconducting power lines that could travel long distances and eliminate the 7 percent of electricity wasted by ugly , above - ground transmission lines .
In papers filed in early December with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , Tres Amigas outlined its plans for a $ 600 million , 15 - to 20 - mile triangular - shaped hub near Clovis , N.M. , constructed using superconducting cable .
Such a trading hub could spur investment in wind and solar power development in many states around the region , say officials with Public Service Company of New Mexico ( PNM ) .
The company is weighing construction of a new “ wind collector ” transmission line to connect new wind farms in the east - central part of the state with Tres Amigas , if the new transmission hub is built .
Today , PNM has “ no significant ability ” to move power to the eastern US or to Texas , says Greg Miller , lead engineering and operations director for PNM .
While power lines that run west to California remain congested , Tres Amigas would open up the other two markets – allowing development of New Mexico wind power .
“ We have very rich potential for renewable - energy development , particularly with wind in the east - central part of our state , ” Mr. Miller says .
With at least 10,000 megawatts of wind power development currently waiting for transmission lines to be built , “ we think [ the hub ] could be the trigger that will allow us to move forward . ”
The supercooled cables from American Superconductor , the nation ’s largest maker of superconducting cable , are already being used in small projects by the Long Island Power Authority , American Electric Power , and National Grid .
Perhaps two dozen locations worldwide rely on superconducting cable , but often it is to connect key stations less than a mile from each other .
Tres Amigas would be a “ game changer , ” company officials say .
“ What we ’re starting to see is a new phase in commercialization of superconducting cable – not just in this country but globally , ” says Daniel McGahn , president and chief operating officer of American Superconductor in Devens , Mass .
A tour of American Superconductor ’s factory found the company creating flat metal tape out of “ high - temperature superconducting ” ( HTS ) oxide materials and costly silver , then slicing it into thin flat strips .
The strips wrap around a pipe carrying liquid nitrogen , which cools the cable to minus 346 degrees Fahrenheit .
At that temperature , electrons that ordinarily move randomly , losing energy in bumper - car - like collisions that generate heat , shift to highway mode .
Electrons then move in pairs in one direction , generating no heat and losing no energy .
Eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional copper wires would save around $ 16 billion a year , estimates the US Department of Energy – and pave the way for long - distance transmission of wind and solar power .
Another advantage : Being underground , the cable would be resistant to terrorist strikes .
Cost , however , has long been a major issue .
However , the price gap is closing , American Superconductor says .
A 1,000 - mile length of superconducting cable capable of carrying 5,000 megawatts would cost about $ 8 million to $ 13 million per mile , a recent company white paper says .
That ’s about on par with the $ 7 million to $ 10 million cost per mile for an equivalent conventional 765 kilovolt line .
Tres Amigas trading hub – which Harris says would be the world ’s largest use of superconducting cable – is like an automobile traffic circle .
It could bring into the loop up to 5,000 megawatts of power at any one moment from any or all of the three grids .
The power would then be sent out to whichever grid needs the electricity .
“ We need the ability to send energy produced in New Mexico to surrounding states , ” Gov. Bill Richardson said in a statement in October .
“ Tres Amigas will break that barrier , creating a larger market for our energy . ”
But there are larger implications here , too .
Building 130 - foot - high transmission lines to deliver renewable energy from distant locations to big cities is a costly challenge .
One major expense comes from potential neighbors who file lawsuits to avoid alternative - energy projects or connecting wires from obscuring historical areas or natural vistas .
This not - in - my - backyard mentality could drastically slow the nation ’s renewable - power development .
“ Tres Amigas will show superconducting technology is indeed a commercially viable alternative and a tremendous step forward in solving the nation ’s transmission gridlock , ” Harris says .
“ It should lessen lawsuits .
If it ’s buried , who cares ? ”
Well , Jeremy Chipps , for one .
A resident of La Crescent , Minn. , he and other members of Citizens Energy Taskforce have been fighting proposals for big power lines that they contend would carry mainly coal power – not renewable energy .
He also is not persuaded that big transmission lines are really needed .
He ’d prefer the United States move to local power generation , rather than depending on big , distant facilities , even wind farms .
“ We ’re not anti-‘shoring up the grid , ’ ” Mr. Chipps says .
“ But we are against massive costs of systems only designed to retain market share of big power companies .
We think it would make more sense for power to be generated much closer to where it is used . ”
Others , however , are keen on superconducting technology .
Johanna Wald , senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council , recently put her stamp on a new conventional transmission line to bring renewable energy into southern California .
“ We are going to have to look at all these technologies if we are going to meet our needs for renewable energy to address climate change , ” she says .
“ Undergrounding is something utility companies today do only reluctantly .
Increasingly they are willing to acknowledge the need to look at that option . ”
The idea of underground superconducting cables thrills Paul Miller , county administrator of Madison County in New York .
His and seven other counties fought a power line that would have planted huge transmission towers in the middle of the Delaware River Valley – 200 - foot - high spires about every 800 feet .
“ If superconducting transmission lines really come to pass , ” he says , “ and really offer the promise [ they seem ] to , a lot of the existing right of ways could be transformed . ”
Such lines “ would be a lot more palatable if [ they ] did n’t have monster towers . ”

Being unemployed is tougher than ever as people are struggling to find jobs longer than before .
But another segment of our society that is sinking even lower .
Homeless Americans live in tents in the woods outside of New York City , as crowded shelters cannot accommodate them .

Is Treatloaf® like meatloaf ?
Yes , except instead of more meat in the middle , there ’s a treat .
Can the treats inside a Treatloaf® be choking hazards ?
Quite often they can be .
I suppose that ’s one of the tradeoffs with how much fun it is to discover a treat inside your meatloaf .
How important is the element of surprise in a Treatloaf® ?
Very .
Always keep your treats unexpected .
For example , leave the packaging from a fancy new watch lying around the house , then sit back at the dinner table and enjoy your husband ’s confused expression as he swirls a pair of sizzling hot cufflinks around his mouth .
I made a Treatloaf® at a recent dinner party and my guests were upset by the treat I chose — a handful of loose coins .
Did I do something wrong ?
It sounds like the only thing you did wrong was inviting a bunch of people over who do n’t like money .
It sounds like Treatloaves® can be dangerous .
I guess that depends on your definition of dangerous , which for most people is living a life void of the enchantment and wonder that comes with scoring prizes in their food .
Is cold , leftover Treatloaf® as good as regular meatloaf the next day ?
Not really .
A lot of excavation , so to speak , often goes into unearthing the treats from a Treatloaf® , so the leftovers are less appetizing than you might hope .
Which is n’t to say you ca n’t remold this cooked rubble into a smaller loaf , jam a little something special in the middle and start all over again .
Can the treat inside a Treatloaf® be meat - based ?
That ’s very existential .
And the answer is , yes it can .
Lambshanks are a popular choice , as are meatballs .
But to avoid confusion with the surrounding meat , it helps to package this “ treat meat ” in some sort of decorative baggie .
Can a Treatloaf® be hung from a rope and beaten like a piñata until the treat comes out ?
It can and it should .
But safety first .
To hang your Treatloaf® , I highly recommend the Treatloaf Sac® .
This durable mesh satchel will keep your loaf secure while protecting your children from flying beef schrapnel .
Needless to say , goggles should be word by all onlookers — this is n’t some cute paper mache donkey you ’re dealing with , this is hot meat .
And hot candy .
Is this a family recipe ?
It is actually .
My grandmother started making Treatloaves ® during the Great Depression to stretch their meals .
My parents told wonderful stories of finding old shoes in their Treatloaves® , then making a game of guessing whose shoe was missing from around the table .
Treatloaf® not only nourished their cravings for merriment , it also nourished their cravings for food .
So your family invented Treatloaf® ?
That ’s right .
So they invented stuffing things into other things ?
I do n’t think I like your tone .
I ’m a vegetarian but I ’d still like to experience the enjoyment of Treatloaf® .
As long as you do n’t have a similarly irrational aversion to treats , this should n’t be a problem .
Simply make your Treatloaf® from tempeh or seitan and keep your fingers crossed that you can work through enough of that nasty crap and get to the treat .
It seems like mini Treatloaves ® would be a natural giveaway during Halloween .
Such a natural .
The only problem is it ’s not always socially acceptable to be the house that ’s giving out meat .
In addition to running the risk of getting some terrible , nasty names shaving - creamed onto your lawn , like “ The Beefersons , ” you also run the risk of retribution in the form of a doorstep Trickloaf , which we all know is just a fancy name for a bag of flaming poop inside a meatloaf .
I live alone .
Does making a Treatloaf® for myself sound pathetic ?
A little bit .
It ’s also very difficult to surprise yourself .
Which is why there are Treatloaf® swaps .
Online forums where really lonely people just like yourself can exchange frozen Treatloaves ® with other really lonely people and guarantee a surprise each time .
I noticed there ’s a registered mark next to the word Treatloaf® literally every time it ’s used .
Did you actually trademark that stupid word ?
Here comes the tone again .
We ’re getting a hamster for my son ’s birthday , can I put it in a Treatloaf® to surprise him ?
I would n’t , unless you ’re familiar with the process of Treatloaf® - airation , necessary during instances of advanced “ live treating . ”
Which , judging by your question , you do n’t appear to be .
But , yes .
I think I had Treatloaf® at a restaurant recently because it had several long , beautiful hairs in it .
I do n’t think that was Treatloaf® .
Are n’t Treatloaves ® illegal ?
You ’re thinking of Muleloaves® — meatloaves that are stuffed with illicit drugs and used as narcotic couriers across international borders .
Muleloaves ® are a felony and are in no way affiliated with Treatloaf® .
Today , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wasted no time in reminding Minnesota voters that Rep. Michele Bachmann -- a member of the House Financial Services Committee -- complained about those bailouts , yet voted against punishing AIG 's for its tone - deafness .
" Bachmann voted to protect bonuses paid to AIG executives with American tax dollars , " said Ryan Rudominer , the DCCC press secretary in a statement .
" This morning , Americans heard that AIG executives are getting $ 100 million in bonuses despite still owing taxpayers more than $ 100 billion .
While Representative Bachmann protects these outrageous Wall Street bonuses paid for by President Bush 's bailout , Bachmann does nothing to help hardworking families .
Clearly , Representative Bachmann is more concerned about Wall Street , than Main Street . "
Nice catch by the Minneapolis City Pages .
And they note that Bachmann opponent Tarryl Clark has been on the issue regularly and for some time .
Now that , is journalism .
Here 's the link :
http://blogs.citypages.com/...
Next :
The Minnesota Independent reports that Ms. Bachmann will be joining Minnesota GOP Governor Tim Pawlenty at the annual meeting of the influential Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC )
This is n't the first time Bachmann was invited to speak before CPAC .
The first time she was supposed to address them was in early 2007 , when she had barely started out in Congress .
( Bachmann was always being groomed for higher things , and the 2007 CPAC appearance was supposed to be her debut before a roomful of truly powerful players . )
Unfortunately , Bachmann had chosen the month before to " go off " with one of her nutty comments about how there was a secret plan to make a deal with Iran to form a new terrorist state in northwestern Iraq .
( Really , that 's what she claimed publicly . )
Total fabrication , but the " bombshell " hit the newswires and Michele was disinvited from the CPAC event when the lie was exposed .
She was n't big enough to withstand that kind of exposure then -- but she is now , and she 's a big hit at these CPAC things , telling Michael Steele " you be da man , " etc .
Reporter Andy Birkey reminds us that CPAC has come under fire for accepting the sponsorship of the John Birch Society .
Back in the 1960s , conservative leader William F. Buckley read the John Birch Society out of the conservative movement for fostering a " psychosis of conspiracy . "
( Calling Eisenhower a " communist , " that sort of thing . )
But a group like that is sure to love Michele , and apparently they do n't trouble Pawlenty 's well - known ethical sensibilities .
Nuttier and nuttier goes the GOP ; nonetheless , they will remain the " go to " guys in event of Dem fails during local elections .

The Mars Society is a group that prepares for man 's eventual exploration of Mars with simulations in the Utahan desert .
But their mission logs , posted regularly on the group 's website , reveal a tension that is very real — and very funny .
Advertisement
The two - week simulations , including various experiments and equipment tests , take place at the Mars Desert Research Station , located outside Hanksville , Utah .
The volunteers who participate are expected to take the matter very seriously — after all , our future Mars colony depends on it .
But of course , some pretend Mars astronauts are more dedicated than other pretend Mars astronauts and this is where the trouble starts .
The current team occupying the Research Station , Crew 90 , is led by Nancy Vermeulen .
According to their " Mission Info " page , they are the first team comprised entirely of Belgians .
In the wake of the trouble they 've been having , it now seems ominous that the last line of their statement reads , " the media is following our project very closely . "
Indeed , Geekosystem picked up on the mission and faithfully documented its simmering turmoil .

After days of snits and snubs , the tension came to a head on February 15 .
In that day 's report , Commander Vermeulen explains :
The growing frustration that after 9 days PE , Nora and Margaux are
still not able to manage the Hab systems / standard engineering
reporting system ( and even do n't consider this as a problem ! ) , exploded
during the lunch .
The lack of dedication to the mission of some people overloads the
others and it had to be spoken out .
The problem was already there from
the first day , when it came out that some people did n't prepare
anything for the mission , did n't look at the manuals , which were send
to them months ago and did n't even prepare the tasks for their own
role .
The accusation into my direction that I did n't brief enough about the
systems was too much .
Nicky almost exploded .
Arjan reacted double :
At one hand he could n't stop criticising the
incompetence of some others during last week , but during the discussion
he acted as if he was from Barcelona ( do n't know anything ) .
He has his
own mission and own world .

Only a few bloody noses are referenced , perhaps as physical manifestations of the crew 's frustrations .

From the composition of just two human genomes , geneticists have computed the size of the human population 1.2 million years ago from which everyone in the world is descended .
They put the number at 18,500 people , but this refers only to breeding individuals , the “ effective ” population .
The actual population would have been about three times as large , or 55,500 .
Comparable estimates for other primates then are 21,000 for chimpanzees and 25,000 for gorillas .
In biological terms , it seems , humans were not a very successful species , and the strategy of investing in larger brains than those of their fellow apes had not yet produced any big payoff .
Human population numbers did not reach high levels until after the advent of agriculture .
Geneticists have long known that the ancestors of modern humans numbered as few as 10,000 at some time in the last 100,000 years .
The critically low number suggested that some catastrophe , like disease or climate change induced by a volcano , had brought humans close to the brink of extinction .
Inspired by Kitchenette ’s delightful bacon snickerdoodles , I solicited the help of the Joy of Cooking for a basic snickerdoodle recipe and tweaked it a bit to accommodate the addition of tasty , salty bacon .
Bacon Snickerdoodles Recipe
Recipe adapted from Irma Rombauer ’s the Joy of Cooking
For the dough , makes eighteen 3 - inch cookies
1 cup all - purpose flour
1 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
6 Tbsp unsalted butter , softened
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
For the cinnamon - sugar coating
1/8 cup sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon
And of course , do n’t forget the bacon .
A few strips will do .
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F .
Mix thoroughly the dry ingredients : flour , cream of tartar , baking soda and salt in a small bowl until well blended .
Using a wooden spoon , mix thoroughly the softened butter and sugar in a large bowl until it becomes a well blended paste .
Add the egg and mix until well combined .
Stir in the flour mixture .
Stir it in incrementally so you wo n’t have flour all over the place .
Mix thoroughly and set aside .
In a small bowl , combine the sugar and cinnamon for the coating .
Slice the bacon strips widthwise into 1/2 - inch wide slices .
Shape the dough into 1 - 1/4 - inch balls .
It ’s a bit sticky so I ended up scooping the dough with a spoon instead of shaping it by hand .
Roll them in the cinnamon - sugar coating , and arrange about 2 - 3/ 4 inches apart on the cookie sheets .
Place the bacon slices on top of each ball , right in the middle .
Gently press down the bacon .
This will flatten the dough a bit , but just a tiny bit .
Doing this makes sure that the bacon stays in the middle of the cookie as it bakes .
The first time I tried baking these cookies , I just laid the bacon strips on top of the dough without pressing it down gently .
The bacon did not stay in the center and it flowed toward the edge of the cookie as it baked .
Bake one sheet at a time , until the cookies are light golden brown at the edges , 12 to 14 minutes .
Let the cookies stand briefly then place them on racks to cool .

By 2008 , that number rose to $ 903 , outstripping inflation .
By the end of this year , it is expected to have grown to $ 997.07 .
Add another $ 1,000 or more for cellphone service and the average family is spending as much on entertainment over devices as they are on dining out or buying gasoline .

Taxi drivers accused of racism for displaying sign saying they are ' English speaking '
A racism row has broken out after a city 's taxi drivers started displaying stickers in their cars saying they are ' English speaking ' .
Up to a dozen drivers have been showing off the notices bearing the St George 's Cross on the back windows of their cars in Southampton , Hampshire .
The small red and white sticker declares the cab is being driven by an ' English speaking driver . '
A racism row has broken out after taxi drivers in Southampton started displaying stickers in their cars saying they are ' English speaking '
But the flags have been branded ' racist ' by trade representatives , councillors and racism campaigners who have demanded they are removed .
Taxi drivers have hit back , claiming the stickers are simply a protest to force the council to make sure new drivers can speak good English .
The stickers were placed in the cars after drivers received complaints about the standard of spoken English among them .
There have also been complaints from passengers about drivers using sat navs and over - charging .
Cllr Brian Parnell said the stickers were ' offensive '
Perry McMillan , chairman of the Southampton cab section of trade union Unite , said the group 's ethnic minority members had been upset by the stickers .
He said : ' Surely all drivers speak English .
If they do n't , then what 's going on ?
' We hope that licensing officers can investigate this and satisfy the trade that this is n't the case . '
Campaign group Show Racism the Red Card demanded the stickers be taken down from the cab windows .
Chief Executive Ged Grebby said : ' I do n't have a problem with displaying the cross of St George because this is a symbol we have managed to reclaim from the far right .
' But the " English speaking driver " part is where it crosses the line into racism .
' Cab drivers have to have a command of English and there are strong racist undertones in this message .
' I think the drivers should take the flags down immediately and if they do n't , they should be told to by the council who licences them . '
But taxi drivers have hit back at the allegations of racism .
Clive Johnson , chairman of taxi firm Radio Taxis and the Southampton Trade Association , said : ' These signs are not racial .
' They are a protest to the council saying please make sure all new drivers have command of the English language .
' There are a few drivers out there who cannot speak English and just bluff their way along .
' It does n't matter if they are Polish , Russian , French or Spanish , if they can't communicate with passengers then it's a problem . '
Taxi driver Peter Ford , 48 , said : ' It 's just about letting customers know that the driver will actually be able to speak English , which is n't always the case . '
Fellow driver Chris Head , 49 , added : ' I have no problem with the stickers .
' Lots of customers will wait at ranks until an English driver comes along because they want someone they can talk to . '
Ian Hall , chairman of the Southampton Hackney Association , said half of the group 's 126 members are from an Asian background .
He added : ' I do n't think any drivers should have these stickers in the back of their car because it 's racist .
' If drivers have got these stickers in their back windows then they need to take them down . '
Mr Hall said night trade in Southampton would ' collapse ' without ethnic minority drivers , who buy the majority of taxi plates .
The sticker issue was raised at a meeting between cab firms and Southampton City Council .
It is believed that the council would order them to be removed if it received complaints from passengers .
Chairman of the council 's licensing committee Councillor Brian Parnell said the stickers were ' offensive ' .
He said : ' It 's certainly not the image we want for Southampton .
' It is offensive to drivers from ethnic minorities who form a large part of the city 's drivers and without whom Southampton 's taxi service would suffer .
' We want to promote harmony in the city .
' But it is important that taxi drivers meet a certain set of standards and one of those is the ability to speak English .
' It is normal good practice for anyone working in another country to be able to speak the language of that country .
' I think the problem might be that many drivers do speak English but with a heavy accent that can be difficult to understand . '
Cllr Don Thomas , who sits on the licensing committee , added : ' Taxis and taxi drivers can form the first impression that visitors have of Southampton .
' I think this is completely the wrong sort of message to be sending out in what is proudly a cosmopolitan city . '
A council spokesman said : ' People should contact the council and let us know if they see signs and stickers being used in taxis , particularly if they find them offensive . '
Currently , anyone who wants to drive a taxi must hold a British driving licence , pass a medical , undergo a criminal record check and complete a ' knowledge ' test of Southampton .
Last year council chiefs added a driving assessment and a test in basic reading , writing and communication skills .

Although we already know what President Obama is going to be selling this Tuesday – a radical escalation of the Afghan war involving 30,000 or more troops – we do n’t yet know what his sales pitch will be like .
Can the peerless rhetorician apply his skills to the task of mobilizing a war - weary nation around yet another military conflict in the Middle East ?
I have no doubt Obama is up to the task in a way his predecessor never was or could be .
The language of " liberation " employed by George W. Bush ’s speechwriters was too hard - edged and ideological for Americans to appreciate .
This could be because those speeches were mostly written by neoconservatives , whose appeals on behalf of a U.S. - led " global democratic revolution " sounded as if they were addressed to a Russian audience , circa 1917 , rather than to Americans of any era .
The Bush speechwriters had basically two tropes when it came to foreign policy : fear and hubris .
Obama ’s wordsmiths no doubt have a broader range of arguments and may prove more skillful at selling them to their restive base : e.g. , the " you break it you own it " theory of altruistic imperialism , which contends that the evil Bush administration ’s sins must be expiated in the task of nation - building because we owe that much to the Afghan people .
This is the position , as I understand it , taken by Code Pink , the pro-Obama " antiwar " group that was dead set against the occupation of Iraq but is currently having second thoughts about opposing what is now Obama ’s war in Afghanistan .
Expect a good portion of the " progressive "
Left to take up this battle cry .
Mixed in with feminist rhetoric – Laura Bush was very good at that sort of thing – this is a variation on the " humanitarian " interventionist angle , with a strong dash of political correctness thrown in for good measure .
We must " save " Afghan women from the tyranny of their own culture .
Intertwined with this theme of moral and cultural uplift is the new military doctrine [ . pdf ] recently adopted by the American high command , otherwise known as COIN .
In a world where the American empire faces increasing challenges , including but not limited to the worldwide Islamist insurgency mounted by al - Qaeda , the emphasis is off of fighting a conventional war .
The U.S. , as the world ’s sole remaining superpower , faces no serious rivals for world hegemony , or so the conventional wisdom goes .
The new focus is on fighting local insurgencies , i.e. , putting down rebellions on the far frontiers of the Empire .
Adopting the Maoist dictum that securing victory in a " people ’s war " is 80 percent political and only 20 percent military , the new COIN doctrine is the War Party ’s instruction manual for victory in the " long war , " and its origins are instructive .
This doctrine was first promulgated by the French army officer David Galula , who based his military theories on his own experience in trying to crush the Algerian independence movement .
While the brutality of French tactics in that war belie Galula ’s own Mao - like insistence on the primacy of politics over military action , his 1964 guide to counter - revolutionary strategy and tactics , Counterinsurgency Warfare : Theory and Practice , is a veritable owner ’s manual for colonial powers who find themselves besieged by ungrateful natives .
Galula divides insurgencies into two categories , " hot " and " cold . "
The latter is defined as any anti-colonialist movement whose activities are " on the whole legal and nonviolent . "
This presents the occupying power with a special problem , to which Galula provides some possible solutions :
1. " Act directly " on the insurgent leaders , i.e. , jail the opposition and otherwise " limit " their activities .
In the case of the French in Algeria , this often involved summary execution .
The replication of the French example , however , is not always possible or advisable .
As one summary of Galula ’s thesis put it , outright repression should only be attempted " when the insurgent ’s cause is not popular , the counterinsurgent has the legal authority to act , and significant publicity of such action can be prevented . "
2 . Act indirectly on the conditions that feed the insurgency .
If it is possible to co-opt the insurgency by adopting some or all of its goals , then by all means the occupiers should do so .
But this assumes an honest assessment of the insurgents ’ objectives and motivation , which may be lacking in the current case .
According to the official narrative , poverty , ignorance , and isolation from modernity are the reasons for the stubborn refusal of the Afghan people to support their American and NATO liberators .
The solution , by this administration ’s lights , is to construct what has never really existed in Afghanistan : a unified , modern nation - state .
Building " infrastructure , " it seems , is the liberal - progressive answer to humanity ’s problems worldwide , and in Afghanistan , too , where roads , hospitals , schools , networks of mass communication , and the very fabric of modernity itself must be built from the ground up .
The sheer arrogance of American policymakers and military theoreticians blocks them from recognizing the simple reality of the insurgents ’ motivation , which is nothing more nor less than aversion to the conditions of military occupation .
Short of withdrawing all U.S. forces from Afghanistan , there is no way to satisfy the central demand of the Afghan insurgents – who resist the American - NATO occupation not because they are ignorant savages who hate us for our freedoms , but because they seek their own version of freedom – which , understandably , does not involve kowtowing to an American viceroy .
The nation - building program advanced by advocates of COIN – one leading enthusiast exulted that COIN has the potential to " change entire societies " – is derived from Galula ’s third option : building a " political machine " to rival the insurgency for the affections of the people .
In the case of Afghanistan , however , this " machine " is oiled by drug money and lorded over by the Karzai brothers , whose names are veritable bywords for corruption in the region .
The fourth method of combating an insurgency is infiltration , but there is little hope of accomplishing that .
Indeed , the great problem in building up a government in Afghanistan is that the Taliban and their sympathizers are likely to take it over from within .
The central premise of the Galula doctrine is protecting the population from the violence of the insurgents and winning them over in the process .
Toward this end , he set down eight steps to the crushing of an insurgency .
The first two – send in troops in sufficient numbers to annihilate or drive out the main body of insurgents , and reinforce these with enough to keep the enemy from returning – are what ’s behind Gen.
Stanley McChrystal ’s call for 40,000 more troops .
The stage is then set for implementing the next two steps in the Galula handbook , which involves sending these soldiers into the villages and hamlets of Afghanistan to live side - by - side with the people , thus presumably gaining their confidence – or , maybe , setting up isolated garrisons of U.S. troops to be picked off one - by - one .
The goal of these garrisons , according to the grand master of COIN theory , is to " establish contact with the population and control its movements in order to cut off its links with the guerrillas " ( emphasis added ) .
In short , we must copy Israeli tactics in the occupied territories , or lockdown in a federal penitentiary .
Once we have the population locked down tight enough , we must :
" Destroy the local insurgent political organizations , set up , by means of elections , new provisional local authorities , and test these authorities by assigning them various concrete tasks .
Replace the softs and the incompetents , give full support of the active leaders .
Organize self - defense units .
Group and educate the leaders in a national political movement . "
Victory occurs when we " win over or suppress the last insurgent remnants . "
In Algeria , a theater in which the war tactics recommended by Galula were carried out – in certain instances , by him personally – the French record was of brutality unmitigated by either decency or common sense .
In order to cut the links between the insurgents and the populace , a large - scale resettlement program was carried out , leading to the massive disruption of Algerian society ( and ultimately backfiring on the colonialists ) .
Are we prepared to do this in Afghanistan ?
Galula ’s prescription for waging a successful counterinsurgency campaign was meant as practical advice for a decaying empire on how to shore up its crumbling defenses .
France had just given up one of the last of its colonial outposts , in Indochina , making way for the Americans , and was stubbornly determined to hold on to Algeria , which was formally considered a department of France proper .
The massive repression practiced by the French and their colonists , the Pieds - Noirs , including periodic massacres of Muslim villages , was only partially successful , and the Algerians eventually won their independence .
The military narrative , however , has it that the French won a military victory and could have retained their renegade province if only Paris had the requisite political will .
An American version of the same narrative informs a certain view of the Vietnam War , where – or so the legend goes – once again defeatist politicians got in the way of a military leadership that was on the verge of defeating the enemy .
Obama is deathly afraid of being characterized in this way by Republicans – and pro-war Democrats – and this underlies much of the rhetoric about Afghanistan being a " war of necessity , " i.e. , a political necessity .
The truth , however , is that the Vietnam War was always a losing proposition , as was the Algerian conflict .
Absent massive repression , the peoples of those nations would never have consented to " pacification " by the West , and it is useless to pretend otherwise .
At the core of COIN theory is a valuable insight , first put forward by Étienne de La Boétie , in his classic The Politics of Obedience : the rulers of a country must , to some significant degree , win the voluntary consent of the ruled .
However , it should be clear that winning " hearts and minds " is incompatible with invading and occupying a foreign country , no matter how ostensibly benevolent one ’s motives may be .
Assuming our unwillingness to utilize more extreme methods of " pacification , " such as those engaged in by Monsieur Galula and his confreres in Algeria , the advantages enjoyed by rebels in asymmetrical warfare – especially when it is waged on their home turf – may be impossible to overcome .
In which case , the Afghan war is an exercise in futility .
The accent is n’t perfect ( Herzog ’s distinctive voice is difficult to impersonate well ) but there are some great lines in this .
IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman does not file his own taxes in part because he believes the tax code is complex .
During an interview on C - SPAN's " Newsmakers " program that aired on Sunday , Shulman said he uses a tax preparer for his own returns .
ADVERTISEMENT
" I 've used one for years .
I find it convenient .
I find the tax code complex so I use a preparer , " Shulman said .
Pressed on how he would make the tax code simpler , Shulman responded , " I do n't write the tax laws .
Congress writes the tax laws so that 's a whole different discussion . "
The IRS this month announced it will be scrutinizing the tax preparer industry .
Shulman said the IRS is looking to set " a minimal level of competence in the preparer community . "
Later in the C - SPAN interview , Shulman downplayed his use of a tax preparer , saying he has used one for 10 years .
He noted that he and President Barack Obama are proponents of simplifying the tax code .
Shulman said about 60 percent of Americans use tax preparers and another 20 percent use software to file their returns .
He added , " So you 're over 80 percent of people who are n't just sitting down and filling out the forms themselves . "
Just over a month ago , I ran into a friend at a CES event .
While I see this friend around town once in a while , this was the first time I ’d seen him in a non-casual setting since Blogworld 4 months earlier .
After exchanging the usual pleasantries , he asked me an odd question : “ Is this like your conference party outfit ? ”
Indeed , I was wearing the exact same clothes I ’d worn to the event four months earlier .
Since he does n’t usually see me dressed up , it stood out enough for him to remember .
But that ’s not the real point , here ; the real point is that I have few clothes suitable for “ adult ” gatherings .
I have a suit , of course , for weddings and funerals .
( I have n’t had a job interview in 9 years , but if I did , it would be suitable for that , too . )
And I have my day - to - day clothes , which are n’t awful but which are n’t anything to brag about , either .
Functional casual , basically : jeans and khakis , an assortment of button - front shirts , some cotton sweaters .
As a college professor , there ’s not a lot of pressure on me to dress up .
If anything , it ’s just the opposite .
For one thing , I interact regularly with younger people , mostly teenagers ( I teach 100 - level courses ) , and being too formal creates a barrier between my students and me .
That might be ok in business or law ( think John Houseman in Paper Chase ) but for my classes and my teaching style , some level of rapport is crucial .
For another thing , my fellow professors do n’t exactly set the sartorial bar very high – and there ’s a certain sense of bohemian “ me-against - The - Machine ” attitude expressed by violating “ corporate ” standards of dress .
But mostly I dress the way I do because I ’ve never really learned how to dress otherwise .
Like a lot of my fellow geeks , fashion just was n’t on the radar for me .
Fortunately I have a brother who has always been very fashion - conscious , and he ’d take me in hand every few years when my fashion sense got too out of touch with reason and social acceptability .
Well , my friend ’s off - hand comment was a wake - up call for me .
I mean , I ’m a grown man – I should have more than one pair of slacks and one shirt nice enough to wear to an industry event without embarrassing myself !
So I set out to educate myself on some fashion basics – what shoes go with what kind of trousers , how to distinguish various sorts of dress shirts , and so on .
Advertising
I did what any true - blooded geek does when he or she wants to find out about a new topic : I googled it .
But what I found was scattered , often contradictory , and for a newbie like me , downright confusing .
A lot of the information out there is tied to specific social contexts : the workplace , the nightclub , and dating , mainly .
And a lot of it ’s quite vague – the answer to most questions is “ it depends on your personal style ” which I ’m sure it does , but what if you do n’t know your personal style yet ?!
With some perseverance , a few trips to department stores , and the help of friends on Twitter , I managed to assemble the following rules .
As with all rules , they ’re meant to be broken – but only by people who know how to break them .
For the rest of us , this is a pretty good primer on basic men ’s fashion .
Dress Suits
1 . You eventually want to own three suits .
Your first suit should be either navy blue or gray , possibly with a light chalk stripe ( like a pinstripe , but softer ) , and in an all - season , medium weight .
Either of these colors will fit into most social settings .
Your second suit should be the one you did n’t get the first time around .
Your third should be black – not for funerals , but for black tie affairs .
If you work in a field where suits are the norm , you ’ll probably want more than three ; once you ’ve covered the basics , you can move on to more distinctive suits ( pinstripes , different weights , unconventional colors , etc. ) .
2. Suits are made of wool or cotton .
Higher thread counts signify higher quality , but are ironically not as durable , so stick with something mid-range .
Ask the salesperson to help you with this .
( Yes , ask the salesperson .
Suits are not self - serve . )
Synthetic fibers need not apply .
3 . You never button the bottom button .
Apparently , Edward VII got fat and could n’t button his vest over his belly , so now nobody does .
On a three - button jacket , you button the middle ; the top button is optional .
If you have a jacket with 4 or more button , you obviously know what you ’re doing already .
4 . A gentleman carries a handkerchief in his front breast pocket .
You do n’t have to get fancy , just fold it square to fit and have 1 / 4 ” to 1/2 ” sticking out the top .
Then proffer it as needed .
And wash it after .
Shirts
1 . Do n’t wear your sleeves too short or too long .
1/4 ” to 1/2 ” of cuff should show beyond your jacket sleeve .
Advertising
2. Shirts with button - down collars are not dress shirts .
They ’re sports shirts , so wear them with a sports coat .
Polo players used to button their collars down so they would n’t flap up in their face while they played .
( Are you beginning to sense a theme here ?
Fashion rules are largely dictated by what English gentleman and nobility did generations or even centuries ago .
Sports coats ?
You wore them during sport , i.e. hunting .
Regimental stripes on ties ?
They indicated your regiment in the British military .
And so on . )
3 . If you unbutton your collar , remove your tie .
You can wear a suit or sports coat without a tie – just ask Obama – but wearing a tie with an unbuttoned shirt looks sloppy .
4 . You can unbutton the top button always ( provided you ’re not wearing a tie ) , the second button usually , the third button only on disco night at the Rollerama .
Trousers
1 . Wear your pants at your natural waist .
Too high and you look like Grampa , too low and you look like a high school kid .
Your waistband should sit 2 - 3 inches below your belly button .
2. Pants should almost touch the ground without your shoes on .
Jeans can be a little longer , since they shrink a bit when you wash them .
3 . One pleat , maximum .
If you ’re a big guy , like I am , you learned somewhere along the line that pleats are slimming .
They ’re not .
At best , they look like you ’re a big guy trying to look slimmer ; at worst , they actually make you look heavier because they pull out across you , broadening your appearance .
In any case , the job of a pleat is to maintain that crease sown the front of your pants .
For pants without that crease ( and many with it ) , pleats are unnecessary ; for pants that need the pleat , they only need one .
4. 1 ” to 1 1/2 ” cuffs .
Or not .
There ’s nothing wrong with cuffs , there ’s nothing wrong with no cuffs .
They are understood , however , to be an older man ’s style – not in a bad way , think sophisticated , experienced , distinguished , and conservative .
For younger men , a cleaner line is generally preferred .
Advertising
5 . A useful piece of trivia for the American abroad : in British English , “ pants ” are underwear .
So if , for instance , you are in London and get invited out and maybe your trousers are dirty from work , do n’t say “ I ’d love to go out , I just need to go home and change my pants first . ”
And if someone should ask , “ Why , are your pants dirty ? ” , do n’t say , “ Yeah , I always get my pants dirty at work . ”
You will be laughed at .
Er , I assume .
Shoes
1. Pay attention to your shoes .
Everyone else does .
It ’s hard for the non-fashion - maven to tell a more expensive suit from a less expensive one , a high - quality shirt from a medium - quality one , and so on .
But everyone can tell cheap or poorly cared - for shoes .
Buy the best ones you can afford , and take care of them .
Polish them regularly ( a few swipes with a wax - infused polishing cloth is often all it takes ) and store them covered if you wo n’t be wearing them for a long time .
Shoe trees , it turns out , are important : they not only hold the shape of the shoe but the cedar ones absorb moisture ( and thus odors ) which helps preserve the leather .
( Aside : women tend to pay a lot of attention to men ’s shoes .
Keep that in mind when a ) dating , and b ) interviewing for a job . )
2 . Shoes are made of leather ( besides sneakers ) .
Anything not made of leather you can consider a non -shoe .
Leather breathes and adapts to the shape of your foot .
The soles do n’t have to be leather , but the uppers do .
( True story : as a young man , my brother was a car salesman here in Vegas .
In the summer , the tarmac could get well over 150 degrees F. Standing out there with leather - soled shoes could give you second - degree burns !
So they wore rubber soles , which melted after a month or two and had to be replaced . )
3 . You need more than one pair of shoes , but not too much more .
Black oxfords ( lace - up dress shoes ) , black loafers ( slip - on shoes ) , brown oxfords or loafers , and you ’re set ( not counting your athletic shoes , of course ) .
A pair of ankle - high boots in black or brown can substitute for the loafers .
Ox - blood ( burgundy ) shoes are harder to find but in theory go with everything .
You can pretty safely ignore white shoes .
4 . The shinier the shoe , the dressier .
Matte - finish shoes – nubuck ( that pebbly leather ) , suede , and distressed leather shoes are automatically compatible with jeans or khakis ; shinier shoes might still go with jeans but it depends on the rest of your outfit , the dressier you are the shinier your shoes can be .
If you can wear them with a suit , you probably can’t wear them with jeans , and vice versa .
5 . Shoes should be the same tone or darker than your pants .
This is all the rule you need to know when trying to figure out what shoes to wear .
This is why you never wear brown shoes with black trousers , but you can usually wear black shoes with brown trousers .
When in doubt , wear black .
Accessories
1. Match your belt to your shoes .
It does n’t have to be a perfect match , as long as you wear a black belt with black shoes and a brown belt with brown shoes .
Advertising
2 . Match your socks to your pants .
Again , it does n’t have to be a perfect match – a little lighter or darker is fine .
If you do n’t have socks to match your pants , you can match your shoes , or just wear black socks .
3 . White socks are for sports .
Only .
Unless you are a ) wearing sneakers , and b ) doing something athletic in them , avoid white socks .
4 . Your tie should reach your belt .
Anything short of your belt makes you look like a rube .
5 . Try a front - pocket wallet or money clip .
This will save wear - and - tear on your back pocket ( helping to avoid the heartbreak of “ buttsquare ” ) , help avoid pickpockets ( a little – the good ones know … ) , and save your back .
Plus : classy !
6 . You ’re allowed one affectation .
A fedora .
A pocket watch .
A bracelet or class ring .
A vest ( if you ’re not wearing a three - piece suit ) .
An expensive wristwatch .
Pick one , but no more – give your whatever - it - is space to say whatever - it - says .
If it feels like these rules are arbitrary and stifling , they are .
Think of it like learning how to paint : first , you do a still - life ( arbitrary ) using just one color ( stifling ) .
Eventually you move up to two and three colors , then maybe a warm or cool palette , and your subjects might expand to include figures or landscapes .
Once you ’ve mastered the basics , you can begin to press against the rules , juxtaposing non-complementary colors or painting unconventional subjects .
In fashion as in art – style emerges not from a lack of rules but from a mastery of them , from making them serve you instead of the other way around .
If you ’re a geek like me , you need to dial a fresh start – clear your closets of all those conference freebie t- shirts , put a shine on your shoes , and burn your butt - crack pants .
Ultimately , these rules are not at all about tamping down your personality but about learning how to express it .
And unfair as it is , people will take you more seriously when you dress with a modicum of style .
Anyone else have tips for the newcomer to the world of style ?

Tara Kolla fancied herself a green thumb - turned - green businesswoman when she planted an organic flower plot in her yard and sold poppies , sweet peas , and zinnias at the local farmers ' market .
For her neighbors , it was an eyesore .
Where Ms. Kolla saw her efforts as creating a lush sanctuary , her neighbors witnessed dusty pots , steaming compost , flies , and a funky aroma on their tiny cul - de-sac in Los Angeles .
They complained to zoning officials — and prevailed .
Kolla and other urban farmers are fighting back by challenging City Halls across the country to rewrite ordinances that govern residential gardens .
They believe that feeding their fellow urbanites homegrown tomatoes , fresh eggs , and sweet corn will change the world one backyard at a time .
Seattle has loosened its rules for backyard goats , New York City 's health department is taking steps to legalize beekeeping , and Detroit is looking into regulating compost and greenhouses .
In Detroit , where zoning laws ban growing crops and raising livestock for profit , city planner Kathryn Lynch Underwood is part of a work group rewriting the regulations and defining what kinds of urban farms might need more oversight .
" The city has not been treating it as an illegal use or a nuisance because it has been a good thing , " Ms. Underwood says .
She is hopeful that urban agriculture and the city 's nearly 1,000 community gardens will create good jobs in a city that desperately needs them and put vacant lots to use in blighted neighborhoods .
Kolla , meanwhile , found a loophole allowing her to grow vegetables while lobbying for the right to set up a city farm at her home just four miles from the urban jungle of downtown Los Angeles .
The challenge for cities is to balance the potential to grow green businesses with the concerns of neighbors who do n't want a thriving , for - profit enterprise next door , never mind the noise and smells that come from compost and small livestock .
Urban agriculture crosses jurisdictional lines , says Alfonso Morales , a professor of planning at the University of Wisconsin .
He advises cities to set up a one - stop - shop for urban farms , like they have for small business development , so that city farmers can deal with zoning , home business regulations and nuisance laws all in one place .
" There 's such enthusiasm that people push the laws and upset their neighbors , " he says .
" The fact is , you can't do anything you want on your property . "
While most urban farms operate under the radar of city officials , and many neighborhoods welcome productive plots and even backyard chickens , other city growers run into trouble with neighbors who wo n't be placated with gifts of salad greens or fresh eggs .
In middle - class areas , concerns about property values and aesthetic differences lead to conflicts .
Kolla alienated neighbors on her quiet cul - de-sac of Spanish bungalows and neat green lawns in the city 's Silver Lake section when she began peddling organic bouquets at farmers ' markets that she grew on her 21,000 square - foot lot .
" They 're trying to grow it into something bigger than what should be in a small neighborhood , " says Frank San Juan , who lives across the street from Kolla .
" When she started having these gardening workshops without telling anybody , there was no parking .
You could n't enjoy your weekends . "
Just a half century ago , Los Angeles was transforming itself from the most lucrative farm county in the nation into a major metropolis .
A zoning ordinance written in 1946 as developers were cutting down the San Fernando Valley 's citrus orchards to build suburbia allowed small farms to grow vegetables to truck to market , but banned growing fruit , nuts , or flowers for sale on residential plots .
Kolla could get a conditional use permit , but she has a stubborn streak and it costs $ 15,000 just to apply .
She and others are trying to reverse the zoning laws with a proposal called " The Food and Flowers Freedom Act . "
Growers from across Los Angeles formed the Urban Farming Advocates to rally around Kolla and defend her right to grow and lobby the city .
" Most people would pay to have a view of her backyard , " says founding member Erik Knutzen , who keeps chickens and grows food in his yard .
" I can understand someone not wanting 50 roosters or an autobody shop next door , but our proposal is about bringing common sense back to our lives . "
In July , City Council President Eric Garcetti introduced a motion to clarify city policies on urban farms and allow cultivation and sale of flowers , fruits , nuts , or vegetables .
While the city farmers wait patiently for the proposal to work its way through the planning commission , Kolla started a weekly vegetable box subscription service so as not to miss too many of southern California 's long growing seasons .
She feels the distinction between vegetables and fruit is arbitrary and unscientific .
" Broccoli is a flower , and a tomato is a fruit .
And some of my flowers are edible , " Kolla says .
" It 's more legal for people to grow marijuana in L.A. than flowers . "

If you want to find an up - to - date map of Haiti , then there is only one place to go .
It is not Google Maps or any of its competitors .
It is the admirable OpenStreetMap.org ( OSM ) , which is being updated even as I write by volunteers all over the world .
It is the Wikipedia of the mapping world , and is used by millions of people .
Started a little over five years ago in London by Steve Coast , it has steadily built up its database to the point where most of the world has now been mapped by a formidable team of volunteers which is doubling every six months : there were 212,000 at the last count , of whom 10 % are active during any one month .
At the end of January there were 239 people rebuilding the map of Haiti .
For a bird 's eye view of operations , go to the Ushahidi site .
When the earthquake happened it was a signal for OSM members around the globe to start downloading satellite images ( either freely available or donated by Yahoo ) and then to start tracing the outlines of streets on top so a map emerged .
Volunteers on the ground in Haiti , often using Garmin GPS locators , added vital local information – such as which roads were passable , where the hospitals were situated , where refugee camps were , or walls , pharmacies , hedges and so forth – so rescue workers had an invaluable tool .
The result is a new , detailed map that is updated frequently , unlike most commercial maps .
This is only one of a number of open projects operating in Haiti in what may come to be seen as a seminal moment in the harnessing of the web to help those in need .
Others include CrisisCommons , WeHaveNeed , Sahana , open source medical software and numerous others , not to mention Twitter tags such as #haiti .
One of the problems of using appropriate technology in disaster regions is that bricklayers in Haiti do n't know of innovations that might have been pioneered in remote parts of Africa , a problem that Akvo is trying to solve with regard to water .
There are also signs that Hexayurt low - cost housing projects are starting to seed in Haiti .
OpenStreetMaps is itself at a turning point as it tries to progress from a techie - driven project to one that the ordinary consumer can not only understand but contribute to as well .
It suffers from what might be dubbed " open source syndrome " , a complaint that also affects other OS projects including the Linux operating system – the involvement of skilled volunteers can make the early stages a bit difficult to understand for laypeople .
However , they have been working on it and it is now much easier to do .
A few days ago I added my local curry house to the map ( next to a post box someone else had already inserted ) .
All I needed to do was to drag a symbol of a restaurant from the bottom of the screen to where I wanted to put it and then add the words " Indian Diner " .
That in a nutshell is the comparative advantage that OpenStreetMap claims over other online maps .
Users can add whatever detail interests them such as cycle routes , skateboarding areas , cycle parks , paths through parks – the parts Google can't reach .
You have to register ( it 's free ) as a member to alter the map .
There is an iPhone app , Mapzen , produced by Cloudmade ( company founded by Coast and Nick Black to exploit mapping opportunities ) that enables you to insert places of interest you have found on the move .
If that takes off , it could lift the project to a new level .
Often volunteers create maps where there was nothing before as in Kibera in Kenya where basic amenities such as drinking water sources and latrines as well as churches are located to improve living standards and combat illness ( eg , where latrines are located too near water sources ) .
The Kibera team have been asked by Ushahidi and Google to include mapping of the slums of Port - au - Prince as part of the relief effort , something that has n't been done before .
Gordon Brown , the UK prime minister , has just rediscovered cooperativism as a way of galvanising people to vote Labour .
He would have been much more in tune with the times if he had widened it to include the open source movement in all its different aspects .
It is one of the most interesting phenomena of our times , a kind of global mutual society .
While the likes of Apple and Amazon , though producing fantastic products , are becoming ever more controlling and proprietary , it is sobering to be reminded that one of the basic instincts of human nature – mutual cooperation for no cost – is thriving on a global scale .

Although the power increase is small , the concept could lead to solar cells that break conventional efficiency limits .
Michael Naughton , a physics professor at Boston College , and others have designed an ultra - thin ( 15 - nanometer - thick ) solar cell , which hot electrons can quickly pass through before cooling .
In conventional , thicker solar cells , only the " cooler " lower - energy electrons that have longer wavelengths can pass through .
When a conventional solar cell absorbs a high - energy photon , it produces a hot electron that quickly loses much of its energy as heat before it can pass through the cell and be used to generate electricity .
Although solar cells can be designed to absorb high - energy photons and use hot electrons , they are n't able to absorb low - energy photons as well .
The new solar cell design , however , can absorb both .
Theoretically , solar cells that can absorb hot and cool electrons could nearly double their power efficiency .
Conventional solar cells can convert at most about 35 % of sunlight energy into electricity , and the rest is wasted as heat .
By absorbing the hot electrons , solar cells could achieve efficiencies of up to 67 % , according to an article in MIT 's Technology Review .
By doubling the efficiency , the cost of solar power could be cut in half .
There are still challenges with the new ultra - thin solar cells , however .
Because they 're so thin , most of the light passes through them , so they only convert about 3 % of incoming light into electricity .
But past research has shown that adding nanowires to the solar cells could allow them to absorb more light while still keeping a short travel distance for the electrons .
In addition , the scientists are investigating incorporating quantum dots into the nanowires to increase the number of electrons collected from the absorbed light .

Extinct : Andaman tribe ’s extermination complete as last member dies
February 4 , 2010
Boa
Sr was the last member of the Bo tribe .
© Alok Das
The last member of a unique tribe has died on India ’s Andaman Islands .
Boa
Sr , who died last week aged around 85 , was the last speaker of ‘ Bo ’ , one of the ten Great Andamanese languages .
The Bo are thought to have lived in the Andaman Islands for as much as 65,000 years , making them the descendants of one of the oldest human cultures on Earth .
Boa
Sr was the oldest of the Great Andamanese , who now number just 52 .
Originally ten distinct tribes , the Great Andamanese were 5,000 strong when the British colonized the Andaman Islands in 1858 .
Most were killed or died of diseases brought by the colonizers .
Having failed to ‘ pacify ’ the tribes through violence , the British tried to ‘ civilize ’ them by capturing many and keeping them in an ‘ Andaman Home ’ .
Of the 150 children born in the home , none lived beyond the age of two .
The surviving Great Andamanese depend largely on the Indian government for food and shelter , and abuse of alcohol is rife .
Boa
Sr survived the Asian tsunami of December 2004 , and told linguists , ‘ We were all there when the earthquake came .
The eldest told us ‘ the Earth would part , do n’t run away or move ’ .
The elders told us , that ’s how we know . ’
Linguist Prof. Anvita Abbi , who knew Boa Sr for many years , said , ‘ Since she was the only speaker of [ Bo ] she was very lonely as she had no one to converse with …
Boa Sr. had a very good sense of humour and her smile and full throated laughter were infectious . ’
‘ You cannot imagine the pain and anguish that I spend each day in being a mute witness to the loss of a remarkable culture and unique language . ’
Boa Sr told Abbi she felt the neighbouring Jarawa tribe , who have not been decimated , were lucky to live in their forest away from the settlers who now occupy much of the Islands .
Survival ’s director Stephen Corry said today , ‘ The Great Andamanese were first massacred , then all but wiped out by paternalistic policies which left them ravaged by epidemics of disease , and robbed of their land and independence .
‘ With the death of Boa Sr and the extinction of the Bo language , a unique part of human society is now just a memory .
Boa ’s loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands . ’

ULTRAVIOLET light has long been used in water - treatment plants to help with disinfection .
As long as the water is clear enough not to absorb the rays , exposing it to a discharge lamp will destroy the DNA of viruses , bacteria and protozoa that could otherwise cause illness when swallowed .
The ultraviolet that exists in sunshine can also be used this way .
A rough and ready method for sanitising water , for example , is to pour some into a clear plastic bottle , aerate it by shaking and then place it in the sun for six hours .
Now a group of German companies including KACO , a solar - power firm , have gone one better .
They have developed an industrial - scale solar - driven purification system that removes not only bugs but also chemical pollutants .
The first of their devices has been built as demonstration project at the German Aerospace Centre in Lampoldshausen .
This organisation , which was among the group of developers , wanted to clean the water that it uses to cool its experimental engines .
This cooling water inevitably gets contaminated both with rocket fuel and with substances produced by that fuel 's combustion .
The trick the researchers use to boost the cleansing action of ultraviolet is to add a light - activated catalyst to the effluent .
They have come up with two sorts , one for heavily polluted water and one for water that is only lightly polluted .
For water containing serious industrial contaminants , like that at Lampoldshausen , they use iron sulphate as the catalyst and add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid to assist the process .
Thus treated , the water is pumped through arrays of transparent glass tubes in a 49 metre - long solar reactor .
In a complex series of reactions , one of which is promoted by ultraviolet light , the iron reacts with both the hydrogen peroxide and some of the water itself to produce powerful oxidising agents known as hydroxyl radicals .
These destroy the polluting molecules .
Once the water has been cleaned , the acid is neutralised , causing the iron to become insoluble .
It precipitates out as iron oxide and can then be recovered and recycled , leaving water pure enough to discharge into a river .
For less heavily polluted water , similar equipment is used , except that the glass tubes are coated with titanium dioxide .
This substance is a semiconductor , meaning that when electrons ( which are negatively charged ) are knocked free from its crystal structure , the result is a positively charged “ hole ” that can move around inside the crystal .
This hole is also a powerful oxidiser .
One of the ways a hole can be created is for the electron to be displaced by ultraviolet light .
A titanium - dioxide system , which is still in development , could purify water to the point where it was suitable not merely for discharge , but for drinking .
The iron - sulphate system at Lampoldshausen , meanwhile , is capable of treating 4,500 litres of waste water in an hour or two .
It would be even more efficient in sunnier climes , and these are expected to become the main market for the process , which KACO has started to produce under the brand name RayWOx .
The German Aerospace Centre reckons RayWOx will be good at removing certain pollutants that are particularly hard to get rid of at the moment , notably antibiotics , X - ray contrast media and hormones .
KACO , meanwhile , says it will be able to supply the system complete with photovoltaic cells to power both the control electronics and the pumps , making it not just cheap to operate , but also ideologically sound — a green , mean , cleaning machine , powered entirely by the sun .
Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 23 January 2010
Like many people , you ’re possibly afraid to share your views on animal experiments , because you do n’t want anyone digging up your grandmother ’s grave , or setting fire to your house , or stuff like that .
Animal experiments are necessary , they need to be properly regulated , and we have some of the tightest regulation in the world .
But it ’s easy to assess whether animals are treated well , or to assess whether an experiment was necessary .
In the nerd corner there is another issue : is the research well conducted , and are the results properly communicated ?
If it ’s not , then animals have suffered – whatever you believe that might mean for an animal – partly in vain .
The National Centre for the Replacement , Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research was set up by the government in 2004 .
It has published , in the academic journal PLoS One , a systematic survey of the quality of reporting , experimental design and statistical analysis of recently published biomedical research using laboratory animals .
It ’s so not good .
The study is pretty solid .
They describe the strategy they used to search for papers , which is important , because you do n’t want to be like a homeopath , and only quote the papers that support your conclusions : you want to have a representative sample of all the literature .
And the papers they found covered a huge range of publicly funded research , behavioural and diet studies , drug and chemical testing , immunological experiments , and more .
Some of the flaws they discovered were bizarre .
Four per cent of papers did n’t mention how many animals were used in the experiment , anywhere .
The researchers looked in detail at 48 studies that did say how many they used : not one explained why they had chosen their particular number of animals .
Thirty - five per cent of the papers gave one figure for the number of animals used in the methods , and then a different number of animals appeared in the results .
That ’s pretty disorganised .
They looked at how many studies used basic strategies to reduce bias in their results , like randomisation and blinding .
If you ’re comparing one intervention against another , for example , and you do n’t randomly assign animals to each group , then it ’s possible you might unconsciously put the stronger animals in the group getting a potentially beneficial experimental intervention , or vice versa , thus distorting your results .
If you do n’t “ blind ” , then you know , as the experimenter , which animals had which intervention .
So you might allow that knowledge , even unconsciously , to affect close calls on measurements you take .
Or maybe you ’ll accept a high blood pressure reading when you expected it to be high , knowing what you do about your own experiment , but then double check a high blood pressure measurement in an animal where you expected it to be low .
Only 12 % of the animal studies used randomisation .
Only 14 % used blinding .
And the reporting was often poor .
Only 8 % gave the raw data , allowing you to go back and do your own analysis .
About half the studies left the numbers of animals in each group out of their tables .
I grew up friends with the daughters of Colin Blakemore , a neuroscientist in Oxford who spoke out to defend animal research at great personal risk .
My first kiss – not one of these sisters , I should say – was outside a teenage party in a church hall , in front of two special branch officers sitting in a car with their lights off .
People who threaten the lives of 15 - year - old girls , to shut their father up , are beneath contempt .
People who fail to damn these threats are similarly contemptible .
That ’s why it sticks in the throat to say that the reporting and conduct of animal research is often poor ; but we have to be more grown up .
For anyone who participated , please remember that you can " un-fan " Chase to remove yourself from their Facebook network .

GENERAL PROGRAM INFORMATION
What is Chase Community Giving ?
Chase Community
Giving is a program run by Chase that will allow Facebook users to vote for local charities and non-profits , and help direct Chase corporate philanthropy dollars to eligible organizations in the following focus areas : education , healthcare , housing , the environment , combating hunger , arts and culture , human services , and animal welfare .
The grassroots campaign aims to inspire a new way of corporate philanthropy .
The eligible charity receiving the most votes will be awarded $ 1 million , the top five runners - up will receive $ 100,000 each and the 100 finalists , including the top winners , will be awarded $ 25,000 each .
Additionally , a special Advisory Board led by prominent national philanthropists will allocate $ 1 million to the nominated charities of its choice .
How long does the program run ?
Chase will use Facebook to allow participants of the Chase Community Giving program to select local causes and organizations in need of support focused on the issues that matter most , enabling those organizations to make further tangible progress toward their missions .
Voting for Round 1 ends December 11 .
Voting for Round 2 ends January 22 , 2010 and the top charities will be announced on or around February 1 .
What is the role of the Advisory Board ?
The Chase Community Giving Advisory Board was formed to embody the spirit of giving back to local causes and the importance of community giving .
The role of the Advisory Board will be to review the 100 finalists from Round 1 and the winners of Round 2 as determined by participant votes to help ensure the finalists meet the eligibility requirements and standards of the program .
The Advisory Board will also choose one or more organizations , from those organizations receiving at least one vote , to be awarded a combined total of an additional $ 1 million .
Why do I need to become a fan of Chase Community Giving and provide access to my information ?
Will I receive e-mail communications from Chase by becoming a fan ?
The purpose of allowing access and becoming a fan of Chase Community Giving is so that administrators are able to track participant votes and to allow participants to spread the word of the program by giving users ability to comment on the charities that they vote for , and to notify friends about the program .
We hope that participants will use the fan page to create awareness around the opportunity for charities to receive donations totaling millions of dollars from Chase 's philanthropy fund .
It has no direct tie to Chase mail or email campaigns .
How will the winners be determined ?
Voting for Round 1 will go from 11/15/09 until 11:59:59 p.m. ET on 12/11/09 .
Voting for Round 2 will go from 01/15/10 until 11:59:59 p.m. ET on 01/22/10 .
Winners from both Rounds will be determined once the votes have been tallied and it has been determined that all program eligibility standards and requirements have been met .
I am a member of the media and would like to contact someone at Chase about the program , who can I reach out to ?
Media inquiries should be directed to JPMorgan Chase corporate media relations .

Visit this Facebook page and vote for Erowid before Saturday Dec 12th .
Help Erowid Center raise $ 25,000 !
Vote for Erowid here in Chase Bank 's giveaway on Facebook .
In late November / early December 2009 , the mega bank JPMorgan Chase offered $ 25,000 USD each to 100 charities , supposedly to be selected by Facebook members through a Facebook - only online " app " .
Erowid learned of the giveaway , and of the current vote totals of the apparent highest vote - getters , only 72 hours before the deadline .
Despite this short timeframe we suspected that it might be within our ability to muster enough community support to win .
So we charged into the competition , sending out email announcements and added messages to page headers across Erowid.org , asking visitors to vote for us at Facebook .
While vote totals were publicly listed throughout the first part of the contest , 48 hours before the declared end of the voting period , those running the contest chose to hide the totals .
Then , rather than announcing the top 100 vote - getters as the winners , they appear to have selected the winners they preferred , violating the terms and spirit of their contest .
They appear to have based this decision on the small - print caveat that they had a ' terms and conditions ' page specifying Chase could disqualify any group " at its sole discretion " .
Chase chose to disqualify and exclude all psychoactive drug- related charities , such as Students for Sensible Drug Policy ( SSDP ) , a group that sent out a complaint email after losing this obviously rigged game .
SSDP has since set up the ChaseBoycott.com website .
Thepublished an article mentioning the controversy .
Others have also discussed the problems with this contest ( e.g. Beth 's Blog ) .
It is worth noting that charities such as Erowid Center did not need to do anything to be listed as a selectable charity in the contest .
Facebook / Chase had created a database of charities eligible to receive votes and Erowid Center was already present in the list when we first became aware of the contest and started asking our supporters for votes .
Facebook / Chase reportedly created the list at least partially out of the GuideStar database of U.S. nonprofits .
In an extremely disingenous statement , Chase wrote " Regarding the vote tallies , we have taken down individual charity counts with a couple of days left to build excitement among the broadest number of participants , as well as to ensure that all Facebook users learn of the 100 finalists at the same time and so we have an opportunity to notify the 100 finalists first . "
If there was a single thing that killed enthusiasm for voting , it was blacking out the vote counts near the end .
It is unequivocally clear that the reason for their not supplying a leader board , for taking down the vote totals before the contest was over , and for not publishing the results after the end of the contest is that they selected the winners with little regard for the voting process they advertised .
Facebook was also complicit in the deceit , as their representatives were part of the Chase Community Giving Advisory Board and likely facilitated the game design and implementation on their site .
Further adding to the annoyance , the Facebook / Chase voting app was poorly designed and extremely buggy .
Many who tried to use it on December 10th or 11th , the final days of the contest , were treated to slow - loading pages ( we timed them at up to 4 minutes ) that frequently failed to load properly at all .
Even when an app page loaded successfully , it required the user to visit a number of pages , some of which required the user to click their browser 's " back " button to complete their vote .
Every aspect of this voting app , from design , to coding , to " functionality " seemed poorly implemented .
Because of these failures , Chase / Facebook extended the contest by an extra day at the last minute , and ran through Saturday , December 12th .
When we made the decision to ask Erowid supporters to play this Facebook / Chase game , our crew discussed the probability that Chase would cheat and disqualify us if we won their contest .
Because we had this concern from the start , we thought we'd take this opportunity to review our decision to participate , with an eye to the time costs involved for Erowid Center and our supporters who took part .
On December 9th , after a half - day of asking people to vote for us , and at the latest time Chase displayed vote totals , we had 532 votes ; votes were coming in for Erowid Center at about one per minute late in the evening when the totals were removed .
We estimated that we would end with over 2000 votes on Friday evening , the original voting deadline .
Because of the near total collapse of their software on Thursday , December 10th and part of Friday , December 11th , we have little confidence that our voters were able to register their votes with the system .
We got numerous emails from supporters letting us know that they had been unable to get the voting app to work properly .
We sent out two announcement emails mentioning the Facebook / Chase game .
These announcements were each sent to around 16,000 unique email addresses and each message would have taken about 15 - 30 seconds to read .
We estimate that about one quarter of our announcement list subscribers would have read the announcements completely , that one quarter would skim them quickly ( 15 seconds ) , one quarter would read just the subject line ( 5 seconds ) , and one quarter would n't spend any time on them at all ( 0 seconds ) .
That works out to an average of 12.5 seconds of person time per announcement sent .
We put up four different header messages on the site in rotation with other donation - related messages , put a link on our front ( splash ) page for about 30 hours , and had a link on the main psychoactives index page for 3 days .
We have a count of the number of people ( IPs ) who clicked on a given link and assume that each person who clicked on the link at leastat the resulting Facebook page .
Some voted , or tried to vote , and some registered a new account to try to vote .
We also have a count of the number of page views served .
Because of the pathetic performance of the Facebook / Chase app , it is hard to estimate how long each voter spent attempting to vote in the game .
We 've estimated 120 seconds per person who actually clicked on the links , although some people reported it took up to 15 minutes to register and vote .
For those who did not click on the links but were just exposed to the links on pages they viewed , we estimate one second per page - view for the splash page , because we so rarely add anything new to the front page of the site , a quarter second average per page - view for the main psychoactives index , and a tenth of a second average per display of each header message .
Those estimates are based on most people not even paying any attention to such messages , since experienced web surfers have necessarily become good at ignoring page clutter .
To actually read the link message text takes 2 - 5 seconds and probably 10 - 30 seconds if one stops to consider the link briefly before clicking .
Paid Erowid crew spent a total of around 10 hours on writing , editing , posting messages , and responding to messages about the contest .
We really appreciate the many supporters who braved the truly awful Facebook experience to try to help us win the $ 25,000 USD grant from JPMorgan Chase .
We also want to thank SSDP for taking the lead in complaining about the way Chase handled this contest .
One small benefit is simply documenting that Erowid , SSDP , MPP , and similar organizations are still outside the acceptable limits for mainstream funding sources .
We rely on the support of visitors and those who understand the importance of accurate information about psychoactives .
Thanks to everyone for their slice of the 10 days of person time wasted on this Facebook - facilitated fraud .
This is n't the way you should learn about the death of your 17 - year - old brother .
According to Sydney 's Daily Telegraph , twins Angela and Maryanne Vourlis had just woken up on their 20th birthday .
Like most young adults , they logged onto Facebook to check their walls and inboxes for birthday greetings .
Instead of finding happy birthday wishes , the twins found messages of " RIP Bobby " ( their brother ) and " RIP Chris Naylor " ( a friend of his ) all across their Facebook newsfeeds .
Completely shocked , baffled and hurt , the two rang their brother 's phone in the hopes that it was a mistake .
It was to no avail .
Next , they rang their mother .
While she did n't receive any word from the police or others about Bobby or Chris Naylor , she did know that Bobby was with his friend that night .
After a call to the police , they confirmed what they had learned on Facebook : That Bobby Vourlis was dead .
He passed away along with Chris Naylor in a fatal car accident that also took the life of a third teenage passenger .
You can read the whole heartbreaking story over at the Daily Telegraph , but it 's clear that the real - time nature of the web spread information far faster than even the police or phone calls could .
While we understand it takes time to identify victims and send an officer to a residence to inform family of the news , the process can simply take too long in today 's world .
We offer our condolences to both families for the tragedy they are enduring .
We could not imagine learning about it the way they did .

Six British - Israelis say they are not the men pictured in the suspects ' passports UK authorities are launching an inquiry into how fraudulent British passports were used by the alleged killers of a Hamas commander in Dubai .
The Serious Organised Crime Agency will look at how passports bearing the names of six British - Israelis were linked to the murder of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Dubai police believe 11 " agents with European passports " killed him .
The Foreign Office has summoned the Israeli ambassador for a meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter .
Israel says there is no evidence that its security service Mossad had any involvement in the killing .
However , several commentators say it bears the hallmarks of a Mossad assassination .
Among them is Labour 's Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Mike Gapes who says if it was not carried out by Israel it was by " someone trying to make sure it looks like the Israelis " .
ANALYSIS Katya Adler , BBC Middle East correspondent Israel is alive with rumour as to whether Israel 's intelligence service , Mossad , murdered Hamas operative Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Mossad has used fraudulent foreign passports and stolen identities to carry out its missions in the past , provoking diplomatic rows with a number of friendly countries .
Former Israeli secret service officer , Gad Shimron , says agents steal identities to escape tougher security checks .
But would Mossad want to point the finger at innocent Israeli citizens ?
At least five of the names listed by Dubai match those of Israeli dual nationals .
Maybe Mossad thought this was a clear way , without making a public declaration , of letting the world know it organised the murder - thereby sending a warning to Israel 's enemies abroad .
It is possible another country masterminded the attack , designing it to look like a clumsy Mossad operation .
Or maybe Israel co-operated with others .
Pictures of ' 11 Europeans ' Israel 's ' covert killing ' history
No proof of Dubai hit - Israel " Israel has ... a policy of targeted assassinations , " he said , adding its agents had previously used faked passports from friendly countries , despite assuring Britain in 1986 that the practice would stop .
But Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israeli Army Radio : " There is no reason to think that it was the Israeli Mossad and not some other intelligence service or country up to some mischief . "
Israel had a " policy of ambiguity " on intelligence matters , he added .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told London's LBC 97.3 FM radio station : " The evidence has to be assembled about what actually happened , about how it happened and why .
" We have to make sure everything is being done to protect [ the British passport ] . "
On Wednesday night , the Foreign Office pledged " to take all the action that is necessary to protect British nationals from identity fraud " .
It said the British embassy in Tel Aviv was ready to support those affected by the Hamas shooting case .
" We need to ensure a full investigation is carried out into the fraudulent use of these passports , " the Foreign Office said .
" The Serious Organised Crime Agency ( SOCA ) will lead this investigation , in close co-operation with the Emirati authorities . "
SOCA has confirmed that photographs and signatures on the passports used in Dubai do not match those on passports issued by the UK .
The Conservatives have called on Foreign Secretary David Miliband to spell out what action he had taken to find out how UK passports were used .
In a letter , shadow foreign secretary William Hague asked when the Foreign Office first learned of suspicions about the passports and what contacts Mr Miliband had made with Israeli officials .
Mr Hague said the alleged forgery was " a matter of great concern " and raised the possibility it could happen in cases involving terrorism .
" We need to know if the home secretary and foreign secretary are confident that existing mechanisms are sufficient to prevent further such abuses from happening , " he added .
' In shock ' Dr Rosemary Hollis , a Middle East analyst from London 's City University , said the development would " raise suspicions " generally that British travellers " might conceivably be up to no good " .
The men who share names with the suspects have dual British and Israeli citizenship .
They are Melvyn Adam Mildiner , Paul John Keeley , James Leonard Clarke , Stephen Daniel Hodes , Michael Lawrence Barney and Jonathan Lewis Graham .
They all deny involvement in the killing .
The details of the suspects and their passport photos were released by officials in Dubai earlier this week .

Salford - born Mr Hodes , 37 , said he had not left Israel for two years and was " in shock " .
" I do n't know who 's behind this .
I am just scared , these are major forces , " he told Israeli television .
Mr Mildiner , 31 , told the Jerusalem Post : " Clearly it is n't me .
" The details are not correct .
The date of birth is wrong .
I went to bed with pneumonia and woke up a murderer , " he said .
The men's family names are not common in Israel , according to the BBC's Middle East correspondent , Katya Adler .
The Irish Republic 's government has confirmed that numbers on suspects ' passports were legitimate .
But Dublin said they did not match records for the names of Gail Folliard , Evan Dennings and Kevin Daveron , which had been used .
Its Department of Foreign Affairs said officials were urgently trying to contact the three citizens who hold or have held passports with these numbers .
France and Germany have also reportedly raised doubts over the identities of two suspects who used a French and a German passport .
Hamas killing Police in Dubai have released images of 27 people they believe are behind the killing of a senior Hamas commander .
The suspects are accused of using fake passports bearing their own pictures , but the names of innocent citizens .
Twelve of the passports used were British ( shown on previous slide ) .
The other 15 on the list are reported to have used stolen identities from Australian , French , Irish and German citizens .
The 27th suspect used the alias Joshua Aaron Krycer - a stolen Australian identity ( pictured left ) .
Police say the suspects used their fake documents to travel to Dubai in groups , flying from Zurich , Rome , Paris and Frankfurt .
One of the victims of the identity theft was British - Israeli Paul John Keeley ( pictured right ) .
The passport used by one of the suspected assassins bore his name , but featured a photograph of another man ( pictured left ) .
Palestinian militant Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was killed in his hotel room in Dubai on 20 January .
Police claim one of the suspects , pictured on the left , went to a hotel to put on a disguise .
He is seen leaving a toilet wearing a wig .
Surveillance cameras also recorded Mr Mabhouh , circled in red above , at the hotel 's reception before his death .
At the bottom of the image the head of one of the suspects can be seen .
As Mr Mabhouh leaves , the suspect follows .
Mr Mabhouh is trailed into the lift by a number of the suspects , including two pictured here in tennis gear .
Investigators believe he had been followed from Syria to Dubai where it is thought he wanted to buy weapons for Hamas .
When Mr Mabhouh leaves the lift , police say two of the suspects can be seen following him down the corridor .
He was later found dead in his room .
A post -mortem report said he had been electrocuted and suffocated .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Mr Mabhouh was murdered in his hotel room in Dubai on 20 January .
Reports have suggested he was there to buy weapons for the Palestinian Islamist movement , Hamas .
Hamas has accused Israeli agents of killing him .
Two Palestinian suspects were being questioned about the murder .
Police said they had " fled to Jordan " after the killing , without releasing their names .
Officials in Dubai , who have issued arrest warrants , said the team appeared to be a professional hit squad , probably sponsored by a foreign power .
They released CCTV footage which they said showed some of the suspects in disguises , including wigs and false beards , in the hotel near Dubai 's international airport .
The suspects allegedly trailed Mr Mabhouh when he arrived in Dubai from Syria .

The 2007 shooting in Baghdad strained Iraq - US relations
Two US men have been charged over the murder of two Afghans after a traffic accident in Kabul last May .
Justin Cannon , 27 , and Chris Drotleff , 29 , worked for a subsidiary of security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater .
The men were sacked after the incident for failing to comply with the terms of their contract .
The charges came on the same day that Xe reached a settlement in a number of separate civil lawsuits over the killings of Iraqi civilians .
The Justice Department said Mr Cannon and Mr Drotleff faced murder charges and could face the death penalty if found guilty .
According to the indictment , two people were killed and one injured as a result of the shooting at an intersection in Kabul .
Compensation sought
The accused told the AP news agency in a recent interview that they had been justified in opening fire when a car caused an accident ahead of them , turned and sped towards them .
" I feel comfortable firing my weapon any time I feel my life is in danger .
That night , my life was 100 % in danger , " AP quotes Chris Drotleff as saying .
Earlier on Thursday , Xe welcomed a settlement - for an undisclosed amount - of a number of lawsuits over the killings of Iraqi civilians .
The civil suits accused Blackwater 's founder , Erik Prince , of cultivating a climate of recklessness .
The lawsuits sought compensation for deaths and injuries incurred in incidents including the killing of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square , in 2007 .
Last week a judge dismissed all criminal charges against five Blackwater employees over that incident .
Watching the news items bubbling up to the surface from the first - ever National Tea Party Convention in Nashville this past weekend was , for liberals , like driving by a horrible car wreck .
Most of us want to turn away but ca n’t help staring in fascination at what we ’re seeing .
First we have overt racist statements from Tom Tancredo suggesting that we need to return to the days of civics literacy tests in order to vote .
This was an odious technique used to keep African Americans from voting and Rachel Maddow did a fantastic job last night showing just what that reference means .
Tancredo also suggested that the over 4 million people that worked to elect Barack Obama and the many more millions that voted for him “ could n’t spell ‘ vote ’ or say it in English . ”
Then we had the comical debacle of Sarah Palin writing crib notes on her hand for the same speech where she taunts President Obama for using a teleprompter .
I ’m not exactly sure why it ’s only bad when the president uses a teleprompter since most presidents have used them since they became available but the fact that she had to write things like “ lift America ’s spirit ” and budget tax cuts on her hand tells us more than a little about her credibility and intelligence .
But these are n’t the reason that the Tea Party movement will fail .
There are three other reasons that are far more important and profound .
Reason Number One –
Where all the young people at ?
This is a movement with almost nobody under the age of 40 .
When you look at photos from this past weekend ’s Convention , nearly everyone is in their 50s or above .
Part of this is because they charge such an enormous fee — a fact that emphasizes that there is a not - so - subtle for - profit element to this .
Politics Daily gives us more :
Where Are the Young ?
A funny thing about the break - out session “ How to Involve the Youth in the Conservative Movement ” – not too many young people showed up .
Mishelle Perkins , a 44 - year - old mother of five children , worries about the paucity of young people at local meetings .
The Rutherford County , Tennessee activist came Friday to get some tips .
Jordan Marks , executive director of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom , suggested that activists use Facebook , volunteer to speak at high schools ( “ bastions of liberalism ” ) and simply do fun stuff that hooks high school and college - age kids .
Marks described a bowling party he organized – “ Knock Down the Pinheads of Communism . ”
A strike equaled Mao , a spare , Pol Pot .
Perkins said she supplements her children ’s education with books by Tea Party authors , but right now it ’s hard to get them too interested .
My , my – Bowling for Communists .
How clever .
That ’s sure to bring in the young ‘ uns , eh ?
A movement with no young people is destined to die out in a very short time and , for the most part , the only youth you see at these events are those who have been drug along by their parents or who enjoy the thrill of carrying obscene , anti-liberal signs around and getting their pictures taken like these fine young gentlemen at the Brighton , MI Tea Party Rally last summer :
In sharp contrast to the army of young men and women that essentially ran the Obama Campaign for Change and are currently running Organizing for America , these are not future leaders .
Reason Number Two –
Where all the leadership at ?
The Tea Partiers are a fractured group and , as Dave Weigel at the Washington Independent has shown in countless articles , the Teabagger - on - Teabagger infighting has reached comical proportions .
The Convention this past weekend is a fine example of that with some groups pulling out in a huff right up until the last minute .
A scheduled Tea Party rally at the Detroit Auto Show had scant attendance and an opposing group was happy to take credit for it saying , “ I ’d like to think I had something to do with that . ”
Nice .
But it ’s more than the fractured nature of their movement .
They literally have no figurehead .
Sarah Palin is the person that everyone points to but she is a failed politician who quit her job for can only be seen as personal gain .
She clearly does n’t have the knowledge of world events , national security and a host of other crucial topics that are required of a national leader .
While she ’s attractive to the Tea Partiers ( in more ways than one ) , she is n’t coming out with any new ideas on how to take their movement forward .
Palin assembling a political organization to compete with the likes of Barack Obama ’s Organizing for America ?
Please .
Frankly , as horrified as Democrats and liberals are at seeing someone like Palin getting any kind of national attention at all , they are all silently praying that she will run for president because she will be eaten alive on the campaign trail and at debates by members of her own party because she simply does n’t have the chops to compete at that level of play and to appeal to a broad cross-section of the country .
You can complain about Democrats raising your taxes all you want but when the taxes of most Americans have gone DOWN , it starts to sound a little silly .
What surprises me is that the Tea Partiers seem to be proud of the fact that they have no leadership .
In a Time magazine article , Jay Newton - Small writes :
The tea-party movement has no leader , and … neither did the American Revolution , ” thundered talk - radio host Phil Valentine , who spoke before Palin at the gala dinner .
Leaving aside poor old General Washington , if there was one thing all tea partiers could agree upon it was that no one is their leader .
And that was a condition Palin was happy to encourage .
“ This is about the people , ” she said .
“ It is n’t about any king or queen of a tea party and it ’s a lot more than any one charismatic guy with a teleprompter . “ , ” thundered talk - radio host Phil Valentine , who spoke before Palin at the gala dinner .
Leaving aside poor old General Washington , if there was one thing all tea partiers could agree upon it was that no one is their leader .
And that was a condition Palin was happy to encourage .
“ This is about the people , ” she said .
“ Bettina Bibiano , a 47 - year - old filmmaker from Los Angeles , said the tea-party movement does n’t need an iconic Obama - like figure .
“ It ’s hard for us to unify behind any one person , ” she explained .
“ We ’re not a cult . ”
That ’s a nice jab at Obama supporters and I ’m sure it ’s something they can rally behind .
For awhile .
But without leadership , any movement is bound for failure .
It is leadership that provides direction and keeps energy levels high and , without it , no movement can succeed .
( And , by the way , for a bunch of so - called patriots , you ’d think they ’d know their American history a bit better , would n’t you ?
The American Revolution had no leader ?
REALLY ???)
Reason Number
Three –
Where all the nerds at ?
I do n’t think it ’s any mystery that , in order to run a successful campaign these days , from early fundraising to getting people to turn out for events and to run your grassroots campaign , you need to be tech - savvy to the Nth degree .
Not just the people that create your websites and email lists but the people who use those things .
And when it comes to the Tea Partiers , they ai n’t got it .
In a recent New York Times article , I chuckled when I read this :
If Tea Party advocates offer little admiration for Mr. Obama , they do often cite his campaign as a model because of the way it built a fortune from small donations and used social networking .
But the crowd here was largely middle - aged and older , and technology may not come as easily as it did to the young adults who powered Mr. Obama ’s campaign .
A session on “ collaboration in the cloud - applied technology ” got hung up on basics like how to do an effective Google search , buy a Web domain or send mass e-mail .
In other words , the Democratic party ( and even the Republican Party ) will have a skabillion emails sent to their supporters before the Tea Partiers even get out of their beds .
While Tea Partiers are still trying figure out how to set up a “ Tea Partiers for Hatin on Obama and Libruls ” listserv , their opposition will be planning phonebanking events online , allowing their grassroots members to create calling lists from the national Voter Action Network and will be mobilizing across the whole country with little effort .
That ’s the future of empowering people at the grassroots level and without those technical skills , the Tea Partiers will be left behind .
So , while it ’s a car wreck for us liberals and sometimes the fervor of the Tea Partiers is a bit disturbing , it ’s clear that their organization is FAIL in critical ways .
And in these same ways , the Democrats do very well .
While there may be some short - term successes for the Tea Party movement , in the end they will self - destruct or just get old and quit fighting .
In the meantime , they may do irreparable damage to the Republicans ’ electoral chances nationally .
And that , as they say , is a Good Thing .
I ’m just sayin ’ …
Judge dismisses all charges in Blackwater shooting
By Del Quentin Wilber
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday , December 31 , 2009 ; 4:15 PM
A federal judge on Thursday threw out charges against five Blackwater Worldwide security guards accused of killing 14 people in a 2007 shooting in downtown Baghdad .
In a 90 - page opinion , U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina ruled that the government violated the guards ' rights by using their immunized statements to help the investigation .
The ruling comes after a lengthy set of hearings that examined whether federal prosecutors and agents improperly used such statements that the guards gave to State Department investigators following the shooting on Sept. 16 , 2007 .
" The explanations offered by prosecutors and investigators in an attempt to justify their actions and persuade the court that they did not use the defendants ' compelled testimony were all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility , " Urbina wrote .
Dean Boyd , a spokesman for the Justice Department , said , " We 're obviously disappointed by the decision .
We 're still in the process of reviewing the opinion and considering our options . "
[ And so on and so on . ]

One of the features I loved in Rachel Maddow 's old Air America Radio morning show was the regular Monday - morning Friday News Dump report .
It 's one of those things that everybody , or at any rate lots of folks , know about , but hardly anyone does anything about .
Anytime anyone in government has news that has to be made public , but that they would like to draw the minimum of attention , they dump it in with their Friday news dump , secure in the knowledge that all the media and an awful lot of media consumers tune out on Saturday .
Anything that happens to get into the Saturday papers and newscasts gets hardly any attention , and by Sunday they 're all off on the Sunday Round of Grand Pontificating -- you could n't wedge anynews in there with a hatchet .
I 'm sure there are any number of blogs doing what Rachel did : combing through those leavings to see what embarrassments , not to mention revelations , were concealed there .
But you see , that 's the thing :
It 's just some lonely , no -account - paid bloggers , and the bureaucratic blunder bundlers can easily live with that -- that 's almost better than silence , in that they can always say , if they 're challenged about a particular news dump , that they put it out there and heck , picked it up -- are they supposed to be doing the journalists ' job for them too ?
You might think of the Holday News Dump as the Friday news Dump on steroids , and maybe the dumpiest dump of them all the one that ushers out the old year , a veritable sea of forgottenness .
Come Monday we 'll see , assuming anybody looks , what got dumped in this year 's New Year 's Holiday - Plus - Weekend Dump .
But who knew that federal judges also know how to do the Dump ?
Note the time stamp on thisreport :
Now I 'm not disupting the judge 's call .
Not that I 'm any expert , but I do recall reading about this basic problem in this investigation of having to use immunized statements , and I 'm prepared to believe that the facts and law left the judge no alternative .
Also , there may be court - specific factors I do n't know about , like a need or desire to clear certain rulings within the 2009 calendar year .
Still and all , I guess Isuggesting that the judge knew this was a hot potato and did everything he could , short of quitting the bench , to direct heat away from his ruling .
The insidious thing about the root problem in this case , the taking of those forever - off - limits statements , is that really it can't ever be fixed .
Even if there were other sources of evidence ( my recollection is that in this case there were n't ) , how would you ever establish that you 've gathered that evidence independent of the unusable statements ?
I would point out that the " investigative " work was done by Bush regimistas , raising the possibility that it was n't entirely by accident that uncorrectable errors happened in the early stages of the case , which as I recall the regime had no interest in pursuing to begin with .
But then hey , with the regimistas , how would you go about separating deliberate incompetence ( i.e. , sabotage ) from the natural kind ?
One obvious question :
What happens now to the poor schlub who pled guilty and was presumably standing ready to testify against the five other suspects ?
Presumably he gets whatever sentence he was going to get anyway .
I guess that 's the roll of the dice in such matters .
Nevertheless , I bet he ( and his lawyers ) are feeling pretty silly .
It 's easier if we just do n't think about it .
The Super - End - of - Year News Dump is perfect for that .
As Timothy Williams pointed out in this morning 's , Iraqis went through some more shock and awe when they read about the decision Friday , reacting " with disbelief , anger and bitter resignation to news that criminal charges in the United States had been dismissed against Blackwater Worldwide security guards who opened fire on unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007 . "

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 20/11/2009 ( 3966 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
CANADIAN officials are taking part in negotiations for a top - secret copyright treaty that could see families barred from the Internet for a year if someone in the household is suspected of illegal down­loads .
Under the worldwide rules of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , Internet service providers such as Bell and Rogers in Canada would be required to become copyright police and filter out pirated material from their networks , hand over the identities of customers believed to be infringing copyrights and restrict the use of identity - blocking software .
ACTA would employ a three - strikes policy .
People believed to be regularly downloading copy - protected material , such as movie and music files , could have their Internet connection severed for up to 12 months and forced to pay a fine .
" It 's incredibly disproportionate .
Three unproven allegations of infringement will cut off Internet service for a year for an entire family , " said Michael Geist , who holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa .
" It 's not based on the individual user , it 's based on the connection , " added Geist , who said he has received details of the proposals from people closely associated with drafting the agreement .
The treaty , which is being pushed forward by the Office of the United States Trade Representative , closely mimics the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) that governs copyright issues in the U.S .
It puts in place measures that would make it illegal for consumers to make backup copies of DVDs or other media with built - in copy - protection technology .
Other provisions could make information on iPods , laptops and other personal electronic devices illegal and force travellers to prove to border officials that the content on such devices was acquired through legal channels .
The U.S. has been particularly vocal about Canada 's lack of copyright reform .
The U.S. Trade Representative placed Canada on its piracy " priority watch list " earlier this year , labelling Canada a piracy haven alongside Algeria , Indonesia , China and Russia .
After less than a week on the job , the new U.S. ambassador to Canada , David Jacobson , scolded Canada for what he said were lax copyright laws .
The Canadian Copyright
Act has not been amended since 1997 , two years before the Napster file - sharing site forever changed the way people obtain music and movies online .
An attempt to update the act in 2005 was abandoned and amendments proposed last year were stalled by a federal election .
The government now is polling citizens on copyright issues and collecting opinions on how best to amend Canadian laws .
But the introduction of ACTA , which would force Canada to adopt international copyright standards , would likely make those discussions meaningless .
" We are looking at a global DMCA , " said Geist .
" From a Canadian perspective , having just conducted a copyright consultation and having ministers talk about a ' made - in - Canada ' copyright solution , what it actually represents is a loss of Canadian sovereignty over its copyright policies . "
ACTA negotiations went on this week in South Korea with representatives from Canada , the European Commission , Japan , Switzerland , New Zealand , Australia , Mexico , Morocco , Singapore , the Republic of Korea and the United States .
According to the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada , participants in the talks have confirmed " their intention to conclude the agreement as soon as possible in 2010 . "
Federal trade agreements do not require parliamentary approval .
Only the signature of a government representative is needed for an agreement to be passed as law .
According to leaked documents , ACTA would operate under a governing body overseen by a committee of representatives from member nations .
Many say the movie and music industries are behind the talks , but Graham Henderson , president of the Canadian Recording Industry Association , said his organization has had little input on the trade agreement .
" We have been ' consulted ' to exactly the same extent that everyone else in Canada has been consulted , " said Henderson in an email from England .
He said his group joined academics and lobbyists at a handful of briefings on ACTA , but little was revealed .

Thousands of Greeks have rallied against deficit - cutting measures during a national public sector strike .
Flights have been grounded , many schools are closed and hospitals are operating an emergency - only service .
The prime minister , who wants to freeze pay , gather more taxes and reform pensions , insisted that the proposals would be fully implemented .
EU leaders will discuss Greece 's difficulties on Thursday amid concern the crisis could threaten the euro .
European finance ministers are also due to hold a teleconference on Wednesday to talk about the issue .
Public anger
Despite heavy rain , there have been rallies across Greece throughout the day , with thousands of striking workers and pensioners gathering in the capital , Athens .
Several thousand people were also reported to have protested in Greece 's second city , Thessaloniki .
The rallies have been mainly peaceful , but in one incident police fired tear gas at rubbish collectors who tried to drive through a police cordon .
Some demonstrators threw stones at the police but the trouble was quickly defused .
The unions regard the austerity programme as a declaration of war against the working and middle classes , the BBC's Malcolm Brabant reports from the capital .
He says their resolve is strengthened by their belief that this crisis has been engineered by external forces , such as international speculators and European central bankers .
" It 's a war against workers and we will answer with war , with constant struggles until this policy is overturned , " said Christos Katsiotis , a union member affiliated to the Communist Party , at the Athens rally .
Others in the capital either see the cuts as necessary or argue that the strike is politically motivated .
" We have to implement the austerity measures , or the country will not be able to get out of this crisis , " said Katerina , a private sector employee .
" We have to pay for the mistakes of the past . "
On Tuesday , Prime Minister George Papandreou 's socialist government announced that it intends to raise the average retirement age from 61 to 63 by 2015 in a bid to save the cash - strapped pensions system .
The move comes on top of other planned austerity measures , including a public sector salary freeze and a hike in petrol prices , announced last week .
Deficit and debt
Further government measures include the non-replacement of departing civil servants , and tax collectors recovering billions of euros lost to tax evasion .
Mr Papandreou , who was in Paris on Wednesday for talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy , pledged to " take any necessary measures " to reduce Greece 's deficit .
" The stability programme will be implemented in every measure , " he said .
Mr Papandreou has already faced down a three - week protest by farmers demanding higher government subsidies .
These protesters referred to " The Pigs " - Portugal , Italy , Greece and Spain
Public sector workers will not be hit as hard as they have been in the Irish Republic , but they complain that some of the lowest paid will suffer while the rich dodge tax with impunity , says BBC Europe correspondent Jonny Dymond .
Financial markets around the world and politicians from across Europe will be watching the situation carefully , he reports from Athens .
Greece 's deficit is , at 12.7 % , more than four times higher than eurozone rules allow .
Its debt is about 300bn euros ( $ 419bn ; £ 259bn ) .
The markets remain sceptical that Greece will be able to pay its debts and many investors believe the country will have to be bailed out .
The uncertainty has recently buffeted the euro and the problems have extended to Spain and Portugal , which are also struggling with their deficits .
The possibility of Greece or one of the other stricken countries being unable to pay its debts - and either needing an EU bailout or having to abandon the euro - has been called the biggest threat yet to the single currency .
Ahead of the talks between EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday , some business media reported that Germany is preparing to lead a possible bail - out , supported by France and other eurozone members .

I hope you liked my Instructable and I hope it helps you .
I know I wish I had something like this when I was first trying to figure this all out .
I must say though I can't take all the credit - I must thank the Arduino product and website for making a great product .
The Arduino website is a great source of information and is actually where I got a lot of information about the minimum required components to get a chip to work away from an Arduino board .
The other great source was at : ITP Physical Computing ... particularly the Arduino - specific web page .
And I can't forget the Getting Started with Arduino book that I mentioned in Step 7 - it was a great resource for getting me started with my Arduino .
And last but not least , if you 've got this far , thank you for reading !
The Perl language is riddled with special variables .
Consider the following example :
open ( FILE , “ bla.txt ” ) ;
while (< FILE >) { print ; }
In case you do n’t speak Perl , this is equivalent to :
open ( FILE , “ bla.txt ” ) ;
while ( < FILE >) { print $ _ ; }
Still unclear ?
Alright , once more :
open ( FILE , “ bla.txt ” ) ;
while ( $line = < FILE >) { print $ line ; }
Perl is developed by linguist Larry Wall , who likes to put all kinds of natural language things into Perl .
$ _ refers to the subject of the sentence , it ’s “ it ” as it were .
print $ _ , or simply print means “ print it ” .
How do we know this variable exists ?
We do n’t .
Unless we read the manual .
Although they might be useful , magic variables like these are generally bad practice , it ’s one of many reasons that Perl code is often called write only code .
PHP also has some magic variables whose behavior do not adhere to any usual rules , they are called super globals .
In particular there are $ _POST and $ _GET .
They do not adhere to the scoping rules defined in PHP .
I do n’t know about you , but I like to see my variables declared .
I like to see where they come from , are they local variables , parameters , or imported from a module that I can lookup ?
Magic variables are confusing , because they have different behavior than other variables in a language , they do not adhere to the usual rules .
As part of Adia , I played around with Compojure , a Clojure web framework .
Generally , Compojure is a well - designed framework , but I came across one instance where it uses magic variables : in the defroutes macro .
An example :
( defroutes webservice
( GET “ / ”
( str “ Hello , “
( : name ( : query - params request ) ) ) ) )
This defines a mapping from the “ / ” URI , to code to be executed when that URI is requested .
As you can see , I use the variable request in this example .
Upon inspection , it not clear where it comes from .
At first , you may assume it ’s a global that is dynamically bound ( Clojure has dynamically scoped variables ) .
But some refactoring of the code shows that this is not the case :
( defn say - hello [ ] ( str “ Hello , “ ( : name ( : query - params request ) ) ) ) ( defroutes webservice ( GET “ / ” ( say - hello ) ) )
This results in a “ symbol cannot be resolved ” error for the request variable .
So clearly , request is not a dynamically bound variable either .
So what is it , and where does it come from ?
I had to dig into the Compojure source code to find it , it is defined in the with - request - bindings macro , which defines some magic symbols : params , cookies , session and flash that are only accessible from inside the macro ’s body :
( defmacro with - request - bindings
“ Add shortcut bindings for the keys in a request map . ”
[ request & body ]
`( let [ ~ ’request ~request
~’params ( : params ~’request )
~’cookies ( : cookies ~’request )
~’session ( : session ~’request )
~’flash ( : flash ~’request ) ]
~@body ) )
I find this confusing and therefore bad practice .
So , what is the alternative ?
It turns out there ’s no perfect solution here , it ’s all about trade - offs .
The problem magic variables try to solve is enabling quick access to data that is otherwise not accessible in a concise manner .
In this case it could have been solved by declaring the request and other variables somewhere , for instance as parameters to defroutes :
( defroutes webservice [ request params cookies session flash ]
…)
A reason not to go with this solution is likely to be its verbosity , nobody likes to write functions with a large number of arguments .
A second alternative is only passing the request parameter and letting the user pull out the other from that map every time they need it .
A reason not to go with that solution is user inconvenience , users likely want quick access to all five of these values and do n’t want to look them up in the request map every time .
A third alternative is using dynamically bound global variables .
In Clojure these can be bound to a new value only for a certain thread within a certain code execution path :
( def request nil ) ; root binding is nil ( defn print - request [ ] ( println request ) ) … ( binding [ request ( build - request … ) ] ; rebind ( print - request ) ; prints request … ) )
I use them in Adia for access to the request , post and get parameters .
For this I declare 3 variables in the adia .web module :
( def * request * nil )
( def * form * nil )
( def * query * nil )
Values have been dynamically bound to their respective values by the time they are used within a webfn :
( defwebfn say - hello [ ]
( str “ Hello , “ ( : name * query * ) ) )
My thinking is that by using the * name * convention , it is at least clear these are not normal locally defined variables , they are different .
Secondly , they are only available if you import the adia .web module and are part of that module ’s interface , i.e. you can look up their declaration .
What is still not clear is where their value comes from , but I suppose the user will have to abstract from that .
The alternative to this approach would be to pass these variables as parameters to every webfn , but I decided against this because it would make writing webfn defintions too verbose .
It was also not very clear what the syntax should have been : ( defwebfn fn- name request form query [ arg1 type arg2 type ] … ) ?
( defwebfn fn-name [ request form query ] [ arg1 type arg2 ] … ) ?
Neither of these options seemed very elegant to me , which is why I decided to be pragmatic and go with dynamically scoped globals .
I think this is an acceptable compromise .
While the five globals are essentially still input parameters , they do not have to be passed around all the time .
However , if you invoke a webfn outside a path where values are bound to the * request* , * form * and * query * variables , you are likely to receive NullPointerExceptions .
As a general rule : to keep programs readable and comprehensible , it should be easy to see where your variables and symbols come from .
Are they local variables , parameters , globals ?
Magic variables should be avoided if possible .
Sarah Palin confirmed on Greta Van Susteren 's show last night that she 's very much planning to show up and speak at the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville , despite the distinct odor of Scam the whole affair is giving off .
Palin :
Oh , you betcha I 'm going to be there .
I 'm going to speak there because there are people traveling from many miles away to hear what that Tea Party movement is all about and what that message is that should be received by our politicians in Washington .
I 'm honored to get to be there .
This , even as some of her fellow wingnuts are catching the same whiff -- namely , Reps .
Michele Bachmann and Marsha Blackburn , who have pulled out of the event :
In separate statements , released by their congressional offices , the lawmakers said that appearing at the convention might conflict with House ethics rules .
But they also said they are concerned about how money raised from the event will be spent .
Palin last night had no such concerns -- and said no one should be concerned about that big wad of cash the convention organizers are paying her :
Palin :
The speaker 's fee will go right back into the cause .
I 'll be able to donate it to people and those events , those things that I believe in , that will help perpetuate the message , the message being : Government , you have constitutional limits .
You better start abiding by them .
Hmmmmm .
It sounds like we 're going to have to rely on Sarah 's say - so when it comes to how she actually spends the money .
Smells even more like Scam , does n't it ?
Of course , the whole scenario , as David Corn explored with Keith Olbermann last night , is developing into quite a fiasco -- mainly because Tea Partier and Birther J.D. Hayworth has decided to challenge Palin 's former running mate , John McCain , in the Arizona Senate primary .
Palin is staying loyal to McCain .
This has outraged the Tea Partiers , as Alan Colmes points out :
She has now chose to align herself with several bad actors .
What should this be called , the Rinoization of Sarah Palin . [...]
She is certainly entitled to write a book and make money for her and her family , but other than what has she has done to support Republican and patriotic candidates .
…
Perhaps , Sarah was too busy talking to her agent about her Fox deal .
Where the hell was Sarah ?
This is what you get when you build a movement around paranoid right - wingers .
There is probably no faction more historically famous for viciously turning on each other in struggles over money and power than right - wing populists .
Could n't happen to a nicer bunch .

Earlier this week I pondered whether Whole Foods , or more specifically , its CEO John Mackey , is bad for the planet .
Mackey ’s latest comments questioning whether mankind is warming the planet prompted the piece , but I also looked at some of the greater questions about just how much , if anything , Whole Foods is doing to back up its green image .
Well , low and behold , a study of grocers and their sustainability efforts documents just how little the company actually does when it comes to climate and related environmental issues .
Released in December 2008 , the study from sustainable business group Ceres assesses what 63 companies are doing to prepare themselves to face the challenge of climate change , with a focus on board oversight , management execution , public disclosure , greenhouse gas emissions accounting and strategic planning and performance .
Whole Foods earned a pitiful 27 score on the assessment ( out of a possible 100 ) — flunking in basically every category .
From the summary :
Whole Foods ’ climate change strategy is focused almost entirely on renewable energy purchases only .
Th e company has purchased 1.2 million
MWh hours of wind - based renewable energy credits ( serving as carbon off sets for 100 percent of the electricity used in all of its stores ) , installed solar panels on nine stores , and converted its truck fleet to bio - diesel fuel .
However , Whole Foods has not publicly disclosed a greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions inventory or emissions reduction targets .
Whole Foods was given a zero on board oversight , and only an 11 on management ’s execution of a sustainability strategy .
Whole Foods neither accounts for nor publicly discloses its emissions .
As of the date of the report , the company did n’t have emissions goals or plans in place for reducing emissions .
Since that report was released , the company has taken on some additional energy - related commitments , but it does n’t appear to have changed much in the other areas .
Ceres also rated United Kingdom - based grocery giant Tesco , which scored a 78 .
The grocer has been among the most aggressive companies in the UK on climate , employing a carbon labeling system and even using expired meat to generate electricity .
US - based Safeway also scored significantly higher than Whole Foods , at 48 .
Safeway does n’t get too much attention for its sustainability efforts , but it was the first retailer to join the Chicago Climate Exchange and the California Climate Action Registry , and has launched a comprehensive greenhouse gas reduction and sustainability initiative .
The other grocer Ceres rated , Kroger , did n’t do particularly well , scoring 23 points .
All of this just highlights the fact that Whole Foods , in reality , is far from the green grocer many customers imagine it to be .
Kooky , libertarian , climate - change - denying CEO aside , the company just is n’t making the grade when it comes to climate change .
Hi : this is Charlie checking in again .
I 'm in a hotel in Boston , winding down from Boskone .

In Wahlkampfzeiten neigen Politiker und Parteien dazu , Probleme zu trivialisieren und Lösungen zu simplifizieren .
Paradigmatisches Beispiel dürfte dafür Ursula von der Leyen mit ihrem Vorstoß zur Sperrung kinderpornographischer Internetseiten sein .
Im Internet würde die „ Vergewaltigung von Kindern vor laufender Kamera “ gezeigt .
Die Server stünden in Indien ( oder Kasachstan ) , wo die Inhalte nicht gelöscht werden könnten .
Deswegen seien Internetsperren in Deutschland die einzig sinnvolle Massnahme .
Für den Wahlkampf ist das eine brauchbare Geschichte – und Wahlkampf war dies ja .
Der Wahlkampf ist bekanntlich vorbei und bei dem Thema Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie hat eine neue Sachlichkeit Einzug gehalten .
Die Koalition will das „ Zugangserschwerungsgesetz “ vorerst nicht umsetzen .
Es bleibt abzuwarten , ob die FDP das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz kippen kann , wie dies vom AK Zensur gefordert wird .
Für das BKA und seinen Chef Jörg Ziercke , wie auch für die Freunde obrigkeitsstaatlicher Lösungen in der CDU ist das nun gewiss etwas enttäuschend .
Da hat man schon ein nahezu todsicheres
Thema , mit dem der Einstieg in die flächendeckende Kontrolle des Netzes geschaffen werden soll , und dann kann man sich – trotz Anwendung aller polemischen Mittel – im Ergebnis nicht gegen eine „ straff organisierte “ ( Zitat von W. Bosbach ) Kampagne des AK Zensur und der gesamten Netzgemeinschaft durchsetzen .
Die FAZ schlägt heute ein neues Kapitel der Auseinandersetzung auf .
Erstmalig wird auf eine Trivialisierung des Problems verzichtet .
Soweit dem Artikel der FAZ Informationen des BKA zu Grunde liegen , ist natürlich von vorne herein Skepsis angebracht .
Das BKA möchte , mindestens im Ausland , nicht direkt eine Löschung von kinderpornographischen Inhalten durchführen , weil u.a . – so die Information von Martin Dörmann – das BKA befürchtet , die sofortige Löschung von Inhalten könne strafrechtliche Ermittlungen behindern .
Man würde sich einen Qualitätsjournalisten wünschen , der zu diesem Punkte das BKA zum Beispiel in der Person von Jürgen Maurer klar befragt .
Ist es etwa nicht richtig , dass das BKA hinter verschlossenen Türen inoffiziell bestätigt hat , dass es an einer sofortigen Löschung von kinderpornographischen Inhalten nicht interessiert ist , damit strafrechtliche Ermittlungen noch durchgeführt werden können ?
Immerhin findet sich bei der FAZ eine etwas verklausulierte Bestätigung dieses Sachverhaltes : Das BKA lehnt es „ bisher ab , sich bei seinen Löschversuchen direkt an ausländische Provider zu wenden und so die Strafverfolger in dem jeweiligen Staat zu umgehen .
Man wisse schließlich nicht , welche Ermittlungsmaßnahmen die ausländischen Kollegen gerade betrieben , heißt es in Wiesbaden . “
Das hat oft zur Folge , dass die Verbreitung geduldet wird , um Konsumenten zu finden .
Dass das FBI Link - Honeypots betreibt ist nur die harmlose offizielle Variante .
Die FAZ lotet nun mit der Lupe die Grenzbereiche des Löschens pornographischer Inhalte aus .
Da geht es um fiktive Texte , Posingbilder und Anscheinsjugendpornographie .
Konsterniert gibt die FAZ zu , es sei schwer , hier die „ Strafbarkeit zu beurteilen “ .
Und vergisst gleichzeitig , dass das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz für solch schwierige und nicht einmal eindeutig rechtswidrige Sachverhalte nie gedacht war .
Worum es Frau von der Leyen beim Zugangserschwerungsgesetz ging , wurde ja präzise formuliert : „ Wir tolerieren nicht länger , dass Kinder vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt , geschändet und missbraucht werden und jeder dabei im Internet zusehen kann . “
Und wer noch etwas deutlichere Formulierungen sucht , sollte sich die Rede von Frau von der Leyen in der Aktuellen Stunde zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie im Internet vor dem Deutschen Bundestag am 26 .
März 2009 durchlesen .
Selbst das BKA hat die Ausweitung des Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes auf andere Sachverhalte abgelehnt .
Die Schlußfolgerung der FAZ , die natürlich nur zwischen den Zeilen zu lesen ist , lautet : Weil das Löschen in diesen Grenzbereichen so schwierig und kompliziert sei , brauche man doch Internetsperren .
So findet die FAZ dann wieder zu der gewünschten Antwort zurück .
Die FAZ bleibt gefangen im Netz der simplen Antworten .
Für die komplizierten Probleme einer grenzüberschreitenden Zusammenarbeit werden wieder nur einfache Antworten gefunden .
Was bei der FAZ indessen unerwähnt bleibt : wer über den Kernbereich international geächteter kinderpornographischer Inhalte hinaus die Differenzen zwischen verschiedenen nationalen Jurisdiktionen zum Anlass nimmt , Netzsperren zu fordern , der muss konsequent aus dem internationalen Internet ein renationalisiertes Intranet , also ein Local Area Network für Deutschland formen .
Das Deutschland - Net .

Almost every day , my in box fattens with e-mails from America ’s freelance writers -- adding their voices to those I quoted a couple of weeks ago about the devastating downturn in the writing market .
In bemoaning the need for speed , the flight from quality and the persistent decrease in pay , it turns out writers have a lot in common with photographers .
And graphic artists .
And architects .
And musicians .
And , well , with just about anyone who sees his creative endeavors being commodified or who is exposed to low - cost foreign competition via the Internet .
I ’ve now heard it hundreds of times : fear that the technology providing the world entree to an unimaginable trove of art , images and information is also obliterating the boundaries that once allowed the creative class to make a living .
Jaron Lanier , a computer programmer , UC Berkeley scholar and onetime champion of the Internet ’s freebie culture , complains about “ digital Maoism ” and “ cybernetic totalism . ”
Advertisement
“ The dominant tech culture says everyone should just give away their content and their expertise , ” Lanier told me this week .
“ Then they are supposed to make money later through personal appearances , or selling T - shirts or whatever .
That does n’t really help the photographer or the graphic artist who is trying to make a living right now . ”
Since the electronics revolution seems only to be gaining pace -- with smart phones now putting the world right in our pockets -- the artists and the artful need to learn how to fight , every day , to make sure the multitude of media does not overwhelm the message .
It ’s been several years since traditional advertising began to slide into a swamp of confusion and fragmentation .
But only recently have big , ad - driven “ content creators ” finally begun moving toward other sources of revenue .
The New York Times this week announced a plan to charge frequent online readers for the stories and photos it spends millions to create .
Hulu executives said they plan to begin charging for some of the TV shows they previously put on the Internet for free .
Advertisement
Now the freelancers -- the sensitive , right - brain souls who sell their creative power one byte at a time -- are going to have to get just as aggressive as the big boys .
That means struggling mightily to find the audiences who appreciate their work and make them pay .
It wo n’t be easy .
Photographers are among those who found out most painfully what happens when their work ( or a reasonable facsimile ) becomes readily available online at little or no cost .
A decade ago , professional photographers thought nothing of selling pictures to stock photo houses .
But what once provided a source of income went into catalogs of nearly endless size and accessibility .
Advertisement
Seemingly overnight , a publisher who wanted a picture of a sunset could choose from thousands on any number of databases .
Why pay a photographer hundreds , or thousands , of dollars to go out and shoot a new one ?
Horror stories among professional shooters have become legion .
Last April , Time paid $ 30 for an iStockphoto shot of a jar of change ( illustrating “ The New Frugality ” ) that ran on the magazine ’s cover .
Other photographers complained that a Time cover in the past ( commissioned , not stock ) might have paid thousands .
Britain ’s Independent newspaper recently pulled photos of snow scenes off Flickr and declined , for a time , to pay , even though the photographer clearly labeled the shots with a copyright .
The Times uses stock photos sparingly ; when it does , it typically pays $ 100 or more per picture .
Spokane , Wash .- based photographer Al Berger e-mailed me about his frustration in seeing once - lucrative event sessions slip away to the “ do it yourself ” crowd .
Advertisement
This winter , for the first time in two decades , Berger did n’t shoot a single company or family Christmas party , work that used to bring him as much as $ 5,000 once he ’d sold prints to all the participants .
Berger sent me a few of the photos one group had come up with as a substitute .
“ They stood them against a wall , wide angle , with an on - camera flash , looking up their noses .
Static .
Lame .
Absolute junk , ” Berger said .
The 54 - year - old photographer has maintained his business , in part , by shooting rodeos -- a genre filled with fervent fans and specialty publications willing to pay for quality work .
Survival will increasingly depend on such niche - mining , since the stopper wo n’t ever be put back in the stock - photography bottle .
Advertisement
A travel editor told me this week that , with all the other cutbacks he faces , it ’s hard to justify spending more than the $ 6 he pays an online photo distributor for a decent picture .
The picture might not be great , or fit the story perfectly , but it will suffice .
The chief executive of one of America ’s biggest newspaper chains told me a couple of years ago he feared readers would accept this “ culture of good enough ” as much as anything , not noticing the difference between blog slop and thoroughly vetted news and analysis .
My friend Blue , an ace with graphics and art reproduction , told me how his field has been beset : Amateurs produce Photoshopped pictures that once would n’t have made it out of a darkroom .
Workers in India draw corporate logos for pennies on the dollar and e-mail them stateside .
What he ca n’t overcome in the “ quicker , faster , cheaper ” sensibility , he tries to co-opt .
He ’s now teaching others the finer points of Photoshop and other software .

Another pal , Brian , told me how architectural renderings his firm once charged $ 10,000 for have recently been contracted out to China .
Draftsmen there will turn the work around , often overnight , and charge as little as $ 600 .
American architects like Brian can take solace that they need to ride herd on the foreign imports .
( Lest “ anomalies ” -- like the Chinese - drawn sketch of an American police station with officers carrying combat - style machine guns -- slip through to clients . )
And locals still control the detailed final drawings that go to building officials .
But the loss of the other work , Brian said with pronounced understatement , “ is a little nerve - racking . ”
Those who continue to distinguish themselves and thrive manage to carve out niches where their expertise and the quality of their work shine through .
I ’ve learned in recent weeks of websites focused on such topics as investing , national security and radio production -- novel enough to draw a loyal base of paid subscribers .
It ’s not ground - breaking news to suggest that the Web has created substantial challenges .
But as the damage to the creative community has become more evident , even once - ardent Internet triumphalists have begun to expound on the collateral damage .
Advertisement
they planLanier , just out with his book “ You Are Not a Gadget : A Manifesto , ” said he would like to offer some balm to the artistic community , but he ’s not optimistic .
“ Other people have to outgrow this false ideal they have built ” about the benefits of the Web , Lanier said .
“ It can take 10 or 20 years for people to give up those sorts of ideas .
In the meantime , people are getting screwed . ”

As the activist skeptical movement grows and increasingly networks , thanks largely to social media , we seem to be irritating those who are the targets of our critical analysis .
This is a good thing .
It ’s a sign that we are doing our job and having an impact .
Recently there has been an increase in those attacking skeptics and skepticism .
One tactic is to attempt to intimidate critics and silence public debate through libel lawsuits or the threat of such suits .
The blustering by Bonnie Vent and her minions following Mark Edwards ’ latest post is a good example .
Clearly , they are not familiar with libel laws in the US , or they hope that we are not , or they simply do n’t care .
To be clear , we take very seriously our responsibility to be fair and factually accurate , and we will happily correct mistakes if they are pointed out to us .
The original version of Mark ’s article contained the word “ apparently ” to refer to second - hand information .
This was probably enough of a qualification , but we strengthened it to “ allegedly ” just to be sure , and even added the caveat about the original source .
( Read the post for details . )
Fortunately in the US we have rational libel laws .
In order to prove libel the plaintiff will have to prove that the defendant wrote something that was wrong , they knew it was wrong , and they did it deliberately out of malice .
In some states you also have to prove harm , but a few have what is called “ libel per se ” which means that certain accusations are considered automatically damaging to one ’s reputation .
On the other hand , some states also have anti-SLAPP laws – strategic lawsuit against public participation .
In essence , if you use a libel suit to silence a critic and remove their right to participate in free speech , you may be counter sued under anti-SLAPP laws .
The courts , in short , have recognized the threat that SLAPP suits pose to first amendment rights .
The Canadian Supreme Court recently recognized this as well , ruling in one case :
The Supreme Court said it examined laws in other countries with similar legal systems , such as the United Kingdom and Australia .
It found that Canadian law was strict by comparison and did not give enough weight to the value of free expression .
“ This , in turn , may have a chilling effect on what is published , ” said the text of one of the rulings .
“ Information that is reliable and in the public ’s interest to know may never see the light of day . ”
Unfortunately , English libel law is still in the dark ages , as some of our colleagues across the pond have discovered .
Simon Singh is currently defending a libel suit in British court against the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) .
Apparently he stung them and made it hurt when he pointed out they promote treatments that are not supported by evidence .
This resulted in a backlash against the BCA and a campaign to reform English libel laws .
Previously Ben Goldacre and The Guardian were the target of a libel suit from one Matthias Rath , for selling dubious treatments for serious illnesses , like AIDS , in Africa .
Ben emerged victorious from this suit .
Back on this side , Robert Lancaster was threatened with suit by Sylvia Browne for his website , stopsylviabrowne.com .
Robert refused to back down or be intimidated by Browne , who had not case against him .
Unfortunately , Robert suffered a stroke and during his recovery period it appears that the registration for the domain name lapsed and the url was picked up by a psychic promoter .
Paul Offit and Amy Wallace from Wired Magazine have also recently been sued by anti-vaccinationist Barbara Loe Fisher , the head of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) .
This one is over the claim by Offit printed in Wired Magazine that “ she lies ” – referring to Fisher .
If it actually gets to court it is likely , in my opinion , that Offit will be able to demonstrate that Fisher has made comments that are less than truthful .
But usually in such cases the point of the suit is not to defend it in court , but simply to force a settlement .
Threat of libel is not the only way that the cranks of the world are trying to fight back against skeptics .
They are also trying to take us on in their own critical writing , which of course they have the right to do .
But just like with the libel suits , this strategy has been backfiring more often than not .
It seems that if we irritate them enough , we can goad them into embarrassing themselves by trying to do something they clearly are not good at – critical analysis .
Recently Deepak Chopra , Rustom Roy , and Larry Dossey attacked Science - Based Medicine in the Huffington Post .
Invariably such attempts butcher the skeptical position ( always a marker of intellectual sloppiness ) and just provide more fodder for us to criticize , and this was no exception .
In the world of alternative medicine defenders on nonsense , like the three above , have an especially hard time because they do need to seem scientific while attacking science and defending pseudoscience .
So it is easy to trip them up in self - contradiction .
As David Gorski writes :
Dr. Dossey just spent two articles whining that his beloved CAM is being treated so very , very unfairly by promoters of science - based medicine , but from my viewpoint it ’s being treated more than fairly these days ; it ’s being given a free pass , by and large .
Again , that ’s why I ’ll repeat it one more time .
If Dr. Dossey really wants CAM to be evaluated on a truly equal scientific footing with science - based medicine , I have one thing to say to him one last time : Bring it on !
Mike Adams , editor of NaturalNews.com , has also felt the sting of skeptics and decided to fight back with his own rhetoric .
In it he raises an army of particularly flimsy strawmen against skeptics , easily dismantled .
He was joined by fellow natural guru Joseph Mercola , who attacked one of our Australian colleagues , Rachael Dunlop .
Mercola ’s comments were in such poor taste that his own followers flinched .
Speaking of which , the winner of the most callous , distasteful , and strategically moronic attack on skeptics of 2009 goes to the Age of Autism for their photoshopped picture of various critics of the anti-vaccine movement ( including yours truly ) eating a baby at Thanksgiving dinner .
Even some of their devoted followers were put off by this despicable ( and mysogynistic ) display , and they quickly decided to take it down .
Conclusion
As the skeptical movement grows we will increasingly become the targets of counter - attacks like those I discuss above .
Like it or not , we are engaged in conflict with the promoters of pseudoscience and an anti-scientific world view , and they will fight back .
But we have shown in recent years that we can stick together and we will not be intimidated .
Try to silence one of us , and the criticism will only be magnified 100 fold .
Bonnie Vent could have just taken Mark ’s criticism and moved on , but instead she chose to try to have the criticism taken down , resorting to empty libel threats as an intimidation tactic .
But all she has accomplished is to focus our attention on her all the more .
The BCA was soundly embarrassed by the attention they received as a consequence of their lawsuit .
It even led to skeptical activists reporting instances of chiropractors making false claims , which in turn led to one chiropractic group advising their members to take down all claims on their websites ( which seems like a curious admission that their claims do not hold up to scrutiny ) .
I am particularly amused when the purveyors of pseudoscience try to engage skeptics in critical analysis .
That is our arena , and we will be happy to trounce them all day long .
In fact , we want a serious discussion of logic and evidence – that is what skepticism is all about .
If we can get them engaging us in such discussion that can only serve our ends .
Even if they can demonstrate that they are correct about a claim – that is all we want , to base claims on logic and evidence .
More likely , however , we will get what Mike Adams served up – a frothing rant that is so disconnected from reality it accomplishes our work for us .
So keep it up , fellow skeptics .
We are having an impact , and the cranks of the world are feeling the pain .

EastEnders has a storyline in which a Muslim man has a gay affair A UK charity is dealing with an increasing number of young gay Muslims becoming homeless after fleeing forced marriages and so - called honour violence .
During a weekly drop - in group held by the Albert Kennedy Trust in London , Suni , a 20 - year - old London student , helps himself to a warm mince pie and a steaming cup of coffee .
In 2008 , during a holiday to Pakistan to visit relatives , his parents suspected the truth about his sexuality .
They believed marriage would " cure " him of what they considered to be a psychological disorder .
Name ' blackened '
" They told me I 'm going to be forced into marriage and they 're looking for a girl and I 'll be married in two to three months and I wo n't be able to come back to London , " Suni said .
When he refused , he was imprisoned in his family 's ancestral home in a remote village of Pakistan and subjected to regular beatings and abuse as he had brought " shame " on the strict Muslim family .
I think I 'd be vulnerable if people knew about me - I 've heard a lot of remarks in the past about people saying that gay people should die for religious reasons
Ali , East London
" I stayed there for three months and he was always beating me .
He was telling me I had blackened our family name and he was saying it 's a sin .
I know it was just for honour . "
Suni managed to escape and return to the UK , penniless and homeless .
Relatives and friends were reluctant to help him due to fear of violent reprisals from his family .
After a night spent in a police cell , he was put in touch with the trust , which helped find him safe accommodation .
' Gay demons '
Trust worker Annie Southerst said in the past six months there has been an increase in the number of Muslims coming to them for help .
" They face threats of physical violence , actual violence and restriction of liberties , " she said .
" We 've had people chased out of the house with knives and we have had issues around young people who had exorcisms planned to get rid of the gay demons , I suppose .
" They come to us because they 're homeless , or in danger of being homeless imminently .
We sort out emergency accommodation for them .
" But the biggest loss they face is the loss of their families .
" I can't imagine what it must be like to suddenly in your late teens , early 20s suddenly not to have a family anymore . "
Using laws introduced by the government in November 2008 , the charity has taken out four Forced Marriage Protection orders in the past few months .
I 'm proud to be a Muslim ... and I 'm proud to be gay as well - unfortunately a lot of parents do n't see that

The orders were introduced after ministers dropped plans to make forcing someone to marry a crime .
More than 80 have been imposed so far .
Breaching one is contempt of court and can carry a two - year jail term .
Fazal Mahmood runs a support group for South Asian and Middle Eastern gay men , called Himat , which means strength in Urdu .
" I 've got about 150 people on my mail out list .
" About 80 % ... have been coerced into marriage or been forced into marriage or are being forced into marriage , " he said .
Mr Mahmood says homosexuality is considered a taboo issue within close - knit Muslim communities in areas such as London , Bradford and Manchester .
" I 'm proud to be a Muslim , I 'm proud to be South Asian , Pakistani and I 'm proud to be gay as well .
" Unfortunately a lot of parents do n't see that .
All they see is ' what is my community going to feel like when they find out my son or daughter is gay ? '. "
Keeping quiet
In fact he advises young gay Muslims not to come out to their families .
" Once you 've told your family and friends about your sexuality , the next unfortunate step for your family to do is ask you to leave . "
The Forced Marriage Unit deals with around 1,600 cases a year Ali , 21 , lives in east London with his large Bangladeshi family , and has decided to keep his sexuality a secret .
" When they do find out , they 're basically going to go against it .
" My relationship with them is not going to be the same , the respect they have for me is going to be different and I 'm going to miss that relationship , " he said .
He is also worried about the repercussions within the local community if they discover he is gay .
" You see people being killed for being gay and stuff .
I think I 'd be vulnerable if people knew about me .
" I 've heard a lot of remarks in the past about people saying that gay people should die for religious reasons . "
Police protection A special government unit tackles the issue of forced marriages .
Every year it deals with around 1,600 cases of forced marriage .
Three - quarters of all calls are from people of South Asian origin .
Department head Olaf Henricson - Bell said gay and lesbian youngsters were particularly vulnerable .
" A few weeks ago , an individual got in touch with the unit to say he'd been taken to Pakistan , forced to marry against his will , brought back to the UK then denounced by both his new wife and his family for his sexuality .
" He 'd been subject to physical and other abuse .
When he rang us he was scared to leave the home and we had to secure police protection .
" Forced marriage by its nature is an underground practice and the cases often go unreported .
" The individuals involved may be reluctant to mention sexuality when they ring us or when they bring their case to the attention of the authorities , " he said .
The unit plans to work with the trust to produce a training programme for Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender organisations working with young people at risk of being forced into marriage .

Holy Oh My God Damn Fucking Shit !!! –
That moronic reaction alone will make you want to stay away with this one .
But if you are curious , and with balls to back em ’ up , then you ’ve got to fucking see this .
A transgender , who goes by the name ‘ genderhack ‘ , did something disgusting and so unthinkable that it sends shiver down my spine , uhm , and balls …
Before having a sex change , the sick - bastard first had an operation to remove his testicles , for the purpose of … get this – eating them !!!
Yes , he wants to cook and eat his own testicles !
Sick !
He even had a dinner guest to help him chow down his cooked balls !
Oh , my …
Presenting … the dinner guest , a girl , with an I.Q. of a fly .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
As international aid agencies rush food , water and medicine to Haiti ’s earthquake victims , a U.S. faith - based group is sending Bibles to Haitians in their hour of need .
Not any Bible .
These are solar - powered audible Bibles that can broadcast the holy scriptures in Haitian Creole to 300 people at a time .
Called the “ Proclaimer , ” the audio Bible delivers “ digital quality ” and is designed for “ poor and illiterate people , ” the Faith Comes By Hearing group said .
It added 600 of the devices were already on their way to Haiti .
The Albuquerque - based organisation said it was responding to the Haitian crisis by “ providing faith , hope and love through God ’s Word in audio . ”
With tens of thousands of Port - au - Prince residents living outdoors because their homes have collapsed or they fear aftershocks from Tuesday ’s quake , the audio Bible can bring them “ hope and comfort that comes from knowing God has not forgotten them through this tragedy , ” the group said on its website .
" The Proclaimer is self - powered and can play the Bible in the jungle , desert or ... even on the moon ! " said the website www.faithcomesbyhearing.com/.

London , England ( CNN ) --
Photographers fed up with being stopped and searched by British police under the country 's terrorism laws gathered in London to protest against the practice .
Waving placards with the message , " I am a photographer , not a terrorist , " about 2,000 photographers called for more leniency from the British police .
The slogan is the name of a group set up to campaign against certain sections of Britain 's Terrorism Act 2000 , which was designed to give police greater powers to fight terrorism .
Photographers say they have been unduly targeted by Section 44 of the Act , which allow officers to stop and search people , regardless of whether they have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing .
" We 're coming together to show solidarity and to show that we wo n't be intimidated , " said Jonathan Warren , a freelance photographer and one of the founders of the campaign group .
Warren said he was approached by police a couple of years ago while covering an anti-arms protest .
" I was waiting for the protest to start when I was stopped and searched , even though I had my press card and was an accredited photographer , " Warren said .
" I showed it to the police , and they did n't believe me .
They went through my bag and my pockets , " he said .
A small number of police watched the protest Saturday in London 's Trafalgar Square , but they maintained a low profile .
Some protesters wore police costumes and badges identifying themselves as " vigilance officers , " amid frequent camera flashes .
Mock " freedom wardens " also made their way through the crowd pretending to arrest photographers .
Britain 's terrorism laws were dealt a blow last week when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that stop - and - search powers under Section 44 of the Act were a breach of human rights .
The ruling came after lengthy legal fight by two people who were stopped and searched on their way to a London demonstration .
The court found that the " coercive powers " of the anti-terrorism legislation amounted to a clear interference with the right to respect for private life .
The British government is appealing the decision , saying the powers are an important tool in the fight against terrorism .
Another founding member of " I 'm a photographer , not a terrorist , " freelance photographer Jess Hurd , felt that she too had been unfairly stopped under Section 44 .
She said these random checks have affected photographers ' ability to work .
" I was stopped last year for 45 minutes covering a travel wedding , " the freelance photographer said .
" Everyone , if they have n't been stopped already , knows someone who has been .
This is becoming a problem .
People stopped over sunsets at St. Paul's , chip shops , roundabouts -- it 's getting a bit crazy .
" I would personally like a repeal of this law , " Hurd said .
" It 's absolutely outrageous that the terrorism act is being used to stop photographers from doing their job , " said another participant , freelance photographer Adam Woolfitt .
" My message is stop .
Leave us alone , " Woolfitt said .
" We 've got a job to do . "
The peak of $ 147 for a barrel of oil seems to be a long gone memory .
Yet oil per barrel is still up over $ 75 , a long cry from the $ 20 barrel many became accustomed to .
I have been mulling this issue over for a few months because few people are even considering oil prices in relation to the value of housing .
With the current economic crisis , there has been nearly an obsessive view that if we only manage to solve housing prices , then all will be well in the economy .
Clearly this is not the case given that unemployment is still at peak levels .
Home prices have fallen drastically in many areas across the country .
But if we look at areas that are less economically diverse and merely serve as suburb hubs , these areas are getting a dual correction .
First , these areas have commercial real estate developments that assumed continuous urban growth that relied on cheap oil .
Cheap oil seems to be a thing of the past .
Second , these areas were built around the notion that many people would be willing to drive into a city hub in order to purchase cheap and plentiful housing .
Well this only would work with cheap oil .
Let us look at the oil chart first :
Putting aside the 1970s oil spikes , we had over 20 years of stable and cheap oil prices .
So fuel was only an afterthought in building suburbs that were miles away from any city center .
The idea was that there would always be enough people willing to drive any distance for a piece of the American dream .
That of course is largely not the case anymore .
And at closer examination , many of these areas are seeing real estate prices crash at a higher rate than areas closer to employment centers .
California is a perfect example of this phenomenon .
We already know that the overall California housing market is in deep trouble .
Yet if we look at areas like San Bernardino and Riverside Counties , prices have corrected much quicker than counties closer to population and employment hubs .
These two counties known as the Inland Empire to people in Southern California had massive bubbles that have largely corrected .
Many in the area think that these areas will see prices go up but that is a large assumption .
If energy costs remain high , there is little reason to believe this .
Let us examine their values over the last decade :
The correction in these two counties is fierce .
Riverside is down 54 percent from its peak value and San Bernardino is down by 59 percent .
These are deep cuts in values from peaks that were clearly unsustainable .
Did oil push these values down faster than the overall market ?
I would say that it did .
We need to also remember than many people that bought out in these areas also had lower incomes than those that were able to afford higher prices near prime areas .
So by default , they had a smaller buffer to withstand any external shocks from the market .
Next , the cheap oil era fueled growth since long commutes did n’t really matter aside from the time spent commuting back and forth .
With higher fuel costs , this ate into the budget of many families that were already stretching to get by .
So even though oil is now at $ 76 a barrel and not $ 147 , it is certainly not at $ 20 .
That is a big difference .
Plus , many of these areas require central cooling and heating for the summer and winter given their variable temperature climates and this also relies on energy prices .
The Inland Empire resembles the dynamics of Arizona and Nevada much more closely than say beach front property in Malibu .
Now for these areas , they have seen a lost decade in home values both nominally and in real terms .
Part of the long - term issues in these suburb areas is also based on their troubled employment base .
Take a look at the unemployment rate for these areas :
California : 12.3 Riverside : 14.6 San Bernardino : 13.8 Source : Employment Development Department , CA
And California ’s unemployment and underemployment rate is closer to 22 percent so you can imagine the rate for these two areas .
In California you are seeing many investors buying up these properties thinking that prices will go up once again .
But this bet is being made on the cheap oil notion .
In fact , if the U.S. dollar keeps on declining oil will go up just by default .
Even though we may be facing drops in demand , the world certainly is n’t :
When you add the above , it makes you wonder how well these areas are going to cope with sustained higher energy prices .
Many of these areas were n’t planned well either so it is n’t like a self sustaining community .
Many were betting on easy back and forth access to big city hubs .
Is there the infrastructure to support a local population base ?
Maybe .
Yet the deep hits in prices causes one to wonder whether these areas are functioning on a model that is now outdated .
It is also the case that these areas have the largest amount of foreclosure activity :
You have one normal home sale for every three foreclosures on the market .
This is data as of this week so problems are still occurring in these areas .
The average American trying to make it on a long commute is going to need to get used to high energy costs .
Short of the dollar staging a massive rally and world oil demand collapsing , this seems to be the new calculus of the market .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Planned layoff announcements at major U.S. corporations increased 59 % in January , reaching 71,482 from a nine - year low of 45,094 seen in December , according to the latest job - cut tally by Challenger Gray & Christmas .
It was the first month - to - month increase in layoffs since July , the outplacement firm reported Wednesday .
The figures are not seasonally adjusted .
Frederick C. Weyand , who served as the commander of American forces in Vietnam in the final year of the war , a duty he carried out despite having become convinced as early as 1967 that the war was a hopeless venture , died on Wednesday at his home in Honolulu .
He was 93 .
The death was confirmed by his daughter , Carolyn Harley .
General Weyand ( pronounced WY - und ) , one of the rare top commanders who did not attend West Point , began serving as a combat officer in Vietnam in 1966 .
As commander of the Tropic Lightning Division , he scored several victories in tough fighting near Saigon and along the Cambodian border , and he was soon placed in charge of II Field Force , responsible for the southern third of South Vietnam .
He was known as an acute analyst of intelligence data .
As a deputy to Gen. William C. Westmoreland , the commander of American forces in Vietnam , he became concerned about unusual movements of North Vietnamese forces in the weeks before the Tet festival in early 1968 and urged that American troops be redeployed closer to Saigon to repel a possible attack .
Westmoreland , persuaded , called off a series of planned pre-emptive strikes on Vietcong sanctuaries near the Cambodian border and allowed General Weyand to shift 15 battalions back to the Saigon area , a move that made it possible for American forces to react quickly and inflict heavy casualties when the North Vietnamese mounted the Tet Offensive .
F1 cars will weigh almost 100 kg more at the start of a race this year compared to last .
That presents a host of challenges to F1 designers such as brake wear , ride height , weight distribution and tyre wear .
Any team which does n’t get a grip of the problems will find themselves playing catch - up like McLaren did in 2009 .
We ’ll find out what their solutions are when the 2010 F1 car launches start next week .
How might they try to solve them ?
The starting point for most of the challenges facing F1 designers this year is the banning of refuelling .
Instead of having cars weighing up to 660 - 700 kg at the start of a race and 605 kg at the end , that variation will be more like 800 kg to 620kg .
That has major repercussions for the design of the cars in several key areas :
Brakes
Brakes will take an even greater pounding in 2010 as drivers will have to brake harder and longer in their fuel - heavy cars .
And designers will have to get it right straight from the off as the first race of the season is at Bahrain , one of the toughest tracks for brake wear .
F1 ’s most notorious brake - buster – the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal – will be back later in 2010 .
And teams will return to Abu Dhabi where higher than expected brake wear caused problems for McLaren and Red Bull in 2009 .
And they ’ve got to cope with all that using brakes which are the same size as those they had last year :
11.3.2
All discs must have a maximum thickness of 28 mm and a maximum outside diameter of 278 mm .
FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations 2010
In the second half of last season – particularly after the Surtees and Massa accidents – we saw the stewards crack down on teams to prevent them from running cars that were damaged or dangerous .
We saw this in their reaction to Fernando Alonso losing a wheel during the Hungarian Grand Prix , and BMW being ordered to replace Robert Kubica ’s damaged front wing at Monza .
When Mark Webber crashed with brake failure at Singapore , it was shortly after the team had warned him on the radio that he had a brake problem and should return to the pits .
Teams who do not take that precaution next year are likely to face the wrath of the stewards .
Ride heights
Heavy fuel weights at the start of a race present another problem for designers .
For optimum performance the cars need to run as low to the ground as possible .
But as the fuel weight decreases the cars will ride higher because there will be less mass pushing down on their suspension springs .
In the last two seasons when refuelling was not allowed in F1 – 1992 and 1993 – many teams solved this problem using active suspension technology , which could be programmed to compensate for the ever - decreasingly fuel load by gradually reducing the ride height .
But two clauses in the 2010 rules prevent those kind of systems from being used :
10.2.2
Any powered device which is capable of altering the configuration or affecting the performance of any part of the suspension system is forbidden .
10.2.3
No adjustment may be made to the suspension system while the car is in motion .
FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations 2010
The regulations appear not to rule out teams designing mechanical systems to adjust ride height during pit stops , but that may prove too complicated and time - consuming to achieve .
As has been the case since 1994 , teams which run their cars too low are at risk of wearing down their skid blocks ( also known as ‘ planks ’ ) .
This year will be the first season they ’ve had to keep their plank wear in check while refuelling has not been allowed .
If you see pictures of cars in the pits without their nose cones on you may spot laser ride height sensors being used by the teams to check their compliance with the rules – especially during the forthcoming pre-season tests .
Fuel consumption
With refuelling banned the teams now have to fit an entire race - worth of fuel into their car .
As Dominic Harlow of Force India explained recently , they begin by looking at the track which is the most demanding in terms of fuel consumption .
A rough calculation using Williams ’ fuel consumption figures from last year suggests that will be the Singapore Grand Prix – 61 laps each using 2.533kg of fuel needing 154.5 kg of fuel .
But the real picture is more complicated than that .
To begin with , that figure of 2.533 kg per lap will increase in 2010 because the minimum weight of the cars has gone up by 15kg to 620 kg .
Also , the cars will consume fuel at a faster rate at the beginning of the race due to the extra weight of fuel on board .
That means they will need even more fuel in the tank to begin with .
Then we have to factor in the varying fuel consumption rates of different engines .
Williams used the comparatively thirsty Toyota engine last year – this year they will have Cosworth engines whose performance is an unknown quantity .
The FW32 is the first Cosworth - powered car we ’ll get a look at , and the size of its back end compared to its rivals could give us an indication of how thirsty Cosworth ’s CA2010 is .
The other engine users face the challenge of adapting their engines as to achieve better fuel economy within the strict engine freeze rules .
This is a particular challenge for Mercedes and Ferrari , whose fuel consumption in 2009 was much higher than the likes of Renault ( see this post on Gavin ’s blog for more ) .
Weight distribution
The reduction in front tyre width combined with the enlargement of the fuel tanks means some tough calls have to be made on weight distribution .
Front tyres will be 25 mm narrower in 2010 compared to last year .
So while in 2009 designers aimed to move weight distribution forward , this year they ’re likely to try to move it rearward .
This may also lead to a reversal in the trend towards shorter wheelbases we saw last year .
Bridgestone will be supplying more durable tyres in 2010 to cope with the increased wear .
Rear packaging
One of the biggest technical stories of 2009 was the controversial double diffusers .
Teams will be able to run them again in 2010 – but are looking to ban them in 2011 .
They offer such a valuable increase in downforce it ’s unlikely any teams will race without them this year .
But the air flow around the rear of the car will be compromised by the enlarged fuel tanks which will require the radiators to be re-positioned and enlarged .
Ferrari have already confirmed they will integrate the oil tank for their car within the gearbox case to give more room for the fuel tank .
Last year the Red Bull RB5 had low , tightly - sculpted side pods and pull road rear suspension .
It will be harder to pull off that arrangement while meeting the demands imposed by the diffuser and the larger fuel tank .
But if any designer is likely to spring a surprise it ’s Adrian Newey .
The team have already admitted the RB6 will not appear at the first test while it fine - tunes what could be the most radical design on the pit lane .
One other potentially significant change here is that no team will be running KERS .
McLaren and Ferrari potentially have more to gain in this area compared to their 2009 designs which still had KERS installations at the end of last season .
Launch season
These are just the obvious changes we expect to see in 2010 .
What other , more radical ideas might F1 designers have up their sleeves ?
Next week we ’ll start to see the cars in their launch configurations but as usual the teams will wait until the later tests to finalise their aerodynamic packages for the first race at Bahrain .
Which team do you think will produce the strongest car for 2010 ?
What other design problems do you expect ?

Dr. Liebowitz , a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas , said the problem on the Web today has less to do with monopolies or software design than with intellectual piracy , which he has also studied extensively .
In fact , Dr. Liebowitz used to be a favorite of the “ information - wants - to - be - free ” faction .
Image RETHINKING
THE WEB Jaron Lanier , pictured here in 1999 , was an early proponent of the Internet ’s open culture .
His new book examines the downsides .
Credit ... Jeffery A. Salter / The New York Times
In the 1980s he asserted that photocopying actually helped copyright owners by exposing more people to their work , and he later reported that audio and video taping technologies offered large benefits to consumers without causing much harm to copyright owners in Hollywood and the music and television industries .
But when Napster and other music - sharing Web sites started becoming popular , Dr. Liebowitz correctly predicted that the music industry would be seriously hurt because it was so cheap and easy to make perfect copies and distribute them .
Today he sees similar harm to other industries like publishing and television ( and he is serving as a paid adviser to Viacom in its lawsuit seeking damages from Google for allowing Viacom ’s videos to be posted on YouTube ) .
Trying to charge for songs and other digital content is sometimes dismissed as a losing cause because hackers can crack any copy - protection technology .
But as Mr. Lanier notes in his book , any lock on a car or a home can be broken , yet few people do so  or condone break - ins .
“ An intelligent person feels guilty for downloading music without paying the musician , but they use this free - open - culture ideology to cover it , ” Mr. Lanier told me .
In the book he disputes the assertion that there ’s no harm in copying a digital music file because you have n’t damaged the original file .
“ The same thing could be said if you hacked into a bank and just added money to your online account , ” he writes .
“ The problem in each case is not that you stole from a specific person but that you undermined the artificial scarcities that allow the economy to function . ”
Mr. Lanier was once an advocate himself for piracy , arguing that his fellow musicians would make up for the lost revenue in other ways .
Sure enough , some musicians have done well selling T - shirts and concert tickets , but it is striking how many of the top - grossing acts began in the predigital era , and how much of today ’s music is a mash - up of the old .
How Do You Look When Merging Fails ;-)
There was a Simpsons episode , I ca n’t recall correctly , but I think Bart recorded Lisa when her heart broke and he watched it in slow motion to stop exactly at that point .
I thought of this episode yesterday while playing around with my laptop ’s webcam and a Python shell .
Finally I wrote a little fun script that does almost the same : Just register it as a hg hook and it takes a picture of you exactly at the unique moment when merging fails and it sends it directly and without any further questions to Twitpic and Twitter :
#!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys import tempfile import time from CVtypes import cv from twitpic import TwitPicAPI DEVICE = 0 TWITTER_USER = ' xx x ' # CHANGE THIS !
TWITTER_PWD = ' xx x '
# CHANGE THIS ! #
This is the time in seconds you need to realize that the merge has # failed .
When setting this consider that it already takes about a second # for the camera to take the picture .
" 0 " means no delay ;-) EMOTIONAL_SLUGGISHNESS_RATE = 0.0 def grab_image ( fname ) : camera = cv.CreateCameraCapture( DEVICE ) frame = cv.QueryFrame( camera ) cv.SaveImage ( fname , frame ) def how_do_you_look ( ) : failed = bool ( os.environ.get ( ' HG_ERROR ' , 0 ) ) if not failed : return # hmpf , maybe next time ... fd , fname = tempfile.mkstemp ( '.jpg ' ) if EMOTIONAL_SLUGGISHNESS_RATE
> 0 : time.sleep(EMOTIONAL_SLUGGISHNESS_RATE ) grab_image ( fname ) twit = TwitPicAPI ( TWITTER_USER , TWITTER_PWD ) retcode = twit.upload( fname , post_to_twitter =True , message = ' Another merge failed .') os.remove ( fname ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : how_do_you_look ( )
You ’ll need the CVtypes OpenCV wrapper and this Twitpic Python module .
I ’ve patched the twitpic module to support messages .
Have a look at this issue if it ’s already supported , otherwise a diff that adds the message keyword is attached to the issue .
To use it as a Mercurial hook just add to .hg / hgrc :
[ hooks ] update = / path/to/the/above/script.py
and make the script executable .
The results are pretty good :)
Have fun !
BTW , the way how to access the camera is inspired by this nice blog post about face recognition using OpenCV .

Primate brains have not always gotten bigger as they evolved , according to new research .
The findings challenge the controversial argument that Homo floresiensis , also known as the hobbit , had a tiny , chimp - sized brain because of disease .
" It was assumed that brain sizes generally get bigger through primate evolution , " said Nick Mundy , a Cambridge University evolutionary geneticist and lead author of the study .
While that may be true for most primates , " we find very strong evidence in several lineages that brain sizes actually have gotten smaller . "
The brains of marmosets , mouse lemurs and mangabeys have shrunk significantly .
The brain of the mouse lemur , a teacup - sized , nocturnal primate found in Madagascar , is 27 percent smaller than that of the common ancestor of all lemurs , Mundy said .
The paper , which appears Jan. 27 in Biomed Central , analyzed brain size and body mass from 37 current and 23 extinct primate species and used three different models to reconstruct how the brain evolved .
Though its not clear why smaller brains would be advantageous to some species , the brain 's voracious energy consumption may have played a role , Mundy speculated .
If food was scarce , it may have been better to sacrifice intelligence to use less energy .
The findings are more fodder for the debate about the mysterious H. floresiensis , a 3 - foot - tall hominid discovered in a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 .
Some have argued these " hobbits " were a distinct species , while others say they were simply stunted , sickly Homo sapiens .
In the second line of reasoning , the hominids may have suffered from cretinism , a pituitary gland disease that leads to stunted growth and small brains .
Part of this camp 's argument was that the hobbits ' miniscule brain was too small to make evolutionary sense , Mundy said .
" We 've just applied the reduction in brain size that we see across the rest of the primate phylogeny to the case of the Flores man , " he said .
" Under reasonable assumptions , it does look plausible that this brain - size massive reduction could have occurred . "
Some scientists argue that there 's no need to rely on either evolutionary brain shrinkage or pathology to account for the short stature of the hobbits .
" Arguments for H. flo being somehow pathological ( one syndrome or another ) have been totally refuted , " Peter Brown wrote in an e-mail .
Brown , a paleoanthropologist at the University of New England in New South Wales , Australia , first discovered the hobbit skeletons .
What 's more , evidence suggests the diminutive island dwellers left Africa more than 1.8 million years ago , and " probably arrived on Flores already small - brained and small - bodied , " he wrote .
In addition , their skeletal and dental features most resemble the tiny - brained Australopithecus or Homo habilis .
So , the brain of H. floresiensis could have started out small and stayed that way , rather than shrinking through evolution .

But what if you had a really , really big volcano .
A super volcano , if you will .
One big enough to fuck up the whole planet .
Uh Oh ...
Supervolcanoes exist , and they are to volcanoes what nuclear weapons are to firecrackers .
According to Wikipedia , a supervolcano can puke out more than 240 - cubic - miles of matter into the sky , which is millions of times larger than a normal eruption .
Imagine tossing all of Connecticut into the atmosphere .

They are caused by massive amounts of magma building up pressure under the crust , and not enough holes ( volcanoes , geysers , etc , ) to vent it all .
Eventually , the pressure builds until a massive section of earth explodes .
The human race was possibly shaped by one such explosion -- it wreaked such havoc on the ecosystem that when it was done , there were only enough humans left on the planet to fill one high school gymnasium .
But do n't worry , there are only , like , seven potential supervolcanoes in the world .
Three are in the western United States .
So Are We Doomed ?
Maybe .
There is no evidence that any of these are going to explode in our lifetime - oh wait .

Coming off a year in which it levied the largest fine in history against any corporation , President Obama ’s Labor Department says it will use next year ’s budget , which is no larger than this year ’s , to actually increase its enforcement of worker safety rules .
The department allocated 100 new inspectors for its Occupational Safety and Health Administration this year and is planning to add 25 additional OSHA inspectors next year .
In order to do this without a budget increase , the Obama administration plans to slash 35 positions the Bush administration had allocated to OSHA ’s “ compliance assistance program ” for businesses .
A federal audit commissioned by the Obama administration this year showed that the Bush - designed OSHA program , geared to “ helping ” businesses comply with safety laws , was not working .
Funds shifted out of the “ compliance assistance ” programs will also be used to increase OSHA ’s Wage and Hour protection programs .
Describing the new approach earlier this week Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said , “ It affirms this administration ’s strong commitment to vigorous enforcement .
OSHA received over 100 inspectors in our 2010 budget , as well as an additional 25 requested in 2011 and we are moving 35 inspectors from compliance assistance to enforcement .
“ With the largest fine in OSHA ’s history , ” Solis declared , “ We are sending a strong message throughout industry that we will not tolerate endangerment of workers . ”
The secretary said OSHA will “ concentrate on high risk workplaces like construction and meatpacking . ”
She made it clear that the administration , in its effort to protect workers , will go beyond just beefing up OSHA and its enforcement activities .
In her announcement Solis said the department plans a major effort to investigate firms that misclassify their workers as “ independent contractors . ”
The “ independent contractor ” misclassification , common in industries ranging from construction and trucking to transportation and even retail , leaves workers without labor law protection , workers ’ compensation or unemployment protection and liable for payments to Medicare and Social Security .
The Teamsters and the Laborers are just two of the unions who have led major battles against the “ independent contractor ” dodge .
The proposed new Labor Department budget actually sets aside $ 25 million and 100 new enforcement personnel “ to be used by the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department to identify and penalize employers who improperly misclassify employees as independent contractors . ”
The administration has gotten so serious about this that the Labor Department budget also funds competitive grants for states that initiate their own programs that help end the misclassification problem .
“ The goal is to improve capacity to identify misclassification through increased information sharing and targeted audits in high - risk industry sectors , ” said Jane Oates , assistant labor secretary for employment and training .
“ These efforts will prevent misclassification , increase statutory enforcement where appropriate , and enable collection of payroll taxes previously lost due to misclassification , such as in the unemployment insurance program . ”
The plan , she said , is for inspectors to concentrate on companies that pay misclassified workers less than the minimum wage , or fail to pay them overtime .
There will be $ 1.7 billion available , a $ 67 million increase , for worker protection agencies overall , a department fact sheet says , “ to make sure the agencies have the resources to meet their responsibilities under the more than 180 laws they enforce . ”
That figure includes $ 573 million for OSHA , up $ 14 million from this year that will be used to add 60 additional enforcement staff who will conduct 9 percent more inspections .
The result will be 42,000 federal job site inspections , up from 38,000 , according to the fact sheet .

A man returns home from drinking one night to find part of his house on fire .
He warns everyone , wakes them up , helps them outside , then goes back inside to rescue someone who , he had just learned , was asleep upstairs .
Do the police officers at the end of the driveway ( A ) Refuse to help him do anything , ( B ) Tackle and restrain him after he ’s helped everyone out of the house , which is now burning down , ( C ) Tase him , ( D ) Arrest him for no apparent charge other than resisting arrest , ( E ) Confine him to a police car and police station , preventing him from receiving medical treatment for his first - and second - degree burns , or ( F ) All of the above ?
Since I like directing this blag at Statists as much as at other libertarians , I ’ll give some advice to the former group :
Stop trying to convince yourselves that monopolistic law - enforcement entities are moral , just , or practical , and have the sense to end this embarrassing charade of pretending that you support monopolistic law - enforcement systems because they protect people ’s rights or lives or property better than free - market systems in a libertarian society could .
When you look deep down , you know that does n’t make any sense , and you realize it ’s foolish and absurd to suppose that people who are attracted to positions of authority and power would rarely abuse that power when they themselves hold the highest , ultimate legal authority in a particular region .
Could you imagine that , if it were n’t tragically true already ?!
A group of clown - suited thugs tases , arrests , and denies medical treatment to someone who probably has n’t committed any offenses and certainly not any serious ones , and the only body to which the victim has recourse is the very one that employs those aggressors and imposes the laws that prevent him from seeking third - party arbitration !
In fact , to even demand arbitration by a disinterested third party would automatically incur even more penalties on top of his original “ crimes ” !
This is how the State wants it .
This is by design ; it ’s how the holders of power want society to function .
A monopolistic legislation , enforcement , and punishment system could not work any other way .
Put simply , this type of incident is not a bug , it is a feature .
When competition is outlawed , the incentive to do good disappears , and punishment for doing bad is nearly impossible .
The importance of this simple competitive mechanism in making the free market superior to socialism cannot be overstated .
A libertarian society ’s assortment of insurance , protection , investigation , pursuit , and arbitration systems provided on the free market would necessarily protect individual rights better and punish malfeasance more harshly , swiftly , and reliably than any monopolistic - Statist system could .
If you disagree with this , please read The Enterprise of Law by Bruce Benson and The Market for Justice by the Tannehills and then get back to me .
Please do n’t be so stupid as to suggest Statist claptrap for me to read , because I already experience the reality of your socialist hellhole every day .

HOUSTON  Bobby Wayne Woods was executed Thursday evening in Texas after his lawyers lost a battle to persuade the courts that he was too mentally impaired to qualify for capital punishment .
Mr. Woods , 44 , was convicted of raping and killing an 11 - year - old girl in 1997 .
He received a lethal injection and was pronounced dead at 6:48 p.m. in the death chamber at a state prison in Huntsville , Tex. , after the United States Supreme Court denied a request from his lawyers to stay his execution .
His last words , at 6:40 , were : “ Bye . I am ready . ”
Tests administered to Mr. Woods over the years placed his I.Q. between 68 and 86 , prompting a bitter debate between his lawyers and the state over whether he was too impaired to face execution .
The state and federal courts repeatedly sided with prosecutors .
The debate reflects the gray area left by the Supreme Court in 2002 , when it ruled that the mentally impaired were not eligible for the death penalty but left it up to state courts to interpret which inmates qualified as impaired .

— Durham police early Thursday arrested the woman who four years ago falsely accused three Duke University lacrosse players of raping her .
Crystal Mangum assaulted her boyfriend , set his clothes on fire in a bathtub and threatened to stab him , investigators said .
She was in the Durham County jail under a $ 1 million bond .
Mangum , 33 , has been appointed a public defender and is scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 22 .
Police charged her with attempted first - degree murder , five counts of arson , assault and battery , communicating threats , three counts of misdemeanor child abuse , injury to personal property , identity theft and resisting a public officer .
Shortly after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday , police received a 911 call about a domestic dispute at 2220 Lincoln St. Authorities said they believe the call came from one of the three children inside the house .
When officers arrived , they found Mangum and her boyfriend , Milton Walker , 33 , fighting .
According to police documents , Mangum scratched , punched and threw objects at Walker and told him , " I 'm going to stab you , ( expletive ) ! "
She then went into a bathroom and set his clothes on fire in the bathtub , police said .
Officers called the fire department to put out the flames .
No one was injured .
Milton was not charged , police said .
The three children inside the house , ages 3 , 9 and 10 , were not injured .
Officers said Mangum gave them a fake name , " Marella Mangum , " and age , prompting the identity theft charge .
She also resisted the officers who responded to the scene , according to police documents .
She has been ordered to have no contact with Walker .
Mangum – who penned her memoir , " Last Dance for Grace , " in 2008 – was a student at North Carolina Central University in 2006 and also worked as an exotic dancer when she performed at the now - infamous Duke lacrosse party .
It was there , she claimed , that three white members of the team trapped her inside a bathroom and raped and sexually assaulted her .
The three players were indicted on rape and other charges on the basis of her allegations and were eventually exonerated after North Carolina 's attorney general dismissed the charges .
The case ultimately cost former Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong his job and he was later disbarred .
He also spent a night in jail for lying to a Superior Court judge .
Several players in the Duke lacrosse case , including Duke Unviersity and the North Carolina Attorney General 's Office , declined to comment on the case .
Nifong could not be reached for comment .
" My heart goes out to her , " Joseph Cheshire , who represented one of the accused lacrosse players .
" Mostly , I worry about her children . "
Authorities say the children are in the care of other family members .
" We hope that the courts will adjudicate this case with fairness and without bias , " Vincent Clark , Mangum 's publisher , said in a statement .
" Nevertheless , we support Crystal in her effort o heal from abuse and past injustices , "

A recent editorial in The Oregonian argued that the Legislature created a difficult choice on Measures 66 and 67 , but voters , in effect , should choose business interests over services .
This , the editorial argued , would force the Legislature to come back and adopt tax increases that businesses would support , but it adds that that probably wo n't happen .
Unspoken is the fact that all state services have already implemented cuts , and human service agencies have lists of the next round of very deep cuts if these measures fail .
Opponents of the measures claim thousands of jobs will be lost and that prices will go up to cover the tax increases .
They say state spending is out of control due to liberal legislators who would not compromise with big business interests , and that the whole reason we pay so much in taxes is greedy public employees .
Can you really believe that thousands of jobs will be lost and prices will go up to offset the increases ?
Would n't it be one or the other , not both ?
Can you really believe that a Tillamook dairy farmer is going to lay people off because her taxes go up $ 140 a year ?
Would Nike , Intel or a large trucking firm in Medford pay the cost of moving to avoid a slight increase in Oregon taxes ?
Nationwide the average tax rate is 4.9 percent of gross state product , and these measures take Oregon to only 3.8 percent .
It does n't make sense to assume that these taxes will crash the Oregon economy the way opponents say .
In the past 30 years the top 20 percent of Oregon households have seen their average real adjusted gross income increase by 47 percent while the rest of Oregonians have stagnated or lost ground financially .
The bottom 20 percent , the families most dependent on state services , have actually seen a loss of 14 percent .
That 's a 61 percent gap as a result of years of shifting taxes to the poor .
From 1980 to 2006 , C - corporations ' profits went from roughly $ 2 billion to $ 12 billion annually .
Yes , the recession has changed this , but it's not acceptable that the vulnerable give up services to sustain such gains .
And the vast majority of state employees are not part of that top 20 percent of wealthy Oregonians , so why are they a fairer target than the top fifth ?
Local small businesses depend much more on the public employees living in their communities than on the few families who make more than $ 250,000 a year in adjusted gross income .
The campaign against these measures cannot identify one person who will actually lose a job if these measures pass , but I can name some 10,000 people with autism , Downs syndrome and other special needs who will lose their jobs and day programs if these measure fail .
Real people .
Real numbers .
Let me offer some more real numbers .
Since 1980 , Oregon 's general fund budget has increased from $ 4,128,063,000 to $ 14,100,000,000 .
That 's a whopping 472.5 percent increase .
This proves out - of - control government spending , right ?
Trouble is , Oregon 's population also increased by 44 percent since 1980 .
To keep up with that and the fact that inflation requires $ 2.66 to buy what a dollar bought in 1980 , proportionally , the 2009 budget should be $ 15,812,132,515 .
Rather than being out of control , we are under - spending previous generations by $ 1,712,000,000 .
Shame on us .
The reason for most of Oregon 's spending increases since the ' 80s has been voter initiatives , not the Legislature .
In 1990 , Measure 5 made the state responsible for 75 percent of public school funding , up from 25 percent in 1980 .
In 1995 , Measure 11 tripled the cost of the prison system but left the means of funding that to the Legislature .
Our initiative measures are the real out - of - control " legislature , " and the responsible thing would be to pay the cost of the laws we passed and stop forcing the real Legislature to make cuts in services for the vulnerable .
Prisons and schools are controlling the state budget -- so much so that funds for programs responsible for the care and safety of vulnerable people are proportionally shrinking , not experiencing out - of - control growth .
A chilling example is that Child Protective Service caseloads have grown from an average of 60 kids in the early ' 80s to a range of 120 to 200 now , and every case has seen a five - fold increase in paperwork to withstand increased legal scrutiny .
Whether it is Jeanette Maples in 2009 or Ashley Pond and Miranda Gaddis in 2002 , their child welfare caseworkers get blamed for their deaths , but nothing is being done about the impossible caseloads that are really responsible .
And further cuts are pending .
Oregon 's kids , disabled , seniors and all those families who depend on state services ask you to question if they really are the most appropriate ones to pay if these measures fail .
Looking at real numbers , I personally can't see the logic .

I was on a conference call with Nancy Pelosi Tuesday afternoon , and she was clear :
There 's not a snowball 's chance in hell that the House will vote to pass the Senate health - care bill in its present form .
" Do n’t even think of asking us to vote for the Senate bill unless the other bill has passed both houses that will amend it through reconciliation , " she said .
But she promised several times during the call : " We will get this done . "
What the House apparently will vote for is a repeal of the antitrust legislation that exempted the health insurance and malpractice insurers for the past 65 years .
She said it will happen next week .
And in case you have n't figured it out yet , the new Democratic mantra is " Jobs , jobs , jobs . "
Pelosi wove the theme throughout the call .
She talked about job lock ( " If you want to leave your job and become a writer or an entrepreneur without worrying about your health insurance , you can do that . " )
" Every issue for us has been about jobs .
The recovery , the budget , health , education , climate and energy bills – all about the economic well - being of America ’s families , " she said .
" Healthcare is central because the current system is so unsustainable .
It ’s not back - burnered , " she said .
She noted the difference it make " in the economic security of America ’s families .
" We have to get this done , we are so very , very close .
She said some senators are calling her , urging her to take the opportunity to put in single payer and the public option .
" I have to wonder , is there a market for these things ? " she said , noting she did n't think the Senate had the votes for either .
She ended the call with an exhortation .
" It ’s a heavy lift , " she said .
" The other side has endless money , total determination that change will not happen . "
She said the insurance industries have the " same philosophical backing as the same people who tried to keep Medicare from happening . "
" It ’s a pretty exciting time .
You ca n’t be discouraged , we have to keep fighting for the American people and our democracy , she said .
" It ’s not only about their health , it ’s about economic security .
We are determined to get that done .
If I sound calm , it ’s because we will not be deterred from this , we will get it done . "
A Chandler man suspected of standing through his open sunroof while speeding on Valley freeways has turned himself in .
Arizona Department of Public Safety officers arrested 25 - year - old Richard Anthony Flores on suspicion of reckless driving and criminal speed , DPS reported .
DPS said Flores was involved in three incidents on Valley freeways .
During the first incident on Nov. 6 , Flores reportedly reached 90 mph in a 65 mph zone on the San Tan portion of the Loop 202 near Lindsay Road .
In the other two incidents , Flores was captured on camera driving his Volkswagen Passat while standing through his sunroof .
Those incidents occurred minutes apart on Nov. 11 on westbound U.S. 60 near Mesa Drive , then Alma School Road .
Flores reached speeds of just under 80 mph , according to DPS .
Flores ' vehicle triggered DPS photo enforcement cameras 14 times in October and November .
Investigators have tied Flores to eight of those violations .
Flores turned himself in Thursday morning after DPS officers encouraged his family Wednesday night to have Flores contact them .
Bailey said Flores " was n't surprised when he was contacted . "
He was also served with seven civil speeding citations .
Of course , Geithner is pushing the Very Serious Idea of reforming Social Security and Medicare .
Does n't everyone ?
Considering that the Greenspan commission did n't actually work - at least , not the way that Geithner says it did - it kind of leads me to wonder what he actually means .
From This Week :
TAPPER : Do you think the fact that you guys are pushing the bipartisan commission is indicative of the fact that our political system is not capable of taking on the serious challenges our nation faces ?
You and I know that the money , as Willie Sutton says , said , that -- why do you rob banks ?
Because that 's where the money is .
The money is in entitlement programs : Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security , things that you do not touch in this budget .
The fact that you need a bipartisan commission to recommend cuts or tax increases , does n't that indicate that our political system is incapable of making these tough decisions ?
GEITHNER : Jake , I am very confident in our ability as a country to bring people together and make sure we are solving these challenges and these problems .
We 've done it in the past , it is completely within our capacity to do as a country .
But of course , it requires you bringing people together across the aisle to step back from politics , to try to bring practical solutions to things that are very important to our future as a country .
And the president is committed to do that .
We 're going to give the Republican Party the chance to share in the responsibility and the burden and the privilege of trying to fix the things that were broken in this country .
TAPPER : Republicans are afraid this is just a back door for tax increases .
Are you willing to say that tax increases are off the table for this commission ?
Let 's sit down and talk about the long - term structural problems with entitlement spending ?
GEITHNER :
The president 's view , and this is a view shared by many Republicans , and it builds on what we 've seen with effective commissions in the past , like the Greenspan commission that President Reagan established to help restore the financial footing of Social Security , is that for this to work , you 've got to bring people together to step back from politics , day - to - day politics , and to bring fresh ideas to solve these kind of problems .
That 's the only way to do it , we think .
And we 're committed to doing that .
We 've got to do it on a bipartisan basis , and we 're deeply serious about doing this .
Last night , President Obama said he wanted ideas on health care reform .
Obama put it this way :
“ If anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums , bring down the deficit , cover the uninsured , strengthen Medicare for seniors and stop insurance company abuses , let me know .
Let me know .
Let me know .
I ’m eager to see it . ”
House Minority Leader John Boehner raised his hand .
So did Dr. Margaret Flowers .
Unfortunately , Dr. Flowers is not from either party .
Last year , she decided to drop out of the Democratic Party because “ both major political parties have failed our patients and us . ”
But she nonetheless took up Obama ’s offer .
Dr. Flowers has a plan that would fit Obama ’s criteria .
Single payer , everybody in , nobody out .
Medicare for all .
And this morning , she traveled to the White House to deliver a letter to Obama spelling out her reasons why .
Unfortunately , when doctor Flowers tried to deliver her letter to Obama , White House security turned her away .
For security reasons , the White House does n’t accept hand delivered letters .
Unless of course , you are with PhRMA or Blue Cross / Blue Shield or the insurance industry .
Then you get to meet with budget director , health care guru , and man about town Peter Orszag and deliver it mano a mano .
Ah yes , the personal is political .
Onward to single payer .

But until now the artist known as Banksy , in creating his satirical artworks , has largely stuck to the old - fashioned mediums of painting and sculpture .
Today , however , it emerged that the graffiti artist and cultural bête noire has branched into filmmaking , with the release of what is described as " the worlds first street art disaster movie " .
Exit Through the Gift Shop , which will have its international premiere on Sunday at the Sundance film festival , is described by its creator as " the story of how one man set out to film the unfilmable - and failed " , and by the festival 's organisers as " an amazing ride , a cautionary modern fairy tale ... with bolt cutters " .
Banksy 's spokeswoman , Jo Brooks , declined to elaborate much further on the plot of the 89 - minute feature film , though the festival 's website helpfully provides some details , describing it as the account of what happened when a French filmmaker , Terry Guetta , set out to record the " secretive world " of street art , only to meet Banksy , at which point " things took a bizarre turn " .
Pressed for more detail , the artist himself offered the following , hardly illuminating , elaboration through his publicist : " It 's a film about a man who tried to make a film about me .
Everything in it is true , especially the bits where we all lie . "
The film 's trailer shows footage of a number of street artists , their identities not always clear , captured in the rather shambolic act of creating graffiti artworks ‑ slipping off platforms , spilling paint and being intercepted by police and security guards .
" In a world without rules , " reads the tagline , " one man broke them all . "
Though the artist , who scrupulously guards his anonymity , does appear in the film , his identity , despite rumours to the contrary , is not revealed , said Brooks .
It is a departure for the artist , who has come some way from his beginnings as an underground rebel in Bristol in the early 1990s to a position dangerously approaching that of establishment darling .
A major show in that city 's museum last summer attracted 350,000 visitors in nine weeks and is thought to have contributed £ 10 m to Bristol 's economy , while 93 % of local residents voted in favour of the city council preserving rather than removing a Banksy artwork of a naked man dangling from a window .
The artist , many of whose works are comical spoofs of other works , these days even attracts his own unscrupulous imitators ‑ an exhibition on fakes and forgeries curated by the Metropolitan police and opening on Saturday at the Victoria and Albert includes a number of fake Banksy artworks .
John Cooper , director of the Sundance festival , described Exit Through the Gift Shop as " one of those films that comes along once in a great while , a warped hybrid of reality and self - induced fiction , while at the same time a totally entertaining experience .
The story is so bizarre I began to question if it could even be real ... but in the end I did n't care .
" I feel bad I wo n't be able to shake the filmmaker 's hand and tell him how much I love this film .
I think I will shake everyone 's hand that day and hope I hit on Banksy somewhere .
I love his work in all forms . "
RushBo , General of the conservative movement gave his orders to the rank - and - file teabaggers today on Fox and Friends with Gretchen Carlson :
Do not desert and get with the program .
How will the Tea Party movement like being told what to do ?
If the teabaggers were really part libertarian , they would create a third party because many of them do come from the Ron Paul party and they are n't fans of the GOP , but as many of us know , most tea partiers are arch conservatives and really only want and see all progressive policies revoked , including Social Security and Medicare , while making sure all the brown people stay where they belong .
Hey , maybe I can write a letter and see if Grover , Ralph Reed or even Jack Abramoff ( from behind bars ) will cosign it , asking the Tea Party movement to stay true to their values and form a third party if they really hate the Republicans .
Carlson :
One thing I like to do at the end of interviews is quiz the interviewee on a scale of one to ten .
So on a scale of one to ten :
Do you think Barack Obama will be re-elected in three years ?
Limbaugh :
One being no , and ten being absolutely ?
Carlson : Yes .
Limbaugh : Ah , one .
Carlson : One .
Really ?
Limbaugh : Yes .
Carlson :
On a scale of one to ten , will Hillary Clinton challenge Barack Obama for the Democratic -- ?
Limbaugh : Seven .
Carlson : Seven .
Limbaugh : Laying the groundwork even as we speak .
Carlson :
In what way ?
Limbaugh : Saying , ‘ No , I have no desire to run for president . ’
They say that – it ’s like a coach getting a vote of confidence from the owner , and gets canned the next day .
Saying you do n’t want to run is a clear signal that you ’re thinking about it and you want to .
The Clintons have just as much ambition to get back there as Obama had to get there .
And it ’s – they will pounce on this weakness .
Carlson :
On a scale of one to ten , that the Tea Party will become the Independent Party .
Limbaugh : Three .
Carlson : Why ?
Limbaugh :
They ’re going to come to senses and realize that all third parties do is guarantee the election of the Democrats .
The Perot party was the same thing .
Let the Democrats do the third - party thing .
The success here in the future is gonna be conservatism dominating , retaking if you will , the Republican Party .
I 'm not sure why the Generalisimo is so worried that they would start an independent party .
Many Teabagger leaders already have been telling the media that they indeed not only want to be part of the GOP , but they want to own it .
MATTHEWS : Matt , how about third party ?
What about the Tea Party ?
Sarah Palin is kind of hard to read .
She is fascinating .
Let ‘s face it , we ‘re all fascinated with her , because she ‘s exciting as a political figure right now .
But she ‘s talking third party .
I mean , she answered the question of Lars Larson .
Maybe it just came to mind , but she said , yeah , I might go third party , something like that .
Would you guys knock off an incumbent Republican by going third party ?
You know how the vote splits .
Split the right , the Dem wins .
KIBBE : The better way to do it is to take over the Republican party .
Frankly , that ‘s what our goal is .
We need to replace the Republican establishment with fiscal conservatives that are actually willing to cut spending .
If they pull it off , you can forget about public education , EPA , Social Security , Medicaid / Medicare , women 's rights and the like .
And the sad part is that the teabaggers ' own lives will be just as damaged by conservative rule as the rest of America -- and yet they will be happy in doing so .

Denmark has been operating against Somali pirates since 2008 Danish special forces serving as part of Nato 's counter - piracy operation have freed the crew of a cargo ship boarded by pirates off Somalia .
They moved in after being assured by the captain that the crew had locked themselves in a safe room , a Nato spokeswoman told the BBC .
It seems the pirates escaped to their boat before the troops arrived but the 180 m ( 590 ft ) vessel was being searched .
A second pirate boat in the area was seized by a Russian warship , Nato says .
Admiral Sir Trevor Soar , commander of the Nato Maritime HQ in London , commended the actions of the Danish warship Absalon , which carried out the rescue .
" Absalon 's action today demonstrates Nato 's resolve to deter and disrupt piracy off the Horn of Africa , " he said in a statement .
He also thanked the Russian and Indian navies for assisting in the operation .
Distress signal A distress signal was received from the master of the Antigua and Barbuda - flagged Ariella on Friday morning , reporting that six heavily armed pirates had boarded the ship , Nato spokeswoman Lt Cdr Jacqui Sherriff told the BBC .
I do n't know if he [ one of the pirates ] jumped overboard when he saw the helicopter or later when he saw the special forces
Cmdr Dan B Termansen
commander of the Absalon The attackers ' skiff and a second boat were seen in the area of the attack about 160 km ( 100 m ) off the Somalia coast .
Informed that the crew had managed to lock themselves away , the Absalon first sent out a helicopter to investigate , then a team of specially trained forces in inflatable dinghies to board the ship and regain control .
The crew , said to be 25 strong , were released safely .
Cmdr Dan B Termansen , commander of the Absalon , said that the crew had reported seeing a pirate firing an automatic weapon aboard their ship .
" I do n't know if he jumped overboard when he saw the helicopter or later when he saw the special forces , " he added .
" We searched the ship for hours and did n't find anybody . "
However , Cmdr Mikael Bill , head of the Danish Admiralty in western Denmark , said he did not believe there had been any pirates aboard the ship when the special forces arrived .
" It is our clear understanding that there were no hijackers on board but our helicopter had deterred an action , " he said .
A Russian warship , the Neustrashimy , successfully boarded and detained the pirates in the second skiff .
Precautions Cdr John Harbour , a spokesman for the EU Naval Force in Nairobi , praised the Nato operation .
It was , he told the Associated Press news agency , the first instance where a warship had been able to " send forces to stop a hijacking while it was in progress " .
Warships typically do not intervene in hijackings because of the danger that crews may be hit by crossfire , he pointed out .
However , in this case the ship had registered with naval authorities , was travelling along a recommended transit corridor and was part of a group transit , ensuring the ships had a helicopter within 30 minutes ' reaction time .
The waters off Somalia are among the most dangerous in the world , despite patrols from EU and other foreign naval forces .
Somalia , riven by war , has had no functioning government since 1991 , allowing pirates to operate along the lawless coast , almost with impunity .

KPilot is dead
Bertjan blogged about it two weeks ago , and you might have deduced it from Jason ’s gadget switch , but KPilot should be considered dead .
Of the three “ maintainers ” ( and I used that word only very loosely regarding myself ) I do n’t think any of them actually uses a PalmOS device any more .
There is , quite simply , no return for us any more in working on the application , much as we might want to keep the software alive .
Read Bertjan ’s blog for details on what this means and where you can find the software if you would like to resurrect it .
It ’s under the GPL v2 , so have at it .
To support such an effort , I ’ll say free to a good home : one box of assorted PalmOS devices , ranging from the Palm Pilot ( the original ! ) through to a Tungsten E and a pair of m500s .
With chargers and assorted cables .
Just drop me a note .

Some people cannot learn .
Thai army chief General Anupong Paojinda is defending the use of what are essentially magic wands to detect bombs , even though the specific device they use has been tested repeatedly and failed to perform .
This device is essentially the same as the ones used in Iraq and Afghanistan which have been proven worthless , and for which the head of the manufacturing company , Jim McCormick , has been arrested for suspicion of fraud .
Paojinda is convinced the dowsing rods work , even though it 's little more than an antenna glued to a plastic box .
In the meantime , thousands of people are dying in bomb attacks in Thailand near the Malaysian border .
Incredibly , the devices cost millions of dollars , when it would be far cheaper and far more effective to employ sniffing dogs at the checkpoints .
Antiscience kills .
You might think that dowsing rods are a cute diversion or at worst a waste of money , but in fact believing in them is leading directly to the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people across the world .
Tip o' the crystal pendulum to BABloggees Claude Works and Jimmy Reynolds .
Editor 's note : David Schilke and his family were passengers on Flight 253 .
He and his wife Iliana work for Ford Motor Co .
The following is from an e-mail he plans to send his co-workers on January 4 .
( CNN ) --
As most of you already know my wife , my son and I were on " that plane " on Christmas Day .
We had ringside seats .
In order to keep myself from going crazy ( repeating everything about everything over and over again ) I am writing this e-mail .
The therapeutic value of writing things down and staring at the words over and over again after such an event should also not be overlooked .
Please , that definitely does NOT mean that you can't come by and say hi , ask how we are doing , ask other questions or just stare at one of the luckiest persons you 'll ever know .
Stop by if you wish , any time .
The only thing you are absolutely forbidden to ask me about is work .
So , here goes .
The most important thing :
My family and I are still here and so are 275 other people -- so it did n't turn out so badly after all .
The facts :
The guy was on the left side of the plane , window seat , aisle 19 .
We were two rows back and I was four seats , plus an aisle , sideways from the guy .
My son was next to me ( on the aisle ) and my wife was across the aisle from him .
About 15 minutes before landing -- tray tables up , chairs forward , strapped in -- most everyone heard a pop , very much like a New Year 's Eve popper .
I immediately poked my head up .
I thought the sound had come from ahead of me but I saw a flight attendant standing in our aisle about four or five rows up looking straight across to the other side of the plane .
Her eyes were wide open staring over in what proved to be the generally correct direction .
I watched her and looked around for people who might be looking back or over towards a particular location .
But neither the flight attendant , presumably , nor I could locate the origin of the pop and a lot of people were n't staring towards one particular area of the plane .
She gave up , presumably , and continued down the aisle .
I slumped back into my chair .
I then was thinking that it was a child with a balloon or some not -very - intelligent person popping a bag .
It had been a good 10 or so seconds since the pop .
Some people over on the other side of the plane suddenly started yelling " fire " and " smoke . "
My head popped up again .
I could see smoke -- not a lot -- rising from a set of two window / aisle chairs on the opposite side of the plane a couple rows up .
I could see an orange reflection -- no flames -- low on the cabin walls .
People were yelling for water .
After a short time I unbuckled my belt , stood up and stared over at aisle 19 , the left window seat .
There was one person to stare at because his neighbor had fled .
People continued yelling " fire " and " water . "
People around the guy , and others who had water , started pouring water on his lap and the seat .
The flight attendants started yelling for fire extinguishers .
The fire continued but always was just a reflection off the cabin walls .
Once or twice I looked up at the smoke -- it was never more then a small smoke trail rising up from the area and spreading out over a few rows in each direction .
I could just barely smell the smoke .
Before the fire extinguishers arrived , a fellow on our side of the plane , about three rows up in a window seat , jumped out of his seat and over the middle four seats towards the suspect .
He grabbed at the suspect and after a very short period of time had dragged him out of his seat to the floor .
Less than a minute after the initial pop , two flight attendants ran up the aisle with fire extinguishers and doused the seat and presumably the suspect .
The fire and smoke were gone at this point .
The suspect was dragged up to the first - class section by the guy from our side of the plane .
We did not see the suspect again until he was removed by police after landing .
We clapped twice during the flight .
Once when the guy from our side of the plane came back to sit down and again when we landed .
My recollections may not exactly correspond to others that you may have heard or read -- a person can only watch and record so many things in a short period of time and different aspects of an event are more or less important to different people .
I would say that my recollections are very accurate as far as the smoke , the fire and the suspect are concerned .
I may not be recollecting exactly who said what and when , exactly what people said ( " water " or " we need water , " etc. ) , how many people poured water and from what direction , who moved from somewhere to assist ( except for the fellow mentioned above ) , what happened to the suspect after he was pulled from his seat onto the floor , exactly how he was removed from his seat , etc .
My wife stated that she did hear people screaming .
I was focused on one area of the plane and only heard things going on in that area ( " water , " " bring fire extinguishers , " etc. ) .
There may have been screaming going on ( which would imply some measure of panic ) but I did n't realize it .
The suspect : I remember staring at him for " long " periods of time ( many seconds ) .
I could very clearly see his face .
He never moved .
He never turned his head .
He never spoke a word or moved his lips .
He never struggled .
He never stopped anybody from pouring water on him .
His expression was completely emotionless .
The aftermath : After the suspect was moved to the front of the plane we quickly landed and moved to a gate -- about 15 minutes or so later .
During this time my wife 's attention -- and mine -- were on our son .
He is 5 years old , and the questions from him were non-stop .
We answered his questions calmly and as accurately as necessary without lying .
He was pretty good about things , maybe because a 3 - foot - 9 - inch person strapped in his seat could n't possibly see anything of consequence in this case .
The flight attendants had to yell at a couple of passengers who felt that it was absolutely necessary to remove items from the overhead bins .
The police came aboard and quickly got the suspect off the plane .
We waited another few minutes before we were allowed to depart .
I did not get a good look at the remains of the fire ( wrong side of the plane ) .
We went into the international luggage pick - up area of the terminal and remained there for about five hours or so .
We heard that other people were forced to sit on planes on the runways for hours , so sitting in the luggage area was not so bad after all .
For some reason we were moved to the hall between the gate and the luggage area for about 20 or 30 minutes and then back to the luggage area again .
We had our carry - on belongings with us the whole time .
Dogs were brought in to sniff through the carry - on luggage .
The conclusion of our stay in the luggage area was an interview with the FBI .
( about a half hour for us ) .
My wife was interviewed by a herd of reporters as we exited the international terminal .
During the bus ride to our car , I kissed my wife and bid her a Merry Christmas .
Until we started viewing the events on TV , many of us thought that this was some amateur - hour idiot or some suicidal moron looking for a little publicity .
We have since learned that we got lucky , very lucky .
This person and his handlers wanted and expected chaos , panic and mayhem .
Two common questions that we were asked over the next few days from various reporters and commentators :
1 ) Were you scared ?
If you asked my wife , she would say " yes " because for awhile , during that minute or so after the pop , she thought that the explosion and fire might cause a hole in the side of the plane that would decompress it .
If you asked me , I would say " no . "
I never saw any chaos or panic ( perhaps controlled chaos , at worse ) .
The flames were always very low , never rising high enough for me to actually see them even while standing ( just that orange glow on the cabin walls ) .
The smoke never got thick .
People cried out about the fire and smoke ( as they should ) .
They cried out for water and fire extinguishers .
The water was poured on the fire .
The fire extinguishers were brought over and the fire was extinguished .
The suspect never moved or spoke .
He did n't try to scream at us .
He did n't try to run out of his seat to possibly spread the fire .
He did n't try to fight being removed from his seat .
I watched and never got concerned to the point of being scared for me or for my son or wife .
Perhaps if I had actually seen flames that went higher and higher ; perhaps if there had been more smoke ; perhaps if other explosions had occurred ; perhaps if the suspect had tried to move about while on fire , or had screamed at us , or had tried to fight back in any way ; perhaps if people around me had been screaming -- then I probably would have been scared .
2 ) Will you fly again ?
Soon :
We have to fly again in January .
There is absolutely nothing that will keep us from flying in January .
Nothing .
Later :
We have enjoyed traveling the world and I expect we will continue to do so in the future .
...
We were not supposed to be on the Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
Our original itinerary was : December 23 - Moscow to Amsterdam , staying overnight in Amsterdam and December 24 - Amsterdam to Detroit .
On December 23 , we started out for the Moscow airport 4 - 1/ 2 hours before the flight , which is normally way more than enough time to go the required 25 - 30 miles .
Traffic was horrible that day ( weather , accidents ) and we made it to the airport about 1/2 hour after the flight left .
We stayed at an airport hotel in Moscow on December 23 , flew from Moscow to Amsterdam on the December 24 and took the fated flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on December 25 , a day late .
...
Some other things I have thought of in the week since Christmas :
The suspect would have just sat in his seat and slowly , and quietly , gone up in flames if nobody had done anything .
He paid cash .
How nice .
Maybe we , and others , will keep an eye on each other next time .
Walk around and watch people .
Look into the eyes of strangers and determine if we like what we see .
Between that Reid guy and this guy ( and others ? ) , " they " will keep trying until they " get it right . "
When they do get it right , it wo n't be pretty .
...
My quote of a lifetime :
" I would rather have days where I am happy to be alive as opposed to days where I am lucky to be alive . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Schilke .
BARACK OBAMA is a socialist who should be impeached .
He may well have been born outside the United States , may be a racist who hates white people , and may also want the terrorists to win .
In any case , he is indisputably less qualified to be president than Sarah Palin .
These are the views of the Republican mainstream , not the fringe , according to a poll conducted by Research 2000 .
When I say " is " , more Republicans believe it than do n't , and when I say " may be " , I mean nearly as many Republicans believe it as disbelieve it .
Bruce Bartlett throws up his hands : " between 20 % and 50 % of the party is either insane or mind - numbingly stupid . "
But let 's unpack this a bit before we write off rational conversation forever .
Just 24 % of the country currently calls itself Republican .
We 're seeing dual - causation here : as the party 's most fervent believers believe more ridiculous things , those sensible ones leave .
The remainder reinforce each other in extreme beliefs .
In any case , the important point is that we should be dividing each of these numbers by four , when we ask how many Americans believe them : 15 % think Mr Obama is a socialist , 10 % think he should be impeached , 8 % think he 's a racist , and so on .
Those figures do n't make me panic .
Really , this should give Republicans more pause than anyone .
The party - identification number is down over Mr Obama 's first year , and beliefs like this are n't likely to turn that around .
Anybody who does n't already believe these things is n't going to start by watching Mr Obama govern .
And is Mr Bartlett right that 20 - 50 % of this 24 % is insane or stupid ?
I 'd guess a big chunk of that group simply pays only passing attention to the news , not exactly reading the whole A section of their newspaper daily .
So where do they get their views ?
Remember , though they do n't read much , they 're committed Republicans , having stayed with the badly battered ship .
When they do tune in , they 're likely to go for cable news or talk radio , and what they hear is only what Republican leaders — and we can include media leaders — tell them .
If they 'd learned the actual facts of things , and still concluded Mr Obama is a socialist racist foreigner , that would indeed make them insane .
But they have n't .
And not being a news junkie does n't make them stupid , contra Mr Bartlett .
They value their jobs , families and non-wonky hobbies over reading the New Yorker or eventhe Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
The conclusion that remains is that the Republican leadership ( including that media leadership ) is deeply irresponsible .
When those passingly - informed people check in briefly , for the health of the country , they 'd better be getting a few responsible messages to absorb .
Instead , people in nice suits with great hair and a television gig — things that used to go along with sober authority — are telling them that the president cares more about Miranda - ising terrorist Muslims than he does about dead American babies .
The viewers have never heard this kind of thing before .
But this is not because of a once - in - a - lifetime radical president .
It 's because of a once - in - a - lifetime irresponsible party elite .
Blame the bosses , not the masses .
Why You Ca n’t Surf a Tsunami
You ca n’t surf a tsunami because it does n’t have a face .
Many people have the misconception that a tsunami wave will resemble the 25 - foot waves at Jaws , Waimea or Maverick ’s , but this is incorrect : those waves look nothing like a tsunami .
On the contrary , a tsunami wave approaching land is more like a wall of whitewater .
It does n’t stack up cleanly into a breaking wave ; only a portion of the wave is able to stack up tall .
Since the wave is 100 miles long and the tail end of the wave is still traveling at 500 mph , the shore end of the wave becomes extremely thick , and is forced to run far inland , over streets and trees and houses .
If you ’re a surfer , you know how little control you have if your board is in whitewater .
On a tsunami , there ’s no face , so there ’s nothing for a surfboard to grip .
And remember , the water is n’t clean , but filled with everything dredged up from the sea floor and the land the wave runs over — garbage , parking meters , pieces of buildings , dead animals .
This is not what you want to be caught paddling around in .
You ca n’t duck - dive because the entire water column is in motion , not just the top few feet .
You ca n’t exit the wave , either , because the trough behind is 100 miles away , and all that water is moving towards you .
Big - wave riders should save their talents — and their lives — for big waves that are generated by massive storms .
The only safe place to be during a tsunami is far inland and up on high ground .

Yemen Hidden Agenda : Behind the Al - Qaeda Scenarios
The Yemen Hidden Agenda : Behind the Al - Qaeda Scenarios , A Strategic Oil Transit Chokepoint by F. William Engdahl ,
Global Research
On December 25 US authorities arrested a Nigerian named Abdulmutallab aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on charges of having tried to blow up the plane with smuggled explosives .
Since then reports have been broadcast from CNN , the New York Times and other sources that he was " suspected " of having been trained in Yemen for his terror mission .
What the world has been subjected to since is the emergence of a new target for the US ‘ War on Terror , ’ namely a desolate state on the Arabian Peninsula , Yemen .
A closer look at the background suggests the Pentagon and US intelligence have a hidden agenda in Yemen .
For some months the world has seen a steady escalation of US military involvement in Yemen , a dismally poor land adjacent to Saudi Arabia on its north , the Red Sea on its west , the Gulf of Aden on its south , opening to the Arabian Sea , overlooking another desolate land that has been in the headlines of late , Somalia .
The evidence suggests that the Pentagon and US intelligence are moving to militarize a strategic chokepoint for the world ’s oil flows , Bab el - Mandab , and using the Somalia piracy incident , together with claims of a new Al Qaeda threat arising from Yemen , to militarize one of the world ’s most important oil transport routes .
In addition , undeveloped petroleum reserves in the territory between Yemen and Saudi Arabia are reportedly among the world ’s largest .
The 23 - year - old Nigerian man charged with the failed bomb attempt , Abdulmutallab , reportedly has been talking , claiming he was sent on his mission by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , based in Yemen .
This has conveniently turned the world ’s attention on Yemen as a new center of the alleged Al Qaeda terror organization .
Notably , Bruce Riedel , a 30 - year CIA veteran who advised President Obama on the policy leading to the Afghan troop surge , wrote in his blog of the alleged ties of the Detroit bomber to Yemen , " The attempt to destroy Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day underscores the growing ambition of Al Qaeda 's Yemen franchise , which has grown from a largely Yemeni agenda to become a player in the global Islamic jihad in the last year …
The weak Yemeni government of President Ali Abdallah Salih , which has never fully controlled the country and now faces a host of growing problems , will need significant American support to defeat AQAP . " [ 1 ] .
Some basic Yemen geopolitics
Before we can say much about the latest incident , it is useful to look more closely at the Yemen situation .
Here several things stand out as peculiar when stacked against Washington ’s claims about a resurgent Al Qaeda organization in the Arabian Peninsula .
In early 2009 the chess pieces on the Yemeni board began to move .
Tariq al - Fadhli , a former jihadist leader originally from South Yemen , broke a 15 year alliance with the Yemeni government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and announced he was joining the broad - based opposition coalition known as the Southern Movement ( SM ) .
Al - Fadhli had been a member of the Mujahideen movement in Afghanistan in the late 1980’s .
His break with the government was reported in Arab and Yemeni media in April 2009 .
Al - Fadhli ’s break with the Yemen dictatorship gave new power to the Southern Movement ( SM ) .
He has since become a leading figure in the alliance .
Yemen itself is a synthetic amalgam created after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 , when the southern Peoples ’ Democratic Republic of Yemen ( PDRY ) lost its main foreign sponsor .
Unification of the northern Yemen Arab Republic and the southern PDRY state led to a short - lived optimism that ended in a brief civil war in 1994 , as southern army factions organized a revolt against what they saw as the corrupt crony state rule of northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh .
President Saleh has held a one - man rule since 1978 , first as President of North Yemen ( the Yemen Arab Republic ) and since 1990 as President of the unified new Yemen .
The southern army revolt failed as Saleh enlisted al - Fadhli and other Yemeni Salafists , followers of a conservative interpretation of Islam , and jihadists to fight the formerly Marxist forces of the Yemen Socialist Party in the south .
Before 1990 , Washington and the Saudi Kingdom backed and supported Saleh and his policy of Islamization as a bid to contain the communist south .
[ 2 ]
Since then Saleh has relied on a strong Salafist - jihadi movement to retain a one - man dictatorial rule .
The break with Saleh by al - Fadhli and his joining the southern opposition group with his former socialist foes marked a major setback for Saleh .
Soon after al - Fadhli joined the Southern Movement coalition , on April 28 , 2009 protests in the southern Yemeni provinces of Lahj , Dalea and Hadramout intensified .
There were demonstrations by tens of thousands of dismissed military personnel and civil servants demanding better pay and benefits , demonstrations that had been taking place in growing numbers since 2006 .
The April demonstrations included for the first time a public appearance by al - Fadhli .
His appearance served to change a long moribund southern socialist movement into a broader nationalist campaign .
It also galvanized President Saleh , who then called on Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council states for help , warning that the entire Arabian Peninsula would suffer the consequences .
Complicating the picture in what some call a failed state , in the north Saleh faces an al - Houthi Zaydi Shi’ite rebellion .
On September 11 , 2009 , in an Al - Jazeera TV interview , Saleh accused Iraq ’s Shi’ite opposition leader , Muqtada al - Sadr , and also Iran , of backing the north Yemen Shi’ite Houthist rebels .
Yemen ’s Saleh declared , " We cannot accuse the Iranian official side , but the Iranians are contacting us , saying that they are prepared for a mediation .
This means that the Iranians have contacts with them [ the Houthists ] , given that they want to mediate between the Yemeni government and them .
Also , Muqtada al - Sadr in al - Najaf in Iraq is asking that he be accepted as a mediator .
This means they have a link . " [ 3 ]
Yemen authorities claim they have seized caches of weapons made in Iran , while the Houthists claim to have captured Yemeni equipment with Saudi Arabian markings , accusing Sana ’a ( the capital of Yemen and site of the US Embassy ) of acting as a Saudi proxy .
Iran has rejected claims that Iranian weapons were found in north Yemen , calling claims of support to the rebels as baseless . [ 4 ]
What about Al Qaeda ?
The picture that emerges is one of a desperate US - backed dictator , Yemen ’s President Saleh , increasingly losing control after two decades as despotic ruler of the unified Yemen .
Economic conditions in the country took a drastic downward slide in 2008 when world oil prices collapsed .
Some 70 % of the state revenues derive from Yemen ’s oil sales .
The central government of Saleh sits in former North Yemen in Sana ’a , while the oil is in former South Yemen .
Yet Saleh controls the oil revenue flows .
Lack of oil revenue has made Saleh ’s usual option of buying off opposition groups all but impossible .
Into this chaotic domestic picture comes the January 2009 announcement , prominently featured in select Internet websites , that Al Qaeda , the alleged global terrorist organization created by the late CIA - trained Saudi , Osama bin Laden , has opened a major new branch in Yemen for both Yemen and Saudi operations .
Al Qaeda in Yemen released a statement through online jihadist forums Jan. 20 , 2009 from the group ’s leader Nasir al - Wahayshi , announcing formation of a single al Qaeda group for the Arabian Peninsula under his command .
According to al - Wahayshi , the new group , al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , would consist of his former Al Qaeda in Yemen , as well as members of the defunct Saudi Al Qaeda group .
The press release claimed , interestingly enough , that a Saudi national , a former Guantanamo detainee ( Number 372 ) , Abu - Sayyaf al - Shihri , would serve as al - Wahayshi ’s deputy .
Days later an online video from al - Wahayshi appeared under the alarming title , " We Start from Here and We Will Meet at al - Aqsa . "
Al - Aqsa refers to the al - Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem that Jews know as Temple Mount , the site of the destroyed Temple of Solomon , which Muslims call Al Haram Al Sharif .
The video threatens Muslim leaders -- including Yemeni ’s President Saleh , the Saudi royal family , and Egyptian President Mubarak -- and promises to take the jihad from Yemen to Israel to " liberate " Muslim holy sites and Gaza , something that would likely detonate World War III if anyone were mad enough to do it .
Also in that video , in addition to former Guantanamo inmate al - Shihri , is a statement from Abu- al - Harith Muhammad al - Awfi , identified as a field commander in the video , and allegedly former Guantanamo detainee 333 .
As it is well - established that torture methods are worthless to obtain truthful confessions , some have speculated that the real goal of CIA and Pentagon interrogators at Guantanamo prison since September 2001 , has been to use brutal techniques to train or recruit sleeper terrorists who can be activated on command by US intelligence , a charge difficult to prove or disprove .
The presence of two such high - ranking Guantanamo graduates in the new Yemen - based Al Qaeda is certainly ground for questioning .
Al Qaeda in Yemen is apparently anathema to al - Fadhli and the enlarged mass - based Southern Movement .
In an interview , al - Fadhli declared , " I have strong relations with all of the jihadists in the north and the south and everywhere , but not with al - Qaeda . " [ 5 ]
That has not hindered Saleh from claiming the Southern Movement and al Qaeda are one and the same , a convenient way to insure backing from Washington .
According to US intelligence reports , there are a grand total of perhaps 200 Al Qaeda members in southern Yemen . [ 6 ]
Al - Fadhli gave an interview distancing himself from al Qaeda in May 2009 , declaring , " We [ in South Yemen ] have been invaded 15 years ago and we are under a vicious occupation .
So we are busy with our cause and we do not look at any other cause in the world .
We want our independence and to put an end to this occupation . " [ 7 ]
Conveniently , the same day , Al Qaeda made a large profile declaring its support for southern Yemen ’s cause .
On May 14 , in an audiotape released on the internet , al - Wahayshi , leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , expressed sympathy with the people of the southern provinces and their attempt to defend themselves against their " oppression , " declaring , " What is happening in Lahaj , Dhali , Abyan and Hadramaut and the other southern provinces cannot be approved .
We have to support and help [ the southerners ] . "
He promised retaliation : " The oppression against you will not pass without punishment … the killing of Muslims in the streets is an unjustified major crime . " [ 8 ]
The curious emergence of a tiny but well - publicized al Qaeda in southern Yemen amid what observers call a broad - based popular - based Southern Movement front that eschews the radical global agenda of al Qaeda , serves to give the Pentagon a kind of casus belli to escalate US military operations in the strategic region .
Indeed , after declaring that the Yemen internal strife was Yemen ’s own affair , President Obama ordered air strikes in Yemen .
The Pentagon claimed its attacks on December 17 and 24 killed three key al Qaeda leaders but no evidence has yet proven this .
Now the Christmas Day Detroit bomber drama gives new life to Washington ’s " War on Terror " campaign in Yemen .
Obama has now offered military assistance to the Saleh Yemen government .
Somali Pirates escalate as if on cue
As if on cue , at the same time CNN headlines broadcast new terror threats from Yemen , the long - running Somalia pirate attacks on commercial shipping in the same Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea across from southern Yemen escalated dramatically after having been reduced by multinational ship patrols .
On December 29 , Moscow ’s RAI Novosti reported that Somali pirates seized a Greek cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden off Somalia 's coast .
Earlier the same day a British - flagged chemical tanker and its 26 crew were also seized in the Gulf of Aden .
In a sign of sophisticated skills in using western media , pirate commander Mohamed Shakir told the British newspaper The Times by phone , " We have hijacked a ship with [ a ] British flag in the Gulf of Aden late yesterday . "
The US intelligence brief , Stratfor , reports that The Times , owned by neo -conservative financial backer , Rupert Murdoch , is sometimes used by Israeli intelligence to plant useful stories .

The two latest events brought a record number of attacks and hijackings for 2009 .
As of December 22 , attacks by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden and the east coast of Somalia numbered 174 , with 35 vessels hijacked and 587 crew taken hostage so far in 2009 , almost all successful pirate activity , according to the International Maritime Bureau 's Piracy Reporting Center .
The open question is , who is providing the Somali " pirates " with arms and logistics sufficient to elude international patrols from numerous nations ?
Notably , on January 3 , President Saleh got a phone call from Somali president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in which he briefed president Saleh on latest developments in Somalia .
Sheikh Sharif , whose own base in Mogadishu is so weak he is sometimes referred to as President of Mogadishu Airport , told Saleh he would share information with Saleh about any terror activities that might be launched from Somali territories targeting stability and security of Yemen and the region .
The Oil chokepoint and other oily affairs
The strategic significance of the region between Yemen and Somalia becomes the point of geopolitical interest .
It is the site of Bab el - Mandab , one of what the US Government lists as seven strategic world oil shipping chokepoints .
The US Government Energy Information Agency states that " closure of the Bab el - Mandab could keep tankers from the Persian Gulf from reaching the Suez Canal / Sumed pipeline complex , diverting them around the southern tip of Africa .
The Strait of Bab el - Mandab is a chokepoint between the horn of Africa and the Middle East , and a strategic link between the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean . " [ 9 ]
Bab el - Mandab , between Yemen , Djibouti , and Eritrea connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea .
Oil and other exports from the Persian Gulf must pass through Bab el - Mandab before entering the Suez Canal .
In 2006 , the Energy Department in Washington reported that an estimated 3.3 million barrels a day of oil flowed through this narrow waterway to Europe , the United States , and Asia .
Most oil , or some 2.1 million barrels a day , goes north through the Bab el - Mandab to the Suez / Sumed complex into the Mediterranean .
An excuse for a US or NATO militarization of the waters around Bab el - Mandab would give Washington another major link in its pursuit of control of the seven most critical oil chokepoints around the world , a major part of any future US strategy aimed at denying oil flows to China , the EU or any region or country that opposes US policy .
Given that significant flows of Saudi oil pass through Bab el - Mandab , a US military control there would serve to deter the Saudi Kingdom from becoming serious about transacting future oil sales with China or others no longer in dollars , as was recently reported by UK Independent journalist Robert Fisk .
It would also be in a position to threaten China ’s oil transport from Port Sudan on the Red Sea just north of Bab el - Mandab , a major lifeline in China ’s national energy needs .
In addition to its geopolitical position as a major global oil transit chokepoint , Yemen is reported to hold some of the world ’s greatest untapped oil reserves .
Yemen ’s Masila Basin and Shabwa Basin are reported by international oil companies to contain " world class discoveries . " [ 10 ]
France ’s Total and several smaller international oil companies are engaged in developing Yemen ’s oil production .
Some fifteen years ago I was told in a private meeting with a well - informed Washington insider that Yemen contained " enough undeveloped oil to fill the oil demand of the entire world for the next fifty years . "
Perhaps there is more to Washington ’s recent Yemen concern than a rag - tag al Qaeda whose very existence as a global terror organization has been doubted by seasoned Islamic experts .

Watch the controversial anti-homophobia ad delayed by the FA .
Warning : strong language Ogilvy
He dreaded going to work with his colleagues .
By the time he got into training , he was so nervous he felt sick .
" I was like a bullied kid on his way to school to face his tormentors , " wrote Graeme Le Saux , the former England and Chelsea defender , in his autobiography .
For 14 years , Le Saux endured the taunts of everyone from team - mates and players such as Robbie Fowler , who bent over in front of him and pointed at his backside during a match , to thousands of vociferous fans chanting obscenities .
The cultured left - back was , in a sense , England 's first outed footballer .
And he was not even gay .
Le Saux 's experience , just because he took an interest in the arts , read the Guardian and was not part of the game 's laddish drinking culture , was so traumatic that he considered quitting football .
Far worse , however , were the years of abuse suffered by Justin Fashanu , the only professional English footballer to come out as gay , who took his own life in 1998 .
After becoming Britain 's first £ 1 m black player , Fashanu 's career went downhill under Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest .
Hearing rumours that Fashanu was visiting gay bars , Clough confronted him , later writing in his autobiography : " ' Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread ? '
I asked [ Fashanu ] .
' A baker 's , I suppose . '
' Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb ? ' ' A butcher 's . '
' So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs ' club ? ' "
The Justin Campaign , named in honour of Fashanu , is just one of a group of diversity and gay rights organisations who expressed " grave concerns " this week when the Football Association hurriedly cancelled the launch of a film intended to confront homophobia .
Previously , it was reported that the FA had been struggling to find high - profile players to support the film ; now , English football 's governing body is to conduct further consultation on the hard - hitting video that shows a man abusing workmates and commuters with anti-gay taunts before doing the same at a football match .
It may never be released in its current form .
While English football 's administrators dither , homophobia endures in the modern game .
The stadiums may be plusher than ever but they still reverberate to offensive anti-gay chants , and homophobic " banter " is widespread in dressing rooms .
The list of openly gay sporting heroes around the world is a short one .
Famous names include basketball 's John Amaechi , hurling 's Donal Og Cusack , Olympic gold medal - winning diver Matthew Mitcham and , most notably in Britain , Nigel Owens , the Welsh international rugby referee , and Gareth Thomas , Wales 's most - capped player and the former British Lions captain , who came out last December .
Of about 4,000 professional footballers in England and Wales , however , none will openly acknowledge they are gay .
Paul Elliott , the former Chelsea and Celtic star who works with football diversity campaign group Kick It Out , has said at least 12 Premier League players are gay .
After Thomas came out , the publicist Max Clifford revealed that he advised two high - profile gay Premiership stars to keep their sexuality secret because football " remains in the dark ages , steeped in homophobia " .
The Professional Footballers ' Association has taken advice from Amaechi over how to tackle homophobic abuse in the game .
" There 's no point beating around the bush , " says its chief executive , Gordon Taylor .
" Football is a macho world but then so was the armed forces , and that has changed . "
Who is to blame for the repression and prejudice hanging over football ?
Abusive fans ?
Homophobic team - mates ?
Or the stuffed shirts at the FA and leading clubs who have n't a clue about the modern world ?
Ben Summerskill , chief executive of Stonewall , describes football as " institutionally homophobic " , and says the FA is significantly behind other workplaces in tackling the problem .
" The FA has been in denial at a senior level , and until recently they did not acknowledge that there was any serious problem , " he says .
Traditionally homophobic , macho and conservative professions such as investment banking and the armed forces are , according to Summerskill , significantly better at addressing homophobia than football .
" It 's ironic that the work we 're doing with the army is much more advanced than what is happening in football .
We 're sending openly gay and lesbian people to fight in Afghanistan , but we can't send openly gay people to fight for the World Cup this summer .
" The chiefs and generals in the armed services understand that people perform better when they can be themselves at work – you feel more comfortable and are more productive – and that will be true of professional football , when it finally happens , as well . "
Rather like Le Saux , former Scotland international Pat Nevin was teased in the dressing room by fellow footballers for his esoteric tastes .
" I was interested in the theatre and the arts and so I got the ' you must be gay ' thing – to which I sniggered and said , ' I 'm not and I do n't care if you think I am , ' " he says .
During his playing career for Everton and Chelsea , Nevin was closely involved in the first anti-racism campaigns in football .
But , perhaps surprisingly , he says he feels slightly differently about homophobia in the game .
He believes the football world would quickly accept gay players and there are actually no insurmountable obstacles to them coming out ; it is just up to them to reveal their sexuality .
" You hate to see homophobia out there , and you do n't want to hear it or have it in the clubs , but if there are any gay players they should just come out .
That may sound heartless , and I am sure if you are gay there are all sorts of fears and worries , but I do think football can probably cope with it . "
In fact , Nevin believes football may be being unfairly tarnished for homophobia when there are actually very few gay footballers ; he says he has never met one who is known to be gay .
" Gay people have come out in other sports .
Football gets battered for certain things which it does n't deserve to get battered for .
If a player comes out and is then hounded out of the game , that 's when we should go for football . "
Summerskill however believes there are high - profile footballers who are gay and in a similar position to Gareth Thomas , whose sexuality was known and accepted by those close to him after Thomas confided in coaches and senior Welsh team - mates three years before he came out .
But it 's not an easy place to come out .
" We 've talked to professional footballers who have explicitly said there is homophobia in their dressing rooms , " Summerskill says .
" That does n't just make a difference to whether you will come out , but also how you play . "
Clifford believes that it is unlikely a Premiership star will come out in the near future , but that if they do , they are likely to be an established , experienced star with a long career behind them and little to lose .
Summerskill says he would be surprised if we did not see an openly gay footballer within a decade .
But he does not believe high - profile players have a moral obligation to come out , even if it would undoubtedly help thousands of other young people – and footballers – wrestling with their sexuality .
He prefers to quietly stress the positive benefits – both personal and professional – that have been widely expressed by openly gay sports stars such as Thomas and Martina Navratilova .
Thomas , who only came out towards the end of his career , admitted that he " could never have come out without first establishing myself and earning respect as a player " , but then spoke of " the amazing response " he received .
At the PFA , Taylor fears the tragic example of Fashanu still looms large over professional footballers .
But there are more encouraging instances of sporting heroes being open about their sexuality in great adversity .
The Australian rugby league star Ian Roberts was the country 's first professional player to come out in 1995 ; a courageous act in a notoriously macho sport .
When he retired three years later , he reflected that , " The public reaction when I came out is my highlight over anything I 've accomplished on the field . "
“ To send anything to Mars is so expensive , you have to extract the most use possible out of it .
Which means you have to change your underlying assumptions about everything , ” he explains .
“ So with [ the Bloom boxes ] , I did the same thing .
I looked at each component and , for example , set a price point that it absolutely had to make . ”
Nearly eight years and a reported $ 250 million in venture - capital investment later , Sridhar has a working product that ’s been in field trials for the past two years and is about to go on the global market , at a price he says will be competitive with existing energy options .
As for results : in an ongoing trial at the University of Tennessee , a five - kilowatt Bloom box ( the size of a large coffee table and capable of powering a 5,000 - square - foot house ) has proved twice as efficient as a traditional gas - burning system and produced 60 percent fewer emissions .
Since the boxes are “ fuel agnostic , ” customers can run them on existing propane , natural gas , or ethanol sources .
But they ’ll also run on plant waste , or almost anything else containing hydrogen and carbon .
And the eventual “ killer app ” ?
Processing wind - or solar - generated electricity with water to create storable oxygen and hydrogen , then reversing the process to generate electricity at night or in low - wind or cloudy conditions .
That alone gives the technology impressive potential .
“ If you have clean , affordable energy , you can get clean air and clean water whenever you want , ” Sridhar says .
“ You can make recycling affordable .
You can turn latent local resources into marketable ones . ”
But the truly disruptive aspect of Bloom ’s fuel cells is n’t their clean , quiet , affordable efficiency .
It ’s their ability to operate independent of a power grid .
That ’s critical for developing countries , which lack infrastructure .
It could also allow Bloom to revolutionize energy - generation in industrialized nations .
“ I want to open up access to energy the way that PCs and the Web opened up access to information , ” Sridhar says .
“ So people can live where they want , and still be connected , without someone telling them when they can do their laundry . ”
A distributed energy system would also be far less susceptible to attack or natural disaster .
Should the utility companies be worried ?
Possibly .
As Sridhar points out , “ The companies who saw their business as selling mainframe computers are gone . ”
Of course , the utilities could also do as IBM did , and adapt .
“ The human ability to innovate out of a jam is profound , ” Sridhar says with a smile .
“ That ’s why Darwin will always be right , and Malthus will always be wrong . ”
Palin Speaks : ‘ How ’s that Hopey - Changey Thing Working Out for Ya ? ’
Created : February 06 , 2010 21:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
NASHVILLE — “ I ’m so proud to be an American !
Happy birthday , Ronald Reagan . ”
Sarah Palin took the stage of the National Tea Party Convention to a thundering ovation , which she cut down quickly by praising “ anyone who serves in uniform or has served in uniform ” and diving right into her speech .
“ I am a supporter of this movement .
I believe in this movement , ” said Palin .
“ America is ready for another revolution . ”
Palin adroitly rewrote the history of the past three months of elections , giving the Tea Party movement credit for Scott Brown ’s election in Massachusetts and calling the White House “ 0 for 3 ″ in recent elections — leaving out the New York special election where her candidate , the Conservative Party ’s Doug Hoffman , lost in a last - minute upset .
“ You know , ” said Palin of Brown , “ he was just a guy with a truck , and a passion to serve his country , ” said Palin .
Brown , however , was a state senator and state representative whose campaign staffers cut their teeth with Mitt Romney .
Nodding at the much - discussed question of whether this speech would make Palin the “ leader ” of the Tea Party movement , she said that the activists did not have a “ king or queen . ”
At the same time , she called for “ contested primaries , ” calling them a strength of democracy — nodding at her fairly controversial endorsements of Hoffman and Rand Paul .
Palin swung quickly and heavily to foreign policy , with a litany of attacks on Obama — from his “ personality ” - based diplomacy to giving “ Constitutional rights ” to “ homicide bombers , ” using a term that ’s rarely heard outside of Fox News , where she is a contributor .
When she moved back to domestic policy , Palin delved again and again into stories that are familiar to political junkies and Tea Party activists .
“ How ’s that hopey - changey thing working out for ya ? ” said Palin , paraphrasing a slogan made popular on Tea Party t- shirts . ”
She mocked the stimulus package — the speech was heavy on mockery — by leaning slightly down and saying “ nobody messes with Joe , ” quoting a comment President Obama made that has been more or less forgotten outside of Tea Party circles .
Palin got rapt attention , and little crowd interruption — not even positive interruptions or cries of “ Drill , Baby , Drill ” — even as she tackled less sensational ( and not really discussed during the convention ) issues like nuclear power and buying insurance over state lines .
But she was on more solid ground with one short clause about America being a place where “ special needs children are accepted . ”
She started to choke up — the audience cheered , wildly , as if nudging her on to the next sentence while proclaiming its admiration for her son Trig .
“ Each of us here is living proof that you do n’t need a title to make a difference , ” said Palin .
“ Let us not get bogged down in the small squabbles .
Let us move on to the big ideas .
To do so would be a fitting tribute to Ronald Reagan . ”
After the speech , Judson Phillips and Palin sat down in two chairs ( which sat rather awkwardly onstage during the speech ) and engaged in a soft Q&A with questions from Tea Party Nation members , such as the top three things she ’d do if she were president ( energy , bipartisanship — it was rather confusing ) .
She closed by addressing the controversy over her speaking fee .
“ I am happy , honored , proud , to get any speaking check that was ever offered to me and to give it for the cause , ” said Palin .
“ I will live and die for this cause . ”

Business reporter , BBC News , Surrey
Ascot Ales is looking to expand to keep up with demand Chris Gill hardly has space to move when he brews his award - winning real ales .
His Ascot Ales brewery , a small unit on an anonymous industrial estate in Camberley , Surrey , is about the same size as a double garage .
With his brewing tanks beside one wall , and barrels on the floor , there is n't much room to turn around .
Add the piled up sacks of malted barley and bags of pungent hops , and you really do have to watch your step .
Thankfully small seems to be beautiful for the 40 - year - old 's growing band of customers .
Made entirely by hand , his range of real ales use only four natural ingredients - water , barley malt , hops and yeast .
Being a microbrewery we can afford to brew something that some may find a bit too challenging , but others will love
Brewer Chris Gill Mr Gill has no truck with the chemicals or cheap additional ingredients like rice and maize that the global brewing giants add to keep costs - and flavour - down .
And he foregoes any thought of pasteurising his brews - a process used by big brewers to nominally extend the shelf life of their beers , but also destroying a lot of the taste in the process .
As a result , his range of Ascot Ales can be bit too flavoursome for many , but for those that like a tasty pint , Chris and his co-worker - wife Suzanne - are brewing at full capacity to supply 70 local pubs and members of the public at a number of farmers markets in Surrey and Berkshire .
Booming sector
But far from being unique , Mr Gill is just one very small part of a major change in the UK beer market - the rapid growth of tiny microbreweries - breweries with very small output levels and only a few staff at most .
The world 's largest brewer AB Inbev has had some trouble of late According to beer pressure group Campaign for Real Ale ( Camra ) , there are now more than 600 microbreweries across the UK , with no less than 70 new ones starting up last year .
And this situation is being replicated in beer - loving countries around the world - especially in the US and Canada - as drinkers seek a more local and interesting pint .
The booming growth in the microbrewery sector could not be in sharper contrast to the current woes facing the multi-national beer giants - their sales are falling as people turn away from mass - market brews .
This is most evident in the continuing travails of the world 's largest brewer Anheuser - Busch InBev , the maker of Stella Artois , Budweiser and Becks .
Its most recent financial results showed that its sales are falling in all parts of the world except Latin America .
Its sales in the US and Canada fell 4.7 % in the third quarter of 2009 , while those in Western Europe lost 3.3 % , and sales in Central and Eastern Europe slumped 16.8 % .
The falls resulted in the Belgian - Brazilian company announcing at the start of this year that it would cut 10 % of its 8,000 strong European workforce .
The news has sparked continuing strikes by its staff in Belgium , who have blockaded its breweries , hitting supplies getting to bars and shops .
Rival SAB
Miller , the world 's second largest , also recently reported a 2 % fall in European sales ; although at the same time sales of its premium brands Pilsner Urquell and Peroni Nastro Azzurro were up strongly .
' Flavoursome ' Camra spokesman Iain Loe , says the growing success of microbreweries can be easily explained .
Chris Gill says he was determined not to make bland beers " They are producing the type of beers people want to drink - flavoursome and interesting , " he says .
" And they are locally brewed as well - these are what more and more people want . "
Back at Ascot Ales , where Mr Gill can currently make just 12 barrels a week " when working flat out " , he is looking to expand into the next door industrial unit , so he can increase production .
" The business started in 2007 , and sales have grown steadily since then , " he says .
" The idea was to sell very distinctive beers - we did n't see any point in producing something bland .
" If you are a big brewer you have to play it safe , because you are producing so many thousands of barrels of beer a time , you need it to have mass market appeal .
" Being a microbrewery we can afford to brew something that some may find a bit too challenging , but others will love . "
Tax boost In addition to consumers ' increasing demand for different flavours from their beer , the growth of the microbrewer sector in the UK has been further helped by the Progressive Beer Duty scheme , which was introduced by the government in 2002 .
Under the rule , brewers of up to 5,000 hectolitres ( 110,000 gallons ) per year , only pay half the excise duty .
For a pint of typical 4 % beer , this cuts the duty a microbrewer has to pay from 37.44 p to 18.72 p , giving them a financial helping hand .
But as Camra 's Mr Doe says , at the end of the day it still all comes back to the taste .
" A successful microbrewer has to produce something distinctive , " he says .
" Thankfully because they are often brewing in very small amounts , they can afford to take risks and try out different recipes until they get one that is popular . "

The Westside of Los Angeles is a coveted area .
I ’ve covered many parts of this market including Culver City .
Yet even within the Westside zip codes some areas are more prized than others .
Santa Monica is one of those jewels but only if you land in the right zip code .
In the early days of the bubble bursting some people were still thinking that contrary to economic trends that Santa Monica would somehow stay out of the problems associated with the California housing market .
Yet we now know that every area is being touched and not even the prime locations are immune from massive price corrections .
It is interesting that all it took to pop the bubble was two major things .
For the herd to stop believing real estate would always go up and the vaporizing of the no document and low down toxic mortgage enterprise .
If we really look at things objectively you would think that things are really good for housing .
Mortgage rates are at generational lows , there is certainly plenty of inventory , and banks are willing to work with buyers .
But this is all a charade .
The problems we are still experiencing are that in many cities in California prices are still in actual bona fide bubbles .
Would you buy a flat screen for $ 18,000 if your payment was $ 50 per month for 30 years ?
Santa Monica is one of the markets still in a solid bubble .
Today we salute you Santa Monica with our Real Home of Genius Award .
Short Sale Valentine Special
I ’ve been getting a few e-mails on how great it is that banks are now approving short sales .
This is actually bogus because it is in their best interest to do this plus , as the SIGTARP report showed banks will get $ 1,500 for each approved short sale .
Here are some of the incentives :
• Borrower Relocation Assistance — A $ 1,500 incentive payment to the borrower .
• Servicer Incentive — A $ 1,000 incentive payment for the servicer .
• Investor Reimbursement for Subordinate Lien Releases —
For every $ 3 an investor pays to secure release of a subordinate lien , such as a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit , the investor is reimbursed $ 1 , up to a reimbursement limit of $ 1,000 per transaction .
The most hypocritical can of horse manure coming out from banks is that they are now doing this as some kind of favor !
They are using taxpayer money for something they should already be doing .
But that is beside the point .
With HAMP going down in a wave of flames , we will start seeing more short sales hitting the market .
The above chart breaks down the MLS data and as you can see , short sales are a big part of the MLS while foreclosure listings are virtually non-existent even though 1 out of 7 mortgages are in default .
Where are these homes then ?
In the shadow inventory or simply being lived in with no payment .
Today ’s home is an interesting short sale in Santa Monica .
It has only been on the MLS for a week but the story behind the home is much more interesting :
According to the ad this is a “ short sale valentine special ” so you might need to rethink that tired and old flower routine this weekend .
Maybe a Santa Monica short sale is the aphrodisiac your relationship needs .
The home is listed at 2,044 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 3 baths .
It was built in 1947 .
I give California realtors credit for not even mowing the lawn on a listing in an expensive zip code ( 90405 ) in Santa Monica .
Let us look at the pricing action :
Price Reduced : 02/05/10 — $ 930,000 to $ 899,000
Only a week on the MLS and already a $ 30,000 reduction .
Looks like someone is looking to move this place !
You might be stunned that a home listed for $ 900,000 does n’t even have a manicured lawn but the path this home took to short sale land is symptomatic of the insanity of California real estate :
Let us walk through the above details .
The home was purchased in 2003 for $ 770,000 .
If you do the math , a mortgage of $ 600,000 and $ 93,000 meant this buyer went in with 10 percent down ( $ 77,000 ) .
So they definitely had some skin in the game .
But then , the California housing market went into warp speed bubble mode and they managed to refinance for a stunning $ 1.2 million .
We really do n’t know what was done with that money but we do know this :
$ 1,200,000 – $ 693,000 = $ 507,000 cash out
Now the above numbers are for simplicity .
We do n’t know what kind of loan they got but all the lenders listed about specialized in let us say , easy money financing .
Also , we are using the $ 693,000 for ease of calculation because most of your first mortgage payments go to interest ( hardly any principal is taken down ) .
And who knows , these could be option ARMs .
So now we are in 2006 with a mega mortgage but some cash as well .
Let us run the numbers for a $ 1.2 million mortgage :
Now we are really being generous with the above data .
The above only includes principal and interest .
Let us include taxes and insurance and the monthly nut looks like :
PITI : $ 8,394
Now how much time does that $ 507,000 cash buy you in terms of monthly payments :
$ 507,000 / $ 8,394 = 60 months ( 5 years )
Well you know where this is heading .
In September of 2009 a notice of default was filed .
They were already behind by $ 138,099 .
Now think about this .
Assuming the $ 7,194 payment how many months was this :
$ 138,099 / $ 7,194 = 19 months
Now this is insane of course but we know with all those Alt - A and option ARM products that this is typical with shady bank strategies .
Finally the home was scheduled for auction and is now listed at $ 899,000 .
Who is going to buy this place ?
It does n’t qualify for FHA insured loan financing .
It would appear that the bigger your mortgage the more dubious banks will be on moving to foreclose on your home .
They are happy to move quickly on homes in the Inland Empire but put a prime Westside location and banks are letting people live rent free for what would seem as ages .
The fact that a listing like this does n’t surprise me anymore shows how desensitized I am to the gaming banks have been doing .
Today we salute you Santa Monica with our Real Home of Genius Award .

He already lived in the shadows , if you could call it living .
Most days , for nearly four years , Glenn Harrington foraged for money , smoked marijuana and methamphetamine , and searched for somewhere to crash : a buddy ’s couch , a deck chair at the Tropicana pool , behind a sign advertising the airport .
Last year , after police rousted him and a friend from the sign , they ran into a homeless guy who directed them to the tunnels .
Beneath the glossy Strip and a vast expanse of suburbs in the arid Las Vegas Valley are hundreds of miles of crisscrossing flood - control tunnels that stay dry most of the year .
The tunnels are thought to shelter about 300 vagabonds from the Mojave Desert ’s unrelenting weather .
The pitch - black passages breed mosquitoes and , where shallow pools of water collect , even crayfish .
They reek of sodden trash and urine .
But in the tunnels , you can disappear .
And for a time , Harrington desperately wanted to disappear .
So , last fall , he and his friend Thomas Kruse headed over to a culvert west of the Strip leading into the tunnels .
For a few nights they slumbered outside .
They started plying the handful of tunnel residents with weed and , eventually , were given the OK to move in .
Harrington paid two guys $ 20 each to lug a red leather couch from a nearby apartment complex into an offshoot of the main corridor , nicknamed the Caesars tunnel .
His new neighbors included a man who decorated the concrete walls with pages torn from nudie magazines and a couple who had hauled in a studio apartment ’s worth of furniture .
Harrington waded into the darkness .
He squinted .
At the time , he could n’t see any clear way out .
The vast majority of the Las Vegas region ’s homeless population , estimated at more than 13,000 , favors the typical homeless haunts -- cars , abandoned buildings , parks .
They find tunnel - dwellers disquieting :
What drives someone underground ?
Some stay awhile , then struggle to get out .
Some never leave .
Harrington , 44 , is a slight , affable man with brown eyes , receding dark hair and a nervous laugh .
The youngest of eight kids in Buffalo , N.Y. , he joined his mom and a sister here almost three decades ago .
He worked at casinos and once was promoted to assistant food and beverage manager .
He had a girlfriend and a daughter , Caylee , and liked the desert ’s ceaseless sunshine .
But the relationship was tempestuous .
Money was tight :
For years , Harrington had taken and quit jobs -- and occasionally left town -- on a whim .
He often ended up on the couch of a sister , playing both the kind uncle her kids adored and the wayward soul who pleaded for money , then vanished .
As he tells it , his girlfriend , who was wrestling with her own addictions , left him and their daughter ; her mother eventually took Caylee , then 3 , with her back to Montana .
He went there to fight for custody , but lost , and returned to Vegas a woeful man .
He started blowing money on drugs and slot machines and eventually ended up on the streets .
Other residents of the tunnels tell similarly glum stories , if they share them at all .
Part of the tunnels ’ appeal is a tacit code that your past sins may remain unspoken .
The passageways begin in a number of low - lying spots around town , including near the iconic “ Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas ” sign .
Many tunnels are the size of hallways , with cobwebbed ceilings and the occasional pool of ankle - deep water .
Las Vegas averages only 4 inches of rain a year , but floodwater can blast through so quickly that , when storm clouds loom , some residents temporarily clear out .
The labyrinthine corridors are eerily hushed .
Your conversation will arrive at the end of a tunnel far before you do , which offers residents some peace of mind .
Approaching footsteps can stir panic :
Is it the police ?
A drug dealer with a grudge ?
Encampments are sometimes littered with the plastic bags and party balloons synonymous with meth and cocaine .
The only light comes from flashlights or the sun streaming through street grates .
The light that sneaks through illuminates walls inked with graffiti : bubble letters , bare - chested women , thoughts morose and poetic .
In the Caesars tunnel , someone scrawled : Thank you for the knowledge of heartbreak .
Most days , after Harrington and the others woke up , they made their way into the blinding sun and hustled for dope and food -- usually , by “ silver - mining . ”
They hovered at casinos , hoping slot players left them credits to play or winnings to cash .
Back in the tunnel , Harrington could n’t bear the shame of stealing or , even worse , the fading memories of Caylee , whom he had n’t spoken to in years .
So he smoked his troubles away .
Or tried to .
He slept fitfully , wracked by fears : surging storm water , bugs inching across his face , a fellow itinerant stealing the black duffel bag with his sole change of clothes .
After a few months , he started squabbling with tunnel neighbors .
Survival was so much harder here .
He was n’t worried about interlopers , at least .
They rarely braved the concrete maze .
But a few years back , journalists Matthew O’Brien and Joshua Ellis had written about the storm - drain society for the local alternative weekly CityLife .
O’Brien expanded the stories into a book , “ Beneath the Neon : Life and Death in the Tunnels of Las Vegas , ” which caught the attention of homeless outreach workers at the nonprofit HELP of Southern Nevada .
This March , they intensified their efforts in the tunnels .
Several times a month , former corrections Sgt. Rich Penska and others headed underground , armed with flashlights and offers of housing and medical help ( a potentially fatal staph infection named MRSA was common in the tunnels ) .
It was grueling work .
Once , Penska had nearly persuaded a woman to leave when her dope supplier showed up .
Another time , a heroin addict charged at him with a syringe .
But since March , the group has coaxed about 18 people out of the tunnels , each success prodding the team to return .
In recent months , they visited the Caesars tunnel repeatedly and often chatted with Steve and Kathryn , an amiable couple who ’d survived underground for more than a year .
The pair showed off their living quarters : a hotel - size bed , a flowered bedspread , sheets swiped from a laundry service .
Dean Koontz books .
Perfume bottles .
Discarded tickets for shows Kathryn dreamed of seeing , including Terry Fator , a ventriloquist at the Mirage .
The outreach team ’s pleas to Steve and Kathryn pinged off walls , and Harrington found himself listening .
He grew more and more intrigued .
On a sweltering afternoon in June , Harrington planted himself outside the Caesars tunnel , waiting for Penska , duffel bag in hand .
His neighbors had been mocking him :
Why was he leaving ?
Was he too good for the tunnels now ?
A few days before , Harrington had approached Penska during one of the team ’s visits , convinced they truly wanted to help .
Get me out of here , Harrington begged .
Penska , 49 and the father of two adult sons , also grew up in Buffalo .
He has blue eyes , an offensive lineman ’s build and an office lined with scuba - diving pictures .
He juggles more than 20 clients and can switch between brusque and kind , though it ’s obvious he prefers the latter .
He sized up Harrington , who initially swore he was n’t using drugs .
Penska assumed -- correctly -- that was bunk , but that did n’t mean Harrington ’s plea was n’t sincere .
Harrington ’s friend Kruse , 52 , had recently accepted help from the group after getting sloshed , falling down a hill and breaking his right ankle .
Another man from the Caesars tunnel had moved out , too .
Penska realized Harrington was struggling far more than Steve and Kathryn , who made subsistence living look oddly effortless .
Yes , Penska thought , this guy wants to go .
That summer afternoon , Penska shuttled Harrington to Deer Valley Recovery , where he bunked with seven men and got intensive counseling -- the first time his sister could remember him seeking help .
While some homeless are slowly weaned off their addictions , Harrington was deemed ready to quit everything at once .
For weeks , he tossed and turned instead of sleeping , with melancholy thoughts overwhelming his mind and no meth to shoo them away .
Each morning , sunlight startled him .
Penska figured living aboveground would be tough for Harrington .
He was reminded of how much each time he returned to the tunnels .
One day , Penska , O’Brien and HELP co-worker Louis Lacey visited Steve and Kathryn , who promised they had n’t been using drugs .
Penska mentioned how well Harrington and Kruse were doing .
Kathryn , with blue eyes and a pixie ’s build , wore a red hoodie , pink shorts and an expression indicating she was n’t swayed .
Steve faced arrest warrants related to drug charges , and the couple feared that , should they accept housing , he ’d be locked up .
( That ’s also why they asked their last names not be used . )
Did n’t matter that , during a recent storm , an ankle - deep torrent had ripped through the tunnels .
They rode it out , Kathryn said , by playing Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit atop the bed .
Back at Deer Valley , his head clearing , Harrington started to catalog the things his old neighbors were missing .
A refrigerator .
Old Spice deodorant .
Hot food , hot showers , hot coffee .
The sense of dignity that came with it all .
He ultimately moved to a two - man room , with a twin bed , two pillows and an entire drawer of socks .
He sometimes visited Kruse , who had moved into his own apartment .
Harrington also warily reconnected with family .
Another of his sisters , who had called jails and hospitals looking for him and considered filing a missing persons report , drove over packs of Gold Coast 100 cigarettes .
His new routine : making sure his housemates finished their chores , and counting down the days until Penska and other counselors determined that Harrington , too , was ready for his own place .
He occasionally talked to Caylee , now 9 , who still lives with her grandma in Montana .
She told him she likes Scooby - Doo and SpongeBob SquarePants .
He decorated his half of the room with e-mailed pictures of her , smiling and in a pink princess dress .
He never could have hung them on tunnel walls .
One windy October morning , Penska pulled up to Deer Valley Recovery in his silver Hyundai Santa Fe to take Harrington to his new apartment .
Harrington stood outside , beaming .
The facility door had been propped open with phone books , and Harrington zipped in and out with garbage bags of stuff .
He tossed his duffel bag into the vehicle and hugged his housemates goodbye .
He had n’t called any place his own in almost five years .
But now a county program run through HELP of Southern Nevada will help him cover $ 650 a month in rent and utilities , though Harrington was eager to start looking for restaurant work .
He and Penska pulled up to the beige stucco complex with huge palms , azure pools and , at some doors , welcome mats .
In the office , the manager smiled warmly as she handed Harrington a checklist explaining the complex ’s rules .
He clenched it as if it might blow away .
She handed him a roll of toilet paper and a box of Chocolate Parfait Nips tied with a white ribbon .
She handed him the keys .
He shook them ever so slightly .
He exhaled .
They were real .
Across the complex , he opened the door to Apartment No. 44 .
He opened the refrigerator .
He opened the freezer and touched the ice cube trays .
His surroundings were austere : dark brown carpet , a bed with no frame , a TV with no stand and a musty odor .
But Penska , who also received a key , had set the round table with a pair of white plates and cups , and that small gesture made Harrington feel at home .
Penska knew so many things could go wrong .
Harrington could suffer tragedy and seek solace in meth ; he could start feeling euphoric and crack open some beers .
He could balk at his new responsibilities and slide back onto the streets .
Kruse , who had been living at the complex for some time , came by .
For Penska , it was an affecting scene :
The old neighbors sat on Harrington ’s black couch , laughing , their faces warm with sunlight .
The tunnels seemed a long time ago .

As one of the most well respected American art forms , jazz has shaped the music industry spawning both the careers of various musical geniuses , and an abundance of elemental new music genres .
Jazz was developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century as American and European classical music was mixed with African and slave folk songs .
These songs were played to a syncopated rhythm , and from this emerged ragtime , then Dixieland and subsequently Big Band , what many consider to be the beginning of modern jazz .
There is obvious West African influence , visible in terms of how the music is written and played ; swing rhythm , polyrhythm , improvisation and syncopation are all prominent examples which are almost exclusively characteristics of jazz music .
Over the course of the 20th century , this art form has been changing drastically as new artists bring on new influence and new sound .
Dixieland became big- band , which became be -bop , which became fusion , Latin and free jazz , which , in turn , established their own separate styles like funk , acid - jazz , hard - bop , smooth jazz , cool jazz , etc .
The musicians behind this ever growing phenomena are recognized as some of the best musicians of all time .
Compiled here are who I believe are the best of the best , and the most influential all throughout the history of jazz music .
15 Art Tatum
Art Tatum was a jazz pianist and virtuoso who was nearly blind .
He is acknowledged by many to be one of the greatest pianists of all time , revolutionizing the role piano played in jazz .
Tatum drew upon stride piano to build up a style uniquely his own , playing with swinging pulse and futuristic improvisational abilities .
His approach to jazz music completely changed the way piano was played :
He reharmonized melodies by altering the underlying chord structure , used innovative chord extensions , and dissonance to his benefit .
All of these were characteristics of bebop music , happening some 10 years before the first bebop records were even made .
He was noted also for having exquisite technique , to a point where he was able to play some of the most difficult passages at high velocity , and still present the illusion that he was hardly moving his hands .
14 Thelonious Monk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmhP1RgbrrY&hl=en_US&fs=1&
Some of the most complex and dissonant harmonies can be found in the repertoire of pianist and composer Thelonious Monk , one of the most important contributers to bebop music .
His somewhat eccentric persona also helped popularize jazz .
Known for his “ hip ” style in suits , hats and sunglasses , Monk , in essence , personified the uniqueness and idiosyncrasy that was his music .
His novel , improvisational approach helped to create a plethora of jazz standards like “ Epistrophy , ” “ Blue Monk , ” “ Straight , No Chaser , ” “ I Mean You , ” and “ Well , You Need n’t . ”
Monk ’s style was commonly characterized by his innovative approach to piano playing which included percussive attacks and abrupt pauses .
He often got up from the piano during performances and danced a bit while the other members of the band continued playing .
Thelonious
Monk remains one of the most celebrated and renown pianists in any genre .
13 Charles Mingus
An acclaimed bass virtuoso , composer , bandleader , and occasional pianist , Charles Mingus was one of the most creative musicians in the jazz scene .
He developed a completely unique style , embracing elements of gospel , hard bop , free jazz , and classical music .
Mingus was called the “ heir apparent to Duke Ellington ” because of his fantastic writing for medium - sized ensembles .
His compositions showcased the skill of each of his players , whom he made sure were not only talented , but characteristically unique like himself .
Mingus was feared for his temper , both on and offstage .
He once punched trombonist Jimmy Knepper in the face , breaking off a crowned tooth and essentially ruining Knepper ’s embouchure .
Mingus suffered from clinical depression and refused to compromise his musical integrity , which resulted in on - stage eruptions and often the threatening of other band mates .
Despite this , Mingus is one of the most important figures in bebop , bass and jazz history .
12 Art Blakey
Art Blakey was a famous American drummer and bandleader who revolutionized the way jazz drums were played .
His unique approach to drumming incorporated bits of swing , blues , funk and hard bop ; a style which is heard today in drummers everywhere .
Along with Max Roach and Kenny Clarke , he is considered to have invented the modern bebop style of drumming .
For over 30 years , his band The Jazz Messengers launched the careers of a multitude of famous jazz artists , like Benny Golson , Wayne Shorter , Clifford Brown , Curtis Fuller , Horace Silver , Freddie Hubbard , Keith Jarrett , Wynton Marsalis and countless others .
The Jazz Messengers not only produced phenomenal music , but served as a proving ground of sorts for young musicians , similar to Miles Davis ’ band .
Art Blakey ’s style changed the way jazz sounded , and the way drums were played in modern bebop .
11 Dizzy Gillespie
American jazz trumpet player , singer , composer and bandleader , Gillespie was very significant in the development of bebop and modern jazz .
His trumpet playing influenced such players as Miles Davis , Clifford Brown and Fats Navarro .
After spending time in Cuba and coming back to America , Gillespie also greatly helped in the advancement of Afro-Cuban Jazz .
He was characterized by his horn rimmed glasses , bent trumpet and uniquely puffy cheeks when playing .
A great improviser , Dizzy added a certain layer of harmonic complexity to his music , something previously unknown in jazz .
Songs like “ Salt Peanuts ” and “ Goovin ’ High ” were very different , both harmonically and rhythmically , when compared with the sounds of his contemporaries .
Remaining true to bebop his entire career , Gillespie is remembered as one of the most influential trumpet players in history .
10 Max Roach
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfiaJHqcRx8&hl=en_US&fs=1&
Max Roach is considered to be one of the greatest drummers in history , and was a renowned bebop pioneer .
He is , along with a select few , essentially responsible for the modern style of jazz drumming .
Roach was also involved greatly in the Civil Rights movement , creating an album with Oscar Brown Jr. and Coleman Hawkins called “ We Insist !
– Freedom Now , ” commemorating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation .
Roach performed with amazing style , able to play entire shows solo , showing that , given his incredible skill , he could play and completely satisfy an entire audience while fulfilling the requirements of a solo performance .
Roach , completely in - tune with the bebop scene , played with artists like Clifford Brown , Miles Davis , Charlie Parker , Dizzy Gillespie , Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus , ensuring a vibrant and successful career .
9 Billie Holiday
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ZyuULy9zs&hl=en_US&fs=1&
“ Lady Day ” was perhaps the most exceptional popular music singer of the 20th century .
She wrote few songs , but when she sang , she took on a deep , personal and intimate approach .
Her vocal style and intonation was inspired greatly by the sound of the instruments she heard and was filled with a profound intensity .
In that manner , she developed a new style , incorporating the manipulation of phrasing and tempo .
Her recording of the song “ Strange Fruit ” is considered one of the most important songs in history , because of it ’s powerful theme and topic , and because of Holiday ’s powerful performance .
She received multiple posthumous Grammy Hall of Fame awards and Grammy Best Historic Album awards for her work .
Although her delivery may have been somewhat thin and her range fairly limited , there is no doubt that her voice was more powerful than any at the time could have hoped to be .
8 John Coltrane
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1n5E4IdYY&hl=en_US&fs=1&
John Coltrane is virtually synonymous with the word “ cool . ”
At the forefront of hard bop , Coltrane , a composer and saxophone virtuoso , made serious headway into becoming one of the most important figures in jazz music .
Coltrane had a harsh , strident sound and played with extreme intensity .
He was able to solo and improvise with astounding power , creating “ sheets of sound . ”
Playing tenor and soprano sax , Coltrane could either play with a smooth melodic sound , or an unmatched intensity .
His compositions , along with Miles Davis , helped redefine be -bop , with the introduction of modal harmony , and the “ Coltrane Changes . ”
Coltrane , a figurehead of avant - garde jazz , was also prolific in his recordings , making about 50 albums in his career as band leader .
He has been recognized extensively , with an induction in the Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame , a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award , a Grammy for “ Best Jazz Solo Performance , ” and a church which worships him as a saint .
7 Count Basie
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQi4jglT0Vo&hl=en_US&fs=1&
Groundbreaking pianist , organist , composer and bandleader , Count Basie led one of the most successful bands in history .
For 50 years the Count Basie Orchestra , an incredibly popular group of musicians who included players like Lester Young , Sweets Edison , Buck Clayton and Joe Williams , maintained a reputation of one of the most swingin ’ and hardhittin’ bands in America .
Winner of nine Grammy awards , Basie introduced multiple generations of listeners to the big band sound .
He wrote numerous standards like “ April in Paris ” and “ One O’Clock Jump , ” which , for years , have been covered by countless other artists .
Basie is also remembered by his colleagues as being considerate , modest , relaxed and enthusiastic .
Without Basie ’s crucial presence on the scene , popular and big band music would be drastically different , and undoubtedly less influential than it has become .
6 Coleman Hawkins
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDOXkDFr35M&hl=en_US&fs=1&
The tenor saxophone is iconic of bebop and jazz music in general ; and there is one person accountable for this : Coleman Hawkins .
Hawkins innovation in swing and big band music was vital in the development of bebop in the mid 1940s .
His contribution to the saxophone made the careers of people like John Coltrane , Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon possible .
Hawkins ’ original recording of “ Body and Soul ” in 1939 is considered a standard to which all tenor saxophonists set themselves .
People like Thelonious Monk , Miles Davis and Max Roach can essentially attribute their successful careers to their early work with the “ Hawk . ”
His ability to improvise led him to cover completely new ground , previously untouched by his contemporaries ; it is because of this that the tenor sax is now such an important improvisational element of jazz music .
5 Benny Goodman
Few can match the swingin ’ sounds of Goodman ’s Big Band .
Benny Goodman , known as the “ King of Swing , ” led one of the most popular bands of the early 20th century .
His 1938 concert at Carnegie hall is considered to be one of the most important live shows in American music history , as it showcased jazz ’ coming to prominence as a respectable art form .
Despite being a major player of big - band swing music , Goodman also helped the advancement of be-bop .
Having a one of the first racially - integrated music groups and being a strong opposer of Jim Crow Laws , Goodman promoted racial - equality by not touring the Southern States .
Goodman was both an important influence in popular and jazz music , as well as a prominent Civil Rights activist .
4 Miles Davis
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TbrgIdm0E&hl=en_US&fs=1&
One of the central figures of jazz in the 20th century , Miles Davis was at the forefront of multiple musical developments and the emergence of a plenitude of styles .
He spearheaded the emergence of be -bop , hard bop , cool jazz , free jazz , fusion , funk and techno music .
Keeping ahead of the game and consistently reinventing his musical style , the various lineups of his band , all of which were very successful , were always full of young brilliant players .
Because of his success , many other artists were propelled to high levels of fame .
Some of the famous jazz artists who owe their success to Miles include John Coltrane , Herbie Hancock , J.J. Johnson , Cannonball Adderley , Keith Jarrett , Bill Evans , Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea .
Davis received various rewards in his lifetime , including eight Grammy Awards and a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction .
Miles Davis was one of the best , most innovative , popular and influential musicians of the 20th Century .
3 Charlie Parker
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjElQ6Ekr9o&hl=en_US&fs=1&
When one thinks of jazz , they think “ Charlie Parker . ”
Known simply as “ Bird , ” Charlie Parker was a pioneering jazz alto - saxophone player , bebop musician and composer .
His fast , virtuosic playing , clean tone , and improvisational abilities greatly influenced other musicians at the time .
His innovation in writing songs , using complex chord progressions and revolutionary harmonic form , changed the standards for composition and greatly influenced other jazz artists .
Parker helped to contribute to the hipster persona associated with jazz , as well as the idea that jazz musicians were artists and intellectuals rather than simply entertainers .
At the time a huge amount of other artists tried to copy Parker ’s style , and often his solos and licks exactly .
His influence is seen in almost every other contemporary musician and renowned jazz composer , many of whom named some choice standards after the “ Bird . ”
2 Duke Ellington
Duke Ellington was a hugely popular pianist , composer and big - band leader .
He was one of the most important band leaders in music .
Although known for his pioneering in jazz , Ellington also excelled in a variety of other genres , including gospel , blues , classical , popular and soundtrack .
Because of his charisma and inventive use of his orchestra , Ellington is essentially responsible for making jazz an art form , similar to classical music .
He received a large variety of awards and honors including 13 Grammy awards , a Pulitzer prize , a Presidential Medal of Freedom , a NAACP Spingarn Medal and Commemorative U.S. quarter to name a few .
A considerable amount of musicians have been inspired by the “ Duke , ” including : Thelonius Monk , Sonny Stitt , Tony Bennett , Dizzy Gillespie , Oscar Peterson , Earl Hines and Joe Pass , as Ellington has proved to be one of the most important figures in jazz and music in general .
1 Louis Armstrong
Arguably one of the most important figures in American history , Louis Armstong , known as “ Satchmo ” or “ Pops ” was an incredibly influential jazz trumpet player and singer from New Orleans .
He is recognized as one of the greatest musicians of all time having a major role in the creation of modern jazz .
With his virtuosic abilities on the trumpet , he is largely accountable for the recognition of the trumpet as a solo instrument in jazz music .
He is also one of the first scat singers and is responsible for its popularization .
His singing influenced people like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby , while his trumpet playing inspired the likes of Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie .
His influence on music as a whole is almost immeasurable , both in terms of his singing and trumpet playing which have earned him a variety of honors and awards .
Notable Exclusions : J.J. Johnson , Wes Montgomery , Django Reinhardt , Ron Carter , Ella Fitzgerald , Paul Chambers , Elvin Jones , Herbie Hancock , Lester Young , Ray Brown , Gene Krupa , Frank Sinatra , Dave Brubeck , Freddie Hubbard , Earl Hines , Buddy Rich , Bill Evans , Red Garland , Clifford Brown , Dexter Gordon , Sonny Rollins , and Oscar Peterson .
Debt levels in an economy matter .�
They matter a lot .�
An economy that is financed primarily by debt can be like a chain of dominoes . �
If one fixed claim fails , and it is large enough , many other fixed claims that rely on the first claim could fail as well , triggering a chain of failures . �
This is a reason why a fiat - money credit - based economy must limit leverage particularly in financial institutions .
Why financial institutions ?�
They borrow and lend .�
They also lend to other financial institutions .�
A� big move in the value of some assets can make many banks insolvent , and perhaps banks that lent to other banks . �
The banks should have equity bases more than sufficient to absorb losses at a 99 % probability level . �
That means that leverage should be a lot lower than it is now .
Economies are more stable when they limit fixed claims and encourage financing via equity rather than debt .�
Imagine what the economy would be like if interest was not deductible from taxable income , but dividends were deductible .
People would save money to buy homes , and would put more money down when they borrowed .
Corporations would lower their debt - to - equity ratios , and would pay more dividends .
Fewer people and corporations would go broke .
Pretty good , but in the short run , the economy would probably grow slower . �
The debt bonanza from 1984 - 2006 pushed our economy to grow faster than it should have , where people and firms took more chances by borrowing more , and making the overall economy less resilient .�
Debt - based economies lose resilience .
What was worse , the Federal Reserve in the Greenspan and Bernanke years facilitated the debt increases because the Fed never took away the stimulus fast enough , and offered stimulus too rapidly . �
This led to a culture of unbridled debt and risk - taking .�
If only :
Greenspan had been silent when the crash hit in October 1987 .
Greenspan had not given into political pressure in late 1990 , where he set up a process of cutting interest rates too much .
Greenspan had not cut rates in 1995 .
Greenspan had not cut rates during the LTCM crisis .
Greenspan would have cut far less 2000 - 2002 .
Instead of tightening 1/4 % at a time 2004 - 6 , they would have raised the rate far more rapidly , completing the rise in one year .
Bernanke would not have let the fed funds rate go to zero , but would have limited fed funds to never go lower than 1 % below the ten - year Treasury yield . �
We never need more than that to stimulate , but some patience is necessary .
What ’s that you say ? �
The economy would have grown more slowly ?�
Right , and the economy should have grown more slowly , rather than gunning the engine through the overaccumulation of debt .�
As it is , the economy will grow more slowly for some time a la Japan , until we delever the economy enough that it can once again grow without stimulus .
The economy is at a fork in the road .�
Do we :
Leave rates low and leave quantitative easing in until price inflation unfolds ?
Let rates rise gradually and drain quantitative easing slowly ?
Raise rates significantly and drain quantitative easing rapidly ?
The third view is off the table .�
No one wants to see any failure . �
Bad decisions of the past must be grown out of , even if it takes a long time of subpar growth to do that .
When Eastern Europe left the Soviet orbit , the countries that did the best were the ones that freed their economies most rapidly .�
Well , not in the short - run . �
Letting companies fail is always a drag in the short run , but in the longer - run it leads to faster growth , because bad investments fail , and are replaced by better investments .
The same is true with monetary policy .�
The US grew faster during periods where failures were reconciled and liquidated , rather than attempting to smooth the economic cycle — leading to fewer failures in the short run , much but bigger failures when the amount of debt became too large .
Before the crisis , when I was writing at RealMoney.com , I usually encouraged taking the less risky macroeconomic route , suggesting policies that would not increase debt levels . �
The trouble was , that all of those ideas were losers in the short - run , and so they were not followed . �
In the long run we are all dead , leaving the failures of short - run policies to our kids .
Personally , I would raise the Fed funds rate to 2 % immediately , and let it shadow the 10 - year rate less 1 % thereafter . �
But no one likes jolts , except when the Fed is loosening .�
After that , I would rather the Fed allow inflation to raise collateral values and end the home and commercial mortgage crises .�
But no , what we are likely to get is a Japan - style muddle - in - the - middle where they struggle with a slow raising of rates , and a slow end to quantitative easing , with a premature giving in when the economy has a negative burp before the removal of policy accommodation is complete . �
I expect us to move in the direction of Japan .
What may change the story are sovereign defaults as government debt levels get too high . �
In the short run , that may favor the dollar — it wo n’t fail rapidly . �
But perhaps the euro might fail .�
Even the yen might .�
The era we are in is like the mid-1800s , when nations were constrained by their debt levels .
From the recent book “ This Time is Different , ” we know that countries with high debt levels grow more slowly , and defaul more frequently . �
Ignore anyone who tells you that debt levels do n’t matter .

Dr. Morfill and his colleagues have tested their devices on hands and feet .
“ It works on athlete ’s foot , ” he said .
“ And the nice thing is , you do n’t have to take your socks off .
They are disinfected , too . ”
( The cleaning takes a bit longer when socks are added to the job , he said  about 25 seconds .
“ And it does n’t yet work through shoes , ” he added . )

Plasmas engineered to zap microorganisms are n’t new .
During the last decade , they have come into use to sterilize some medical instruments .
But using them on human tissue is another matter , said Mark Kushner , director of the Michigan Institute for Plasma Science and Engineering and a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
“ Many thousands of volts drive the generation of plasma , ” he said , “ and normally one does n’t want to touch thousands of volts . ”
But the design of the new hand sanitizers , he said , protects people from doing so .
Reassured by that design , about five years ago he put his naked thumb into a jet of microbe - destroying plasma at the lab of another plasma researcher .
“ It was just one of those leaps of faith , ” he said .
( His thumb survived just fine . )
Research in the field of plasma medicine has grown quickly in the last decade , with at least 50 groups worldwide working on medical uses , Professor Kushner estimated .
He said that there were many documented cases of plasmas being applied for sanitizing skin or other body parts , and “ for speeding the rate of blood clotting in wound healing . ”
“ Plasmas turn out to have beneficial effects , ” he said .
Dr. Morfill , who has a plasma research laboratory inside the international space station , took an unusual route to studying medical uses of plasmas .
He was researching the natural plasmas of space , including the charged dust in Saturn ’s rings , and decided to develop plasmas for health on earth .
( User Submitted ) – In what 's being heralded as " a huge leap forward , " Stanford researchers have successfully turned mouse skin cells into fully functioning brain cells .
The process , which took less than a week , upends thinking on how cells develop specialized roles , and could help minimize the controversial role of embryonic stem cells in treatments for diseases like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
" These are fully functional neurons , " researcher Marius Wernig told AFP .
" They can do all the principal things that neurons in the brain do . "
If the process can be duplicated with human cells , brain cells derived from a skin graft would be genetically identical to patient 's , removing the risk of immune rejection and making them ideal for treating neurodegenerative diseases .

THE LIFE of Charles Darwin has all the elements of an engaging movie -- adventure , conflict , insecurity , heartbreak and ultimately victory over entrenched ideas and institutions .
The film Creation takes up some of these issues , portraying Darwin ( Paul Bettany ) in the years preceding the publication of On the Origin of Species , grappling with his theory and confronting the religious conservatism of his wife Emma ( Jennifer Connelly ) .
And yet , director Jon Amiel seems to have found a way to make this story boring .
Creation is not a terrible movie-- Bettany and Connelly are both fine actors -- but the story largely avoids the great conflicts posed by Darwin 's ideas and focuses on his personal life .
What 's left is a drama that is gloomy and erratic .
Initially , the film uses a confusing chronology , moving back and forth through time with little indication of the date beyond Darwin 's increasingly fragile hairline .
Rather than helping us understand or appreciate the story , we 're left confused and alienated .
Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin in Creation
There 's also some hokey imagery , with Bettany 's grief - ridden Darwin being pounded by a baptism of water during a hydrotherapy session and an even sillier image of him touching the finger of an orangutan .
Clearly meant as an allusion to Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel , its attempts to be at the same time sacrilegious , bittersweet -- the animal is dying -- and insightful into Darwin 's theory clumsily failing at all three .
But the bigger problem is that the story focuses on Darwin 's family life almost to the exclusion of his ideas or their challenge to society .
Darwin's theory was " the biggest single idea in the history of thought , " the opening titles tell us , announcing how important the movie is .
But there are precious few examples of those ideas in the film .
There are a few discussions of evolution with fellow scientists , most notably with Thomas Huxley , later dubbed " Darwin 's bulldog , " who congratulates him for killing God .
" Good riddance to the old bugger , " Huxley says in a moment of greatly needed humor .
There are also a few scenes involving Darwin 's alienation from church , but altogether , these scenes are a sideshow .
Review : Movies Creation , directed by Jon Amiel , starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly .
ULTIMATELY , DARWIN'S struggles are with his religious wife , although even that conflict is not so much about religion as it is about grief for their deceased child .
There can be little doubt that this affected both of them deeply , but it 's only one aspect of the pressures that Darwin faced and makes for a plodding story .
Instead of a brilliant scientist grappling with big ideas , we get a brooding , sickly madman barely able to put a word on the page , much less capable of revolutionizing biology .
The result is very claustrophobic .
For a film about a man who traveled the world and associated with some of the great scientific minds of his day , Creation spends far too much time with Darwin tucked away in his country home , with only an occasional visitor to bring him out of his doldrums .
More importantly , this completely avoids the larger conflicts that Darwin faced with the outside world and his own position in it .
Earlier in life , Darwin studied to become a clergyman at Cambridge , where students were required to swear to the Thirty - Nine Articles of Religion in the Anglican Church , and most of the scholars were ordained priests .
He later spent five years on the HMS Beagle , meticulously studying geology and wildlife along the way .
His observations convinced him of the evolution of species and led him to develop the theory of evolution by natural selection .
Darwin spent another 20 years of experimenting and studying in order to improve his theory and gather evidence for it .
This promised to be no easy battle , and the entrenched powers in the Anglican Church and their hangers - on were n't likely to concede easily .
But Darwin 's painstaking labors and belief in the vast evidence he accumulated gave him the strength to persevere .
As Ian Angus writes in the International Socialist Review :
These materialist methods led him to an entirely materialist theory -- at a time when materialism was n't just unpopular in respectable circles , it was considered subversive and politically dangerous .
Between 1838 and 1848 , while he was first working out his ideas , England was swept by an unprecedented wave of mass actions , political protests and strikes .
Radical ideas -- materialist , atheistic ideas - - were infecting the working class , leading many to expect ( or fear ) revolutionary change .
The challenge these ideas posed and the potential they had to shake up the scientific community are almost nowhere to be seen in the film .
Instead , this whirlwind of experience and ideas that led Darwin to his theory are left as footnotes to an overwrought chamber play .
Amiel describes his approach to making the film in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine :
Feature films do n't do abstract ideas so well .
It deals with them best when it embeds those ideas in character conflicts .
I think any great film that 's produced any ideological change , whether it 's Inherit the Wind or Z or Salvador , any film that makes a controversial , world - changing statement , they all succeed primarily because they are great drama first ...
As for the controversy , I really did n't want to see those awful scenes set in an oak - paneled room with a bunch of guys in black frock coats and big side whiskers standing up and going " No ! Outrageous !
Shocking ! Scandalous ! "
It seemed unnecessary to do that .
But Inherit the Wind - - a dramatization of the Scopes Monkey Trial pitting Creationists against the teaching of evolution -- succeeded precisely because it reveled in the battle of ideas .
Released in 1960 , when the McCarthyite Hollywood blacklist had just barely ended , it is best remembered for a classic scene where Spencer Tracy puts Fredric March 's Creationist attorney on the witness stand and forces him to explain who gave birth to Adam and Eve 's grandchildren and justify the young age of the earth .
That is a film that lives and breathes ideas , and its characters come to life through them .
Unfortunately , Creation avoids this approach and dwells in the misery of the suffering Darwin .
The Victorian - era trappings of " frock coats and big side whiskers " remain -- it 's just the controversial ideas that are gone .
Amiel 's previous films include the mediocre thrillers Copycat and Entrapment .
His last film was The Core , which featured a plan to detonate nuclear bombs at the center of the Earth in order to save the planet 's electromagnetic field .
Unsurprisingly , the film has gained notoriety for its exceptionally bad science .
None of this suggests that Amiel is a director interested in grappling with complicated ideas or controversy , historical or contemporary .
" There is grandeur in this view of life , " Bettany tells us at the end of the film .
Unfortunately , that is exactly what is missing from Creation .

SANTIAGO , Chile  Sebastián Piñera , a billionaire businessman and former senator , broke the 20 - year hold on power of a leftist coalition on Sunday , becoming the first right - wing president to be elected in Chile since the dictatorship ended in 1990 .
It was the first time the right had won the presidency democratically in more than 50 years , and Mr. Piñera is one of a handful of conservatives elected to head a Latin American country since the region began a strong swing to the left in recent decades .
But most analysts did not see the vote as a reflection of a major conservative shift among voters as much as a sign of disenchantment with what they saw as stale ideas and a desire for renewal .
“ It ’s clear to me there needs to be change in Chile , ” said Eduardo Navarrete , a retiree who voted for Mr. Piñera .
“ Twenty years of abuse and fake progress based solely on the price of copper is too much .
The rest is just for show . ”
Happiness is contagious , and that “ contagious ” quality is where design meets the market .
Coca - Cola ’s Happiness
Machine video is a perfect example of how viral happiness can be .
The brand ’s first viral venture captures what happened when they placed a very special vending machine on a college campus .
The video launched on January 12 and topped a million views today based solely on people sharing the video through Twitter , Facebook , blogs , and word - of - mouth .
The people in the video and people spreading the video will forever share a memory that cements the association of happiness with Coca - Cola .
I know I have great memories of Coca - Cola from when I was a kid .
( Sorry , Pepsi . )
I remember so clearly arriving in New Delhi to visit my grandparents , and then , in the midst of hottest day I ’d ever seen , there was a silver tray with an ice - cold bottle of Coke .
My mouth still waters as I evoke the memory .
How can designers create these special moments –this magic ?
And not just “ viral video ” magic , but that everyday life magic of the emotional connection that bonds people with your brand .
Can we conceive of the complete story and lead people down a path of creating smiles ?
When you design , do you think about the object , service , or experience in a way that focuses you on create an effect well over the horizon ?
As designers , that is our challenge .
That is our mission .
I would love to know what inspiration you get out of the success of this short but engaging video .
This year , we all need to become more like Utah , under its Republican governor – and then go further .
No , dear reader , do n't panic – I have not converted to Mormonism , nor have I tossed out my sanity with my old Santa hat and Christmas decorations .
The people of one of the most conservative states in the US have stumbled across a simple policy that slashes greenhouse gas emissions by 13 percent , saves huge sums of money , improves public services , cuts traffic congestion , and makes 82 per cent of workers happier .
It can do the same for us – and point to an even better future beyond it – without the need for the Arch - Angel Moron ( yes , Mormons really do believe in him ) to offer his blessing .
It all began two years ago , when the state was facing a budget crisis .
One night , the new Republican Governor Jon Huntsman was staring at the red ink and rough sums when he had an idea .
Keeping the state 's buildings lit and heated and manned cost a fortune .
Could it be cut without cutting the service given to the public ?
Then it hit him .
What if , instead of working 9 to 5 , Monday to Friday , the state 's employees only came in four days a week , but now from 8 to 6 ?
The state would be getting the same forty hours a week out of its staff – but the costs of maintaining their offices would plummet .
The employees would get a three - day weekend , and cut a whole day 's worth of tiring , polluting commuting out of their week .
He took the step of requiring it by law for 80 per cent of the state 's employees .
( Obviously , some places - like the emergency services or prisons – had to be exempted . )
At first , there was cautious support among the workforce but as the experiment has rolled on , it has gathered remarkable acclaim .
Today , two years on , 82 per cent of employees applaud the new hours , and hardly anyone wants to go back .
Professor Lori Wadsworth carried out a detailed study of workers ' responses , and she says : " People love it . "
A whole series of unexpected benefits started to emerge .
The number of sick days claimed by workers fell by 9 per cent .
Air pollution fell , since people were spending 20 per cent less time in their cars .
Some 17,000 tonnes of warming gases were kept out of the atmosphere .
They have a new slogan in Utah – Thank God It 's Thursday .
But would n't people be irritated that they could n't contact their state authorities on a Friday ?
Did the standard of service fall ?
It was a real worry when the programme started .
But before , people had to take time off work to contact the authorities , since they were only open during work hours .
Now they were open for an hour before work and an hour after it .
It actually became easier to see them Monday to Thursday : waiting times for state services have fallen .
Think of it as the anti-Dolly Parton manifesto , puncturing her famous song : " Workin ' 9 to 5 / What a way to make a livin ' / Barely gettin ' by / Its enough to drive you /
Crazy if you let it ... "
A queue of US cities and corporations like General Motors are following suit , and Britain 's councils and companies should be sweeping in behind them .
It 's a win - win - win – good for employees , good for employers and good for the environment .
And once we started on this course , it could spur us to think in more radical ways about work .
If this tiny little tinker with work routines leads to a big burst of human happiness and environmental sanity , what could bigger changes achieve ?
Work is the activity that we spend most of our waking lives engaged in - yet it is too often trapped in an outdated routine .
Today , very few of us work in factories , yet we have clung to the habits of the factory with almost religious devotion .
Clock in , sit at your terminal , be seen to work , clock out .
Is this the best way to make us as productive and creative and happy as we can be ?
Should we clamber into a steel box every morning to sit in a concrete box all day ?
Some of the best artworks of recent years – Joshua Ferris ' novel And Then We Came To The End , Ricky Gervais ' TV series The Office , Mike Judge 's film Office Space – have distilled the strange anomie of living like this , constantly monitored , constantly sedentary , constantly staring at a screen .
When I started working from home , I suddenly found my productivity shot up : when I stopped being seen to work just by sitting at a desk , I actually knuckled down faster and with fewer distractions to work properly .
In a wired lap - topped world , far more people could work more effectively from home , in hours of their own choosing , if only their bosses would have confidence in them .
They would be better workers , better parents and better people – and we would take a huge number of cars off the road .
But the problem runs deeper than this .
Britain now has the longest work hours in the developed world after the US – and in a recession , those of us with jobs scamper ever faster in our hamster - wheels .
Yes , we now make the Japanese look chilled .
This is not how 2010 was meant to turn out .
If you look at the economists and thinkers of , say , the 1930s , they assumed that once we had achieved abundance – once humans had all the food and clothes and heat and toys we could use – we would relax and work less .
They thought that by now work would barely cover three days as we headed en masse for the beach and the concert - hall .
Instead , the treadmill is whirling ever - faster .
This is n't our choice : virtually every study of this issue finds that huge majorities of people say they want to work less and spend more time with their friends , their families and their thoughts .
We know it 's bad for us .
Professor Cary Cooper , who has studied to effects of overwork on the human body , says : " If you work consistently long hours , more than 45 a week , every week , it will damage your health , physically and psychologically . "
You become 37 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke or heart - attack if you work 60 hours a week – yet one in six of all Brits are doing just that .
We do n't stop primarily because we are locked in an arms race with out colleagues .
If we relax and become more human , we fall behind the person in the next booth down , who is chasing faster .
Work can be one of the richest and most rewarding experiences , but not like this .
In a recession , this insecurity only swells .
Under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the 1990s , the French discovered the most elegant way out of this , taking the Utah experiment deeper and further .
They insisted that everyone work a maximum of 35 paid hours a week .
It was a way of saying : in a rich country , life is about more than serving corporations and slogging .
Wealth generation and consumerism should be our slaves , not our masters : where they make us happy , we should embrace them ; where they make us miserable , we should cast them aside .
Enjoy yourself .
True wealth lies not only in having enough , but in having the time to enjoy everything and everyone around you .
It was the equivalent to an arms treaty : we all stop , together , now , at the 35 hour mark .
The French population became fitter , their relationships were less likely to break down , their children became considerably happier , and voluntary organisations came back to life .
According to the national statistics agency Insee , the policy created 350,000 jobs , because so many people moved to job - shares to ensure their post was filled five days a week .
But under pressure from corporations enraged that their staff could n't be made to slog all the time , Nicholas Sarkozy has abolished this extraordinary national experiment .
The French people were dismayed : the polls show a majority still support the cap .
As a top prospect for the Oakland Athletics , outfielder Grant Desme might 've gotten the call every minor leaguer wants this spring .
Instead , he believed he had another , higher calling .
Desme announced Friday that he was leaving baseball to enter the priesthood , walking away after a breakout season in which he became MVP of the Arizona Fall League .
" I was doing well at ball .
But I really had to get down to the bottom of things , " the 23 - year - old Desme said .
" I was n't at peace with where I was at . "

First up is word of a new firmware release ( 3.2010.02 -8 ( PR 1.1.1 ) ) , 16.2 MB worth of apparently minor changes along with a slew of new regions , the inclusion of which may mean good things for those who have n't been granted to this smartphone yet .
If that 's not enough for you , at MWC Nokia is showing off some new apps for the handset , the most notable being a couple of 3D games that look a wee bit simplistic in terms of gameplay but do n't disappoint in terms of graphics .

This one has us scratching our heads .
When attempting to order the iPhone for zip codes in Los Angeles , San Francisco and other major cities , everything seems perfectly fine .
However , NYC zip codes , more specifically Brooklyn , removes the iPhone as an option for online sales .
We called several stores in the NYC area , including one in Brooklyn , and the sales reps said stock was perfectly fine .
So we chatted up online sales and they told us it was n’t available in that area and , as noted by the image below , they could n’t tell us why :
Consumerist has a slightly different twist in this story — the rep they spoke with said it ’s because NYC is n’t ready for the iPhone .
That ’s fine and most New Yorkers would agree , but that does n’t explain the sufficient stock available in stores throughout that area .
One Consumerist reader wrote a comment saying that “ Due to massive fraud in online ordering , iPhones are not available online only . ”
Now that is definitely interesting , but you can order an iPhone online if you have a non-NYC zip code .
We ’re digging deep and trying to sort this one out for you guys and we ’ll definitely bring the updates as they come .

Today ’s idea : Let ’s have “ driver ’s licenses ” for the Internet to counter online fraud , hackers and espionage , a Microsoft executive suggests .
Internet | Maybe on your busy junket to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week you missed the panel where Craig Mundie , Microsoft ’s chief research and technology officer , offered up the Internet licensing proposal above .
Barbara Kiviat of the Curious Capitalist blog was there , and summarizes the idea thusly :
What Mundie is proposing is to impose authentication .
He draws an analogy to automobile use .
If you want to drive a car , you have to have a license ( not to mention an inspection , insurance , etc. ) .
If you do something bad with that car , like break a law , there is the chance that you will lose your license and be prevented from driving in the future .
In other words , there is a legal and social process for imposing discipline .
Mundie imagines three tiers of Internet I.D. : one for people , one for machines and one for programs ( which often act as proxies for the other two ) .
Now , there are , of course , a number of obstacles to making such a scheme be reality .
Even here in the mountains of Switzerland I can hear the worldwide scream go up : “ But we ’re entitled to anonymity on the Internet ! ” Really ?
Are you ?
Why do you think that ?
Mundie [ above ] pointed out that in the physical world we are implicitly comfortable with the notion that there are certain places we ’re not allowed to go without identifying ourselves .
Are you allowed to walk down the street with no one knowing who you are ?
Absolutely .
Are you allowed to walk into a bank vault and still not give your name ?
Hardly .

Guest post by Jerome Ravetz
At the end of January 2010 two distinguished scientific institutions shared headlines with Tony Blair over accusations of the dishonest and possibly illegal manipulation of information .
Our ‘ Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035 ’ of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is matched by his ‘ dodgy dossier ’ of Saddam ’s fictitious subversions .
We had the violations of the Freedom of Information Act at the University of East Anglia ; he has the extraordinary 70 - year gag rule on the David Kelly suicide file .
There was ‘ the debate is over ’ on one side , and ‘ WMD beyond doubt ’ on the other .
The parallels are significant and troubling , for on both sides they involve a betrayal of public trust .
Politics will doubtless survive , for it is not a fiduciary institution ; but for science the dangers are real .
Climategate is particularly significant because it cannot be blamed on the well - known malign influences from outside science , be they greedy corporations or an unscrupulous State .
This scandal , and the resulting crisis , was created by people within science who can be presumed to have been acting with the best of intentions .
In the event of a serious discrediting of the global - warming claims , public outrage would therefore be directed at the community of science itself , and ( from within that community ) at its leaders who were either ignorant or complicit until the scandal was blown open .
If we are to understand Climategate , and move towards a restoration of trust , we should consider the structural features of the situation that fostered and nurtured the damaging practices .
I believe that the ideas of Post - Normal Science ( as developed by Silvio Funtowicz and myself ) can help our understanding .
There are deep problems of the management of uncertainty in science in the policy domain , that will not be resolved by more elaborate quantification .
In the gap between science and policy , the languages , their conventions and their implications are effectively incommensurable .
It takes determination and skill for a scientist who is committed to social responsibility , to avoid becoming a ‘ stealth advocate ’ ( in the terms of Roger Pielke Jr. ) .
When the policy domain seems unwilling or unable to recognise plain and urgent truths about a problem , the contradictions between scientific probity and campaigning zeal become acute .
It is a perennial problem for all policy - relevant science , and it seems to have happened on a significant scale in the case of climate science .
The management of uncertainty and quality in such increasingly common situations is now an urgent task for the governance of science .
We can begin to see what went seriously wrong when we examine what the leading practitioners of this ‘ evangelical science ’ of global warming ( thanks to Angela Wilkinson ) took to be the plain and urgent truth in their case .
This was not merely that there are signs of exceptional disturbance in the ecosphere due to human influence , nor even that the climate might well be changing more rapidly now than for a very long time .
Rather , they propounded , as a proven fact , Anthropogenic Carbon - based Global Warming .
There is little room for uncertainty in this thesis ; it effectively needs hockey - stick behaviour in all indicators of global temperature , so that it is all due to industrialisation .
Its iconic image is the steadily rising graph of CO2 concentrations over the past fifty years at the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii ( with the implicit assumption that CO2 had always previously been at or below that starting level ) .
Since CO2 has long been known to be a greenhouse gas , with scientific theories quantifying its effects , the scientific case for this dangerous trend could seem to be overwhelmingly simple , direct , and conclusive .
In retrospect , we can ask why this particular , really rather extreme view of the prospect , became the official one .
It seems that several causes conspired .
First , the early opposition to any claim of climate change was only partly scientific ; the tactics of the opposing special interests were such as to induce the proponents to adopt a simple , forcefully argued position .
Then , once the position was adopted , its proponents became invested in it , and attached to it , in all sorts of ways , institutional and personal .
And I suspect that a simplified , even simplistic claim , was more comfortable for these scientists than one where complexity and uncertainty were acknowledged .
It is not merely a case of the politicians and public needing a simple , unequivocal message .
As Thomas Kuhn described ‘ normal science ’ , which ( as he said ) nearly all scientists do all the time , it is puzzle - solving within an unquestioned framework or ‘ paradigm ’ .
Issues of uncertainty and quality are not prominent in ‘ normal ’ scientific training , and so they are less easily conceived and managed by its practitioners .
Now , as Kuhn saw , this ‘ normal ’ science has been enormously successful in enabling our unprecedented understanding and control of the world around us .
But his analysis related to the sciences of the laboratory , and by extension the technologies that could reproduce stable and controllable external conditions for their working .
Where the systems under study are complicated , complex or poorly understood , that ‘ textbook ’ style of investigation becomes less , sometimes much less , effective .
The near - meltdown of the world ’s financial system can be blamed partly on naïvely reductionist economics and misapplied simplistic statistics .
The temptation among ‘ normal ’ scientists is to work as if their material is as simple as in the lab .
If nothing else , that is the path to a steady stream of publications , on which a scientific career now so critically depends .
The most obvious effect of this style is the proliferation of computer simulations , which give the appearance of solved puzzles even when neither data nor theory provide much support for the precision of their numerical outputs .
Under such circumstances , a refined appreciation of uncertainty in results is inhibited , and even awareness of quality of workmanship can be atrophied .
In the course of the development of climate - change science , all sorts of loose ends were left unresolved and sometimes unattended .
Even the most fundamental quantitative parameter of all , the forcing factor relating the increase in mean temperature to a doubling of CO2 , lies somewhere between 1 and 3 degrees , and is thus uncertain to within a factor of 3 .
The precision ( at about 2 % ) in the statements of the ‘ safe limits ’ of CO2 concentration , depending on calculations with this factor , is not easily justified .
Also , the predictive power of the global temperature models has been shown to depend more on the ‘ story line ’ than anything else , the end - of century increase in temperature ranging variously from a modest one degree to a catastrophic six .
And the ‘ hockey stick ’ picture of the past , so crucial for the strict version of the climate change story , has run into increasingly severe problems .
As an example , it relied totally on a small set of deeply uncertain tree - ring data for the Medieval period , to refute the historical evidence of a warming then ; but it needed to discard that sort of data for recent decades , as they showed a sudden cooling from the 1960 ’s onwards !
In the publication , the recent data from other sources were skilfully blended in so that the change was not obvious ; that was the notorious ‘ Nature trick ’ of the CRU e-mails .
Even worse , for the warming case to have political effect , a mere global average rise in temperature was not compelling enough .
So that people could appreciate the dangers , there needed to be predictions of future climate – or even weather – in the various regions of the world .
Given the gross uncertainties in even the aggregated models , regional forecasts are really beyond the limits of science .
And yet they have been provided , with various degrees of precision .
Those announced by the IPCC have become the most explosive .
As all these anomalies and unsolved puzzles emerged , the neat , compelling picture became troubled and even confused .
In Kuhn ’s analysis , this would be the start of a ‘ pre- revolutionary ’ phase of normal science .
But the political cause had been taken up by powerful advocates , like Al Gore .
We found ourselves in another crusading ‘ War ’ , like those on ( non-alcoholic ) Drugs and ‘ Terror ’ .
This new War , on Carbon , was equally simplistic , and equally prone to corruption and failure .
Global warming science became the core element of this major worldwide campaign to save the planet .
Any weakening of the scientific case would have amounted to a betrayal of the good cause , as well as a disruption of the growing research effort .
All critics , even those who were full members of the scientific peer community , had to be derided and dismissed .
As we learned from the CRU e-mails , they were not considered to be entitled to the normal courtesies of scientific sharing and debate .
Requests for information were stalled , and as one witty blogger has put it , ‘ peer review ’ was replaced by ‘ pal review ’ .
Even now , the catalogue of unscientific practices revealed in the mainstream media is very small in comparison to what is available on the blogosphere .
Details of shoddy science and dirty tricks abound .
By the end , the committed inner core were confessing to each other that global temperatures were falling , but it was far too late to change course .
The final stage of corruption , cover - up , had taken hold .
For the core scientists and the leaders of the scientific communities , as well as for nearly all the liberal media , ‘ the debate was over ’ .
Denying Climate Change received the same stigma as denying the Holocaust .
Even the trenchant criticisms of the most egregious errors in the IPCC reports were kept ‘ confidential ’ .
And then came the e-mails .
We can understand the root cause of Climategate as a case of scientists constrained to attempt to do normal science in a post - normal situation .
But climate change had never been a really ‘ normal ’ science , because the policy implications were always present and strong , even overwhelming .
Indeed , if we look at the definition of ‘ post - normal science ’ , we see how well it fits : facts uncertain , values in dispute , stakes high , and decisions urgent .
In needing to treat Planet Earth like a textbook exercise , the climate scientists were forced to break the rules of scientific etiquette and ethics , and to play scientific power - politics in a way that inevitably became corrupt .
The combination of non-critical ‘ normal science ’ with anti-critical ‘ evangelical science ’ was lethal .
As in other ‘ gate ’ scandals , one incident served to pull a thread on a tissue of protective plausibilities and concealments , and eventually led to an unravelling .
What was in the e-mails could be largely explained in terms of embattled scientists fighting off malicious interference ; but the materials ready and waiting on the blogosphere provided a background , and that is what converted a very minor scandal to a catastrophe .
Consideration of those protective plausibilities can help to explain how the illusions could persist for so long until their sudden collapse .
The scientists were all reputable , they published in leading peer - reviewed journals , and their case was itself highly plausible and worthy in a general way .
Individual criticisms were , for the public and perhaps even for the broader scientific community , kept isolated and hence muffled and lacking in systematic significance .
And who could have imagined that at its core so much of the science was unsound ?
The plausibility of the whole exercise was , as it were , bootstrapped .
I myself was alerted to weaknesses in the case by some caveats in Sir David King ’s book The Hot Topic ; and I had heard of the hockey - stick affair .
But even I was carried along by the bootstrapped plausibility , until the scandal broke .
( I have benefited from the joint project on plausibility in science of colleagues in Oxford and at the Arizona State University ) .
Part of the historic significance of Climategate is that the scandal was so effectively and quickly exposed .
Within a mere two months of the first reports in the mainstream media , the key East Anglia scientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were discredited .
Even if only a fraction of their scientific claims were eventually refuted , their credibility as trustworthy scientists was lost .
To explain how it all happened so quickly and decisively , we have the confluence of two developments , one social and the other technical .
For the former , there is a lesson of Post - Normal Science , that we call the Extended Peer Community .
In traditional ‘ normal ’ science , the peer community , performing the functions of quality - assurance and governance , is strictly confined to the researchers who share the paradigm .
In the case of ‘ professional consultancy ’ , the clients and / or sponsors also participate in governance .
We have argued that in the case of Post - Normal Science , the ‘ extended peer community ’ , including all affected by the policy being implemented , must be fully involved .
Its particular contribution will depend on the nature of the core scientific problem , and also on the phase of investigation .
Detailed technical work is a task for experts , but quality - control on even that work can be done by those with much broader expertise .
And on issues like the definition of the problem itself , the selection of personnel , and crucially the ownership of the results , the extended peer community has full rights of participation .
This principle is effectively acknowledged in many jurisdictions , and for many policy - related problems .
The theory of Post - Normal Science goes beyond the official consensus in recognising ‘ extended facts ’ , that might be local knowledge and values , as well as unoffficially obtained information .
The task of creating and involving the extended peer community ( generally known as ‘ participation ’ ) has been recognised as difficult , with its own contradictions and pitfalls .
It has grown haphazardly , with isolated successes and failures .
Hitherto , critics of scientific matters have been relegated to a sort of samizdat world , exchanging private letters or writing books that can easily be ignored ( as not being peer - reviewed ) by the ruling establishment .
This has generally been the fate of even the most distinguished and responsible climate - change critics , up to now .
A well - known expert in uncertainty management , Jeroen van der Sluijs , explicitly condemned the ‘ overselling of certainty ’ and predicted the impending destruction of trust ; but he received no more attention than did Nikolas Taleb in warning of the ‘ fat tails ’ in the probability distributions of securities that led to the Credit Crunch .
A prominent climate scientist , Mike Hulme , provided a profound analysis in Why We Disagree About Climate Change , in terms of complexity and uncertainty .
But since legitimate disagreement was deemed nonexistent , he too was ignored .
To have a political effect , the ‘ extended peers ’ of science have traditionally needed to operate largely by means of activist pressure - groups using the media to create public alarm .
In this case , since the global warmers had captured the moral high ground , criticism has remained scattered and ineffective , except on the blogosphere .
The position of Green activists is especially difficult , even tragic ; they have been ‘ extended peers ’ who were co-opted into the ruling paradigm , which in retrospect can be seen as a decoy or diversion from the real , complex issues of sustainability , as shown by Mike Hulme .
Now they must do some very serious re-thinking about their position and their role .
The importance of the new media of communications in mass politics , as in the various ‘ rainbow revolutions ’ is well attested .
To understand how the power - politics of science have changed in the case of Climategate , we can take a story from the book Here Comes Everybody by Clay Shirkey .
There were two incidents in the Boston U.S.A. diocese of the Roman Catholic Church , involving the shuffling of paeodophile priests around parishes .
The first time , there was a criminal prosecution , with full exposure in the press , and then nothing happened .
The second time , the outraged parents got on their cell phones and organised ; and eventually Cardinal Archbishop Bernard Francis Law ( who had started as a courageous cleric in the ‘ 60 ’s ) had to leave for Rome in disgrace .
The Climategate affair shows the importance of the new IT for science , as an empowerment of the extended peer community .
The well - known principle , ‘ knowledge is power ’ has its obverse , ‘ ignorance is impotence ’ .
And ignorance is maintained , or eventually overcome , by a variety of socio- technical means .
With the invention of cheap printing on paper , the Bible could be widely read , and heretics became Reformers .
The social activity of science as we know it expanded and grew through the age of printing .
But knowledge was never entirely free , and the power - politics of scientific legitimacy remained quite stable for centuries .
The practice of science has generally been restricted to a social elite and its occasional recruits , as it requires a prior academic education and a sufficiency of leisure and of material resources .
With the new information technology , all that is changing rapidly .
As we see from the ‘ open source ’ movement , many people play an active role in enjoyable technological development in the spare time that their job allows or even encourages .
Moreover , all over IT there are blogs that exercise quality control on the industry ’s productions .
In this new knowledge industry , the workers can be as competent as the technicians and bosses .
The new technologies of information enable the diffusion of scientific competence and the sharing of unofficial information , and hence give power to peer communities that are extended far beyond the Ph.D.s in the relevant subject - specialty .
The most trenchant and effective critics of the ‘ hockey stick ’ statistics were a University - employed economist and a computer expert .
Like any other technology , IT is many - faceted .
It is easily misused and abused , and much of the content of the blogosphere is trivial or worse .
The right - wing political agendas of some climate sceptics , their bloggers and their backers , are quite well known .
But to use their background or motivation as an excuse for ignoring their arguments , is a betrayal of science .
The blogosphere interacts with other media of communication , in the public and scientific domains .
Some parts are quite mainstream , others not .
The Climategate blogosphere is as varied in quality as any other .
Some leading scholars , like Roger Pielke , Jr. have had personal blogs for a long time .
Some blogs are carefully monitored , have a large readership and are sampled by the mainstream media ( such as the one on which this is posted , Wattsupwiththat.com ) .
Others are less rigorous ; but the same variation in quality can be found in the nominally peer - reviewed scientific literature .
Keeping up with the blogosphere requires different skills from keeping up with traditional literature ; it is most useful to find a summarising blog that fits one ’s special interests , as well as a loyal correspondent , as ( in my case ) Roger ‘ tallbloke ’ Tattersall .
Some mainstream publications are now saying nice things about the blogosphere .
Had such sentiments been expressed a while ago , the critical voices might have had a public hearing and the Climategate scandal might have been exposed before it became entrenched so disastrously .
And now the critical blogosphere does not need to be patronised .
Like any extension of political power , whether it be the right to believe , to protest , to vote , to form trades unions , or to be educated , it can lead to instabilities and abuses .
But now the extended peer community has a technological base , and the power - politics of science will be different .
I cannot predict how it will work out , but we can be confident that corruptions built on bootstrapped plausibility will be less likely in the future .
There is an important philosophical dimension to Climategate , a question of the relation of personal scientific ethics to objective scientific facts .
The problem is created by the traditional image of science ( as transmitted in scientific education ) as ‘ value - free ’ .
The personal commitments to integrity , that are necessary for the maintenance of scientific quality , receive no mention in the dominant philosophy of science .
Kuhn ’s disenchanted picture of science was so troubling to the idealists ( as Popper ) because in his ‘ normal ’ science criticism had hardly any role .
For Kuhn , even the Mertonian principles of ethical behaviour were effectively dismissed as irrelevant .
Was this situation truly ‘ normal ’ – meaning either average or ( worse ) appropriate ?
The examples of shoddy science exposed by the Climategate convey a troubling impression .
From the record , it appears that in this case , criticism and a sense of probity needed to be injected into the system by the extended peer community from the ( mainly ) external blogosphere .
The total assurance of the mainstream scientists in their own correctness and in the intellectual and moral defects of their critics , is now in retrospect perceived as arrogance .
For their spokespersons to continue to make light of the damage to the scientific case , and to ignore the ethical dimension of Climategate , is to risk public outrage at a perceived unreformed arrogance .
If there is a continuing stream of ever more detailed revelations , originating in the blogosphere but now being brought to a broader public , then the credibility of the established scientific authorities will continue to erode .
Do we face the prospect of the IPCC reports being totally dismissed as just more dodgy dossiers , and of hitherto trusted scientists being accused of negligence or worse ?
There will be those who with their own motives will be promoting such a picture .
How can it be refuted ?
And what about the issue itself ?
Are we really experiencing Anthropogenic Carbon - based Global Warming ?
If the public loses faith in that claim , then the situation of science in our society will be altered for the worse .
There is very unlikely to be a crucial experience that either confirms or refutes the claim ; the post - normal situation is just too complex .
The consensus is likely to depend on how much trust can still be put in science .
The whole vast edifice of policy commitments for Carbon reduction , with their many policy prescriptions and quite totalitarian moral exhortations , will be at risk of public rejection .
What sort of chaos would then result ?
The consequences for science in our civilisation would be extraordinary .
To the extent that the improved management of uncertainty and ignorance can remedy the situation , some useful tools are at hand .
In the Netherlands , scholars and scientists have developed ‘ Knowledge Quality Assessment ’ methodologies for characterising uncertainty in ways that convey the richness of the phenomenon while still performing well as robust tools of analysis and communication .
Elsewhere , scholars are exploring methods for managing disagreement among scientists , so that such post - normal issues do not need to become so disastrously polarised .
A distinguished scholar , Sheila Jasanoff , has called for a culture of humility among scientists , itself a radical move towards a vision of a non-violent science .
Scientists who have been forced to work on the blogosphere have had the invaluable experience of exclusion and oppression ; that could make it easier for them to accept that something is seriously wrong and then to engage in the challenging moral adventures of dealing with uncertainty and ignorance .
The new technologies of communications are revolutionising knowledge and power in many areas .
The extended peer community of science on the blogosphere will be playing its part in that process .
Let dialogue commence !

Looks like the goods - govt job ratio peaked around 3:1 in the 30 ’s - 40’s .
Now there are far more government jobs than goods - producing ones .
Pretty damn shocking .
It should be obvious to anyone with a pulse that an economy based on government jobs , deficit spending , zombie banks , moral hazard , and cheap imports is not sustainable .
I had a friend who worked at the Dept of Labor .
The agency ’s ironic name was a running joke .
Apparently people spent most of their time surfing the net , even running Ebay businesses out of their cubes .
That ’s what happens in low - accountability work environments .
And it ’s why government spending is always less efficient than the private sector .
These low or zero- accountability jobs are taking over our economy , and it ’s not just government .
We ’re removing accountability and responsibility from all sorts of industries — especially banks , autos , and real estate .
But this support really only goes to the politically connected .
Businesses who do n’t donate generously to their local reps can drop dead .
Welcome to the Kleptocracy .
I ’m taking advantage of this “ recovery ” to prepare for the inevitable funding crisis ahead .

In 1959 , the British man John Crawford was convicted of “ buggery , ” the crime of having sex with another man .
He was 19 at the time , and says he confessed to the crime only after weeks of jailhouse beatings and sleep deprivation .
Today , he is 70 , and homosexual sex has not been much of a punishable crime there since 1967 , when the British parliament repealed the Sexual Offences
Act of 1956 , though it took until 2004 for all buggery laws to be wiped clean .
It ’s a criminal history he learned about eight years ago , when he applied for a volunteer job at a prison , and remains legally required to disclose to employers at jobs where he would work with “ vulnerable ” people , such as the infirm ; he does this now , as a volunteer at a hospital .
And unless Britain ’s justice department removes the stipulation of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Exceptions Order of 1975 , he will sue , arguing Crawford ’s sexuality is still being used to discriminate against him .
It should n’t have to go that far , but should it , we wish Crawford the very , very best in his case .
SilverStone ’s HDDBoost aims to pair an SSD and hard disk to deliver the best attributes of both devices ( that ’s speed and loads of storage , just in case you ’ve been asleep for the last two years )
SilverStone has just announced its HDDBoost , a device that teams an SSD with a hard disk .
The aim is to offer the incredibly fast data access speeds typical of SSDs with the high capacity of a hard disk but to make it easy to use , so both appear as a single storage device in Windows .
Essentially , the HDDBoost uses an SSD as an huge cache for your hard disk , theoretically delivering the best of both technologies with no compromise .
This sounds almost as magical as the Lucid Hydra , but with a much better chance of success .
The device takes the form of a 2.5 in to 3.5 in hard disk caddy with a couple of SATA connectors on the end .
These connectors allow you to daisy - chain the hard disk to the SSD , and then connect the caddy to your motherboard .
As usual , images are better than words for explaining weird layouts , so here you go :
In order to appear as one storage device in Windows , SilverStone has needed to use some software to con the OS .
As soon as you install the HDDBoost , it performs a mirror backup of the most commonly used hard disk files to the SSD .
In SilverStone ’s own words : " Once the SSD has all the priority data from the hard disk , the HDDBoost storage controller sets the data read priority to the SSD , telling Windows to favour the SSD when possible .
This makes the storage sub-system as fast as the SSD , but with all the storage space of the hard disk .
Some software is needed to achieve the magic , but the HDDBoost looks like one of the most innovative yet practical products we ’ve seen in ages .
It ’s due for release on19 February 2010 , and set to cost € 33 ( exc VAT ) in Europe .
We hope to have one in the Labs for testing soon to see if it all works .
In the meantime , take a look at SilverStone ’s flashy , er , Flash animations of the HDDBoost in action and let us know your thoughts in the forums
There 's confusion as to whether the SSDBoost requires software or not .
The above slide from the press release says not , but a subsequent slide from the same release talks about a ' Special Software Utility '.
We 've asked SilverStone for clarification , but we may need to wait until we get our hands on a sample to know what the situation is .
Stay tuned !

snake oil salesman steals deepak chopra ’s act
Mike Adams borrows the King of Woo 's strategy of stringing a Gish Gallop of junk science to better sell his supplements and pamphlets .
Illustration by Sven Prim
When last we left professional snake oil salesman and celebrity vulture Mike Adams , he was in the middle of an odd hybrid of a eulogy and a sales pitch after Patrick Swayze ’s death from pancreatic cancer , claiming his diet of garlic and carrots could knock out the Grim Reaper himself .
Now , after going berserk that an award for medical Twitter feeds is out of his hands , he decided to follow the path of all cranks after a setback and steal one of Deepak Chopra ’s recent routines .
Basically , it consists of hurling out condescending and painfully ill - informed stereotypes of skeptics and scientists , collecting them into a long stream of accusations and listing them as a supposed exposition of the true beliefs of his hated enemies .
Oh and keep in mind , if you like his rants , make sure you go to his South American health resort to learn super secret natural health techniques that Big Pharma does n’t want you to know and you too can laugh in death ’s face before kicking it to the curb .
Look , it ’s one thing to list the beliefs of people with who you disagree .
It can even be an invaluable lesson for those who want to understand both sides of a debate .
But Adams is n’t interested in anything but the voices in his head and lacking Chopra ’s skills in ephemeral technobabble and eloquence , his litany of the evil ideas of those who dare doubt his brilliance in all medical and pharmacological methods reads more like a spit in the face by an angry zealot .
Oh and there are no links or sources to support his assertions , but that ’s just fine .
His fans take his word as absolute truth after applying their double standard to nonsense like this …
Skeptics believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective ( even if they ’ve never been tested ) , that ALL people should be vaccinated , even against their will , and that there is NO LIMIT to the number of vaccines a person can be safely given .
Yes , we ’re all slavish believers in the magic of vaccines , so much so that the FDA requires testing of any new or modified vaccines before they ’re approved and vaccines that fail to show at least 70 % efficacy are deemed to be mediocre at best and usually discarded .
Vaccines have also been pulled from the market the minute we hear a report about a statistically notable side - effect which has been shown to be linked to vaccines .
And just to make this accusation a perfect example of Adams ’ glaring hypocrisy , we should note that his regimens and concoctions have never been clinically tested due to his paranoid fear of an FDA conspiracy against him , but he assures that everything he sells is 100 % safe and 100 % effective .
Pot , this is kettle , come in pot …
Skeptics believe that fluoride chemicals derived from the scrubbers of coal - fired power plants are really good for human health .
They ’re so good , in fact , that they should be dumped into the water supply so that everyone is forced to drink those chemicals , regardless of their current level [s ] of exposure to fluoride from other sources .
And his source for the origin of fluoride in our drinking water are what again ?
Ah , right .
He does n’t need any of those pesky sources because that ’s what skeptics use .
Other than that , it seems like a perfectly rational and reasonable stance to say that a successful attempt to reduce tooth decay in developed nations is just voodoo by polluters and ignoramuses .
Plus since no one has access to commercial water filters sold for a few bucks at your nearest supermarket , we ’re all absolutely forced to drink these evil chemicals .
Ok , no , not really .
Skeptics believe that many six - month - old infants need antidepressant drugs .
In fact , they believe that people of all ages can take an unlimited number of drugs at the same time : Antidepressants , cholesterol drugs , blood pressure drugs , diabetes drugs , anti-anxiety drugs , sleeping drugs and more — simultaneously !
Mike , you ’re been talking to those strange voices a wee bit too long since just going down to a pharmacy could prove this assertion as nothing more than ignorant tripe .
If it was really safe to give kids the same medication as adults , why would there be lower dose pediatric formulations ?
And if it was really safe to give people all the drugs in the world at the same time , why do pharmacy technicians try as hard as they can to flag adverse drug interactions and warn patients and doctors if taking an anti-depressant and painkillers could be dangerous ?
Skeptics believe the human body has no ability to defend itself against invading microorganisms and that the only things that can save people from viral infections are vaccines .
And the parade of blithering inanity rolls on .
There are some 1,300 bacteria and viruses that cause disease and yet , vaccines only tackle a tiny percentage of them .
Plus , what is the scientific approach to colds and flu- like diseases ?
Take some pills to soothe the symptoms while your body kicks that virus ’ microscopic tail end with killer T cells .
Vaccinations are designed to prevent diseases that can cause lifelong complications or we simply can’t handle on our own as history has shown .
Oh and here ’s the kicker .
Vaccines work only because we have such a powerful immune system since instead of defending us from disease directly they … wait for it … train our immune system how to kill them more effectively .
If skeptics really believed the nonsense which resides the dusty cobwebs of Mike ’s underutilized mind , there would be no scientific rationale for vaccines in the first place .
This is n’t just a hit and a miss .
This is not even wrong .
Skeptics believe that pregnancy is a disease and childbirth is a medical crisis .
( They ’re opponents of natural childbirth . )
I wonder , does he mean that kind of natural childbirth that was one of the biggest killers of women until we ’ve mastered the germ theory of disease and sanitary practices ?
The kind that was insanely dangerous for both the mother and the baby by modern standards ?
And if women deliver babies safely and with much less pain , how could it possibly harm the child to be born into a medically advanced world that has cures for many of the things that will ail him or her throughout the next 70 to 80 years , vs. the 40 to 50 less than a century ago ?
Mike is just being an idiot at this point .
Sorry , I meant more of an idiot .
Skeptics do not believe in hypnosis .
This is especially hilarious since they are all prime examples of people who are easily hypnotized by mainstream influences .
As opposed to the alt med faithful who believe that anything advertised with the words “ natural ” or “ organic ” is immediately safer , better and more effective than medication that spent a decade in testing , development and had a successful public release ?
No , this is not another case of projection that would make Freud himself rise from his grave , point his bony finger at Adams and yell “ aha ! ” to today ’s psychologists .
Not at all …
There ’s more nonsense in the article but as you can see , every single statement is utterly wrong in ways that lets me know that if facts came to life in the form of a vicious dog and slammed its jaws around his nose , Mike would n’t recognize them if he used every working brain cell left in the wet tissue between his ears .
But hey , he makes a good living off lying , scamming and slandering those who have the audacity to challenge his ideas so he really does n’t have to be intellectually honest or scientifically sound as long as he issues the good old Quack Miranda of the DSHEA and vomits forth woefully ignorant and ridiculous caricatures of all his doubters .
Until someone gets hurt and sues him for selling worthless cures and lying through his teeth that is …

Currently , a few errors –and supposed errors– in the last IPCC report ( “ AR4 ” ) are making the media rounds – together with a lot of distortion and professional spin by parties interested in discrediting climate science .
Time for us to sort the wheat from the chaff : which of these putative errors are real , and which not ?
And what does it all mean , for the IPCC in particular , and for climate science more broadly ?
Let ’s start with a few basic facts about the IPCC .
The IPCC is not , as many people seem to think , a large organization .
In fact , it has only 10 full - time staff in its secretariat at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva , plus a few staff in four technical support units that help the chairs of the three IPCC working groups and the national greenhouse gas inventories group .
The actual work of the IPCC is done by unpaid volunteers – thousands of scientists at universities and research institutes around the world who contribute as authors or reviewers to the completion of the IPCC reports .
A large fraction of the relevant scientific community is thus involved in the effort .
The three working groups are :
Working Group 1 ( WG1 ) , which deals with the physical climate science basis , as assessed by the climatologists , including several of the Realclimate authors .
Working Group 2 ( WG2 ) , which deals with impacts of climate change on society and ecosystems , as assessed by social scientists , ecologists , etc .
Working Group 3 ( WG3 ) , which deals with mitigation options for limiting global warming , as assessed by energy experts , economists , etc .
Assessment reports are published every six or seven years and writing them takes about three years .
Each working group publishes one of the three volumes of each assessment .
The focus of the recent allegations is the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) , which was published in 2007 .
Its three volumes are almost a thousand pages each , in small print .
They were written by over 450 lead authors and 800 contributing authors ; most were not previous IPCC authors .
There are three stages of review involving more than 2,500 expert reviewers who collectively submitted 90,000 review comments on the drafts .
These , together with the authors ’ responses to them , are all in the public record ( see here and here for WG1 and WG2 respectively ) .
Errors in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 )
As far as we ’re aware , so far only one–or at most two–legitimate errors have been found in the AR4 :
Himalayan glaciers :
In a regional chapter on Asia in Volume 2 , written by authors from the region , it was erroneously stated that 80 % of Himalayan glacier area would very likely be gone by 2035 .
This is of course not the proper IPCC projection of future glacier decline , which is found in Volume 1 of the report .
There we find a 45 - page , perfectly valid chapter on glaciers , snow and ice ( Chapter 4 ) , with the authors including leading glacier experts ( such as our colleague Georg Kaser from Austria , who first discovered the Himalaya error in the WG2 report ) .
There are also several pages on future glacier decline in Chapter 10 ( “ Global Climate Projections ” ) , where the proper projections are used e.g. to estimate future sea level rise .
So the problem here is not that the IPCC ’s glacier experts made an incorrect prediction .
The problem is that a WG2 chapter , instead of relying on the proper IPCC projections from their WG1 colleagues , cited an unreliable outside source in one place .
Fixing this error involves deleting two sentences on page 493 of the WG2 report .
Sea level in the Netherlands :
The WG2 report states that “ The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea - level rise and river flooding because 55 % of its territory is below sea level ” .
This sentence was provided by a Dutch government agency – the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency , which has now published a correction stating that the sentence should have read “ 55 per cent of the Netherlands is at risk of flooding ; 26 per cent of the country is below sea level , and 29 per cent is susceptible to river flooding ” .
It surely will go down as one of the more ironic episodes in its history when the Dutch parliament last Monday derided the IPCC , in a heated debate , for printing information provided by … the Dutch government .
In addition , the IPCC notes that there are several definitions of the area below sea level .
The Dutch Ministry of Transport uses the figure 60 % ( below high water level during storms ) , while others use 30 % ( below mean sea level ) .
Needless to say , the actual number mentioned in the report has no bearing on any IPCC conclusions and has nothing to do with climate science , and it is questionable whether it should even be counted as an IPCC error .
Some other issues
African crop yields :
The IPCC Synthesis Report states : “ By 2020 , in some countries , yields from rain - fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 % . ”
This is properly referenced back to chapter 9.4 of WG2 , which says : “ In other countries , additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion , deficiencies in yields from rain - fed agriculture of up to 50 % during the 2000 - 2020 period , and reductions in crop growth period ( Agoumi , 2003 ) . ”
The Agoumi reference is correct and reported correctly .
The Sunday Times , in an article by Jonathan Leake , labels this issue “ Africagate ” – the main criticism being that Agoumi ( 2003 ) is not a peer - reviewed study ( see below for our comments on “ gray ” literature ) , but a report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Climate Change Knowledge Network , funded by the US Agency for International Development .
The report , written by Morroccan climate expert Professor Ali Agoumi , is a summary of technical studies and research conducted to inform Initial National Communications from three countries ( Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and is a perfectly legitimate IPCC reference .
It is noteworthy that chapter 9.4 continues with “ However , there is the possibility that adaptation could reduce these negative effects ( Benhin , 2006 ) . ”
Some examples thereof follow , and then it states : “ However , not all changes in climate and climate variability will be negative , as agriculture and the growing seasons in certain areas ( for example , parts of the Ethiopian highlands and parts of southern Africa such as Mozambique ) , may lengthen under climate change , due to a combination of increased temperature and rainfall changes ( Thornton et al. , 2006 ) .
Mild climate scenarios project further benefits across African croplands for irrigated and , especially , dryland farms . ”
( Incidentally , the Benhin and Thornton references are also “ gray ” , but nobody has complained about them .
Could there be double standards amongst the IPCC ’s critics ? )
Chapter 9.4 to us sounds like a balanced discussion of potential risks and benefits , based on the evidence available at the time–hardly the stuff for shrill “ Africagate ! ” cries .
If the IPCC can be criticized here , it is that in condensing these results for its Synthesis Report , important nuance and qualification were lost – especially the point that the risk of drought ( defined as a 50 % downturn in rainfall ) “ could be exacerbated by climate change ” , as chapter 9.4 wrote – rather than being outright caused by climate change .
Trends in disaster losses : Jonathan Leake ( again ) in The Sunday Times accused the IPCC of wrongly linking global warming to natural disasters .
The IPCC in a statement points out errors in Leake ’s “ misleading and baseless story ” , and maintains that the IPCC provided “ a balanced treatment of a complicated and important issue ” .
While we agree with the IPCC here , WG2 did include a debatable graph provided by Robert Muir - Wood ( although not in the main report but only as Supplementary Material ) .
It cited a paper by Muir - Wood as its source although that paper does n’t include the graph , only the analysis that it is based on .
Muir - Wood himself has gone on record to say that the IPCC has fairly represented his research findings and that it was appropriate to include them in the report .
In our view there is no IPCC error here ; at best there is a difference of opinion .
Obviously , not every scientist will always agree with assessments made by the IPCC author teams .
Amazon forest dieback : Leake ( yet again ) , with “ research ” by skeptic Richard North , has also promoted “ Amazongate ” with a story regarding a WG2 statement on the future of Amazonian forests under a drying climate .
The contested IPCC statement reads : “ Up to 40 % of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation ; this means that the tropical vegetation , hydrology and climate system in South America could change very rapidly to another steady state , not necessarily producing gradual changes between the current and the future situation ( Rowell and Moore , 2000 ) . ”
Leake ’s problem is with the Rowell and Moore reference , a WWF report .
The roots of the story are in two blog pieces by North , in which he first claims that the IPCC assertions attributed to the WWF report are not actually in that report .
Since this claim was immediately shown to be false , North then argued that the WWF report ’s basis for their statement ( a 1999 Nature article by Nepstad et al. ) dealt only with the effects of logging and fire –not drought– on Amazonian forests .
To these various claims Nepstad has now responded , noting that the IPCC statement is in fact correct .
The only issue is that the IPCC cited the WWF report rather than the underlying peer - reviewed papers by Nepstad et al .
These studies actually provide the basis for the IPCC ’s estimate on Amazonian sensitivity to drought .
Investigations of the correspondence between Leake , scientists , and a BBC reporter ( see here and here and here ) show that Leake ignored or misrepresented explanatory information given to him by Nepstad and another expert , Simon Lewis , and published his incorrect story anyway .
This “ issue ” is thus completely without merit .
Gray literature :
The IPCC cites 18,000 references in the AR4 ; the vast majority of these are peer - reviewed scientific journal papers .
The IPCC maintains a clear guideline on the responsible use of so - called “ gray ” literature , which are typically reports by other organizations or governments .
Especially for Working Groups 2 and 3 ( but in some cases also for 1 ) it is indispensable to use gray sources , since many valuable data are published in them : reports by government statistics offices , the International Energy Agency , World Bank , UNEP and so on .
This is particularly true when it comes to regional impacts in the least developed countries , where knowledgeable local experts exist who have little chance , or impetus , to publish in international science journals .
Reports by non-governmental organizations like the WWF can be used ( as in the Himalaya glacier and Amazon forest cases ) but any information from them needs to be carefully checked ( this guideline was not followed in the former case ) .
After all , the role of the IPCC is to assess information , not just compile anything it finds .
Assessment involves a level of critical judgment , double - checking , weighing supporting and conflicting pieces of evidence , and a critical appreciation of the methodology used to obtain the results .
That is why leading researchers need to write the assessment reports – rather than say , hiring graduate students to compile a comprehensive literature review .
Media distortions
To those familiar with the science and the IPCC ’s work , the current media discussion is in large part simply absurd and surreal .
Journalists who have never even peeked into the IPCC report are now outraged that one wrong number appears on page 493 of Volume 2 .
We ’ve met TV teams coming to film a report on the IPCC reports ’ errors , who were astonished when they held one of the heavy volumes in hand , having never even seen it .
They told us frankly that they had no way to make their own judgment ; they could only report what they were being told about it .
And there are well - organized lobby forces with proper PR skills that make sure these journalists are being told the “ right ” story .
That explains why some media stories about what is supposedly said in the IPCC reports can easily be falsified simply by opening the report and reading .
Unfortunately , as a broad - based volunteer effort with only minimal organizational structure the IPCC is not in a good position to rapidly counter misinformation .
One near - universal meme of the media stories on the Himalaya mistake was that this was “ one of the most central predictions of the IPCC ” – apparently in order to make the error look more serious than it was .
However , this prediction does not appear in any of the IPCC Summaries for Policy Makers , nor in the Synthesis Report ( which at least partly explains why it went unnoticed for years ) .
None of the media reports that we saw properly explained that Volume 1 ( which is where projections of physical climate changes belong ) has an extensive and entirely valid discussion of glacier loss .
What apparently has happened is that interested quarters , after the Himalyan glacier story broke , have sifted through the IPCC volumes with a fine - toothed comb , hoping to find more embarrassing errors .
They have actually found precious little , but the little they did find was promptly hyped into Seagate , Africagate , Amazongate and so on .
This has some similarity to the CRU email theft , where precious little was discovered from among thousands of emails , but a few sentences were plucked out of context , deliberately misinterpreted ( like “ hide the decline ” ) and then hyped into “ Climategate ” .
As lucidly analysed by Tim Holmes , there appear to be a few active leaders of this misinformation parade in the media .
Jonathan Leake is carrying the ball on this , but his stories contain multiple errors , misrepresentations and misquotes .
There also is a sizeable contingent of me - too journalism that is simply repeating the stories but not taking the time to form a well - founded view on the topics .
Typically they report on various “ allegations ” , such as these against the IPCC , similar to reporting that the CRU email hack lead to “ allegations of data manipulation ” .
Technically it is n’t even wrong that there were such allegations .
But is n’t it the responsibility of the media to actually investigate whether allegations have any merit before they decide to repeat them ?
Leake incidentally attacked the scientific work of one of us ( Stefan ) in a Sunday Times article in January .
This article was rather biased and contained some factual errors that Stefan asked to be corrected .
He has received no response , nor was any correction made .
Two British scientists quoted by Leake – Jonathan Gregory and Simon Holgate – independently wrote to Stefan after the article appeared to say they had been badly misquoted .
One of them wrote that the experience with Leake had made him “ reluctant to speak to any journalist about any subject at all ” .
Does the IPCC need to change ?
The IPCC has done a very good job so far , but certainly there is room for improvement .
The review procedures could be organized better , for example .
Until now , anyone has been allowed to review any part of the IPCC drafts they liked , but there was no coordination in the sense that say , a glacier expert was specifically assigned to double - check parts of the WG2 chapter on Asia .
Such a practice would likely have caught the Himalayan glacier mistake .
Another problem has been that reports of all three working groups had to be completed nearly at the same time , making it hard for WG2 to properly base their discussions on the conclusions and projections from WG1 .
This has already been improved on for the AR5 , for which the WG2 report can be completed six months after the WG1 report .
Also , these errors revealed that the IPCC had no mechanism to publish errata .
Since a few errors will inevitably turn up in a 2800 - page report , obviously an avenue is needed to publish errata as soon as errors are identified .
Is climate science sound ?
In some media reports the impression has been given that even the fundamental results of climate change science are now in question , such as whether humans are in fact changing the climate , causing glacier melt , sea level rise and so on .
The IPCC does not carry out primary research , and hence any mistakes in the IPCC reports do not imply that any climate research itself is wrong .
A reference to a poor report or an editorial lapse by IPCC authors obviously does not undermine climate science .
Doubting basic results of climate science based on the recent claims against the IPCC is particularly ironic since none of the real or supposed errors being discussed are even in the Working Group 1 report , where the climate science basis is laid out .
To be fair to our colleagues from WG2 and WG3 , climate scientists do have a much simpler task .
The system we study is ruled by the well - known laws of physics , there is plenty of hard data and peer - reviewed studies , and the science is relatively mature .
The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Fourier , the heat trapping properties of CO2 and other gases were first measured by Tyndall in 1859 , the climate sensitivity to CO2 was first computed in 1896 by Arrhenius , and by the 1950s the scientific foundations were pretty much understood .
Do the above issues suggest “ politicized science ” , deliberate deceptions or a tendency towards alarmism on the part of IPCC ?
We do not think there is any factual basis for such allegations .
To the contrary , large groups of ( inherently cautious ) scientists attempting to reach a consensus in a societally important collaborative document is a prescription for reaching generally “ conservative ” conclusions .
And indeed , before the recent media flash broke out , the real discussion amongst experts was about the AR4 having underestimated , not exaggerated , certain aspects of climate change .
These include such important topics as sea level rise and sea ice decline ( see the sea ice and sea level chapters of the Copenhagen Diagnosis ) , where the data show that things are changing faster than the IPCC expected .
Overall then , the IPCC assessment reports reflect the state of scientific knowledge very well .
There have been a few isolated errors , and these have been acknowledged and corrected .
What is seriously amiss is something else : the public perception of the IPCC , and of climate science in general , has been massively distorted by the recent media storm .
All of these various “ gates ” – Climategate , Amazongate , Seagate , Africagate , etc. , do not represent scandals of the IPCC or of climate science .
Rather , they are the embarrassing battle - cries of a media scandal , in which a few journalists have misled the public with grossly overblown or entirely fabricated pseudogates , and many others have naively and willingly followed along without seeing through the scam .
It is not up to us as climate scientists to clear up this mess – it is up to the media world itself to put this right again , e.g. by publishing proper analysis pieces like the one of Tim Holmes and by issuing formal corrections of their mistaken reporting .
We will follow with great interest whether the media world has the professional and moral integrity to correct its own errors .
PS .
A new book by Realclimate - authors David Archer and Stefan Rahmstorf critically discussing the main findings of the AR4 ( all three volumes ) is just out : The Climate Crisis .
None of the real or alleged errors are in this book , since none of those contentious statements plucked from the thousands of pages appeared to be “ main findings ” that needed to be discussed in a 250 - page summary .
PPS .
Same thing for Mike ’s book Dire Predictions : Understanding Global Warming , which bills itself as “ The illustrated guide to the findings of the IPCC ” .
Or Gavin ’s “ Climate Change : Picturing the Science ” – which does include a few pictures of disappearing glaciers though !
Update 24 March : Simon Lewis has made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about Leake ’s Amazon story .
Update 29 March : IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri has published an interesting article in the Guardian .
The first U.S. clinical trials in more than 20 years on the medical efficacy of marijuana found that pot helps relieve pain and muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and certain neurological conditions , according to a report released Wednesday by a UC research center .
The results of five state - funded scientific clinical trials came 14 years after California voters passed a law approving marijuana for medical use and more than 10 years after the state Legislature passed a law that created the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at UC San Diego , which conducted the studies .
Dr. Igor Grant , a UC San Diego psychiatrist who directs the center , called the report " good evidence " that marijuana would be an effective front - line treatment for neuropathy , a condition that can cause tingling , numbness and pain .
" We focused on illnesses where current medical treatment does not provide adequate relief or coverage of symptoms , " Grant said .
" These findings provide a strong science - based context in which policymakers and the public can begin discussing the place of cannabis in medical care . "
Despite California 's passage in 1996 of Proposition 215 , which allows patients with a valid doctor 's recommendation to grow and possess marijuana for personal medical use , the federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug with no medical use and has closed pot clubs and prosecuted suppliers .
Thirteen other states have passed similar measures legalizing medical marijuana .
Proponents of medical marijuana see Wednesday 's news as the turning of the tide for what they hope would become federal acceptance of pot 's therapeutic benefits .
A first step
" This is the first step in approaching the ( U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) , which has invested absolutely nothing in providing scientific data to resolve the debate , " said state Sen .
Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , who noted that marijuana showed benefits throughout the AIDS epidemic in helping people afflicted with neuropathy and other ailments .
Dale Gieringer , a Berkeley resident who is executive director of the California branch of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , agreed .
" This is finally the evidence that shows that the ( U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ) stance that marijuana does not have medical use is just wrong , " he said .
" It 's time for the Obama administration to act . "
During the study , volunteers were randomly given marijuana or placebos .
The marijuana was obtained through the University of Mississippi , which has a contract with the federal government to provide the only pot that can be used for scientific research .
Grant said the research required heavy federal oversight .
Long - term issues
He noted volunteers had the same amount of pain reduction with low doses of THC , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , compared with high doses of THC .
He also said evidence casts doubt on long - term negative impacts of marijuana use , while acknowledging there have not been formal studies on the question .
" There is not very strong evidence that marijuana , for example , produces emphysema or lung cancer or permanent brain damage , " Grant said .
That does n't mean marijuana is harmless , he said .
" Anything you smoke in a combustible form has potential risks , but the safety profile seems to be better for it than some other drugs like tobacco , " he said .
The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research has approved 15 clinical studies , five of which were completed and reported Wednesday , and two are in progress .
While researchers said more studies are needed , the future of the center is in doubt .
The center has spent all but $ 400,000 of the $ 8.9 million in research funding it started with in 1999 .
Leno said the state does n't have the money to continue funding it .
" It may be close to the end of its life unless there 's foundation money to continue the work , " Leno said .
Pope ' wanted to demonstrate his forgiveness '
Pope Benedict XVI has had a meeting with the mentally disturbed woman who knocked him over at Mass on Christmas Eve , and has forgiven her .
Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the woman , Susanna Maiolo , told the Pope she was sorry for what had happened .
Father Lombardi added that the Pope expressed " his interest and best wishes " for her health .
The Vatican is continuing a legal case against Ms Maiolo .
She and her family met Pope Benedict in a private audience at the end of his general audience , Father Lombardi said in a statement .
The Pope inquired about Ms Maiolo 's health and " wanted to demonstrate his forgiveness " .
The Vatican said no photographs or video would be released of the meeting .
The Roman Catholic world was shocked by the attack , in which Ms Maiolo leapt over a barrier at St Peter 's Basilica and brought the 82 - year - old Pope to the ground at the beginning of the Mass .
She was quickly overpowered and Pope Benedict , who was not injured , proceeded with the service .
Ms Maiolo was treated at a psychiatric clinic outside Rome after the incident , and was released on Saturday .
There are no tour dates available at the moment .
The Southern Metropolis newspaper said a man from the southern city of Dongguan recently had his phone blocked .
China Mobile ’s customer service told him their computers had detected lewd words in his messages and that he would have to take his identity card to the police to reactivate the phone .
He also had to furnish a letter guaranteeing that he would no longer spread inappropriate messages .
The tallest Arab ever wanted dead or alive by a president of the United States is still at large .
Either that or he ’s dead .
Again .
We ’ve been hearing from intelligence sources and the media that bin Laden is dead for a long time .
How dead can one evildoer get ?
In July 2002 the New York Times carried an op - ed piece that led with " Osama bin Laden is dead . "
Bin Laden died in December 2001 , according to the author , Amir Taheri , an editor of the Paris - based journal Politique Internationale .
Both Taheri and his journal have been broadly accused of questionable journalism practices .
Taheri ’s sources – all unnamed except for then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , who " repeated " the information – were n’t any more reliable than Taheri is , but he ultimately based his conclusion on logic .
" With an ego the size of Mount Everest , " Taheri reasoned , " Osama bin Laden would not have , could not have , remained silent for so long if he were still alive . "
And what of all the videos of bin Laden that have surfaced between 2001 and now ?
David Ray Griffin , whom the BBC identifies as " a former theology professor and member of the 9/11 Truth Movement , " says they ’re false because " None of them can be proven to be authentic . "
These are negative proof arguments , the kind that say , " We ca n’t prove little green men are flying over Nevada in spaceships , but we ca n’t prove they are n’t , so it must be true . "
Live or Memorex ?
As former CIA officer Philip Giraldi noted in December 2009 , analysts " inside and outside the government " base their assessment that bin Laden has found sanctuary in the hereafter on non-evidence : specifically , that they have n’t had any solid information about the al - Qaeda leader since late 2001 .
That puts our intelligence agencies , which have access to more space - age gizmology than any other spy apparatus in the history of espionage , on par with the likes of the conspiracy theorists at WHATREALLYHAPPENED .COM .
According to these folks , bin Laden is dead because unreliable journalist Taheri said so in a New York Times op - ed piece , and because a video released in December 2001 made bin Laden look much older than he did in a photo taken when he was much younger , and because in the video he did n’t move his left side much therefore he must have been suffering from diabetes , and because in November 2001 the UK Guardian revealed that Le Figaro of Paris reported that in 2000 bin Laden had ordered a mobile dialysis machine to be delivered to his base in Afghanistan .
The bin Laden narrative aptly illustrates the extent to which our government institutions have used the big media and polluted the information environment .
Rumor begets hearsay .
Hearsay begets opinion .
Opinion begets unconfirmed facts , unconfirmed facts beget disinformation begets propaganda begets intelligence , and intelligence begets nonexistent weapons of mass destruction .
What makes these convoluted yarns successful is something I call the " grain of truth " factor .
If one or more of the assertions in a far - fetched fable seem plausible , a certain type of person will accept some or all of the rest of the tale because " there ’s a grain of truth in it . "
There is , of course , grain in every pile of horse manure , but that does n’t make horse manure easy to swallow , does it ?
Having said all that , there ’s a fair chance that bin Laden really is dead .
If he ’s hiding along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border high up in the Hindu Kush mountains where helicopters can’t fly , he could have died of a nosebleed by now .
And in November 2008 then CIA Director Michael Hayden said bin Laden was still alive , which adds credence to the argument that he was n’t .
It does n’t matter either way .
Dead or alive , Osama bin Laden is the greatest strategist in the history of human conflict .
With no navy or air force or anything that resembles a formal army , he ’s managed to whip the world ’s mightiest nation like a rented camel .
Our economy is shot , the best - trained , best - equipped military in history has been proven impotent , and our moral standing in the world has gone through the sub - basement .
Speculation about bin Laden ’s status vis -à - vis mortality is little more than a smoke screen to keep the American hoi polloi from focusing on a harsh reality .
A tenet of the Dead Osama Theory says that the Bush administration hid the fact that Osama died in December 2001 to justify continuing the war on terrorism .
President Obama stepped in a boiling vat of OOPS when , as Candidate Obama , he vowed to " get the job done " in Afghanistan to deflect criticism of Sen.
Obama ’s vote against the Iraq surge .
In October 2008 , a month before the election , Obama vowed to " snuff out " bin Laden , and if bin Laden is n’t available for snuffing out because he ’s already snuffed , it gets real hard for Obama to justify the massive Afghanistan escalation that Generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal and the rest of the warmongery strong - armed him into going along with .
Hence , the Obama administration has a vital stake in preserving the belief that bin Laden is still consuming oxygen .
That may explain why , in January 2010 , the FBI published a digital image of how bin Laden looks today on the State Department ’s " Rewards for Justice " Web site .
Shortly afterward , it turned out the picture was an alteration of a web photo of Spanish parliament member Gaspar Llamazares .
Nice try , FBI .
The most recent evidence that bin Laden still lives was the recording al - Jazeera released just before Obama ’s first State of the Union Address in which bin Laden taunted , " God willing , our raids on you will continue as long as your support to the Israelis will continue . "
But the recording was just an audiotape , so maybe the FBI hired Rich Little to do a voice impersonation .
It is little wonder that the status of the man who goaded history ’s mightiest nation has become the stuff of checkout - line tabloids .
The facts of our so - called war on terror are more ludicrous than our fictions , as witnessed by the National Security Agency ’s exploitation of expanded and probably unconstitutional surveillance authorities to eavesdrop on obscene phone calls .
Here ’s the disturbing news : our war on terror has been a colossal blunder regardless of whether bin Laden ’s safe haven is in this world or the next one .
All the king ’s machines and men deployed to far - flung corners of the earth have done little to stem the threat of terrorism , as the Christmas panty bomber illustrated .
Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with bin Laden ’s attack on New York and Washington .
We ’re now discovering , thanks to Gareth Porter of Inter Press Service , that Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban leader we ousted from power in Afghanistan because he gave aid to bin Laden ’s planning of 9/11 , actually attempted to prevent bin Laden from attacking America .
Oops .
Our bad .
Our " struggle against violent extremism " has produced , at a conservative estimate , a minimum of 100,000 civilian deaths in Iraq alone .
The figure may be well over a million .
In 2007 , official Iraqi government statistics showed that the country possessed 5 million orphans .
That ’s a bunch more Iraqi orphans than Saddam Hussein ever made .
Osama bin Laden did n’t need to survive beyond December 2001 to wreak havoc on the United States and the rest of the world .
We ’ve done it for him .
The Royal Institution of Great Britain has always seemed to non-scientists to be one of those features of the British intellectual establishment that exist in a vacuum - sealed glass case .
Impervious to modernity , it was , is and , we assumed , always will be .
Hence the shock last week when news came that the organisation that brings us the children 's Christmas lectures is in deep financial trouble .
And the apparent reason , according to some , is the 200 - year - old institution 's rush to embrace the world of brand , image , marketing and revenue - chasing .
Founded in Mayfair in 1799 by a group of " gentlemen " , including Henry Cavendish , who discovered hydrogen , and its first president , George Finch , eighth Earl of Winchilsea , the institution was to provide an arena for " diffusing the knowledge , and facilitating the general introduction , of useful mechanical inventions and improvements ; and for teaching , by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments , the application of science to the common purposes of life " .

Granted a royal charter in 1800 , it has housed the personal papers of some of Britain 's most influential scientific minds for the past 200 years and has seen 14 of its " residents " win Nobel prizes .
Ten chemical elements were discovered there , among them sodium and potassium by one of the institution 's first chemistry professors , Sir Humphry Davy .
The annual lectures were devised by the scientific luminary Michael Faraday , who conducted his groundbreaking experiments with electricity at the institution .
Designed to bring science to children and young people , they have been held every year since 1825 , stopping only during the Second World War , and have featured the 19th century physicist John Tyndall , Sir David Attenborough , Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins .
When Baroness Susan Greenfield was appointed director 10 years ago , she was the first woman to hold the title .
The Oxford neuroscientist was brought in to " modernise " the institution she branded " charming but fusty " in April 2008 , a month before her controversial project of refurbishment was due to be completed .
In fact , the refit of the historic Faraday Lecture Theatre , a new restaurant and bar , conference facilities and atrium , as well as its new status as a licensed wedding venue , were delayed until October , despite an opening by the Queen in May , after building works overran .
Some members of the governing council and board of trustees expressed concern two years ago when works began at a cost of £ 22 m .
To raise the funds , Lady Greenfield sold off the institution 's entire £ 15 m property portfolio , also in Mayfair , with the aim of enabling it to work as a self - sufficient scientific destination .
But the project ran over budget and did not meet its targets .
Due to the delays , it was forced to relaunch in the middle of the recession , and now the oldest independent scientific research body in the world has found itself in a cash crisis .
Its trustees ' report to the Charity Commission for the financial year to 30 September 2008 stated that it could have coped with any of these negative factors in isolation , but not with all happening at the same time .
As a result , the institution was forced to spend £ 3.2 m from restricted and endowment funds .
The trustees ' report is gloomy .
" If the charity is to continue as a going concern , " it says , " the financial projections for the three years ending 30 September 2011 need to be met ...
There is a significant uncertainty as to whether these projections will be achieved . "
Some tough choices have to be made , and Lady Greenfield might be ousted as director : advisers have said the post should be sacrificed or " much reduced " .
" Fusty " it may once have been , but , with hindsight , it seems that fustiness can have its advantages , not the least of which is solvency .
She is thought to be on the run somewhere in either Mexico or Argentina .
Her drug syndicate was exposed in December last year after a 21 - year - old blew the whistle after being caught with 55kg of cocaine at Buenos Aires airport .
In high school , my friends and I drove some really , really crappy cars .
We knew that they were crap , yet we invested fist fulls of money and months of time into them as if they were going to have a huge payout someday .
Apparently foresight was not taught in school .
Somehow putting $ 1500 of stereo system in a $ 30 car made a lot of sense at that point in our lives .
On the bright side , the cars were so crappy that it allowed our creativity to really shine .
We could do any ridiculous modification that we wanted because the car was worthless to begin with .
If we messed up , it was still a worthless car .
Racing stripes ?
Sure !
Painted windows ?
You Bet !
Backwards seats ?
ummm , yes ?
We learned many valuable life lessons on these cars , and we would n’t have be the same without them .
Pictures above is a friend / coworker ’s high school driven 1983 Olds Delta 88 in the prime of it ’s life .
It was a car that we were proud to cruise in for obvious reasons .
Thank goodness for high school cars .
The looming public spending cuts will be more profound than any experienced in modern times , the head of the spending watchdog warned as he labelled political promises to protect schools and hospitals " insane " .
Steve Bundred told MPs on the Commons public administration committee that the cuts required to reduce the nation 's deficit would be worse than those in the 1970s and 1990s , and urged politicians to " be honest " about their tax and spending plans .
But he maintained that because the cuts followed sustained hikes in spending , billions could be shaved from budgets , and the public sector would still be better funded than it was in 1997 .
Bundred , the head of the Audit Commission , said : " There are further efficiencies to be found in the public sector , undoubtedly , but not just in back - office functions .
I think it 's important in the debate about efficiencies to recognise that there are greater productivity [ savings ] to be found from the frontline as well as the back offices .
" It seems to me to be absurd to imagine that the only services where no efficiencies can be found are those that have been most generously funded for 10 years .
To simply exempt the two most well - funded services from the kind of pain that will be inflicted on everybody else seems to me to be insane . "
He went on : " Although it 's undoubtedly the case that we are going to experience spending cuts of a kind that have n't been seen probably in the lifetime of anyone working in the public sector , it 's also the case that they are going to come after a period of 10 years of sustained growth . "
His comments – the strongest warnings the spending watchdog has made to date – came a day after a senior Conservative adviser , the former minister Lord Forsyth , said that David Cameron will have to cut public spending by £ 75 bn a year by the end of the next parliament if he is to avoid destroying the British economy .
His comments were seen as an indication of the scale of cuts expected under the Tories , should they win the general election .
Both Labour and the Conservatives are pledging to safeguard spending on frontline health and education services .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that this would lead to 17 % cuts in budgets for all other departments .
The first clear sign of the cuts will come from the government in a comprehensive spending review – which sets three - year budgets for departments – but the chancellor has said that will not happen until after the election .
A spokesman for the chief secretary to the Treasury , Liam Byrne , said Labour was clear about its pledge to halve the deficit within four years and that the pre-budget report last year committed extra money to health and education but also demanded efficiency savings .
The Tories have said they will act even faster but Bundred said neither party had spelled out how it would achieve savings .
" What politicians are n't saying at the moment is about the judgment they would make about the balance between tax and spending and where the cuts should fall .
I would like to see more open discussions and greater clarity of the intentions of all parties , " he said .
Bundred was addressing the committee 's inquiry into public administration in the fiscal squeeze .
He was giving evidence alongside Amyas Morse , head of the National Audit Office , who warned it was highly unlikely that the necessary spending reductions could be achieved without cutting staffing in key public services .
He said : " A significant part of the cost driver in the public sector are people and it is very unlikely that will be excluded from the serious cost reduction . "
The committee has received written evidence from Tony Travers , professor of government at the LSE , setting out options for reducing the £ 178bn deficit , including reduced universal benefits such as child allowance and tax credits and increased charges for public services .

New York , June 21 , 2006 — The Committee to Protect Journalists is deeply troubled by allegations contained in author Ron Suskind ’s new book , The One Percent Doctrine , that U.S. forces deliberately targeted Al - Jazeera ’s Kabul bureau in November 2001 .
“ On November 13 , a hectic day when Kabul fell to the Northern Alliance and there were celebrations in the streets of the city , a U.S. missile obliterated Al - Jazeera ’s office , ” Suskind wrote in the book , which was released yesterday .
“ Inside the CIA and White House there was satisfaction that a message had been sent to Al - Jazeera . ”
Questioned yesterday by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer , Suskind said : “ My sources are clear that that was done on purpose , precisely to send a message to Al - Jazeera , and essentially a message was sent .
… There was great anger at Al - Jazeera at this point . ”
Suskind said U.S. officials considered Al - Jazeera a mouthpiece for al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
Asked who made the decision to target the station , Suskind told Blitzer that because of “ sourcing issues ” he could n’t say .
“ You do n’t put everything you know in a book like this .
But I ’ll tell you emphatically it was a deliberate act by the U.S. ” CNN reported last night that Pentagon officials speaking on background denied that the attack was intentional and said it was the first that they had heard about it .
“ If true , such targeting would seriously threaten the ability of all journalists to cover conflict , ” said CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper .
The November 2001 air strike , carried out with two 500 - pound bombs , destroyed the Al - Jazeera bureau , which had been evacuated hours earlier .
The Pentagon asserted then , without providing additional detail , that the office was a “ known al - Qaeda facility ” and that the U.S. military did not know that the space was being used by Al - Jazeera .
U.S. officials have said little about the Kabul attack since their initial statement .
Gen. Richard B. Myers , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , reiterated in a February 2002 letter to CPJ that the military believed the building to be an al - Qaeda facility , but he offered no evidence or other detail .
The Kabul strike was the first of two significant cases in which Al - Jazeera offices in the Middle East were struck by U.S. fire .
On April 8 , 2003 a U.S. air - to - surface missile exploded outside the two - story villa that housed Al - Jazeera ’s Baghdad bureau , killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub , who had been on the roof adjusting a pre-positioned camera during fierce fighting in the area .
The U.S. military claimed Ayyoub was killed in crossfire when U.S. forces were responding to hostile fire coming from the building , an assertion denied by Al - Jazeera .
Al - Jazeera has said it provided the Pentagon with the bureau ’s coordinates in advance of the war .
U.S. officials have not responded to calls from CPJ to investigate and explain the strike .
“ The Pentagon ’s repeated failure to publicly account for its actions in these bombings has understandably fueled suspicion that they may have been intentional , in violation of international humanitarian law , ” Cooper said .
“ This should be of concern to journalists everywhere .
It ’s time for the United States to credibly explain the circumstances behind both incidents . ”
Accusations that Al - Jazeera was deliberately targeted by the United States gained currency last year when the London - based Daily Mirror reported that U.S. President George W. Bush raised the idea of bombing Al - Jazeera ’s offices in an April 2004 meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
Blair reportedly advised against it , saying such action would provoke a global backlash .
The paper ’s unnamed sources disagreed on the nature of Bush ’s alleged suggestion .
One source dismissed the remark as “ humorous , not serious , ” while another claimed the president was “ deadly serious . ”
The Washington Post quoted a senior U.S. diplomat as saying the report “ sounds like one of the president ’s one - liners that is meant as a joke . ”
The White House said only that it was “ not interested in dignifying something so outlandish and inconceivable with a response . ”

Goldman Sachs is disputing reports that its chief executive could pocket a bonus of $ 100 million .
Lloyd Blankfein , who leads Goldman -- the world 's richest investment bank -- stands to collect the staggering amount in defiance of the White House , which has leveled strong criticism on excessive bonuses for top executives on the heels of last year 's credit crisis .
The Times of London , which cites unidentified bankers in Davos at the World Economic Forum , reported Monday that Blankfein and other top execs will " receive some of the bank 's biggest ever payouts . "
“ This is Lloyd thumbing his nose at Obama , ” a banker from a rival company told The Times .
Last week , President Barack Obama , responding to reports that Wall Street employees will rake in $ 18.4 billion in bonuses , called the payouts " the height of irresponsibility " while their crumbling financial sector received a bailout from taxpayers last year .
Responding to the rumor of Blankfein 's bonus , a Goldman spokesman said Monday the company 's board has n't yet made a financial decision on executive compensation and called the $ 100 million figure " speculative nonsense . "
" Everything Goldman Sachs has said and done in terms of compensation this year gives the lie to The Times story , " the representative said .
He added that Blankfein received no bonus in 2008 .
Taxpayers are growing increasingly angry over big bonuses at financial institutions after saving the banks from near collapse last year .
Goldman will reveal the pay of its top five earners in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of next month .
The IEA warns that energy consumption must be reduced
The prediction comes from the latest annual World Energy Outlook report from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
It says that under current consumption trends , energy demand will also rise by more than 50 % over the next 25 years .
The IEA adds that oil prices will " substantially " rise unless there is extra investment in oil facilities .
It says the world has seen " years of under - investment " in both oil production and the refinery sector .
The organisation estimates that the global oil industry now needs to invest $ 20.3 trillion ( £ 12 trillion ) in fresh facilities by 2030 , or else the wider global economy could suffer .
' Unsustainable '
" These projected trends have important implications and lead to a future that is not sustainable , " said IEA chief Claude Mandil .
If investments [ in oil fields ] do not come in a timely and sufficient manner , there will be higher oil prices , and global economic growth will suffer
IEA chief economist Fatih Birol
" We must change these outcomes and get the planet onto a sustainable energy path . "
The IEA 's warning comes at a time when the Kyoto climate change agreement calls on developed nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to 5 % below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .
It also cautions that oil producers need to double annual investments in their oil fields or else see another £ 13 a barrel on the projected price of oil over the next 25 years .
Economic impact
The IEA says this extra investment is vital to avoid the supply bottlenecks that saw oil prices rise above $ 70 a barrel in late August .
" If investments do not come in a timely and sufficient manner , there will be higher oil prices , and global economic growth will suffer , " said IEA chief economist Fatih Birol .
The IEA says the world has enough oil supplies to last until 2030 , and that the core issue is instead the need to improve the supply chain .
Greenpeace said the latest figures from the IEA showed just how important it was for countries to meet their Kyoto targets .
" The Kyoto protocol does n't amount to much in terms of emissions reductions but at least it breaks the curve [ of rising emissions ] among countries that have accepted its targets , " said Steve Sawyer , climate policy expert at the environmental pressure group .
" We have to work out the trick of how to get the US and the rapidly industrialising developing countries to break the curve as well . "
The IEA is made up of the 26 main industrialised nations who are the major oil consumers .
