On this day in 1962 , Johnny Carson took the helm of The Tonight Show .
Hi-yo !
I know there were hosts before and since , but Johnny is the only one that matters .
I remember watching him when I was a tyke , and while I did n’t completely understand everything they were talking about , I did understand about half the guests were intoxicated to one degree or another .
They must have had one helluva green room .
I mean , fully stocked .
Was there a bartender ?
I ’d believe it .
Go on YouTube and watch some of the old shows and see for yourself .
The show was loose , it was fun , it was a little goofy , it was real .
Nowadays , I do n’t know .
I think I watched an episode , it was Kimmel or Fallon , who can tell , and they were making a big deal of drinking shots of beer on the air .
Yeah .
Beer .
Whoop - dee - do .
Freaking amateur hour .
At noon on September 16 , 1920 , a horse drawn buggy loaded with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of cast - iron slugs exploded across the street from the J.P. Morgan bank headquarters in downtown Manhattan , New York .
The explosion blew out windows for blocks around , killed 30 immediately , injured hundreds of others and completely destroyed the interior of the Morgan building ..
Those responsible were never found , but evidence — in the form of a warning note received at a nearby office building — suggested anarchists .

Where :
Financial District , downtown Manhattan , New York
When :
September 16 , 1920
The Story :
Shortly after 12 pm on September 16 , a dynamite loaded horse drawn cart exploded on the corner of Wall and Broad Street in downtown Manhattan , just outside the banking firm .
J.P. Morgan & Co .
The blast would ultimately kill 39 people — most of them the clerks and messengers and secretaries who served the financial institutions -- and cause damage in the millions of dollars .
To witnesses , the scale of the damage was unimaginable .
Glass flew everywhere , including into the Morgan building , where several of the bank 's partners were injured ( Morgan himself was traveling in Europe that day . )
The attack was made more lethal by the cast iron slugs packed in with the dynamite .
Investigations began immediately , with several theories about who might have committed the attack discarded along the way .
Thomas Lamont , a Morgan bank principal , first accused Bolsheviks of the attack .
Bolsheviks was for many a catch - all term that meant " radicals , " whether anarchists , communists or socialists .
The day after the attack , a message was found in a mailbox a block from the attack , which said :
Remember .
We will not tolerate any longer .
Free the political prisoners or it will be death for all of you .
American Anarchist Fighters ! "
Some have theorized that this note indicated that the attack was revenge for the murder indictment , several days earlier , of anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti .
Finally , it was concluded that either Anarchists or communists were responsible .
However , those responsible for the attack were never located , and suspicions about the object of the attack were inconclusive .
From Wall Street to the World Trade Center :
The first act of terrorism aimed at the heart of the nation 's financial institutions inevitably draws comparison to the second , on September 11 , 2001 .
Beverly Gage , author of the forthcoming book , The Day Wall Street Exploded : A Story of America in its First Age of Terror , has made one such comparison :
To New Yorkers and to Americans in 1920 , the death toll from the blast seemed incomprehensible .
" The horrible slaughter and maiming of men and women , " wrote the New York Call , " was a calamity that almost stills the beating of the heart of the people . "
That those numbers now seem paltry -- statistics from a past when we counted civilian deaths in dozens instead of thousands -- underscores just how violently our own world changed last Tuesday .
The destruction of the World Trade Center now stands alone in the annals of horror .
But despite the difference in scale , the Wall Street explosion forced upon New York and the nation many of the same questions that we are confronting today :
How should we respond to violence on this new scale ?
What is the proper balance between freedom and security ?
Who , exactly , is responsible for the destruction ? "
There is another striking similarity .
We may think that the defensive security crackdowns and resource mobilization following 9/11 are unprecedented , but a similiar mobilization occurred in 1920 : Within days of the attack , there were calls on Congress and the Department of Justice to dramatically increase funding and legal mechanisms to counter the threat of Communists and Anarchists .
According to the New York Times on September 19 : " It was said today at the Department of Justice that Attorney General Palmer would recommend in his annual report to Congress that drastic laws for dealing with anarchists and other disturbing elements be enacted .
At the same time he will ask for larger appropriations , which were denied in the past . "

In a statement , the company said it “ believes this step is necessary to protect the interests of its employees , its shareholders and the company . ”
Transocean also said it wanted to consolidate all the lawsuits it is facing in one court , and establish a single fund from which “ legitimate claims may be paid . ”

Also on Thursday , Ken Salazar , the Interior secretary , took a step toward a planned reorganization of the troubled Minerals Management Service , the agency responsible for regulating the safety and environmental practices of offshore oil drillers , as well as promoting oil exploration and collecting royalties from it .
Mr. Salazar , who announced earlier in the week that he intended to separate the agency ’s two functions , named two senior department officials to begin planning for the breakup of the minerals agency and creation of its successors .
He said the goal of the reorganization was to strengthen safety and environmental enforcement and to end the sometimes - too - close relationship between government officials and regulated companies .
“ We have a responsibility to ensure that the operation and oversight of offshore operations are following the law , protecting the workers and guarding against future incidents and spills , ” Mr. Salazar said in a letter to Congressional leaders seeking their opinions on the proposed overhaul .
BP , which has assumed responsibility for the bulk of claims arising from the spill , announced that the cost of responding to the disaster so far had amounted to an estimated $ 450 million , about $ 100 million more than the estimate earlier in the week .
The company said in a filing to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that the tab included money it had given to Gulf Coast states and the federal government for their responses .
The costs also include efforts to contain the spilling crude oil , continuing work to drill a relief well and settlements .
So far 6,700 claims have been filed , of which about 1,000 have already been paid , according to the company statement .
In the gulf , efforts continued to stop the oil flowing from the damaged well , as BP said it was moving forward with several strategies to try to contain the spill , including inserting a tube into the broken drilling pipe to draw the oil out .
Head feminist " Buck " McGowan leads a march on Washington for women 's rights .
WASHINGTON — After decades spent battling gender discrimination and inequality in the workplace , the feminist movement underwent a high - level shake - up last month , when 53 - year - old management consultant Peter " Buck " McGowan took over as new chief of the worldwide initiative for women 's rights .
Advertisement
McGowan , who now oversees the group 's day - to - day operations , said he " could n't be happier " to bring his ambition , experience , and no -nonsense attitude to his new role as the nation 's top feminist .
" All the feminist movement needed to do was bring on someone who had the balls to do something about this glass ceiling business , " said McGowan , who quickly closed the 23.5 percent gender wage gap by " making a few calls to the big boys upstairs . "
" In the world of gender identity and empowered female sexuality , it 's all about who you know . "

McGowan , who was selected from a pool of roughly 150 million candidates , made eliminating sexual harassment his first priority before working on securing reproductive rights for women in all 50 states , and promoting healthy body images through an influx of strong , independent female characters in TV , magazines , and film .
" It 's about time , " McGowan said upon returning from a golf game with several " network honchos " in which he brokered a deal to bring a variety of women 's sports to prime - time television .
" These ladies should have brought me on years ago . "
Advertisement
McGowan claimed that one of the main reasons the movement enjoyed so little success in the past was that the previous management was often too timid and passive and should have been much more results - focused .
" You can't waste time pussyfooting around with protests and getting all emotional about a bunch of irrelevant details , " McGowan said .
" If you want to enjoy equal rights , you have to have a real man - to - man chat with the people in charge until you can hammer out some more equitable custody laws . "
Advertisement
" And do n't get me started on how disorganized and scatterbrained their old fundraising methods were , " McGowan added .
" Let 's just say the movement never really had a head for numbers . "
After McGowan successfully appointed three of his best men to lead Smith College 's women 's studies department and called in some favors to a number of powerful board chairmen to triple the number of female CEOs in Fortune 500 companies , analysts predicted that the feminist movement could achieve all of McGowan 's goals by as early as 2009 .
Advertisement
" With a charismatic , self - assured guy like Pete pulling the strings , we might even see a female elected president one of these days , " said Nathan Roth , an analyst at the Cato Institute .
" Finally , the feminist movement has a face that commands respect . "
McGowan , however , said he did n't get into the business of women 's rights for the praise .
Advertisement
" What these women were able to accomplish with the little manpower they had is very impressive , " McGowan said .
" I just bring a certain something to the table — I 'm not sure what — that gave us that extra little push into complete female independence .
I guess it just comes naturally . "
But despite his modesty , McGowan continues to garner praise from those closest to the cause .
Advertisement
" The whole movement just seems more legitimate with Buck in charge , " leading feminist Gloria Steinem said at a gala dinner Friday .
" His drive , focus , and determination are truly remarkable .
Mr. McGowan is a man with a plan . "
Although he has not hinted at any future projects after all forms of gender discrimination are a thing of the past , McGowan has vehemently denied rumors that he will leave the feminist movement to head up the struggle for gay rights .

" The wife would kill me if I took on any more hours , " McGowan said .
" I 'm sure those fellows know how that goes . "

A pair of male swans have made a love nest in the UK :
" The pair show no interest in their female companions and only have eyes for each other .
Dave
Wheeler , from the swannery , said : ' The two birds both hatched in 2002 and are sort of together .
" They have been together for several nesting seasons and basically keep territory as if they are a nesting pair . '
The twosome flock together at the start of the nesting season in March and perform rituals associated with a breeding couple . "
Said Manager of Abbotsbury Swannery , John Houston : " They sit on the nest and act in every way as if they were a pair expecting to lay eggs .
It is quite sweet … They just always stay together and I hear that they have some spectacular fights with each other , but they always make up and get back together .
We have more than a thousand swans here in the reserve and they are the only two doing this .
We realised they were together because the swan herds can obviously tell the difference between the males and females as the cobs have a much larger bump on their nose .
They are sexed and tagged at birth so we know from their rings that they are both male . "
Oaxaca : Paramilitaries Ambush International Aid Caravan , Two Dead by Kristin Bricker ( repost )
Wednesday Apr 28th , 2010 2:39 PM
San Juan Copala , Oaxaca -
On Tuesday afternoon at about 2:50 pm , people believed to be paramilitaries affiliated with the ruling party of Oaxaca ambushed an international aid caravan en route to San Juan Copala .
At least two people are reported dead .
San Juan Copala , Oaxaca -
On Tuesday afternoon at about 2:50 pm , people believed to be paramilitaries affiliated with the ruling party of Oaxaca ambushed an international aid caravan en route to San Juan Copala .
At least two people are reported dead .
The caravan was carrying food , water , and other basic necessities to San Juan Copala , which has been subject to a paramilitary blockade that has prevented anyone from entering or leaving the community since January .
In addition to carrying much - needed supplies , the caravan was meant to accompany teachers who were returning to classes after paramilitaries denied them access to the community nearly five months ago .
The caravan included representatives from the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca ( APPO ) , Section 22 of the teachers union , the Center for Community Support Working Together ( CACTUS ) , Oaxacan Voices Constructing Autonomy and Liberty ( VOCAL ) , two reporters from the Mexican magazine Contralinea , and international observers from Belgium , Finland , Italy , and Germany .
San Juan Copala has been under constant siege from pro-government paramilitaries since it declared itself autonomous following the 2006 peaceful uprising that shook the state and nearly drove the governor out of office .
One such paramilitary organization , the Union for the Well - being of the Triqui Region ( UBISORT ) , warned that the caravan could be in danger if it attempted to enter San Juan Copala .
UBISORT leader Rufino Juárez Hernández told press that shoot - outs were a constant occurrence in the region , and that his organization would not be held responsible for “ what could happen ” to the caravan .
Reports from survivors indicate that at approximately 2:50 pm just outside the community of La Sabana , which is controlled by UBISORT , the caravan reached a blockade of rocks piled on the road .
As the vehicles began to turn around to head back , they came under fire from gunmen who were hiding in the brush .
“ They started shooting like madmen , ” says one survivor .
Monica Citlali Santiago Ortiz , 22 , was shot in the back .
She is being treated in a hospital in Juxtlahuaca .
The total number of wounded and dead is unknown .
Paramilitaries continue to blockade the area , making rescue impossible .
The paramilitaries did allow police to remove two bodies from the area this afternoon .
They have been identified as Alberta “ Bety ” Cariño , the director of CACTUS , and Juri Jaakkola , an observer from Finland .
Survivors who fled into the brush when the caravan came under attack are beginning to surface as they make their way out of the area and into larger towns .
Nonetheless , an unconfirmed number of people are still missing .
VOCAL reports that two of its members remain missing after they fled into the brush .
CACTUS reports another four missing , including the two Contralinea reporters and Martin Sautan , a Belgian citizen .
Paramilitaries briefly detained VOCAL member , Ruben Valencia .
He reports that the gunmen took his identification and cell phone and threatened to kill him before releasing him along the side of a road .
The Oaxacan government has denied all responsibility for the attack , claiming that it had no knowledge of the caravan .
Eduardo Almeida from the human rights organization Nodo de Derechos Humanos said , “ We fear that the government will use this as a pretext to militarize the region . ”
These Chilean ads for menstrual pain medication , sent in by Mia A. , turn women into symbols of violent aggression : fighters , literally , but also men of color .
They simultaneously affirm , then , the association of violence with both masculinity and non-white skin and the de-association of women with those characteristics .
The message is that men of color are appropriately violent , while women are not .

When White House carpenter Charlie Brandt told some of First Lady Michelle Obama ’s staff about his latest hobby in beekeeping , Chef Sam Kass was quick to ask him if he knew how to make honey that could be used in the White House kitchen .
Fortunately , not only did Brandts know how to make the honey , but he also had a spare beehive at home that he was happy to donate to the White House .
Now Brandt is the White House ’s official beekeeper tending a hive of approximately 70,000 bees near the new Kitchen Garden .

Abstract Background Studies have shown that patients suffering from depression or schizophrenia often have immunological alterations that can be detected in the blood .
Others reported a possible link between inflammation , a microgliosis and the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) in suicidal patients .
Serum S100B is a marker of BBB function commonly used to study cerebrovascular wall function .
Methods
We measured levels of S100B in serum of 40 adolescents with acute psychosis , 24 adolescents with mood disorders and 20 healthy controls .
Patients were diagnosed according to DSM - IV TR criteria .
We evaluated suicidal ideation using the suicidality subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children ( BPRS-C ) .
Results Serum S100B levels were significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) and correlated to severity of suicidal ideation in patients with psychosis or mood disorders , independent of psychiatric diagnosis .
Patients with a BPRS -C suicidality subscores of 1 –4 ( low suicidality ) had mean serum S100B values +/− SEM of 0.152+/−0.020 ng/mL ( n = 34 ) compared to those with BPRS -C suicidality subscores of 5 – 7 ( high suicidality ) with a mean of 0.354+/−0.044 ng/mL ( n = 30 ) .
This difference was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) .
Conclusion
Our data support the use of S100B as an adjunctive biomarker to assess suicidal risk in patients with mood disorders or schizophrenia .

Introduction Every year , one million people die by suicide worldwide , and approximately every forty seconds there is a suicide attempt [ 1 ] .
In fact , suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in patients between the ages of 5 – 14 , and the third leading cause of death in young adults ( 15 – 24 years ) .
In the last two decades , the rate of suicide in those aged 10 – 14 years has doubled .
Up to 90 % of the people who die by suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder , such as a mood disorder , psychosis or substance abuse [ 1 ] .
The most effective way to prevent suicide is through early recognition and treatment of these disorders [ 1 ] .
Biomarker studies of suicidal patients have shown immunological abnormalities in patient with psychotic and mood disorders [ 2 ] – [ 7 ] .
Immunological mechanisms have been described in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder , as evidenced by altered immunological measurements from a variety of blood , cerebrospinal fluid or brain samples [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] – [ 12 ] .
Microglial activation has been suggested in 4 postmortem studies in patients with schizophrenia [ 13 ] – [ 16 ] .
Two postmortem studies have reported neuroinflammation as a potential contributor to increased suicidal behavior [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
Microgliosis in the anterior cingulated cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamic nucleous has been reported in suicidal patients , independent of the diagnosis ( schizophrenia vs. mood disorders ) , though it is difficult to elucidate if microglial activation is the cause or consequence of suicide [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
The role of stress is an important link between the psychosocial and neurobiological underpinnings of suicidal patients [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] .
Stress activates the inflammatory cascade , and as a result of this reaction microglia become activated [ 3 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] .
In an effort to further elucidate the link between inflammation , neurological diseases and the blood - brain barrier , Bayard et al. reported BBB permeability alterations in 18 % out of 90 suicide attempters [ 21 ] .
Current methods to determine BBB breakdown are limited by cost ( contrast - enhanced MRI ) or invasiveness ( lumbar puncture ) .
Neither is suitable for broad - scale or frequent screening of populations at risk .
Nevertheless , a surrogate marker of BBB function offers several advantages .
These include the possibility of many determinations over time , testing under circumstances that are not suitable for MRI scans ( emergencies , contraindications , or non-cooperative emotionally distressed patients ) , and possible screening in other selected cohorts ( i.e. , cancer ) .
The development of alternative strategies to non-invasively monitored BBB function has been elusive , until the recent discovery of CSF and glial proteins present in plasma when the BBB is breached [ 22 ] – [ 25 ] .
Our data in conjunction with other European and American studies have supported the hypothesis that S100B is associated with blood - brain barrier leakage .
The negative predictive value of S100B for BBB leakage is comparable to contrast - enhanced MRI or iodine - contrast CT [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] – [ 29 ] .
The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that suicidality in adolescents is accompanied by an increase in S100B values , possibly indicating S100B in the pathophysiology of suicidality .
Results
The subjects with psychosis and those with mood disorders were combined into a single set of 64 patients treated for psychiatric illness .
They were then separated into two groups based on the BPRS - C subscale score for suicidality .
Those with scores of 4 or lower were identified as “ low risk ” of suicide , while those scoring 5 or higher as “ high risk ” , we decided to use this definition of risk according to clinical experience and reports that patients with daily suicidal ideation have increase risk of suicide attempts [ 1 ] .
Levels of S100B were found to be positively correlated ( p<0.05 ) with suicidality , as measured by the BPRS - C suicidality subscore ( see Figure 1 ) .
This was true for all subjects , regardless of diagnosis .
When comparing the statistical difference between the “ low risk ” and “ high risk ” groups for suicide based on assessment of standard BPRS -C , the group with low risk had an average S100B levels of 0.152+/−
SEM 0.020 and the group with high risk had an average S100B levels of 0.354+/−0.044 , ( see Figure 2 ) .
Difference between the groups was statistically significant ( p<0.05 , by Paired Student 's t- test ) .
This difference appeared to be unchanged by the exclusion of subjects having more than one psychotic episode .
Bivariate fit analysis of BPRS -C suicidal assessment and S100B yielded a positive correlation with a corresponding p-value < 0.01 , and R2 correlation value of 0.273 ( see Figure 1 ) .

In a group of 64 patients with either psychosis or mood disorders levels of S100B objectively predicted suicidal ideation ( p<0.01 ) . 20 control subjects are included for comparison .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011089.g002
The study was controlled for age and gender based on the following data : Average age of patients with BPRS suicidality subscore of < or equal to 4 was 14.5+/−0.5 years ( mean +/− SE ) , while those with subscore > 4 ( high suicide risk ) were 14.1+/−0.5 years of age , with a p-value = 0.616 .
The gender ratio of males to females in the low suicidality group was 17 / 17 , while that in the high suicidality group was 20 /10 .
While there appears to be a trend towards a predominance of males in the high suicidality risk group , the p-value does not show a significant difference between the two ( p = 0.183 ) .
The study was also controlled for diagnosis of schizophrenia based on measurement of BPRS suicidality assessment .
Those subjects with subscores < or equal to 4 were not significantly different for schizophrenic vs. non-schizophrenic subjects : Non-psychotic mean scores were 2.6+/−0.3 vs. 2.1+/−0.4 for psychotic subjects ( p = 0.259 ) .
Likewise , those with subscores > 4 were comparable with non-psychotic subjects averaging 6.2+/−0.4 and psychotic subjects
6.4+/−0.2 ( p = 0.602 ) .
Similarly , no significant difference was observed in the height , weight or calculated body - mass index ( BMI ) when comparing the low and high suicidality risk groups ( respective p-values of 0.248 , 0.867 and 0.732 ) .
Additionally , BMI did not show any statistical significance ( p<0.05 ) when comparing the low to high suicidality risk groups subdivided as either psychotic or non-psychotic ( respective p-values of 0.31 and 0.29 , see Tables 2 – 4 ) .
In 2001 , Rothermundt and colleagues had found that S100B levels were reduced significantly in a group of patients diagnosed with acute schizophrenia , where serum S100B was measured at baseline , in the absence of neuroleptic medication [ 33 ] .
A subsequent paper by Hetzel et al. , examined the effect on anti-depressant medication on serum S100B levels for a group of drug - free subjects diagnosed with major depression and 4 weeks post - medication treatment with either reboxetine or citalopram [ 34 ] .
Although the S100B levels in these subjects were reduced after 4 weeks , the difference was not significantly significant ( p = 0.28 ) .
Statistical analysis of the total number of medications , as well as anti-psychotic ( neuroleptic ) , and anti-depressant medications separately was performed for high and low risk subjects who were identified as either psychotic or non-psychotic , as well as the two groups combined .
No statistically significant difference was observed between the total , neuroleptic nor anti-depressant medication use between the low and high risk of suicidality for either psychotic or non-psychotic subjects or the two combined ( see Supplemental data Table S1 and S4 ) .
To rule out traumatic injury possibly induced by attempted suicide , a comparison of 9 inflammatory cytokines ( IL - 1α , IL - 1 β , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IFN γ and TNFα ) for subjects with high and low risk of suicidality ( based on BPRS - C suicidality subscores ) as well as for 17 healthy pediatric controls of comparable age and gender distribution is provided in Supplemental Table S2 .
Corresponding S100B serum levels were also measured .
A statistically significant difference ( p<0.05 ) was observed between the combined psychotic subjects ( low and high risk of suicidality ; n = 64 ) and pediatric controls for inflammatory cytokines IL - 1 β and IL - 8 , as well as the protein biomarker , S100B .
Discussion
The main finding of our study is that S100B is a biomarker that can help predict suicidality in adolescent patients with psychosis and mood disorders .
This opens a new diagnostic venue for the psychiatrist and constitutes a new tool to study the pathobiology of suicide .
The finding that S100B is a marker of psychiatric illness also expands our understanding on how blood - brain barrier disruption impacts brain function .
Thus , in addition to seizure disorders [ 28 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , schizophrenia [ 37 ] and traumatic brain injury [ 38 ] –[ 40 ] , pediatric psychosis and suicidality appear to be consequence , at least in part , of cerebrovascular malfunction .
Our results also reiterate that S100B has no predictive value for any particular neurological disease , since elevated levels are present when the BBB is breached or when severe brain damage occurs .
We also want to underscore that S100B is not a diagnostic tool for any particular neurological disease but rather an adjunctive means to predict evolution of disease or rule out the presence of underlying brain or cerebrovascular damage .
This was predicted by early studies by us and others showing that serum S100B elevation is not necessarily a consequence of neuronal cell death , or other pathological changes in the brain parenchyma [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] .
The therapeutic and diagnostic value of S100B rather resides in its almost absolute negative predictive value [ 22 ] – [ 26 ] , [ 36 ] – [ 41 ] .
The negative predictive value of S100B for BBB leakage is comparable to contrast - enhanced MRI or iodine - contrast CT [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] – [ 29 ] .
Thus , a normal S100B serum level in general does not warrant additional interventions or change of therapeutic course .
In recent years , there has been a proliferation of interest in the protein S100B , its many physiological roles and its behavior in various neuropathological conditions including mood disorders and schizophrenia [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
Suicide is a fatal consequence of a set of treatable diseases ; based on our findings , S100B appears to be a reliable , easy accessible biomarker that can objectively help prevent suicide in this population .
Suicide has a high prevalence in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia .
A novel finding in this study is that S100B appears to be a marker of severity of risk of suicidality in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia .
This is in contrast to other studies where only cut - off values were indicative of presence or absence of disorder .
The pathophysiological underpinnings of this are currently unknown but warrant further investigations .
The question remains , whether our results are in support of the link between S100B , blood - brain barrier disruption and inflammation .
Studies by us or others have clearly shown that the etiological factors proceeding BBB disruption are indeed inflammatory in nature and comprise both cellular ( monocytes ) and molecular ( IL1 - β ) factors [ 36 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
Thus , it is possible that the originating factors leading to BBBD were indeed inflammatory .
The triggers for these systemic changes are as of yet unknown , but have been shown to occur in other neurological diseases such as epilepsy [ 36 ] , [ 46 ] .
Similarly , we have found that two key inflammatory cytokines , IL - 1 β and IL - 8 , were elevated by a statistically significant level ( p<0.05 ) in psychiatric patients ( combined low and high risk subjects , based on BPRS - C suicidality subscores ) compared to healthy control pediatric volunteers ( see Supplemental Table S2 ) .
To ensure that bodily harm , self induced by those patients attempting suicide , did not significantly contribute to any inflammatory processes which have been responsible for elevations in serum S100B an analysis of 9 inflammatory cytokines was undertaken in parallel to S100B measurements .
Only BPRS -C suicidality subscores and S100B serum levels were statistically significantly different ( p<0.05 ) when comparing the values of all measurements of low vs. high risk of suicidality patients ( see Supplemental Table S2 ) .
Recently , Hohoff and colleagues at the University of Muenster in Germany have identified genetic polymorphisms of the S100B gene in schizophrenic patients ( specifically SNPs rs2186358 , rs11542311 , rs2300403 and rs9722 ) and have demonstrated that S100B protein and mRNA expressions are dependent on these gene polymorphisms [ 47 ] .
This , however , seems unlikely given the facts that most of these identified polymorphisms are in a non-coding region of the gene and that no one has yet measured the frequency at which these polymorphisms occur .
Although such polymorphisms may be proven as a key contributor to psychiatric illnesses or elevations in serum S100B , we feel these findings are premature to signify cause .
Though these results are promising , we realize that further prospective studies are needed to assess a broad clinical applicability of this biomarker for suicidality in different populations , ages , ethnicity , independent of the diagnosis .
S100B may however become an important risk stratification tool for the assessment of suicidality in patients with severe mental disorders such as mood disorders and schizophrenia .

North Korea - the most bizarre country in the world
North Korea has one of the world 's largest armies
By Sue Lloyd - Roberts
BBC News , North Korea
Imagine a country where your mobile phone is taken from you at the airport with no explanation or apology , where there 's no access to the internet , where your minders watch every move and you 're reported if you try to leave your hotel alone .
A country which has not been at war for half a century but has one of the largest standing armies in the world and where people are expected to worship a president who died 16 years ago .
No , I am not describing Big Brother and the country of Airstrip One in George Orwell 's 1984 - it 's the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in 2010 .
I went to the Soviet Union in the Brezhnev years and have filmed in Burma and Tibet , but I have never before been anywhere I have been so watched and controlled , or where everything is so stage - managed .
Potemkin villages sprang up wherever I went .
I visited model farms , model villages , model factories and model schools , though , at the school , even my government minders looked faintly embarrassed when I asked a model pupil in an English language class who he admired most among modern world leaders and he answered : " Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong . "
But then , with its personality cults , dictators and marching Young Pioneers , North Korea is so 20th Century .
A confused old woman pushing a shopping trolley along the road , a factory worker wearing an old jacket at work , and random street vendors were , all hastily removed from in front of the camera , lest they tarnish the sanitised version of their country that officials wanted us to film .
My cameraman almost wept when a group of children playing spontaneously by the side of the road were abruptly shoved aside .
" We want to see ordinary people , " we begged , day after day .
But spontaneity is not allowed in North Korea .
Immortal president
What they allowed me to film proves that the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea is truly the most bizarre country in the world
That evening we were taken to the theatre to watch a ballet devoted to the triumphant building of a hydroelectric dam .
The next morning , we were removed to the safety of Pyongyang 's model kindergarten .
As I approached each room in the vast , palatial building , children rushed out and grabbed my hand to take me to watch another carefully rehearsed performance .
Little girls smiling widely and dancing in perfect formation , little boys in smart red suits and painted faces singing praises to the country 's Great Leader .
It started off faintly charming .
But with mask - like faces and rigid grins , even children become rather sinister .
More children are employed to sweep the steps leading up to the 60ft bronze statue of the Great Leader , which dominates Pyongyang .
Kim
Il - sung died 16 years ago but he 's still the country 's president .
There are over 500 statues of Kim Il - sung in North Korea " He 's immortal , " a 24 - year - old - guide explained .
" We do n't believe he passed away . "
When I tried to bring the conversation back to reality , to talk about the modern world , she revealed that she had not even heard of Nelson Mandela .
This lack of connection with the modern world is disconcerting , especially on the practical level .
State secrets I had sent a " wish list " to Pyongyang via the North Korean embassy in London of the things I wanted to see and do while in the country .
I thought it might be polite to ask to film the country 's football team which has , for the first time since 1966 , qualified to play in the World Cup .
I was given the impression before I left that this , along with my other requests , had been agreed .
At my first meeting with my minders in Pyongyang , they put me straight .
Not only was the football team out of bounds , but , they claimed , there was not a single football match taking place in the entire county during my nine - day stay .
Football is clearly a state secret .
North Korea are playing in only their second World Cup finals
One morning we saw another couple sitting at breakfast , also wearing press arm bands .
They looked utterly defeated .
It turned out that they were Brazilian football correspondents .
They , too , had asked to come to the country to watch the football team and had flown from Rio to London to Pyongyang via Beijing to do so .
" Going to a match today ? " we 'd ask cruelly every morning .
" No , we 're going to the kindergarten , " they replied forlornly one day .
" No , we 're going to the ballet , " the next .
Despite the craziness , at least I have been able to make something of my stage - managed trip to North Korea - if only to illustrate , by what they allowed me to film - that the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea is truly the most bizarre country in the world .
But one can only weep at the thought of the Brazilian football correspondents at the ballet .

British defence secretary Liam Fox has indicated that the country 's new government is reconsidering its approach to the war in Afghanistan .
He is currently on a visit to Kabul , but before he left London , Mr Fox revealed the potential change of policy .
In remarks in a newspaper interview , Mr Fox said Britain should focus less on state - building in Afghanistan and more on speeding up the withdrawal of its troops .
Mr Fox described Afghanistan as a broken 13th century country .
" National security is the focus now .
We are not a global policeman , " he told The Times .
" We have obligations to deal with poverty and human rights but that is no different in Afghanistan from dozens of other countries .
" We should n't deploy British troops unless there are overwhelming humanitarian emergency considerations or a national security imperative . "
The comments will dismay those who see the massive expansion of the Afghan education system , funded by donors such as the UK , and the opening of school doors to girls as major successes of the post - Taliban era .
The former head of British forces in Afghanistan , Colonel Richard Kemp , warned against any drastic changes in policy .
" The priority , as Liam Fox says , is to deal with the security situation in Afghanistan and to ensure that the streets of the UK and the rest of the world are safe , safer than they are at present , " he said .
" But in order to do that we must rebuild and repair the society in Afghanistan and that does include things like education policy , the economy , governance . "
Britain's new foreign secretary , William Hague , also sought to assure Kabul of his government 's commitment .
Ahead of a visit by three senior ministers , Mr Hague said that the conflict in Afghanistan is his most urgent priority , and Britain cannot set any kind of date for a withdrawal .
" There is n't going to be an arbitrary or artificial timetable .
I do n't think it 's going to work like that , " he said .
" As I say , we have to give the situation , the strategy that has been set out the time and the support to succeed .
" That does need , and require , Britain 's continued military involvement .
There is no doubt about that . "

The Department of Labor estimates that of the country 's 2.5 million farm workers , most of whom are Hispanic , 52 percent are undocumented .
The UFW believes the figure is actually 80 to 90 percent , making the industry a prime target for enforcement .
Deportation is relatively inconsequential for some harvesters in Yuma , since many are seasonal workers who commute daily from Mexico , where they board buses just north of the border for a 20 - minute ride to the fields .
But many of the year - round migrants who follow the crops from Salinas to Yuma and back again — and who account for up to 40 percent of Arizona lettuce harvesters — live full - time in the U.S. , and for them , to risk deportation is to risk estrangement from established communities and families .
If workers are reluctant to return to Arizona , growers may find themselves short on harvesters , in which case " the crops rot in the field , " says Wendy Fink - Weber , director of communications for the Western Growers Association , which represents 90 percent of fruit and vegetable growers in Arizona and California .
Greens , which are a finicky crop and demand near - perfect conditions , have only about a five - day harvest window after reaching maturity .
Each head of lettuce is cut and packed into boxes by hand .
The intensive labor associated with growing lettuce — a $ 1 billion business for Arizona and the state 's highest - value crop — accounts for up to 50 percent of the cost of production .
A main alternative to relying on migrant laborers is hiring workers registered under the temporary agricultural worker visa , H2A .
But growers say this is undesirable , and Fink - Weber describes the initiative as a " very inflexible , onerous , expensive guest worker program . "
Brian Church , director of operations at major grower - shipper Church Brothers , thinks mechanization could also offer a quick solution if workers disappear , although he notes that " you have to sort with the eye and the hand .
No machine can find defects like the human eye . "
The experience of Colorado , which enacted restrictive immigration legislation in 2006 , suggests another alternative .
Workers fled the state , and farms , desperate for labor , partnered with the Department of Corrections to pilot an inmate - harvester program .
Tom Church , the president of Church Brothers , says the absolute last resort is finding Americans to work the fields .
" If we had to rely on American workers , it would never get done , " he says .
According to Brian Church , the company would sooner resort to machines than H2A or inmate labor .
Farm managers are reluctant to predict precisely what will happen when they return to Yuma , especially as municipalities across Arizona are questioning their ability to implement and enforce the new law , which may well be overturned before lettuce transition season .
But the worst case scenario is a crop that is left to rot , meaning incalculable financial losses for farmers — and expensive salad while Arizona 's supply goes to the worms .

The NE Portland Police favorite hangout , the Starbucks on 15th and Fremont lost a
little bit of its ambiance last night .
Namely every single window we could reach
got smashed out .
Starbucks was chosen for a myriad of reasons : their union - busting
activity , the exploitation of indigenous community of coffee growers , their support
for neo-liberal trade policies , just to name a few .
This location in particular was
chosen because every time we pass by it , it 's filled to the brim with Portland
Police , who are still fucking murderers , in case you forgot .
You were working yourselves up to predict what we were going to do on Mayday , but we
were n't even there .
May 4th , the day of the Haymarket bombing , is the day we chose
to attack .
Just consider yourselves lucky , that you got off alot easier then some of
your predecessors .
No peace for the capitalists ,
No lattes for the cops !

An invitation to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to speak at Cal State Stanislaus ’ 50th anniversary gala is generating controversy and raising questions about the foundation that is paying her .
The nonprofit is refusing to divulge her speaking fees .
The foundation ’s secrecy has raised scrutiny over the financial dealings and clout of that group and scores of others like it that are associated with California ’s public universities .
The foundations raise billions of dollars for scholarships and other programs , run student organizations and bookstores and perform other crucial campus functions .
But they are set up as private entities and are not subject to state law that requires public agencies , including schools , to disclose information about how money is raised and spent .
Among recent incidents drawing attention : A Sonoma State foundation made a $ 1.25 - million loan to one of its former board members , who then defaulted on the loan .
A nonprofit at Cal State Sacramento is being audited by the attorney general for loans made to the university president .
Foundations at San Francisco City College , Cal State Fresno and the San Jose / Evergreen Community College District have also been embroiled in controversy over financial decisions , according to state Sen.
Leland Yee ( D - San Francisco ) , who is looking into the activities .
Concern about the foundations comes amid broader questions about how public universities spend taxpayers ’ dollars .
This includes recent disclosures about the use of funds meant for classrooms and students to cover real estate and construction costs and other business pursuits .
The California Faculty Assn. and the California Newspaper Publishers Assn. , among others , are pressing for more transparency from the foundations and other auxiliary groups .
They are supporting legislation , SB 330 by Yee , that would require these groups to adhere to California ’s Public Records Act .
Last year , a similar bill , SB 218 by Yee , was vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who said some of its provisions would have a “ chilling effect ” on the support of donors and volunteers if their names were disclosed .
The new bill would protect the privacy of donors except in cases in which contributors are given a gift of $ 500 or more .
It has passed the Senate and awaits an Assembly hearing .
Yee has asked Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate Cal State Stanislaus for failing to provide documents relating to Palin ’s fundraising appearance .
Yee said the Stanislaus Foundation is housed on the campus , staffed by university employees , uses university e-mail accounts , telephones , computers and other resources and is headed by university President Hamid Shirvani .
“ The Stanislaus situation provides the clearest evidence of the collusion between the foundation and the state university , the clearest evidence of the relationship between the two and that they are , in fact , not independent of each other , ” Yee said .
“ The larger issue is that I believe the state universities have been shifting some of their state responsibilities over to the foundations for the sole purpose of hiding transactions involving millions of dollars from the public . ”
Meanwhile , Cal State Stanislaus students will join
Yee in a news conference Tuesday to disclose documents they say relate to the university ’s contract with Palin .
The students and Yee say they will hand over the documents to the attorney general for further investigation .
Universities and colleges argue that much financial information is already available to the public in annual tax filings and audits that are frequently posted on campus websites .
But critics contend financial decisions -- such as investments and loans -- are made out of sight and hold the potential for misuse .
For example , without a full accounting of the Palin fee , they argue , it would be hard to ascertain whether the event raises money for the foundation .
In the 23 - campus Cal State system , more than 90 foundations and auxiliaries control $ 1.34 billion , about 20 % of the universities ’ $ 6.7 billion budget , according the chancellor ’s office .
In the 10 - campus University of California system , 10 major campus foundations hold about $ 4 billion in assets .
State law allows foundations and other nonprofits to provide some essential services that contribute to the educational mission of the university .
At Cal State , for instance , campus radio stations , recreational sports activities and food services typically are funded and operated by auxiliary groups rather than the university .
The organizations are self supporting and use no general fund monies .
But the vast sums from grants and contributions coupled with scant public oversight should invite concern , particularly when state funding cutbacks have led many campuses to trim programs , reduce student enrollment and furlough staff , said Terry Francke , the general counsel of Californians Aware , a nonprofit group that promotes open government .
“ There is the question of whether these institutions are being managed well , ” said Francke , whose group has also requested documents about the Palin appearance .
“ These are nonprofit , charitable enterprises but they are also business enterprises .
That ’s all the more significant in an environment of severely rationed resources . ”
Shirvani , at Cal State Stanislaus , declined to discuss the issues surrounding Palin ’s June 25 appearance , a $ 500 - a plate , black - tie affair .
In a statement , Matt Swanson , president of the foundation , cited government code that exempts auxiliary organizations from the Public Records Act .
He said that the Washington Speakers Bureau , which represents Palin , requires that financial terms of speaker appearances remain confidential .
The Speakers Bureau did not return calls for comment .
“ I can assure you that no public funds are being used to support this event , ” Swanson said .
“ All funds used have been given for the express purpose of putting on this event in order to raise money to benefit university programs and student services . ”
But although Cal State and UC maintain that foundations and other nonprofits should continue to play a vital role , they also have become aware of the need for more transparency .
The universities have proposed an amendment to Yee ’s legislation that would maintain the separate status of foundations and auxiliaries but make available to the public more documents , including audited financial statements , compensation plans , records documenting loans and investment practices and names of donors who have made significant contributions in exchange for substantial gifts .
They argue that Yee ’s bill would make it more difficult to raise funds and that it would be costly to handle public records requests .
“ We believe in allowing for transparency as much as possible and think there ’s a way to do that without undue costs , ” said Erik Fallis , a Cal State University spokesman .
But Yee ’s staff said the senator believes the proposed amendment would weaken the Public Records Act and that he has no intention of including it .

The news has been reported around the Internet , most notably at TrekMovie , that CBS is considering marketing the original “ Star Trek ” series in 3 - D .
That ’s right , folks .
If some of the wizards at CBS have their way , you can watch Kirk and Spock jump out of the Guardian of Forever and seemingly into your living rooms through the magic of 3 - D television .
There is , however , a very notable individual who is not thrilled with the idea : CBS president and chief executive officer Les Moonves recently stated that he has seen episodes of the series converted to 3 - D and they did not impress him , or make him believe that there is a market for such shows .
While the opinion of the head of CBS is important , I had the chance to spend the weekend at a fan club convention with a lot of Trek fans .
I decided to talk to a few of them about the idea and see if they would be interested in such a change in their beloved show .
After all , what the market thinks is what drives sales .
After three days talking with fellow fans , I could not find a single person who desired or wanted to see the show converted into 3 - D.
Many expressed the concern that we have seen from the 3 - D experience ( or lack thereof ) with “ Clash of the Titans , ” that generating the 3 - D effect after the fact has been , so far , a huge failure .
Many fans reacted with disgust and said the remastering that was done recently should be the final changes allowed to the series .
I also agree with the fans .
Post filming 3 - D generation just does not work well .
The depth perception is just not there and it becomes an annoying factor instead of a movie enhancement .
Frankly , if you are going to show a movie in 3 - D , then it needs to be produced that way in the first place to get the proper
depth perception , you are there feel , and overall effect just right .
Now the fact that the president of CBS , many fans of “ Star Trek , ” and this writer agrees on a subject is not quite a sign of the apocalypse , but it is close .
This idea needs to be shelved .
If they want “ Star Trek ” in 3 - D , then I would strongly recommend shooting the next film in that format .
After all , if you want something done a certain way , why not do it right in the first place ?
Think about it .
Editor 's Note , 12:15 PM PDT :
We have updated this story with a response from Facebook .
When a piece of software is automatically installed on your computer without your knowledge , it 's called malware .
But what do you call it when Facebook apps are added to your profile without your knowledge ?
We discovered Wednesday that this is actually happening , and stopping it is n't as easy as checking a box in your privacy settings .
If you visit certain sites while logged in to Facebook , an app for those sites will be quietly added to your Facebook profile .
You do n't have to have a Facebook window open , you do n't need to signed in to these sites for the apps to appear , and there does n't appear to be an option to opt - out anywhere in Facebook 's byzantine privacy settings .
These apps appear to be related to Facebook 's sharing tools .
The sites currently leaving this trail all have Facebook Connect integration , and the list includes heavyweights such as the Gawker network of blogs , the Washington Post , TechCrunch , CNET , New York Magazine , and formspring .me .
It is n't entirely clear what information these apps are pulling from user profiles or feeding back to Facebook .
They do n't show up automatically on profile pages , but if you go to an application 's profile page , you can see a list of your friends who also have that app installed , essentially getting a unintentional peek at their browsing habits .
On the other side there are sites like the Washington Post's , which has a Facebook Network News box showing a list of your friends who have recently shared a Washington Post article on Facebook .
How to block the apps
Opting out of Instant Personalization does not stop these apps from appearing .
Unfortunately , removing these kinds of applications requires more vigilance than just un-checking a box .
To see a list of your current Facebook applications , click Account in the top right corner of Facebook , then select Application Settings from the drop down menu .
If you click on the Edit Settings link for one of the new applications , you 'll always see one tab called Additional Permissions that has a box that 's unchecked by default .
Checking it will give that application permission to " Publish recent activity ( one line stories ) to [ your ] wall . "
Sometimes there is a second tab with an option to add a bookmark for that link to your wall .
And a few apps also have a Profile tab where you can add a Tab to your profile for that site and pick its privacy level .
Clicking the X to delete an application will temporarily remove it from your applications list , but it will just be re-added as you return to that site .
One work - around is to always log out of Facebook before surfing the Web .
Another is to block each application after they appear .
In order to permanently block an application , you have to click on the Profile link for that application , then click Block Application .
What Facebook intended
There is some evidence of how Facebook 's newly rolled - out Open Graph API are supposed to be used for cross posting comments and reviews on Facebook and external sites .
For example , if you are logged in to a site like PCWorld or Macworld using Facebook Connect and you leave a comment on an article , you 'll see a pop - up message asking if you 'd like to publish the comment as a story to your wall .
If you click Publish , the comment will show up in your friend 's news feeds .
They can choose to block all stories from that site .
It 's already been a rough week for Facebook and privacy .
Recent issues have revealed a disorganized and buggy platform , and raised concerns about Facebook 's ability to responsibly store and manage users ' private information .
Hopefully this latest issue is just another bug and not a new way of operating for the social networking site .
Facebook 's response
After this story was published , Facebook spokesperson David Swain contacted us and confirmed that the appearance of unauthorized apps was a bug :
" In this case , there was a bug that was showing applications on a user ’s Application Settings page that the user had n’t authorized .
No information was shared with those applications and the user ’s list of applications was not shown to anyone but the user .
This bug has been fixed . "
It does appear that unauthorized apps are no longer being added to users ' pages , however any unwanted applications that were previously added will still need to be removed manually .
Police found this photo of Harris - Moore on a digital camera in a car hed stolen , which convinced them hed returned to Camano .
Just after midnight on July 18 , 2008 , Shirley Morgan , owner of Camano Island ’s Elger Bay Cafe , received a phone call from the police informing her that her restaurant had been struck by a car .
Hours earlier , Deputy William Vaughn of the Island County Sheriff ’s Department had spotted a black Mercedes - Benz , which was being driven erratically .
Riding shotgun in Vaughn ’s cruiser was Lucas Adkins , a civilian and sheriff ’s department intern .
As the Mercedes sped northward up the lonely two - lane road that winds around Camano ’s heavily forested southern half , Vaughn gave chase .
When the Benz neared the intersection at Mountain View Road , its driver hung a sharp left into the cafe ’s parking lot and exited the vehicle .
Still in gear , the car rolled across the asphalt and into the building ’s back end .
According to police reports , Vaughn observed the vehicle ’s occupant flee on foot , drop down a hill , and break for the forest .
But it was the intern who first identified the suspect , whose tall , lanky frame and boyish face were recognizable even in the darkness .
Adkins told the detectives who arrived at the scene that the suspect looked like Colton Harris - Moore , Camano Island ’s most infamous son and the state of Washington ’s youngest serial fugitive — the so - called “ Barefoot Burglar . ”
( Harris - Moore earned the nickname after witnesses reported seeing him running without shoes . )
In the dead of night , the restaurant — one of a trio of conjoined businesses , including a gas station and bait shop — was naturally empty of patrons .
But there was a problem , police told Morgan .
The car had plowed into a storage dumpster .
Weighed down by spent cooking oil , it had absorbed much of the impact .
But the crash had caused it to crush a pipe connected to the cafe ’s industrial - sized propane tank .
The deputies had turned off the gas , but the pipe would need to be repaired .
All told , the incident cost Morgan $ 400 .
“ He did n’t do it intentionally , ” says Morgan of Harris - Moore , “ but when you ’re that reckless , dangerous things like that can happen . ”
Island County Sheriff Mark Brown , the man who had made it his agency ’s priority to catch the teen , was less charitable , telling the Everett Herald : “ I ’m convinced it was him .
He spit in the eye of law enforcement .
He spit in the eyes of the juvenile services that tried to help him , and he spit in the eye of the citizens that have tried to help him . ”
The Mercedes Harris - Moore drove and ditched belonged to his neighbor , Carol Star .
She was in Colorado when police reached her , and told them that no one had permission to use her car and that whoever it was must have stolen it .
Police later found a sliding door at her house , located near Harris - Moore ’s childhood home , completely removed .
A search of the car turned up a red-and - black backpack also belonging to Star .
It was filled with items Harris - Moore had pilfered since walking away from a Renton group home that April — credit cards , a cell phone , a digital camera , a GPS unit — and a smattering of personal belongings , including a journal with his name inscribed on the inside front cover .
From the camera , investigators would later obtain the now - iconic photo that has been published in newspapers around the world .
Taken by himself in what appears to be the woods , Harris - Moore is pictured lying on his back , wearing a black polo shirt with a Mercedes - Benz logo embroidered across the chest and a shit - eating grin across his face .
“ That was how most of the island found out that he was back , ” says Morgan .
Morgan , 61 , has lived on Camano since long before Harris - Moore became a thorn in the collective side of the island ’s residents .
Thirteen years ago , she left Arlington , Wash . , in search of new digs .
She found Camano , a 40 - square - mile island separated from the mainland by the Davis Slough , and promptly fell in love .
Her cafe , one of a handful of eateries on the island , is the kind of place where semi-retired residents mix easily with well - heeled vacationers while conversing about topics of import — namely fishing .
“ It ’s a laid - back , peaceful place , ” says Morgan .
“ There ’s not usually a lot of drama , ”
But there have been momentary breaks in the tranquility , many of which have come courtesy of Harris - Moore .
While most kids his age are shambling through their freshman year of college , the 18 - year - old has become a local legend , much to the displeasure of his hometown ’s adult population .
At age 16 , Harris - Moore was already a prolific , if sloppy , burglar .
Facing a felony charge in 2006 , he absconded and disappeared into the island ’s forested wilds .
After seven months he was caught , only to escape and disappear again after serving just one year of a three - year sentence — this time through a window of a Renton juvenile - rehabilitation facility .
In the year since his escape , Harris - Moore has officially been named as a suspect in two separate incidents in which the perpetrator stole and then took a joyride in a single - engine airplane , and is rumored to be the culprit in a third .
The parallels to another famous teenage fugitive , Frank Abagnale Jr. , whose own enthusiasm for impersonating airline pilots was captured in the film Catch Me if You Can , are obvious .
As of this writing , Harris - Moore is still at large .
Hence , reporters from national media outlets like the Los Angeles Times are schlepping to northwest Washington to get the story ; film producers are clamoring for the rights to his tale ; and a Facebook fan page dedicated to him has nearly 8,000 members .
Meanwhile , his legend looms over Camano Island .
Solicitations for comment from the Island County Sheriff ’s Department were unsuccessful , but residents say sheriff ’s deputies there have stepped up their patrols .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has offered its assistance , and on some nights , helicopters equipped with night - vision cameras hover over the woods , searching for Harris - Moore .
“ Every time you hear a siren , you think it might be because of Colton , ” says Morgan .
But even as the island grapples with the possibility that Harris - Moore might be back , debate over the reasons behind his lawlessness continues .
His former neighbors have been filing concerns about his mother ’s and father ’s child - raising fitness since Harris - Moore was old enough to walk .
According to documents and to Harris - Moore ’s own accusations , both his parents have a history of substance abuse , as did the rotating cast of surrogate dads who entered his home after his biological father left the family .
“ He started breaking into people ’s homes because he wanted to see what it was like to live a normal life , ” says one friend , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Reached by phone , Pam Kohler defends her son , calling Harris - Moore a “ sweet boy . ”
She then demands payment in exchange for an interview , and hangs up the phone when it ’s made clear that none will be forthcoming .
“ I have no doubt that he might be doing some burglaries , ” says Sandra Puttmann , Harris - Moore ’s maternal aunt .
“ But every time there ’s a robbery on Camano Island , they blame it on Colton . ”
True or not , Harris - Moore has earned the suspicion .
This is the story of a usual suspect .
Colton Harris - Moore was born at Skagit Valley Hospital on March 22 , 1991 .
His troubles began early .
One of his very first interactions with Camano police was as a suspect , says his aunt .
According to Puttmann , police suspected that a new bicycle he was walking with near his mother ’s trailer was not an eighth - birthday present his mother had long saved to buy him , but had been stolen .
Harris - Moore ’s real difficulties began long before that , claims Kohler .
In a letter submitted to Snohomish County Superior Court during his 2007 prosecution on multiple counts of burglary , Kohler said that her son ’s impulsiveness began as early as age 2 .
He had a tendency to “ do things without thinking of the end results of his actions , ” she wrote .
Years later , clinicians at Washington ’s Compass Health Center diagnosed the then - 10 - year - old Harris - Moore with a host of psychiatric maladies , including attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , depression , and intermittent explosive disorder , a condition that causes sufferers to react violently and grossly out of proportion to a particular situation .
Harris - Moore ’s biological father , Gordon Moore , was , according to court documents , an oft - incarcerated , violent alcoholic .
He left the family for good in 2003 after being arrested following an incident at a family barbecue in which Harris - Moore had been throwing rocks at his father following an argument , according to court documents .
In response , the elder Moore knocked his son to the ground and held him down by the throat .
“ Do n’t you know , I have killed three men because of my anger , ” he allegedly told his son .
Moore ’s criminal record is no less extensive than his son’s .
From 1974 to 1996 , he racked up 25 convictions , many of them for driving without a valid license or under the influence .
Moore ’s most egregious offense was a 1999 hit - and - run , but to Harris - Moore the anger boast must have been a credible threat .
After he called the police , his father disappeared into the woods , much as Harris - Moore would years later .
Moore was eventually captured , taken in on an outstanding warrant , and found guilty of misdemeanor assault and driving under the influence .
He is not currently incarcerated , but has been out of touch with his son since the incident .
A number of his mother ’s boyfriends moved in and out of the family home as Harris - Moore grew to adolescence , each of them suffering from some form of chemical dependency .
His mother also had problems with alcohol addiction , according to documents obtained from Child Protective Services by Compass Health Center ’s Dr. Delton Young .
SW ‘s request for those records was denied by the state ’s Department of Social and Health Services , citing their private nature .
But as Young ’s evaluation indicates , CPS was moved on more than one occasion to look into the conditions at Harris - Moore ’s home .
In 2002 , CPS began an investigation for “ negligent treatment ” after Harris - Moore was found with a bruise on his leg allegedly inflicted by his mother ’s then - live - in boyfriend .
Kohler told the evaluator that her boyfriend , who according to CPS also had issues with drugs and alcohol , was “ not playing with a full deck . ”
During this time , Harris - Moore was briefly placed in foster care following intervention by local police , says the evaluation .
His first conviction would soon follow .
Four days after Thanksgiving 2003 , Harris - Moore and two fellow hellions tore across Camano Island , burgling and vandalizing their way to Stanwood Middle School .
Before the night was over , they ’d stolen a laptop from a mortgage - company office , set fire to the bulletin board at a grocery store , and taken a torch to one of the school ’s soda machines .
The next day , one member of the crew confessed to local authorities and rolled on the other participants .
Harris - Moore was subsequently tried and convicted of his first felony offense .
As a juvenile , his sentence was light :
He received six months of community supervision to go with 56 hours of community service and a 30 - day stay at Everett ’s Denney Youth Center .
By that time , Harris - Moore ’s relationship with Kohler had grown tumultuous .
Physical altercations between the two were not uncommon .
Kohler was violent towards him “ 100 ’s [ sic ] of times , ” says Young ’s evaluation .
Harris - Moore soon became one of Stanwood Middle School ’s problem students .
He reported to CPS investigators that Kohler had grown largely indifferent to his studies , and his attendance at school plummeted .
He later begged for help , saying , “ I am not happy .
I am depressed .
I could stay in bed all day .
I need help .
I ’m tired of this stuff . ”
Following that first conviction , Harris - Moore ’s criminal activity continued .
The crimes were petty , however : possession of stolen goods , theft , and vandalism .
Previous convictions had resulted in relatively minor penalties , mostly a combination of fines , community service , and a few days ’ detention at one of the local juvenile - rehabilitation centers .
But in 2006 , as he entered his freshman year at Stanwood ’s alternative high school , Lincoln Hill , he was facing mandatory incarceration .
Washington state allows juvenile offenders only so many points before they are taken into the custody of the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration .
And after being found guilty that February of stealing $ 61 from the Stanwood Public Library cash box , Harris - Moore had exhausted all of his , subsequently serving 30 days at Denney Youth Center .
He caught yet another charge a week after his release — for boosting $ 3,700 in computer equipment via a stolen credit - card number .
The day before he was to appear in Snohomish County juvenile court , Harris thought better of it , and fled into the woods instead .
For those not blessed with access to a boat or helicopter , there is only one way on or off Camano Island .
Sandwiched between the Tulalip Indian Reservation and Skagit Bay , its sole connection to the mainland is the Mark W. Clark Memorial Bridge , so named after a U.S. Army general and WWII veteran who once called the island home .
Underneath the bridge is the Davis Slough .
Centuries before the island became a vacation community , Snohomish and Kikalo Indians would wait until low tide before crossing over to gather from its summer abundance of seafood .
Similarly , many of Camano ’s estimated 13,000 residents do n’t actually live there full - time , arriving only after the weather turns warm .
That and the island ’s unique geography and relative isolation create plenty of opportunities for bored , disaffected young people looking for a place to squat .
“ Camano Island has the same crime problems of a King County or a Seattle , ” says John Dean , chairman of the Island County Board of Commissioners .
“ Most people come up to Camano Island thinking they ’re going back into a very peaceful , crime - free area , but that ’s really not so .
When you have this amount of people in an area where there are so many places to hide , you ’re going to have some problems . ”
Morgan ’s assessment is more blunt .
“ There are some bad apples on this island , ” she says .
“ There are boys and girls who go over the bridge and steal .
They break into people ’s houses here .
And because it ’s a small community , everybody knows who they are . ”
The Camano Island Chamber of Commerce boasts 135 members , most of them of the mom-and - pop variety like the Elger Bay Café , though a few are higher - end shops like the fashion boutique Doncaster and Dusty Cellars , a winery .
Just over the bridge , across the line that separates Island County from Snohomish County , is the town of Stanwood .
If Camano is a sleepy island refuge for residents who prefer not to be bothered , Stanwood is its conjoined but non-identical twin .
Recent years have seen an uptick in development along the section of State Highway 532 that serves as the otherwise quaint town ’s main thoroughfare .
Big - box stores have sprung up , in some cases directly next to worn - out homes whose owners have yet to be bought out .
The retail development seen in Stanwood “ may not be the kind of development that they want ” on Camano , says Dean .
In true islander form , some have developed a somewhat standoffish attitude toward those living on the “ mainland . ”
An article in the most recent edition of the Crab Cracker , a local community newsletter , laments the bygone days when local youth spent Halloween on the island instead of being driven to the suburb of “ Stanwoodopolis ” to collect piles of candy .
“ There are some people who would prefer it if a gate were placed at the entrance to keep everyone who is not from Camano Island out , ” jokes Morgan .
Across the water the feeling is mutual , at least in regard to Harris - Moore .
It was in Stanwood that his criminal activity began in earnest , and its citizens do n’t particularly enjoy the association .
At the Stanwood Hotel and Saloon , Mike McCarthey looks up from his beer to inquire why anyone would still be interested in Colton Harris - Moore .
“ That kid does n’t need any more publicity , ” he says .
“ And you do realize he ’s not from here , right ? ”
On the lam in 2006 , Harris - Moore crashed with friends when he could and camped on his mother ’s land when he could n’t .
But sometimes he ’d stay inside one of the many empty vacation homes that dot the island .
He ’d had years to learn the migratory patterns of Camano Island ’s residents , and now he took full advantage .
“ As near as we could tell , it was kind of like this Goldilocks thing , ” says Shauna Snyder .
A former investigator with the Island County Public Defender ’s Association , Snyder worked for Harris - Moore ’s defense team during his 2007 trial .
“ Here you have this kid who grew up in a double - wide , and there he is in a mansion .
Sometimes he would n’t take anything more than a can of soup .
He just wanted to be there . ”
During this particular six - month stint eluding the authorities , Harris - Moore would break into a home , eat , take what supplies he could , and use stolen credit - card numbers and the home ’s Internet connection to purchase other items he thought would be useful .
Theft reports began pouring in from residents across the island .
Eventually , Harris - Moore amassed a trove of survival gear — police scanners , clothing , bear - grade pepper spray — much of which he had delivered to island residences under false names , intercepting the packages before the homeowners returned .
He also allegedly used a pilfered credit card to pay for membership to a male pornography Web site called barelytwinks.com , though Snyder believes that this purchase was attributed to Harris - Moore by the card ’s embarrassed owner .
Evading capture proved more difficult .
Contrary to legend , on multiple occasions Island County Sheriff ’s deputies almost caught Harris - Moore , with each incident report containing some derivation of “ Colton Harris - Moore got away . ”
Weeks after he decamped for the wilderness , deputies served a warrant for Harris - Moore ’s arrest at his mother ’s house .
According to police reports , he went crashing through the woods just as police arrived .
While searching for him , the cops stumbled on a tent he ’d set up on the southwest corner of the property .
Harris - Moore ’s dog Melanie was there , and inside the tent , deputies found several thousand dollars ’ worth of property they identified as stolen .
“ It was like he was hoarding it all , ” says Snyder .
Deputies found a Christmas shopping list ’s–worth of stolen goods , but as Snyder would later discover , there was no evidence that Harris - Moore had the means or inclination to sell any of it .
“ Normally , someone is going to try and make some money off of what they steal , but not him , ” she says .
“ There just was n’t any rhyme or reason to it . ”
Nor did he make any especially large purchases with the credit cards police found in his possession .
“ I ’m not sure if he ever knew , but some of the cards had limits in the thousands of dollars , ” says Snyder .
“ It was like , ‘ Dude , you could have been in the Bahamas . ' ”
When his mother returned home to find the deputies ’ note attached to her door , she provided them with a message her son had left for the cops before he fled .
“ Mom , cops were here …everything ’s on lockdown .
I ’m leaving 4 - Wennachi … wo n’t be back est. 2 month .
I ’ll contact you they took Melanie .
I ’m going to have my affiliates take care of that .
P.S. – Cops wanna play huh !?
Well its no lil game ….. It ’s war ! & tell them that . ”
[ Ellipses his . ]
They heard , and turned to a relatively new weapon in the law enforcer ’s arsenal : tracking his movements via the Internet .
Each time they suspected Harris - Moore had broken into a residence , investigators checked the past day ’s Internet activity .
Eventually they turned up his e-mail address , mellenie010@hotmail.com , named for his dog .
They also found his MySpace page , where under “ occupation ” Harris - Moore had entered the word “ pilot . ”
By then , Island County Sheriff Mark Brown had created a detail whose sole purpose was to track down Harris - Moore .
Police began pulling overtime shifts trying to facilitate his capture — made all the more imperative , said police , after he allegedly stole a pistol from a police cruiser .
“ Wanted ” posters with the teen ’s mug shot were posted around the island .
Upon his election to office in January 2007 , Brown announced that capturing Harris - Moore would be one of his top priorities , later telling the Herald that not only would Harris - Moore be caught and prosecuted , but so would anyone giving him shelter .
“ Make no mistake , we intend to prosecute anyone assisting him to the fullest extent , ” said Brown .
On Friday , February 9 , 2007 , Island County undersheriff Kelly Mauck sent out a press release containing a message for Colton Harris - Moore .
“ You will be caught , ” he said .
“ You are hurting the citizens of our community , and you are unnecessarily putting yourself and others in harm ’s way . ”
Hours later , the department received a tip from a south Camano Island resident who had noticed a light turned on in a home that was supposed to have been vacant .
The residents were on vacation , said the tipster .
More than a dozen sheriff ’s deputies and other law - enforcement agents then converged on the two - story bungalow , whose back end opens out to a clear view of Skagit Bay .
By the time police confirmed that Harris - Moore was indeed inside the home , he was on the phone with his mother .
Pamela Kohler was picked up from her home and brought to the scene .
After a “ lengthy negotiation , ” Harris - Moore finally surrendered .
All told , Harris - Moore had reportedly stolen nearly $ 30,000 in goods from his fellow Camano Island residents .
After a seven - month manhunt , Harris - Moore was back in custody .
From a 16 - year - old fugitive ’s perspective , it could not have been worse .
Harris - Moore was remanded to the Island County juvenile detention center on Whidbey Island .
Prosecutors charged him with 23 counts of burglary and possession of stolen property .
The coming months promised an seemingly endless series of tedious meetings with lawyers , and worse , a “ structured environment , ” a thinly veiled euphemism for school .
The chase was over , and still there remained some bravado .
“ He was n’t willing to plead , ” says Snyder .
“ In his mind , the cops had n’t put it all together , and he thought he could beat the charges . ”
After the state ’s evidence was all laid out for Harris - Moore , however , he changed his tune .
His court - appointed lawyer , Rachel Miyoshi , negotiated a plea agreement that slashed the number of charges against him from 23 to three .
With Miyoshi’s help , he ’d be out in three to four years depending on his behavior , potentially making him a free man by age 19 .
“ I ’m not sure if it ’s like his mother says and he ’s three IQ points behind Einstein , but you ’d have to be an idiot not to take that deal , ” says Snyder .
Which is why Snyder and Miyoshi were both surprised when news broke of Harris - Moore ’s escape .
By that time , Harris - Moore had been transferred from Green Hill School , the state ’s maximum - security juvenile detention facility in Chehalis , to the Griffin Home , a comparatively soft - core facility in Renton .
Documents obtained from the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration paint a picture of an inmate whose rehabilitation was going reasonably well .
“ He was willing to work on treatment needs , ” wrote Sarah Pemble , the Griffin Home ’s Clinical Program Manager , in her assessment .
But staff also observed that Harris - Moore would “ victimize his peers , ” calling them names and invalidating their responses during group - therapy sessions in an attempt to gain status , according to the report .
On the night of his escape , April 29 , 2008 , he was present for an early bed check at 8:40 .
By 9:45 , the time of the next bed check , he had escaped through a window .
Staff at the Griffin Home searched the grounds to no avail .
“ Colton is just this mystery , ” says Snyder .
“ Nothing he does has a rhyme or reason . ”
But in his 2007 evaluation , Dr. Delton Young wrote that Harris - Moore “ suffers significant anxiety being in detention and worrying about how long he will be incarcerated . ”
Young also noted that Harris - Moore occasionally had anxiety attacks while he was on the run prior to his capture .
“ I knew I would get caught , ” he told the psychiatrist .
Now he was on the run again — only this time it would n’t be just one law - enforcement agency chasing him , but several .
Before dawn on November 12 , 2008 , the Eastsound Airport on Orcas Island was empty .
Beatrice von Tobel and the rest of the airport ’s employees would not arrive for a few hours .
But the small runway , as always , was lit .
It ’s unclear how well - laid - out Harris - Moore ’s plan was , or if he ’d chosen his targeted plane before or after he arrived .
A notorious quirk in the design of the Cessna 182 allows for keyless start - up , making it an obvious target .
And so the suspect walked up to the single - plane hangar , entered the airplane , and then quite literally took off .
Hours later , the plane ’s owner , Bob Rivers , the morning - zoo DJ at Seattle ’s KZOK , received a phone call from the Yakima County Sheriff ’s Department saying that the plane had been found crashed some 300 miles east of its previous parking spot .
The suspect had made a “ hard landing ” on the Yakama Indian reservation , damaging the plane , and police found vomit in the cockpit .
Rivers declined to comment for this article , but he addressed the theft for the first time on his radio show in early October .
“ I do n’t buy this folk - hero stuff , ” he later told The Seattle Times .
“ I was furious that something like this could happen .
I really want him caught . ”
Shortly after his reappearance on Camano in 2008 , folks on the island began to wonder if Harris - Moore had decided to take the summer off .
Reported burglaries went down .
Many wondered if he ’d moved on .
That ’s when authorities in San Juan County , northwest of Island County , began noticing an uptick in reported thefts .
Harris - Moore was later officially named a suspect in more than 30 burglaries there , and another dozen in Whatcom and Kitsap Counties .
( Seattle Weekly made repeated attempts to solicit comment from the Island County Sheriff ’s Department and the San Juan County Sheriff ’s Department .
Neither responded . )
On September 11 , 2009 , a Cirrus model SR22 ( average price , $ 500,000 ) was stolen from Friday Harbor and flown due east to Orcas Island where it landed — hard .
Harris - Moore got away , eluding the San Juan County Sheriff ’s deputy who had spotted him .
Harris - Moore had always wanted to fly .
Police retrieved flight - training manuals from his stash following one of his near - captures , and suspect that he learned from them and from Internet programs designed to educate newbies in the basics of flight .
His aunt , however , does n’t buy it .
“ What does he know about flying ? ” she asks , cantankerously denying that someone without any formal training could steal , much less pilot , a single - engine airplane .
Von Tobel , longtime pilot and manager of the Eastsound Airport , is only slightly less skeptical .
You could fly a plane without having had any formal instruction , she says , “ but I would n’t try it . ”
As the news spread , Harris - Moore became less an elusive teenage criminal than a folk hero , as observers began lauding his willingness to defy authority and his brazenness .
Or his popularity could be due to the cinematic qualities of his story — classic Internet fodder that can take on a life of its own .
A Facebook fan page dedicated to Harris - Moore boasts the rallying cry “ Fly , Colton .
Fly . ”
Cable news outlets took notice ; Kohler appeared on FOX News with Shepard Smith , who predictably wagged his finger at her failures as a parent .
Since felonious lifestyles often make best - selling narratives , a book is also in the works .
What ’s more , film producers began to contact area media outlets , including SW , hoping to obtain Harris - Moore ’s contact information , casting him as a backwoods Abagnale , his story writ large across the screen .
“ If you were as famous as he is now , ” says Puttmann , “ would you turn yourself in ? ”
By continuing to elude the authorities , Harris - Moore is answering his aunt ’s question without saying a word .

Since being formalized as an Open Geospatial Consortium standard , KML has become something of a lingua franca for geospatial information .
From humble beginnings in Google Earth , KML support can now be found in a wide variety of mapping products and services .
Today we ’re happy to add Maps API v3 to this list with the introduction of the new KmlLayer class .
The KmlLayer class enables KML or GeoRSS files that are hosted on publicly accessible web sites to be rendered in a Maps API v3 application .
The KmlLayer class is just one of several new layer classes we ’re adding to Maps API v3 today .
A layer class handles a collection of overlays that are added to the map as a single entity .
In addition to the KmlLayer class , we are also adding a TrafficLayer class and a BicyclingLayer class .
The TrafficLayer class adds real time color coding of traffic speed on highways and major arterial roads .
The BicyclingLayer class adds information about bike trails , lanes and recommended roads for bicyling onto the map :
A dark green line indicates a dedicated bike - only trail ;
A light green line indicates a dedicated bike lane along a road ;
A dashed green line indicates roads that are designated as preferred for bicycling , but without dedicated lanes
If you generate bicycling routes using the DirectionsService class , and display them on the map using a DirectionsRenderer , the BicyclingLayer is now added to the map with the route .
You can use the map below to try out these new layers and check how your own KML files are rendered by the KmlLayer class :
If you have any questions about these new layers , or the Maps API v3 in general , we recommend that you join the Maps API v3 Google Group .

It is so awful as to be unbelievable .
But it did happen , in Australia , Germany , the US , Ireland and elsewhere .
Catholics have to accept that fact , and that for too long church leaders allowed themselves to be hoodwinked by paedophiles , who are by nature , brilliantly deceptive .
This was an important lesson from the Wood royal commission ; paedophilia is often unchecked because of the naivety of people who cannot bring themselves to believe it is occurring .
As we saw from the trials of the Sydney paedophiles Robert '' Dolly ' ' Dunn and Philip Bell , the predators use positions of power in an institution to gain access to children and escape detection .
They are endlessly patient , willing to performing hundreds or thousands of good works for every foul deed .
God knows what drives them except a desire to extinguish what is most good and pure about humanity .
We know also some paedophiles were themselves victims as children , which makes you shudder from sympathy for the tragic child who grew to such a monster .
Just to contemplate the depths of human depravity can make you wonder about the value of life at all .
But it also has to be said that if paedophilia seems to be on the increase , it has been enabled by the eroticisation of our culture over decades , and even priests are not immune .
Why , for instance , should the Dutch be surprised by the launch in 2006 of a paedophile party , the Charity , Freedom and Diversity ( NVD ) party , which wanted to cut the age of consent from 16 to 12 .
Since dissolved , it was just another step in the continuum of social disorder in which the taboos and social norms protecting children break down .
In a similar vein were moves in 2003 by psychiatrists at an American Psychiatric Association conference to stop classifying paedophilia as a mental disorder , thus normalising it as just another sexual preference .
It is the Catholic Church that has been most vocal about the breakdown of moral order , from paedophilia to abortion .
And this has made it a target of those who object to moralising they regard as an infringement of their freedoms .
But it is no use saying paedophilia exists everywhere else even though it does , because the church is meant to be better .
And defensive pronouncements from the Vatican and other church leaders have been needlessly provocative diversions - one has linked homosexuality and paedophilia and another claimed the church is being attacked because it is anti-abortion .
This is not helpful .
Nor is attacking the media .
The Pope may have made mistakes , but his letter to Irish Catholics last month could not have been more frank , humbly penitent , or condemnatory of predator priests and the bishops who failed to stop them .
To the victims , he wrote : '' You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry .
I know that nothing can undo the wrong you have endured .
Your trust has been betrayed and your dignity has been violated .
Many of you found that , when you were courageous enough to speak of what happened to you , no one would listen . . .
It is understandable that you find it hard to forgive or be reconciled with the church .
In her name , I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel . ''
To the abusive priests he wrote : '' You betrayed the trust that was placed in you by innocent young people and their parents , and you must answer for it before Almighty God and before properly constituted tribunals . ''
Yet the baying from atheists and fellow travellers for the biggest scalp of all has only escalated .
The process is not unfamiliar to people who have lived under communist rule when destruction of the church was a goal .
Professor Piotr Jaroszynski from Poland 's Catholic University of Lublin has written in the Catholic country 's mass newspaper that the offensive against the Pope is recognisable particularly to Poles who lived under communist rule .
'' It has elements that have been very well planned , rational to the extreme , but at the same time there is a singular hatred for Catholicism hidden under concern for victim . ''
The struggle against religion has taken the form of a new religion .
Its new priests '' find their greatest ideological enemies in priests , religious brothers , and sisters .
They cannot physically destroy them ( as was done in communist countries ) , so they try other methods . ''

What is the motive : to destroy the credibility of the strongest moral voice left ?
Would the world be a better place without the Catholic Church ?
Without Christianity ?
That is the end point of this game , which should frighten everyone , whether religious or not .

“ When we consider the presence of North Korea and the state of the wider region , it is clear that we must maintain the Japan - U.S. alliance as a deterrent force , and that we must ask Okinawa to bear some of that burden , ” he said after the meeting with local leaders .

In his first visit to Okinawa since he became prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , center , heard from residents of the island , home to a Marine air base .
Credit ... Kimimasa Mayama / European Pressphoto Agency
“ It has become clear from our negotiations with the Americans that we cannot ask them to relocate the base to too far - flung a location , ” he said .
Mr. Hatoyama still has not divulged the specifics of his plan .
But it is widely expected that it will involve the small island of Tokunoshima , where since January , when word got out , residents have marshaled their resources for a fight .
Tokunoshima , a small , semitropical island located between Okinawa and Japan ’s main islands and blanketed with fields of sugar cane , was mentioned as a possible site for training activities and up to 1,000 of Futenma ’s 2,500 Marines , said Takeshi Tokuda , the island ’s representative in the lower house of Parliament , who was briefed on the plan .
But enraged islanders vowed that the move would never happen .
“ If he comes , our old people and mothers with children will sit in the street to block his way , ” Seiichi Yoshitama , 65 , a coffee farmer , said of Mr. Hatoyama .
“ We ’ll even use our fighting bulls to stop him . ”
They have held a series of increasingly large anti-base rallies , the largest on April 18 , when more than half of the island ’s 26,000 residents gathered , organizers said .
The mood on Tokunoshima is now overwhelmingly against the plan .
The main road along the coast is lined with hand - painted signs saying “ No Base ! ”
The mayors of the island ’s three towns agreed on Saturday to meet with the prime minister , but only to express their opposition in person , they say .
At least 60,500 federal and state prison inmates were sexually abused at their current facility in the preceding year alone , according to a 2007 nationwide study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) .
A similar study revealed that nearly 25,000 county jail detainees were sexually abused in the prior six months .
This violence is not limited to adult prisoners – in January , another BJS report found that almost one in eight youth in juvenile detention reported being sexually abused in the preceding year ; at the worst facilities , one in three kids were victimized .
When Bryson Martel was sentenced to six years in prison for check fraud , he was 28 years old , weighed 123 pounds , and was scared to death .
He had good reason to be afraid .
Within weeks of his arrival , he was beaten and raped at knifepoint .
Martel reported the assault to staff , who moved him to “ protective custody ” – into a cell with a known rapist .
Days later , he was raped again .
Prison authorities should have taken particular care to protect Martel ’s safety , knowing that he was a target for abuse .
They did n’t , and the assaults continued .
Over the course of nine months , Martel estimates he was raped by 27 different people .
Ultimately , he was infected with HIV , and now has full - blown AIDS .
“ I know I had to pay the price for what I did , but I ’ve paid double , ” Martel says .
“ That check I wrote cost me my life . ”

Martel ’s experience is far from unique .
At least 60,500 federal and state prison inmates were sexually abused at their current facility in the preceding year alone , according to a 2007 nationwide study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) .
A similar study revealed that nearly 25,000 county jail detainees were sexually abused in the prior six months .
This violence is not limited to adult prisoners – in January , another BJS report found that almost one in eight youth in juvenile detention reported being sexually abused in the preceding year ; at the worst facilities , one in three kids were victimized .
No matter where it occurs , sexual violence shatters lives .
Unlike rape survivors in the community , however , survivors behind bars often have no choice but to suffer in silence .
Prison mental health counselors rarely have expertise in sexual assault , and they cannot provide confidential services .
Because of the danger of being labeled a “ snitch , ” fear of retaliation , and lack of trust in corrections officials , most incarcerated survivors are too afraid to report an assault and so avoid the limited counseling available from prison staff .
This , in turn , leads to long - term emotional trauma and untreated medical conditions .
Women behind bars , who may become pregnant from rapes committed by male staff , lack access to the full range of reproductive health options .
Many victimized inmates are infected with HIV and other STDs , which are far more prevalent among prisoners than in the community at large .
Yet corrections facilities often fail to provide proper screening and treatment for STDs .
In short , sexual violence behind bars is a public health and a human rights crisis .
Disturbingly , many corrections officials continue to deny that sexual abuse is a problem in their facilities .
Such indifference is reinforced by misguided public perceptions that prisoner rape is inevitable , or , even worse , a joke .
“ Guards knew what was happening and looked the other way , ” says Troy Erik Isaac , who was raped at age 12 in a California juvenile facility .
“ People would take advantage of me and I just did n’t know how to get help . ”
Officials are required to protect inmates in their charge .
Nothing could be more grotesquely opposed to this responsibility than sexually abusing them .
Yet the BJS reports consistently showed that staff – - not other inmates - –were responsible for most sexual victimization .
Even more appalling , staff sexual abuse is particularly common in juvenile facilities , where the BJS found that corrections staff perpetrated more than 80 percent of the reported abuse .
Survivor Chino Hardin describes her experience in a New York juvenile facility : “ The corrections officers allowed certain boys to enter the cells of girls that the officers did not like or said were not behaving well .
I often heard girls screaming in fear at two or three o’clock in the morning .
In my one month there , three different girls told me they were raped by boys who corrections officers allowed into their cells .
I was terrified and did my best to keep a low profile so that I would not be targeted . ”
Hardin ’s story is heartbreakingly common , yet prisoner rape is preventable – it is not an unavoidable part of incarceration .
While some facilities are plagued by sexual abuse , others are virtually free from it .
Stopping sexual violence in detention is a matter of committed leadership , strong policies , and sound practices .
For example , facilities that consistently separate detainees who are vulnerable to abuse ( such as gay and transgender inmates ) from likely predators are able to reduce sexual violence dramatically .
Safe and well - run facilities make it clear to staff and inmates – in policy as well as practice – that sexual abuse simply will not be tolerated .
The Constitution bars corrections agencies from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment , and the Supreme Court has recognized that prisoner rape may amount to such a constitutional violation .
In addition , rape and sexual abuse is illegal throughout the country .
Nevertheless , prisoners and advocates face tremendous barriers when seeking to hold officials accountable for failing to protect inmates .
For example , federal law requires inmates who have been sexually assaulted while incarcerated to navigate the full internal grievance process at their facility before going to court – no matter how complicated , unrealistic , or illogical that process may be .
Any misstep and a judge must dismiss the lawsuit .
The courts play a meaningful role in holding public institutions accountable for civil rights violations – absent this oversight , impunity reigns and prisoner rape flourishes .
But now we have a tool that could significantly improve safety behind bars .
Last June , the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission issued recommended standards to address sexual abuse in all forms of detention .
The federal Prison Rape Elimination
Act of 2003 , passed by a unanimous Congress , created the Commission and mandated the drafting of the standards .
Developing the standards was no slap - dash effort .
They are the result of almost six years of deliberation , public hearings , and review .
Corrections officials , advocates , legal experts , and survivors of prisoner rape all contributed to the process .
The final recommendations represent a hard - reached compromise among these different stakeholders .
Bold , yet basic , these common - sense measures have the potential to become the most powerful tool so far in the effort to end sexual abuse in detention .
The standards address core issues such as staff training , detainee education , housing , investigations , and medical and mental health care in the aftermath of an assault .
They make it clear that prisoner rape can be prevented , and that there are straightforward steps prisons and jails can take to end this type of violence .
The standards draw on best practices already in use around the country and some corrections agencies are working to implement them even before they are required to do so .
The Prison Rape Elimination
Act gave the Attorney General one year from the release of the standards to review and codify them as federal regulations , making them binding on all detention facilities in the country .
But after well over nine months , it is clear that Attorney General Eric Holder will not make the deadline of June 23 , 2010 .
It may be another year – or more – before Holder releases the final guidelines .
In that time , thousands and thousands more adults and children will be raped behind bars .
Some corrections leaders are happy to delay the implementation of the standards .
Alarmingly , leading corrections associations are challenging key provisions , including requirements that cross - gender supervision be limited in areas where inmates are nude and that all facilities undergo regular external audits .
Such measures – already in place in the rest of the developed world – could dramatically lower the levels of prisoner rape in the United States .
According to opponents , however , they are too costly .
In response to such criticism , the Justice Department has commissioned a cost projection study of the standards that is both biased and delaying the review process .
The study is not a cost - benefit analysis ; it fails to account for the enormous benefits of the standards and is based solely on estimated expenses provided by corrections administrators .
Corrections officials who oppose the standards have an obvious incentive to exaggerate their anticipated costs — and so do officials who support the standards , since they also want and need more funding than is usually appropriated .
The argument that it is too expensive to stop prisoner rape is not only morally questionable , but also incorrect .
In reality , any prison or jail that has basic policies and practices in place to protect its detainees , as all detention facilities are legally required to do , will not incur substantial costs by complying with the standards .
Sexual abuse in detention costs states millions of dollars every year in prisoner abuse lawsuits alone .
When victims require medical care , as they often do , corrections systems must cover the cost .
Inmates who are traumatized while incarcerated suffer long - term harm that often prevents them from becoming self - sufficient members of society upon release .
Making the standards binding on corrections agencies will reduce these costs – and it ’s simply the right thing to do .
In an important step forward , the Department of Justice opened a public comment period on March 10 , 2010 .
The Department is seeking input on the standards generally , and has posed three specific questions regarding the terminology , the costs of implementation , and compliance requirements .
If history is any guide , corrections officials and their lobbyists will weigh in en masse , opposing the standards .
During the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission ’s public comment period in 2008 , on a draft version of the standards , more than 100 corrections departments and associations submitted comments .
Right now , supportive public comments are vital to ensuring that the Attorney General promulgates strong standards .
Just Detention International has mobilized a coalition to demonstrate the strong support for the standards that exists across U.S. society — including among corrections officials who recognize the urgency of ending prisoner rape and understand the importance of the standards .
Members of the Raising the Bar for Justice and Safety Coalition are submitting comments urging the Attorney General to enact the standards fully and quickly .
Anyone who cares about ending sexual abuse behind bars can send letters in support of the standards to Justice Department .
Survivors of sexual violence know first - hand about the urgent need for the standards .
Kimberly Yates was raped repeatedly by an officer at a federal detention center .
The officer who assaulted her had previously raped at least four other women – and some of them had told the authorities , but nothing was done .
“ If the national standards had been in place , I might never have been raped , ” says Yates .
“ How many women could the Bureau of Prisons have spared if they had taken notice of what they were told ? ”
The effort to end prisoner rape is at a watershed moment .
Sexual abuse behind bars is a serious human rights violation and an affront to our society ’s most basic values .
With the power to stop this abuse , there is no excuse for dawdling .
It ’s time for Attorney General Holder and President Obama to demonstrate their commitment to ending this shocking violence by codifying the national standards .
The iPhone 4 is Apple 's " biggest leap since the original iPhone , " at least according to Steven P. Jobs speaking at the WWDC 2010 keynote .
Indeed , in the three years since Apple first introduced the iPhone , the device has come quite far .
At the same time , the basic concepts behind the iPhone have remained very consistent over the years .
Despite regular modifications to the OS and yearly hardware upgrades , the iPhone 4 is very much a more modern , more capable version of that original device that made such a splash in the industry back in 2007 .
We 're not living with our heads in the sand : if you have come to hate the iPhone , walled gardens for developers , and everything Apple stands for , you will likely hate the iPhone 4 , and there 's nothing anyone can say to change your mind .
Luckily for you , Apple is no longer competing against the saddest of the sad : there are now plenty of solid phones from other manufacturers that have multitouch screens , app stores of their own , great cameras , and much more extensible OSs .
If you are curious about Apple 's latest offering , however , read on .
The iPhone 4 is not without its flaws — some of them more serious than others — but the device remains a really cool evolution in Apple 's lineup .
( We have already reviewed the majority of the OS , now called iOS 4 , in a separate review .
If you 're looking to read about our impressions of the features in iOS 4 , go read that one first and come back .
This review is focused on the hardware of the new iPhone and on specific parts of iOS 4 that are limited to the iPhone 4 . )
What you get in your grubby little hands
The iPhone 4 comes with the same accessories that iPhones have come with since the iPhone 3G launched in 2008 ( sans microfiber cloth ) : a wall plug , a syncing cable , and a set of Apple earbuds with a built - in mic .
The device does not come with a dock — that costs extra , to the tune of $ 30 — but a dock is n't necessary in order to use it with a computer .
( I prefer using a dock at my desk , however , so I always find myself forking over the dock tax . )
The phone itself , as you likely already know , has a completely new design compared to previous generations of iPhones .
Gone is the curved back of the iPhone 3GS and 3G , and the plastic has given way to glass .
The iPhone 4 is flat from top to bottom , making it considerably thinner than its predecessor : 0.37 inches thick versus the 0.48 of the 3GS / 3G .
Otherwise , it 's basically the same overall shape : 4.5 inches tall ( same as previous iPhones ) and 2.31 inches wide ( slightly thinner ) .
i Phone 4 on the left , 3GS on the right
The iPhone 4 on the left is 24 percent thinner than the 3GS on the right
You might think that the 0.11 inch difference would n't be all that noticeable , and it does n't even look like much in the picture , but it is — possibly because the back is now flat and does n't have the same " fat " feeling of the 3GS and 3G .
For comparison 's sake , the HTC Evo is also 0.47 inches thick , almost the same as the iPhone 3GS , but otherwise has very similar dimensions to the iPhone 4 ( 4.63 inches tall and 2.3 inches wide ) .
Weight - wise , they are all similar as well : the iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS are both 4.8oz. var randomnumber=Math.floor( Math.random ( ) * 11 ) ; var ___testing = false ; if ( randomnumber % 2 ) { var loc = window.location.pathname ; ___testing = true ; document . write ( ' Next page : My what a nice display !

The Four Stages of Economic Collapse
Are you still bullish ?
As I write , the notion of a unified Europe is literally going up in smoke .
Greece has yet to confirm a bailout ( four months into this ridiculous comedy ) , Spain and Portugal have both been slapped with credit downgrades .
These problems are hardly unique as the below chart reveals :
Europe , particularly Greece , should be viewed as a “ trial run ” for what will eventually be hitting the US .
The key items to note in Greece are :
Obvious issues taking time to hit the market / people “ Extend and pretend ” without doing anything / affecting any change Civil unrest , political failure , the “ blame game ” Debt default / currency devaluation
First off , I want to point out the Greece Crisis was staring everyone in the face for years .
Greece ’s debt did not suddenly become an issue overnight .
As far back as 2006 the Greek deficit was out of control ( and this was BEFORE we knew that Greece was using derivatives with Goldman Sachs to hide its true debt levels ) .
So this tells us right up front that those who actually look into the numbers were well aware that Greece had problems years ago .
Again , the Greece Crisis was staring everyone in the face for years .
It did not suddenly erupt overnight .
Secondly , the Greek Crisis tells us that once a Crisis erupts , it takes months to be resolved .
Greece ’s Crisis went “ mainstream ” in December / January .
Here we are nearing May and nothing has yet been resolved .
At this point I can think of at least five or six times that we ’ve had “ rumors ” of a bailout coming soon , only to find that they were all false .
So we know that even when Crises go mainstream , the powers that be will do everything they can to simply “ extend and pretend ” without resolving anything .
This brings us to our next point : the Blame Game .
Greece has not been bailed out yet .
We ’ve seen a lot of posturing , finger pointing , and rumors , but no concrete action has been taken yet .
The politicians have blamed financial speculators ( as if a short - seller is responsible for Greece running up deficits and absurd debts ) and even their would - be saviors ( the Germans ) .
This will happen in the US too , and most likely financial speculators will bear the brunt of the blame .
Meanwhile the Greece populace is erupting into full - blown riots .
A bomb went off at the JP Morgan office in Athens .
All of this will occur on an even bigger scale when these issues hit the US ’s shores .
The end result here will be same as in Greece : ultimately default .
You can bail out an issue for a time and play “ extend and pretend ” but ultimately you cannot solve a debt problem with more debt .
The only real solution is default ( hyperinflation is also possible but less likely if history is a guide ) .
This is why I ’ve been telling everyone to prepare well in advance for what is to come .
I realize I am quite early on all of this .
It took more than three years for Greek ’s obvious debt issues to hit the mainstream .
I have no idea how long it will be before similar Crises hit the US ’s shores ( if not for QE it likely would have already happened ) .
Regardless , at some point these issues will hit the US .
When they do , we ’ll go through everything Greece is going through .
The ultimate result will likely be default .
However , until then , the Fed and other central bankers will attempt to inflate our issues away .
Which will lead to inflation taking hold .
Indeed , it already is .
‘ Super Easy ’ BOE Policy May End to Curb Inflation
The U.K. ’s inflation rate jumped to 3.4 percent in March , exceeding the government ’s 3 percent limit , stoked by higher energy costs and the weakness of the pound .
Bank of England officials pledged to monitor price expectations closely because the inflation outlook is a source of concern to some of them , according to the minutes of their April 8 meeting .
Faster inflation “ is starting to rub off on consumer and market expectations , ” Kounis , an Amsterdambased economist who is a former U.K .
Treasury official , said in a telephone interview .
“ This monetary policy stance that ’s super , super easy is inappropriate .
They will have to take some of that accommodation away . ”

Wholesale prices rise in March as food costs jump
Wholesale prices rose more than expected last month as food prices surged by the most in 26 years .
But excluding food and energy , prices were nearly flat .

India Food Inflation Quickens ; Rains May Cool Prices
India ’s food inflation accelerated ahead of a report tomorrow that may show monsoon rains this year will be sufficient to cool farm prices .
An index measuring wholesale prices of agriculture products including lentils , rice and vegetables compiled by the commerce ministry rose 17.65 percent in the week ended April 10 from a year earlier .
It gained 17.22 percent the previous week , according to a statement in New Delhi today .

Inflationary fears are gripping the markets .
On that note , Gold has broken out of its trading range of the last four months :
This is a strong signal to buy .
If Gold remains above $ 1,150 , we ’re likely going to see a re-test of the December highs .
I ’ve been bullish on Gold Since mid March .
And my clients are already up double digits on our position .

At least two influential unions will spend close to $ 100 million on the 2010 election , with most of those funds going to protect incumbents .
Union officials told The Hill they plan to help endangered members — particularly freshmen — who made politically difficult votes in a year during which an anti-incumbent mood has filled the country .

And the number will be even higher since the AFL - CIO declined to give its figures .
While the labor movement has displayed an aggressive tack in Democratic primaries , including supporting some challengers over incumbents , it remains concerned about the party retaining its congressional majorities .
As a result , it plans an enormous spending spree to help ensure Democratic control of Congress .
The American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) plans to spend in excess of $ 50 million during the 2010 campaign , part of which will fund “ a massive incumbent protection program , ” according to Gerry McEntee , president of the union .
AFSCME spent roughly $ 67 million on its political activities in 2008 .
But the $ 50 million slated for the 2010 elections is the largest expenditure the union will make in a midterm election , according to union officials .
The money will go to help defend the union ’s top tier of eight Senate seats and 34 House members .
“ We have got to protect the incumbency in the House .
We have got to protect the incumbency in the Senate , ” McEntee said .
“ It is going to be hard .
Those tea - baggers are out there .
There is an anti-incumbency mood out there . ”
After the top tier , there will be a second tier of House candidates AFSCME will be monitoring and will step in to help defend if they become endangered by GOP challengers .
“ We are not out there looking for new seats .
We have our hands full the way it is , ” said McEntee , who has been a key voice in pushing labor to play in Democratic primaries .
The Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) plans to spend $ 44 million in total on its 2010 election program .
The union spent $ 85 million on its 2008 campaign , according to union officials .
SEIU has a list of 15 top - priority House districts across the country that it plans to campaign in to protect members who voted for the healthcare reform bill .
Among those who will see support from the national union are Reps.
John Boccieri ( D - Ohio ) , Bill Foster George ( Bill ) William Foster81 Nobel laureates endorse Biden 's White House bid Trump payroll tax deferral finds few takers among businesses Former Obama Ebola czar Ron Klain says White House 's bad decisions have put US behind many other nations on COVID - 19 ; Fears of virus reemergence intensify MORE ( D - Ill. ) , Betsy Markey ( D - Colo . ) , Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) , Gary Peters ( D - Mich . ) and Dina Titus ( D - Nev. ) .
“ In the past , we have not paid as much attention to incumbent protection as we have this year , ” said Jon Youngdahl , national political director for the SEIU .
“ In the past , decisions were made on electoral opportunities and this year decisions are being made on the healthcare reform accountability . ”
For the SEIU , the 2010 campaign began in the fall of 2009 during the House ’s first healthcare reform vote .
The union has already spent $ 3 million on three rounds of television ads thanking members for backing the legislation .
A third labor group said it plans to spend big in 2010 but would n’t get into specific numbers .
Karen Ackerman , the AFL - CIO ’s political director , told reporters on Wednesday that the labor federation will be active in 18 states , will campaign in gubernatorial and Senate races and will likely have a role in 60 to 70 House races this election .
She declined to give a dollar amount .

“ The field is very large , maybe even more races than there was in 2008 , ” Ackerman said .
The AFL - CIO official said the labor movement sees 2010 as “ a very hard election , maybe the hardest yet ” and wants to see the “ many , many good progressive members of Congress ” return to Capitol Hill .

Based in a state with high unemployment and a high home foreclosure rate , Reid is facing a tough reelection race this year .
Consequentially , unions are revving up their general - election campaigns three months earlier than usual , as soon as Reid ’s Republican challenger is picked in the June 8 primary .
“ It ’s our single focus .
Harry Reid has done more for the state — more than anyone in history , ” said Danny Thompson , executive secretary - treasurer of the Nevada State AFL - CIO , which has more than 200,000 members .
The state labor federation has a three - pronged program in place : a worksite initiative , from construction sites to casinos , where workers will lobby other workers to vote for Reid , target union members for door - to - door campaigning and then direct - mail pieces paid for by the national union .
Thompson said he believes the labor vote will be key to Reid ’s reelection , estimating it makes up to 32 to 34 percent of the vote in Nevada .
“ We are right now putting everything in place .
The people who will be running the campaign are in place .
The structure is in place .
We are ready to go , ” Thompson said .
Another senator who will have stout labor backing is Barbara Boxer Barbara Levy BoxerThe Hill 's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Biden , Harris launch Trump offensive in first joint appearance Bottom line Polls show big bounce to Biden ahead of Super Tuesday MORE ( D - Calif . ) .
“ We are going to devote more resources to the 2010 campaign than we have ever done in any prior campaign , ” said Steve Smith , communications director of the California Labor Federation .
Electing California Attorney General Jerry Brown ( D ) as governor and reelecting Boxer to the Senate are the state federation ’s two highest priorities .
But the labor group is also looking to protect a trio of House members based in the Central Valley region who took tough votes in favor of healthcare reform .
California Reps. Dennis Cardoza ( D ) , Jim Costa ( D ) and Jerry McNerney ( D ) could be facing stiff GOP opposition this November .
Smith said the 2.1 million member - strong union has been preparing for months , microtargeting non-union members in the region who share the same priorities with labor to find more votes for the Democrats .
“ Given where they are , it ’s never an easy proposition .
We are going to make sure that we stand up and they are reelected and sent back to Congress , ” Smith said .
Unions are aware that some of the most endangered incumbents in 2010 are the freshmen who voted for the healthcare reform bill .

MORE ( D ) and Perriello .
“ Definitely , Tom Perriello will have priority with us , ” said Doris Crouse - Mays , the secretary - treasurer of the Virginia AFL - CIO .
“ Along with Gerry Connolly , they will definitely get protection for the healthcare vote . ”
The union has some 15,000 members in Connolly ’s district and 2,500 in Perriello ’s whom it plans to mobilize ahead of November .
Crouse - Mays said the union would also support Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - Va. ) , a 14 - term incumbent who did n’t vote for the healthcare bill .
“ He ’s still a 28 - year incumbent who ’s been there for working families in the past , ” she said .
In Illinois , unions are working to protect Foster and Rep. Debbie Halvorson ( D ) , two freshman members who voted for the healthcare bill .
“ The action is going to be in Halvorson and Foster , so we ’re going to put a lot of effort there , ” said Jerry Morrison , executive director of the SEIU ’s state council .
“ That would always be our first [ priority ] , especially in the off - year , to protect our incumbent allies .
There ’s going to be a lot of activity at the federal level this year . ”
The union plans to focus on voter registration , early voting and then get - out - the - vote efforts , Morrison said .
“ Debbie ’s district , the first time she ran , I think we registered 18,000 new voters in high - Democratic - performing precincts , which helped her . ”
Foster will have more difficulty this cycle because his district , which was formerly held by GOP Speaker Dennis Hastert , is more Republican .
“ It ’s just a tough district , ” Morrison said .
“ But Foster ’s been very good — he ’s taken some really tough votes and I think people are really energized to get out there and go work for him . ”

A similar strategy is being used in Ohio by the state ’s branch of the SEIU .
“ We have already made contributions to candidates who supported working families in Ohio , ” said Anthony Caldwell , a union spokesman .
Caldwell noted that freshman Reps. Boccieri , Mary Jo Kilroy ( D ) and Steve Driehaus ( D ) , who voted for healthcare reform , are all expected to have tough reelection races .
“ We want to make sure those folks return to Congress come January , ” he said .
One member who wo n’t be getting support : Rep. Zack Space ( D - Ohio ) .
He angered labor groups by voting against the healthcare bill and will have to go without their help in his reelection bid .
BEIJING — For businesswomen gathered at the 20th Global Summit of Women here last week , the title of a talk on the final day of the three - day event , “ Working Effectively With Men , ” was irresistible .
Women have wondered how to do that all their lives , the conference ’s organizer , Irene Natividad , had joked earlier in an interview .
“ I ’ve been at this for two decades , and it keeps popping up , ” the longtime women ’s rights advocate said .
“ So I thought , on this , our 20th summit , I ’ll have a stab at it . ”
Around a century after women won the right to enter parliaments in countries ranging from Azerbaijan to the United States , they are still greatly underrepresented in corporate boardrooms , according to a preliminary report released at the conference by Corporate Women Directors International , a group based in Washington that promotes women in business , and the World Bank ’s International Finance Corp .
Seeking answers , hundreds of women gathered around dozens of luncheon tables in a ballroom and listened intently as Ali Faramawy , vice president of Microsoft International , spilled the beans .
How could they work effectively with men ?
What do men say about their female colleagues when they leave the room ?

After a time , police began selecting particular members of the crowd for arrest .
At around 8 p.m. , the soaked and shivering detainees began volunteering to be arrested so they could get out of the rain .
Eventually there were two large groups of people , one in cuffs , each person with an officer next to them ; and a second in a large group hemmed in by dozens of officers in full riot gear .
Most of the people were in shorts or pants and T - shirts and tank tops .
“ I ’m freezing cold .
We have no food , no water , no shelter and I ’ve had to pee for the last five hours , ” Sammy Katz , a man detained in the intersection , told CP24 by phone from inside the corral .
Another detainee said he had a panic attack and was allowed to leave .
At about 9 p.m. , a man named Roop left the secured zone and crossed a line of police bikes north of the secure zone on Spadina .
He said he was released because he was a type 2 diabetic and said he needed medical care .
“ I ’ve been in there the whole time .
I ’ve never seen something like this before .
People are freezing and soaking wet .
I know they are saying we should have left , but not everyone heard them say that . ”
Also inside were three legal monitors with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association .
Ms. Des Rosiers said she had lost contact with the monitors and presumed they were arrested .
“ It ’s outrageous , ” she said , calling the police action an infringement of constitutional rights and “ abusive . ”
“ I ’ve been talking to them for the last hour and a half .
They wanted to leave .
We told them to leave , but they could not leave . ”

Image caption Recovery of the bodies : Difficult and dangerous
Between 20 and 25 bodies , thought to be the victims of drug gang violence , have been found in an abandoned silver mine in southern Mexico , officials say .
The bodies appeared to have been thrown down a 200 m ( 650 ft ) ventilation shaft over a period of time , police said .
The mine is near the city of Taxco in Guerrero state , a focal point for drug - related violence that has claimed some 23,000 lives nationwide since 2006 .
A tip - off from a person arrested on Friday sparked the search .
Police and soldiers have been using breathing equipment as they descend deep underground to recover the bodies .
Many of the corpses had their hands and feet tied , Mexican media reported .
The mine is located near Taxco , a colonial era city popular with tourists .
While much of the drug violence over the past four years has been in northern Mexico , in particular in areas bordering the US , other regions have not been immune .
Guerrero , in the south and with a Pacific coastline , has also seen vicious bouts of bloodshed amid bitter turf wars for control of the trade in illegal drugs .
Enough with the Math - Science Mania
I just finished watching President Obama ’s State of the Union speech .
Regarding education , the President said , “ Instead of funding the status quo , we only invest in reform – reform that raises student achievement , inspires students to excel in math and science , and turns around failing schools . ”
Do you see a problem with that statement ?
I do .
For me , the President ’s words imply a view of education that values quantitative subjects above all else .
After all , the only subjects he mentioned were math and science – areas that typically get assessed with standardized tests .
He did n’t point to topics such as writing , collaboration , languages , and , of particular interest to me , the arts .
I believe that my 30 years of teaching outfit me to say with some authority that the sorts of thinking that students require to be flexible learners and adept problem - solvers are n’t typically being taught in K - 12 math and science classes .
They could be , but when school districts ’ budgets hinge on how students score on government - mandated math and science tests ( as is the case with many schools today ) , their curricula inevitably become centered on test preparation , which can foster anti-creative mindsets .
As I see it , creativity gets stifled when children are pressured , above all else , to score well on standardized tests in which they ’re rewarded only for getting the ‘ right ’ answers and picking ‘ correct ’ responses on multiple - choice exams .
In such school cultures , students start thinking in absolutist , black - and - white sorts of ways , and mistakes become costly : wrong answers lower grades and can even undercut school funding .
Yet we all know that we learn best in environments that encourage experimentation and in which the error - and - revision process can proceed without students feeling shamed .
Sure , math and science skills are essential , but they are n’t the only skills that matter .
Nor are they necessarily the most important subjects for students to master .
Nor does the study of them have to supplant education in the arts .
In my book , The Musician ’s Way , the section titled “ Solving Problems ” ( p. 54 -70 ) points out the limitations of educational models that nurture narrow , convergent ways of thinking .
That is , a math problem will commonly have a single correct answer , but artistic problems and social predicaments can have numerous solutions .
Creative problem - solvers , therefore , think in divergent ways .
For us musicians , our artistic success depends on our ability to recognize , define , and solve problems in the practice studio and rehearsal hall .
We have to think both independently and collaboratively .
We have to try out various interpretive and technical ideas , weigh them , make choices , go forward , have things not work out , try other ideas , etc .
( See my post ‘ Constructive creativity ‘ ) .
I do n’t know about your experiences going to school , but in my math and science classes , little of that sort of creative thinking took place .
Instead , problems were set in front of us , and we were all expected to arrive at identical answers .
I ’m not suggesting that President Obama believes that we should scrap every subject other than math and science .
But when he talks about education and appears to tow the old math - science lines , then I feel obliged to speak out and say that students need a very different kind of education today than the one they ’re ordinarily receiving , an education that places arts and creativity at the center .
And the evidence is mounting that kids who receive arts educations out - think those who do not .
For instance , in a 2009 issue of Psychology of Music ( 37/3 ) , researchers Piro and Ortiz report that second graders who were given twice - weekly piano instruction dramatically improved their verbal scores by the end of the school year compared to a control group that had no music instruction .
Of course , the true value of arts education is n’t its power to help students excel in other subjects .
Arts education stands on its own merits , which include its capacity to stimulate creativity and integrated intelligence as well as bring about the beauty , self - actualization , and community - building that result from artistic expression and shared meaning .
In sum , I ca n’t sit back and let our nation ’s leaders promote educational systems that merely aspire to train workers to function in technically demanding jobs .
I hope that you ’ll join me in supporting educational systems that promote the sorts of creative , divergent thinking that made America great and that spawned the artists and innovators that we celebrate worldwide .

Do you believe that our school systems cultivate flexible , creative thinking ?
In what ways did your schooling help or hinder your creative powers ?

There are so many situations where the addition of a simple progress bar would make the user experience 1 million times more bearable .
Several years ago I had read about pipe viewer , or pv for short .
This is truly the answer to my progress bar prayers .
I cannot believe I had forgotten about such a nifty and useful tool .
It ’s been in existence so long , chances are good that you forgot about it too .
I ’ll just jump right in …
The project page describes it as ;
… a terminal - based tool for monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline .
It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing through , how long it has taken , how near to completion it is , and an estimate of how long it will be until completion .
It ’s hard to believe that Andrew Wood first produced this linux software gem waaay back in 2002 !
Its been around so long , I had trouble finding a 64 bit version of it …. like it really matters .
Anyway , if anyone cares ; I rebuilt the RPM for x86_64 and have it available here at dlaube.com .
If you are using the RPMforge repository , you can simply yum install pv .
If your fine with just RPM ;

German Development Aid Minister Dirk Niebel was denied entry into the Gaza Strip during his current visit to Israel , German officials said Saturday evening .
A ministry spokesman said talks had continued to the last moment with Israeli officials over Niebel 's aim to visit the Palestinian areas .
Open gallery view German Economic Cooperation and Development Minister Dirk Niebel , Afghanistan , April 4 , 2010 Credit : Reuters
Niebel , who arrived in Israel earlier Saturday , had hoped to visit a sewage treatment plant being financed with German development aid .
Speaking on the second German TV network ZDF program " heute " ( today ) Saturday evening , Niebel expressed his anger about being denied entry .
" I would have wished for a clear political signal would be sent for an opening and for transparency , " said Niebel , of Germany 's liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) .
" Sometimes the Israeli government does not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves the way it does , " he added .
Niebel said that Israel 's latest announcement on easing the Gaza blockade was " not sufficient " and that Israel must " now deliver " on its pledge .
Beyond that , the government in Jerusalem should be " clear about how Israel , within an international context , wants to cooperate with
its friends in the future as well , " the German minister said .
Earlier Saturday , the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that the German parliament is to issue a cross-party demand that Israel allow humanitarian aid to reach the Gaza Strip by sea .
According to the newspaper , a motion opposing Israel 's blockade of Gaza had the support of Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government coalition parties , as well as the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Green Party .
" The living conditions for the civil population in Gaza must urgently be improved , " the motion reportedly stated .
" Israel 's Gaza blockade is effectively a blockade of the United Nations , " the Greens ' foreign spokeswoman Kerstin Mueller told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung , adding : " This is unacceptable . "
Mueller said Israel had to give the United Nations sea access to Gaza , so aid could be delivered " quickly and unbureaucratically . "
The motion reportedly calls upon the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton to facilitate negotiations between Israel and the UN .
Earlier in the week , Israel decided to ease the blockade - which intensified after Hamas took control of the Strip in June 2007 - following international uproar over the May 31 Israeli navy attack on a flotilla of unauthorized aid to the Gaza strip , which left nine activists dead .
Decoupling GUI and Business Logic
My GUIs suck .
They are hard to use and are a nightmare behind the scenes .
In particular , I find it hard to separate the business logic from the GUI code .
However I managed to divide these parts in a recent project into 100 % disjoint namespaces .
Let 's see how .
Talking to Clojure
GUI code is all about handling state .
So we have to cope with that .
Luckily Clojure gives us a variety of tools here .
I decided to use atoms for my little project .
The state is modified by the user via UI interaction .
So we need a way to change the atom once some interaction happens .
This can be easily done via the huge listener machinery of Swing .
Here is an example of a button modifying the atom .
( defn process [ stuff canceled ? ] ( doseq [ x ( take - while ( fn [ _ ] ( not @ canceled ? ) ) stuff ) ] ( process - item x ) ) ) ( defn some - click - handler [ evt ] ( let [ stuff ( get-eg . - selected - stuff - from - gui ) canceled ? ( atom false ) cancel ( JButton .
" Cancel " ) ... ] ( add-action - listener cancel ( fn [ _ ] ( reset !
canceled ? true ) ) ) ... ( future ( process stuff canceled ? ) ) ) )
add - action - listener is a small helper from clojure.contrib.swing-utils .
Otherwise the idea should be pretty straight - forward .
The future call is necessary , so that the processing does n't run on the Swing Event Dispatch Thread .
We first retrieve some stuff we want to process from our GUI .
Then we set up a Dialog with a cancel button and fire off the processing .
Pressing the cancel button should stop the processing of our input data .
In order for this to work , our processing function has to take the atom carrying the state of whether the computation should be stopped .
And in fact it has to check the atom from time to time .
Here we do this after every item .
A bit hacky but worked for me .
Beware chunked seqs , though .
Showing Progress
So far this is not very exciting .
To keep the user entertained let 's add a progress bar to our dialog .
( defn process [ stuff canceled ?
progress ] ( doseq [ x ( take - while ( fn [ _ ] ( not @ canceled ? ) ) stuff ) ] ( process - item x ) ( do - swing ( .setValue progress ( inc ( .getValue progress ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn some - click - handler [ evt ] ( let [ stuff ( get-eg . - selected - stuff - from - gui ) canceled ? ( atom false ) cancel ( JButton .
" Cancel " ) progress ( JProgressBar. 0 ( count stuff ) ) ... ] ( add-action - listener cancel ( fn [ _ ] ( reset !
canceled ? true ) ) ) ... ( future ( process stuff canceled ?
progress ) ) ) )
Again , we have to pass the progress bar down to our processing function in order to be able to update it after an item was processed .
But wait !
Now our processing function has to know , what a progress bar is !
And it has to know , that updating a progress bar has to be done on the Swing EDT .
What the heck is an EDT ?
Things like do - swing from clojure.contrib.swing -utils help a bit .
But why should our processing function be bothered with such stuff .
Again GUI stuff leaked into my logic .
Bleh .
Talking to the GUI
But Clojure to the rescue : we can simply fix the situation using a feature of Clojure 's reference types : a watch .
We can wire - up the state of the progress bar with a Clojure atom .
Updating the atom will then also update the progress bar .
That way the processing function does not have to know how the GUI works .
It just updates the atom .
( defn process [ stuff canceled ?
progress ] ( doseq [ x ( take - while ( fn [ _ ] ( not @ canceled ? ) ) stuff ) ] ( process - item x ) ( swap !
progress inc ) ) ) ( defn some - click - handler [ evt ] ( let [ stuff ( get-eg . - selected - stuff - from - gui ) canceled ? ( atom false ) cancel ( JButton .
" Cancel " ) progress ( atom 0 ) bar ( JProgressBar.
0 ( count stuff ) ) ... ] ( add-action - listener cancel ( fn [ _ ] ( reset !
canceled ? true ) ) ) ( add - watch progress :: update - progress -bar ( fn [ _ _ _ new - val ] ( do - swing ( .setValue bar new - val ) ) ) ) ... ( future ( process stuff canceled ?
progress ) ) ) )
Ah .
Much better the progress bar update code moved back to the other GUI stuff again .
And the processing function is independent of the GUI code again .
Upshot
Using watches , we were able to completely separate the GUI code from the business logic .
Neither is dependent on the implementation of the other .

When we go looking for greeting cards we do what every other man does – we find the slot closest to empty and we buy that one .
After all , someone had to have read the card in that slot at some point and decided it was worth buying so we ’re just going to trust them and go with it .
Unfortunately , every card in JoAnne ’s Hallmark for Secretary ’s Day was overflowing from their pastel colored $ 6 prison and we spent the better part of an hour ( we left when the cute cashier went on break ) in the midst of a dilemma of epic proportions .
On one hand , you ca n’t not get her a card because then you ’re in the shit .
On the other hand , if you get her a card that sucks , is n’t heartfelt , does n’t “ fit ” her , or she ca n’t put on the fridge , you ’re in the shit .
We decided that since we ’re pretty much screwed regardless we were going to make cards that said what Hallmark never could – what men were actually thinking .
ACCORDING to the old adage , what goes up must come down .
But in the case of balloons , the descent sometimes comes sooner than expected .
Although helium - filled weather balloons regularly launch instruments high into the stratosphere , at altitudes of 20 km ( 65,000 feet ) the air is 15 times less dense , causing the balloons to expand and ultimately burst .
This problem has long vexed the American military , which would like to use lighter - than - air dirigibles as atmospheric satellites , or stratellites .
From 20 km a blimp would be able to continuously survey an area the size of Texas for months at a time , but in greater detail and at much lower cost than geostationary satellites or those moving in low Earth orbit .
Despite the problems , dirigibles are coming back into service .
Global Telesat Corporation , an American supplier of unmanned aerial vehicles , recently purchased its first SkySat .
This 38 metre-long remotely operated airship is designed to carry communications and monitoring equipment for intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions .
With its familiar cigar - shaped design , however , it will rise only so far — 14 km , to be precise .
And at this altitude ferocious winds require a SkySat to burn through its fuel supply just to stay still .
As a result it can remain aloft for only a few days at a time .
The ultimate goal is to find a way to slip above the jet stream and into the virtually windless stratosphere for an even better vantage point , says Dan Erdberg of Sanswire , a Florida company which developed SkySat .
Over the years the company has looked at various solutions , and it is now working with Global Telesat to develop a novel , snakelike airship called the STS - 111 .
It is made up of four connected and articulated inflatable sections .
Each section of the STS - 111 contains two gas envelopes — one inside the other .
The inner envelope holds helium in the head section of the blimp and an ethane fuel gas in the three tail sections .
The outer envelope of all four sections contains air maintained at atmospheric pressure .
Although the airship starts off flaccid , the helium and the ethane expand as it gains altitude .
As it does so , the air in the outer envelope is released to allow these gases to fill the void left behind .
This approach gives the gases more room to expand without stretching the envelope of the airship too much .
Venting gases is not a new idea , says Mr Erdberg , but usually it involves releasing helium , which reduces the buoyancy of the craft , so that making a safe descent or maintaining a steady altitude becomes extremely difficult .
What makes Sanswire 's design unique is that it allows the airship to have the same weight on landing as it did when it took off .
This is because air is pumped back into the tail envelopes as the ethane fuel is burned by the craft 's thrusters , and is also pumped into the tail and head during descent as the inner envelopes contract .
The serpentine aerofoil shape is designed to face into what little wind there is , generating a small amount of lift .
And since ethane has roughly the same density as air , the fuel in effect weighs nothing , further reducing the amount of helium needed to create buoyancy .
That is the theory , at least .
So far , apart from some low - altitude test flights , the only stratospheric tests have involved a scaled - down version tethered to a weather balloon .
Tests of a full - sized STS - 111 at high altitude are not expected to begin until next year .
So the military will have to wait a bit longer to see if Sanswire 's ideas hold up — or its claims are inflated .
Hey everyone , it ’s me TheExMachina with another installment of Under the Radar where I once again inform you about the hidden gems of this generation !
In this article I talk about a computer game that combines the intensity and strategic thinking of a turn - based RTS with the grinding and exploration of an RPG .
That game is King ’s Bounty .
King ’s Bounty is an RPG / RTS hybrid computer game where you are the commander of a great army , exploring a vast fantasy world and unleashing the might of your soldiers upon the forces of evil .
Victory or defeat hangs by a thread from the decisions you make in battle .
The original King ’s Bounty was released in 1990 by designer Jon Van Caneghem of publisher ’s New World Computing in 1990 .
It was originally an MS - DOS title but it later found its way on Apple 2 , Commodore 64 , Amiga , Sega Genesis then on Widows and Mac OS .
It is a turn - based tactical role playing game where the player leads his / her army across four continents , gathering 25 pieces of a map leading to an artifact known as the Sceptre of Order .
There are 4 hero classes to choose from : Barbarian , Paladin , Knight and Sorceress .
Each class has varied levels of attack , magic and leadership over his / her army .
The main attributes of your chosen hero is leadership which determines the number of men in your army , commission which decides on how much income is rewarded after each battle and maximum spells determining the maximum number of spells cast .
The soldiers in your army vary from Infantry , Archers , Arch- mages , even Dragons , Vampires and Demons , all reporting for duty and ready to assist you in obtaining the Sceptre of Order .
King ’s Bounty is considered by many to be the predecessor of the Heroes of Might and Magic series which was also published by New World Computing and designed by Jon Van Caneghem .
The turn - based combat and the character development are very much alike between the 2 computer games , with other similarities also being noticeable .
King ’s Bounty has also been featured in some versions of the Heroes of Might and Magic anthology as an executable file .
Those who did not grow up with King ’s Bounty but are adept with Heroes of Might and Magic will feel right at home .
In 2008 the Russian game publisher 1C Company , along with publishers Atari and developers Katauri Interactive releases the successor of the classic King ’s Bounty with the title : King ’s Bounty : The Legend .
King ’s Bounty : The Legend stays true to its roots by keeping all the game play elements that made the original a joy to play while adding a vast number of improvements , catering for both veterans of tactical role - playing games and newcomers of the genre and like other computer game in King ’s Bounty :
The Legend ’s category , the game is easy to learn , but difficult to master .
The world of Endoria is in need of a hero .
As Sir Bill Gilbert , you have sworn service to King Mark Leonard the Wise .
Having completed your training , you embark with your brothers in arms towards adventure , searching for pirates , overthrowing kings , rescuing princesses and more .
These are everyday challenges you will face in King Darion ’s service , all for the good of Endoria .
Right off the bat you are given a choice of three character classes : Warrior , Paladin and Mage .
Each class varies in levels of attack , magic and leadership .
The Warrior can recruit more men in his army , has greater attack power and can increase the combat parameters of his men teaching them new skills to use in battle .
He has the biggest increase in leadership and rage .
He develops his might skills faster than the other two classes .
The Paladin is a mix between the warrior and the mage .
He is able to gain more combat experience and gold .
He can even convince enemies to switch side and maintain two stacks of reserve troops .
The Mage is a magical powerhouse .
He is able to improve the spells he learns and increase their power .
As he progresses , he can cast spells more frequently in battle and gains more intellect than the other classes .
The game is played much like many other RPGs .
You and your soldiers travel across maps , meeting friendly NPCs who will greet you and sometimes give you quest .
You do the quest and you get rewarded with experience and money .
You ’ll also be entering dungeons and caves finding loot and battling many enemies , much like Diablo .
You can view your characters three attributes through the sub- menu : Might , Magic and Mind .
Might is what determines your strength , Magic is what governs you magical capabilities and Mind focuses on the rate of experience and money you gain from battle .
You can also buy armor and weapon upgrades from various shops , although strengthening your men is not done through healing spells as there are not alot of them to be found .
Instead you ’ll bolster your army by buying more troops .
Your army can be made up of mages , arch - mages , archers , knights , swordsmen , even creatures such as bears and spiders .
Like its predecessor , combat in King ’s Bounty : The Legend is turn based .
Your hero ’s men are deployed on the field on one side where the opponent ’s army is on the other .
An encounter takes place on a flat plain with small hex grids , indicating the number of spaces your units are able to move to .
Units are only able to move a certain amount of spaces , much like chess .
Although your hero does not get involved directly in battle , the class you ’ve chosen , the attributes you upgrade and the equipment you buy will determine how well you men fare in battle .
How much training they ’ve been given , what abilities are available to them , their attack power and so forth .
You are able to cast spells and summons to assist your men and turn the tide of the fight .
Each class in your army has their advantages .
Swordsmen and knights are naturally better melee fighters , mages can cast both offensive and defensive spells , archers can attack enemies from a distance et cetera et cetera .
The classes can also learn special skills , giving them the edge over the other side .
Your men and the opponent ’s men are affected by the terrain as well .
Some surroundings have hazards such as bee nests and possessed crucifixes which can damage your unit ’s health and create status alerting effects , such as poison .
The undead fight better in cemeteries and narrow passages will mean certain death for melee units unfortunate enough to be funneled in .
On the other hand , the battlefield offers some positive surprises .
Sometimes you ’ll find a treasure chest , which one of your men can collect revealing gold , spells or special items .
All this including the enemy themselves will mean a lot of obstacles to overcome if you ’re serious on destroying your opponent .
From a visual perspective , it looks very pleasing to the eye .
The bright colours make all the characters and the environment look lush and vibrant , making the game look and feel more fun to play .
The daylight outdoor areas look luxuriant and diverse .
While traversing the daylight outdoor areas you ’ll notice some nice little details such as birds in the air and fish in the river .
The caves and dungeons look atmospheric and moody .
Traveling through dark forests , cemeteries and lava levels feel fiendishly distinctive .
The musical score is appropriate for the fantasy genre .
You ’ll listen to big , sweeping musical numbers as you explore the world on Endoria and do battle with the forces of evil .
King ’s Bounty : The Legend is one of the most difficult games out there .
You ’ll find yourself facing stronger opponents all the time no matter how much you ’ve leveled up , even at the very start of the game .
Normal difficulty will give even the most battle hardened strategy fan a tough time .
Enemies just feel so unfairly overpowered and even when you have the stronger side , the enemy still manages to find a way to dwindle your numbers !
You ’ll have to play with brute force at the very start in order for you and your men to become a force to be reckoned with , but even then there ’s the danger of starting the campaign all over again because your men were wiped out by another opponent !
What ’s worse is that places of commerce only have a limited number of reserve troops , thus players who die a lot will end up with a very small and very pitiful army !
There is plenty to do in King ’s Bounty : The Legend .
The continents that you travel to are humongous .
Each continent have their own sub regions , each cram - packed with side quests to complete , treasure to grab and enemies to fight .
Even if you ’re not going for 100 % completion , you may end up playing this game for a very long time .
When you do eventually complete the game , there ’s more adventure to be had in the world of Endoria , as there is also a standalone expansion pack of the game entitled : King ’s Bounty : Armored Princess .
This new chapter in the King ’s Bounty universe was released in 2009 in Russia and North America , then in 2010 in the United Kingdom .
This expansion maintains almost all of the gameplay conventions of the previous title and adds a plethora of improvements , making your King ’s Bounty experience that much more special .
Set 10 years after the events of King ’s Bounty : The Legend , the world of Endoria is in peril .
Darion , the domain of King Mark Leonard the Wise has been overrun by demons .
His daughter , Princess Amelie has traveled to the world of Teana in search for her mentor : Sir Bill Gilbert , the knight who pledged his service to the King 10 years before .
All in an effort to eradicate the evil that threatens the world of Endoria .
Gameplay is identical to its predecessor , as you choose once again between the classes Warrior , Paladin and Mage , explore the new world of Teana , traversing over massive continents , battling foes , completing side quests and collecting treasure to strengthen your army .
Improvements include a more comprehensive tutorial , instantaneous sea voyages between continents , new spells , new enemies and new friendly units .
You will also gain the ability to turn your horse into Pegasus and fly and you ’ll also acquire a humorous pet baby dragon which will aid you in battle .
Princess Amelie will struggle at first to hold back much stronger armies .
However , over time , leadership and a higher level , she ’ll be commanding units such as giant snakes , giant spiders , ancient bears , pirates and vampires .
No opposing army will ever be able to stand in Princess Amelie ’s way .
The new King ’s Bounty games are prime examples of how a classic gameplay style should be brought into the new generation .
This RTS / RPG hybrid has something for every gamer to enjoy .
Veterans of the genre who played the classic King ’s Bounty will be pleased to know that the new King ’s Bounty games have done the original justice .
Even if you did n’t grow up with hybrid games such as King ’s Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic , it ’s not hard to appreciate this traditional take on a tactical RPG being brought into this generation of gaming .
Both Kings Bounty : The Legend and King ’s Bounty : Armored Princess are very simple to learn , thus gamers who may never have played a tactical RPG should have no problem grasping the gameplay basics of King ’s Bounty .
However , beneath that simplicity is a deep , intuitive , addictive and challenging experience that will have you constantly adapting to changing situations and planning attentively to survive in battle .
If adventure , excitement , fun and glory in battle are what you crave for in gaming , then the King ’s Bounty games could be exactly what you need .
Happy Gaming .

The shovels are finally ready .
But is anyone paying attention ?
With a flurry of stimulus construction work getting under way about 16 months after the $ 787 billion package was signed into law , the Obama administration has billed the coming season “ Recovery Summer . ”
This week , the administration issued a report on the stepped - up pace of work , rolled out Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to brief reporters on its progress , and President Obama went to Columbus , Ohio , on Friday to laud the 10,000th stimulus - financed highway project .
For all the talk of “ shovel - ready ” infrastructure projects when the stimulus first passed , construction projects made up a comparatively small slice of the package , and many required considerable administrative spade work  planning , permitting and contracting  before actual dirt could be turned .
The stimulus initially injected money into the economy mainly through tax cuts and aid to states and individuals .
Now that the long - promised “ road work ahead ” is here , in big numbers , the question is whether voters will warm to the stimulus .
The stakes for the Obama administration and Democrats are high , with the midterm elections approaching and many voters , Tea Party supporters and otherwise , incensed about spending .
Image President Obama spoke in Columbus , Ohio , on Friday to commemorate the 10,000th stimulus - financed highway project .

Stimulus - financed construction is set to explode this summer : 10,700 highway projects should be under way next month , up from just 1,750 last July .
States expect to weatherize 82,000 homes this summer  27 times the number of homes that were weatherized last summer , when the program got off to a slow start .
And there will be 2,828 clean - water projects under construction , a twentyfold increase over last year .
Trey Grayson : Rand Paul is winning because Fox News asks him ' softballs '
My colleague Perry Bacon is on the ground in Kentucky , where he filed this interview with fading / rallying ( depending on whom you ask ) Republican candidate Trey Grayson .
For the umpteenth time , Grayson responds to questions about why Rand Paul is doing so well by grousing about Paul 's national support .
“ I ’ve been on Fox News once , on a live feed on one of the shows , and I was told I was to expect a certain line of questioning , and I was given a different line of questioning , ” Grayson said .
Referring to Rand Paul , Grayson said , “ he ’s on all of the time . ”
“ His dad had these phenomenal contacts , so … he ’s on Fox News every couple of weeks with softballs , ” Grayson said .
Imitating an anchor ’s voice , Grayson said the questions are like “ Rand , tell us about health care , you ’re a doctor , Rand , tell us about the tea party . ”
Let 's step away from the question of whether it is ever , ever a good idea to do a " funny " voice in the presence of a reporter and home in on the more important question .
Does Grayson seriously think it 's a bigger advantage to be the son of a presidential candidate who scored a whopping 6.7 percent of the vote in the 2008 Kentucky primary than it is to be the candidate endorsed by the state 's senior senator , the minority leader of his party ?
Because I 've been covering Paul and his network since 2007 , and I have seen many , many people try to use their connections to him in campaigns and get nowhere .
Look at Peter Schiff , an economist who appears frequently on Fox News and Fox Business , who brought Paul backing into his race for U.S. Senate in Connecticut and who has gone nowhere .
Why did Rand Paul become a sensation when he could have just as easily become what he was portrayed as one year ago , a novelty candidate with a fun personal story ?
Because he hustled , he dealt quickly and decisively with staff problems , he plugged into the tea party movement before doing so was obviously a political benefit , and he beat Grayson to the punch on multiple opportunities , like rallying for Sen.
Jim Bunning 's ( R - Ky . ) filibuster of unemployment benefits .
Grayson has combated this with outreach to national conservatives like Dick Cheney and Rudy Giuliani -- foreign policy hawks -- in a manner that was too obvious for journalists to miss but too shadowy to avoid irritating Paul 's campaign and his voters .
And he has repeatedly been frazzled by Paul , going overboard to argue that his libertarian stances will disappoint social conservatives -- a strategy that bottomed out when a Grayson ally misled Dr. James Dobson on what Paul 's abortion stance really was , something that so irritated Dobson that he eventually endorsed Paul .
Lots of conservatives get softballs on Fox News .
Few have the hustle to run a serious Senate race .
At the 11th hour , it 's like Grayson still does n't take Paul seriously .
Enlarge By Uriel Sinai , Getty Images Israelis rally in Tel Aviv to support their country following a military encounter at sea that left nine dead .
JERUSALEM  Israel defended itself Monday against accusations it overreacted to a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists it said provoked a battle with Israeli commandos that left nine activists dead and several soldiers severely injured .
" The armada of hate and violence in support of the Hamas terror organization was a premeditated , outrageous provocation , " Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said .
Thousands of people in Turkey protested the deaths of the activists , many of whom were Turks .
Turkey 's government called the incident " state - sponsored terrorism . "
The United Nations Security Council , which held an emergency meeting Monday , called for an impartial investigation of the raid .
U.S. Deputy Ambassador Alejandro Wolff urged Israel " to investigate the incident fully . "
President Obama voiced " deep regret " over what occurred .
Six ships carrying humanitarian aid left Cyprus to breach a blockade of Gaza set up by Israel and Egypt to keep arms from Hamas .
Designated a terror group by the United States and other countries , Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 and has rained more than 6,500 rockets onto Israeli towns .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the ships were contacted and told they could offload supplies at an Israeli port for delivery to Gaza , but they refused .
According to Barak , Israeli commandos boarded five of the ships and forced them to dock , but dozens of activists on the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara used guns , knives and bats to attack commandos .
The commandos were armed with paintball rifles but got the OK to use their pistols when one commando was thrown 30 feet onto a lower deck and another soldier lost his handgun to an attacker .
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who canceled a planned meeting with Obama , said he regretted the loss of life but said the soldiers " had to defend themselves . "
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the " massacre . "
Jews and Arabs viewed the killings differently .
" It hurts to think that the food and medicine did n't make it to the people of Gaza , " said Mazen Sublaban , an Arab music teacher in East Jerusalem .
" Hamas is defying international law , but no one cares about that , " Ofer Kadesh said .
After nightfall , a rocket was fired into Israel .
Hamas - linked militants said it was in response to the raid .
No one was hurt .

The Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer ( CPSA ) attempts to enumerate all essentially different executions possibe for a cryptographic protocol .
We call them the shapes of the protocol .
Naturally occurring protocols have only finitely many , indeed very few shapes .
Authentication and secrecy properties are easy to determine from them , as are attacks and anomalies .
For each input problem , the CPSA program is given some initial behavior , and it discovers what shapes are compatible with it .
Normally , the initial behavior is from the point of view of one participant .
The analysis reveals what the other participants must have done , given the participant 's view .
The search is based on a high - level algorithm that was claimed to be complete , i.e. every shape can in fact be found in a finite number of steps .
Further theoretical work showed classes of executions that are not found by the algorithm , however it also showed that every omitted execution requires an unnatural interpretation of a protocol 's roles .
Hence the algorithm is complete relative to natural role semantics .
The package contains a set of programs used to perform and display the analysis .
A standards complient browser , such as Firefox , Safari , or Chrome , is required to display the results .
Program documentation is in the doc directory in the source distribution , and installed in the package 's data directory .
You can locate the package 's data directory by typing " cpsa -- help " to a command prompt .
New users should start learning to use the tool from the manual , found at " cpsamanual.pdf " in the data directory .
Examples referenced in the manual can be found in the data directory as well .
It is suggested that users make an examples directory and copy " *.scm *.xhtml " to their local examples directory , both so that they may be modified and for ease of access .
Serious Windows users should install MSYS so as to allow the use of make and script execution .
The theory and algorithm used by CPSA was developed with the help of Joshua D. Guttman , John D. Ramsdell , Jon C. Herzog , Shaddin F. Doghmi , F. Javier Thayer , Paul D. Rowe , and Moses D. Liskov .
John D. Ramsdell and Moses D. Liskov implemented the algorithm in Haskell .
CPSA was designed and implemented at The MITRE Corporation .
TEL AVIV , Israel , June 18 ( UPI ) -- Israel may be celebrating the discovery of giant offshore gas fields that are expected to transform its economy , but its hopes of overcoming its acute water problems have been set back by Turkey , its erstwhile ally .
The Islamist government in Ankara has shelved plans to sell the Jewish state 1.75 billion cubic feet of water a year for 20 years from the Mavganat River in Anatolia , part of its wider strategy of restoring the regional dominance it had a century ago .
Advertisement
The Turkish decision to suspend the project was in retaliation for the May 31 killing by the Israeli navy of nine Turks aboard a Turkish - flagged ship carrying humanitarian to the Israeli - blockaded Gaza Strip .
Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Taner Yildiz says Ankara will not develop any joint projects with Israel until it " apologizes and expresses its regret " for the attack in international waters in the eastern Mediterranean .
The May 31 attack was the latest in a series of incidents over the last few years that have soured relations between the two states and taken them to the brink of severing diplomatic relations .
Ankara has also halted a plan to supply Israel with natural gas from Russia via Turkey through an underwater gas pipeline across the eastern Mediterranean , part of the Blue Stream 2 project .
Relations have been deteriorating steadily since Israel invaded the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip in December 2008 and killed some 1,200 Palestinians , mainly civilians .
Ankara bitterly denounced that action .
Now that the Jewish state has its own gas fields , which industry experts say could contain up to 25 trillion cubic feet of gas , the loss of the gas pipeline is a minor irritant in economic terms .
But the block on the water project is a greater setback for a country whose water resources , partly in the occupied West Bank , are shrinking .
Both state - sponsored programs have been in abeyance for several years .
The Mavganat plan , first mooted 20 years ago , was to ship water from Turkey in converted oil supertankers across the eastern Mediterranean .
The river flows into the Mediterranean near the port of Antalya on Turkey 's southern border where a $ 150 million water export hub was built in preparation for the project .
The Mavganat is capable of producing 6.3 billion cubic feet of water a year for export across the region , including Cyprus , Syria , Jordan and even the Persian Gulf states .
Ankara was ready to provide the water to cement its 1996 military cooperation pact with Israel , a strategic alliance that drew together the region 's two non-Arab military powers .
Ankara was also prepared to sell this valuable resource to other states , even as far afield as Libya and the Persian Gulf , to promote Turkey as the regional power as it had been until the Ottoman Empire was carved up by the British and French after World War I .
However , back in the early 1990s , pipelines to carry the water around the region were rejected by the governments concerned .
They were reluctant to put themselves in a position where Ankara would have control over such a critical resource .
In June 2000 , Israel and Turkey signed a preliminary agreement on the Mavganat project .
But little more was heard of it until June 2006 , when the Israeli government said it was considering canceling the project , citing high costs of around $ 1.34 billion over the 20 - year period .
The feeling at the time was that desalination plants were more feasible to solve Israel 's perennial water problems .
It preferred a water pipeline from Turkey , but that would have to pass through arch - enemy Syria , and probably Lebanon as well , which made it highly insecure .
Finally , on Aug. 6 , 2006 , then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon signed an agreement on the water project in Jerusalem with Turkey 's then - energy minister , Zeki Cakan , and agreed to set up a joint committee to deal with transportation .
But the project again slipped into abeyance because both sides agreed that high oil prices at the time made the cost of transporting the water in giant tankers prohibitive .
Turkish privatization of the water treatment facilities at the mouth of the Mavganat also pushed up the cost of the water for Israel .
Now the project may never get off the ground .
Is it a bird , is it a plane ?
Well kind of , it 's the latest development in green aviation and it looks rather like something from the Jetsons .
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) this week took the wraps off two new aircraft designs , which they claim could cut aviation fuel use by 70 per cent and deliver similarly deep cuts in air and noise pollution .
The faculty at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics presented the designs to NASA last month as part of a $ 2.1 m ( £ 1.5 m ) research programme intended to develop environmental and performance concepts that will shape the agency 's aeronautics research over the next 25 years .
As part of the project the MIT team was tasked with developing two new commercial aircraft designs that would burn 70 per cent less fuel , emit 75 per cent less nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) than current planes and could take off using significantly shorter runways .
They delivered a design for a 180 - passenger plane , dubbed the " double bubble " series , which could serve as a replacement for the Boeing 737 - class aircraft that are widely used for short - haul flights .
That design was accompanied by plans for a 350 - passenger H " hybrid wing body " plane to replace the 777 - class aircraft commonly used for international flights .
According to Mark Drela , lead designer of the D Series , the design would have to travel about 10 per cent slower than a 737 , but he added that the repositioning of the engines at the rear of the plane , use of longer wings and reconfiguring of the cross section would significantly reduce drag , allowing engines to burn less fuel for the same amount of thrust .
" Little five per cent changes add up to one big change , " he said in a statement , adding that while the plane would be slower than current commercial aircrafts , time could be saved on commercial routes because the plane 's design would allow for faster loading and unloading .
The aim of the NASA - backed project is to deliver designs that could be turned into a commercial reality by 2035 , but the MIT team also provided designs for a version of the D Series that could be built using conventional aluminum and existing jet technology that could feasibly be produced sooner and would still cut fuel use in half .
The larger H Series design uses similar principles to the D Series , positioning the engine at the rear of the aircraft and using longer , thinner wings .
But it also features a triangular - shaped hybrid wing body design that allows for more passengers and improved aerodynamics .
The MIT research is part of a wide - ranging project from NASA that has also seen Boeing , GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman contracted to undertake research into next - generation subsonic commercial aircraft designs , and Boeing and Lockheed - Martin tasked with exploring how supersonic jets could be used for commercial aircraft .
The MIT team now hopes to receive a decision from NASA within the next few months on whether it has been selected for the second phase of the programme , which will provide it with funding to continue research into how new propulsion system technology could be integrated with the designs .
MIT said that even if the designs are not chosen for the second phase of the project , the research team hopes to continue work on them through the testing of smaller models at the Institute 's own wind tunnel and ongoing work with aircraft manufacturers .
Call for An Anarchist Manifesto about Palestine
Anarchist ideas and politics had gained a foothold in middle east region , but we need to assure that these ideas and politics will be translated into what they are supposed to be : a revolutionary programme of social change towards free self - managed society .
[ Français ] [ Castellano ] [ العربي ة ]

Syrian Anarchist
Anarchist ideas and politics had gained a foothold in middle east region , but still we are totally absorbed in promoting these ideas and politics while the heat of social struggle is escalating everywhere .
These ideas were created by the oppressed masses as the core of the revolutionary programme of their struggle ; this means that we are facing an urgent need to formulate an ANARCHIST analysis and criticism of the current situation and the prevailing power and production relationships in our societies , to assure that these ideas and politics will be translated into what they are supposed to be : a revolutionary programme of social change towards free self - managed society .
I assume that an anarchist manifesto about Palestine will be in a way or another a manifesto ( and a critical analysis ) of the situation of our societies in general ; and a necessary introduction of an anarchist manifesto of the middle east and Arab and Muslim world .
I think that the Jordanian comrades , and the Israeli ones , and the activists of Anarchists Against the Wall are in a position to put down the preliminary ideas about such a manifesto , which must be discussed widely afterwards by every interested anarchist organisation and individual .
This is not a process to create a final infallible anarchist analysis and programme about Palestine , this is a process of formulating a suggested anarchist analysis and programme that will not help only to stimulate free discussion about the issue among anarchists themselves , but also to stimulate the Palestinian , Israeli , Egyptian , Syrian , Jordanian , Lebanese and other masses to take the initiative about their own present and future , and to be part of a wider discussion among the oppressed masses about the best way to their freedom .
Last Tuesday night , I had a date with my 13 - year - old daughter to see the Imax version of “ Iron Man 2 ” at a theater on 42nd Street .
In a first for us , she would take the bus in by herself from our suburban New Jersey home to the Port Authority Bus Terminal .
There would be a phone call before she got on , a text or two on the way in , and then a call when she arrived and walked across the street to my office .
She is mature , quietly confident and careful , and had taken the trip with others many times before , so it seemed pretty straightforward .
Except this was just three nights after the failed bombing attempt in Times Square .
And on Monday , as if to punctuate the mood , there were some fairly loud booms on 40th Street right next to the New York Times building on Eighth Avenue , where I work .
Some people fled while others gawked until a firefighter barked : “ It ’s not Disneyland , people .
Get the hell out of the way . ”
As it turned out , the explosions came from some blown transformers beneath the street , a quotidian event in urban life , but in the context of the scare Saturday night , taking on deeper portent .
As a parent , I confronted a new calculation .
Asymmetric warfare had advanced from downtown to Midtown , from 2001 to the present moment .
As a reporter I had covered the aftermath of 9/11 and now found myself revisiting long - buried worries .
I decided not to share any of those dark thoughts with my daughter .
We had n’t discussed the failed bomb , and besides , how do you explain that some people a long way away may wish her dead even though they do n’t know her ?
In the end , we stuck to the plan , lining up with many others at the AMC Empire 25 near Times Square , having a moment , together , in one of the gaudiest , grandest places on earth .
The website was very easy to use and I was given feedback on the status of my order as it went through the process ( I wish more vendors would do this ) ...

Editor ’s note :
This is a guest post from AoM ’s resident bartender , Mike Hagan .
Mr. Hagan has previously written on classic cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks .
Drunk Fella : “ Hey Chief ! Chief ! ”
My co-worker : “ If that guy calls me ‘ Chief ’ one more time , I ’m cutting him off . ”
As I write this , I ’m sitting at my bar , just off of work on a Friday night .
I feel sorry for my co-worker ; I ’m the one who got Drunk Fella that way .
“ Chief ! ”
What Drunk Fella does n’t know is that he is being ignored on purpose .

When Mr. McKay asked me to write this article , I had to think about it for a couple weeks .
I really had to talk to a lot of bartenders I know to find out what their process is for getting their customers drinks .
Do they just start at one end of the bar and work their way down ?
Does a regular get served before someone they do n’t know ?
Do friends take precedence ?
Or do they just serve the loudest guy first , in an effort to get him to shut his trap ?
After talking to a few co-workers and fellow bartenders , I think I ’ve got it down to a few key concepts .
1. Always , always , tip .
An elephant never forgets .
Neither does a bartender ( or waiter , for that matter ) .
If you do n’t tip well , or at all , you are automatically on the bottom of the list .
And do n’t play games with your tipping , either .
If you pay cash each round , tip with your change .
Do n’t pull it all back and then tip at the end of the night .
Tipping is expected , no matter how much you think of it as “ extra . ”
If you start a tab , tip when you pay at the end of the night , or when you get your rounds with whatever cash you happen to have .
Either will do !
Both !
Let ’s be honest : if you do n’t have money to tip , go to a liquor store , buy your favorites , and watch the game at home .
If you do n’t have money to tip , you do n’t have money to go out in the first place .
Here ’s a tip : tip big on the very first round .
I have a customer that hands me a $ 20 bill after he ’s paid for his first drink .
I take care of him until he leaves .
He often gets refills before he ’s even done with his last one .
I take care of him because he ’s taken care of me already , and no matter how busy it is , I always have time for him .
And guys , your phone number is not a tip .
Give my female bartenders out there a break .
2 . Know what you ’re going to order before you start yelling for service .
Hopefully , I ’ve gotten there just as your group has approached the bar and I ’ve asked you what you ’d like to have .
If you ’re the one who ends up ordering for the group , I understand if you do n’t know what everyone wants .
That ’s why I have no problem waiting for your order if I ’ve approached you .
But if it ’s super busy and you ’ve finally gotten me over to take your order , KNOW WHAT YOU WANT .
There is nothing worse than hearing you call for service for a few minutes and when I get there , you do n’t know what you are ordering .
I ca n’t stress this enough .
In the time it takes you to figure out what everyone is drinking , I could have filled two other orders .
All that time spent yelling for service should be used for figuring out what your group wants .
Case in point : for some reason , I always end up being the “ order guy ” for my group .
Last time , we had a new person with us and I did n’t know his drink , so I asked him BEFORE we got to the bar .
When the bartender came over , I rattled it off to her , she quickly called my price , and I paid her .
She took my money , ran to get the drinks , and brought them back with the correct change .
The whole thing took 5 minutes .
Because I tipped well , the next time , it took 2 .
We understand that if we approach you , we ’ve caught you off guard and you may not know who needs what .
But if you ’re yelling , waving your arms , slapping the bar , trying to get our attention , then we get there and you do n’t know what you want , understand that we ’re a bit unhappy .
3. Chief , Boss , Bro , Scout , Partner , Dude …
The list goes on .
Do n’t use them .
For bartenders they ’re the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard .
Now , I know that not all bartenders will call you “ sir . ”
But they should call you something respectable if they do n’t know your name .
My line is “ Sir , can I get you a drink ? ” and when I deliver , “ There you are , sir .
My name is Mike if you need anything else . ”
I expect to be called by my name or sir , or if you ’re impolite , I ’ll answer to “ bartender . ”
“ Chief ” especially chills my spine .
The key is not the names , but what they represent : respect .
Like it or not , the bartender is in charge of the bar .
You are in his territory .
Waiters come to YOUR table , but you have entered the bartender ’s area .
Treat it , and him , with respect , and you ’ll both have a good time .
4 . Do n’t stand at the server station .
If the bar has a station where servers come to pick up drinks , it ’s a bad idea to try to stand there to get one .
You ’ll get mad because the bartender is there 50 % of the time , yet he ’s ignoring you , and he ’ll ignore you because you ’re not supposed to be there in the first place , so he ’s hoping you ’ll get the idea and move .
5 . Be a regular .
Find a bar you like .
Go there as often as you can .
If they serve food and it ’s good , eat there on a slow night .
Talk to the bartender when he ’s not busy .
Get to know about him and let him know about you .
Create a rapport .
When he sees you on a busy night , he ’ll make steps to make sure you ’re having a good time and getting taken care of .
Unless you ’re the creepy jerk regular that only tips with phone numbers given to the waitresses !
My Method
I ’m lucky because I ’m tall .
Not NBA tall , but tall enough .
I find a hole in the bar chairs that allows me not to reach over someone ’s back .
I hold my money in my hand , elbow on the bar , hand in the air , facing the bartender .
I look at them until they ’ve made eye contact .
Now they know I ’m there .
Now I can scan the bar for beautiful women , friends I did n’t know would be there , or check the score of the game .
But I keep watching the bartender .
When they come over , I rattle off my drink order , and repeat if necessary .
Explain drinks if necessary .
The money is still in my hand .
I say thank you when they bring the drinks back to me .
They take the money .
I say thank you again when I get my change , and because I know what I ’ve already planned on tipping , I give it straight to them , saying thanks for a third time .
If I need a helper for my drink load , they ’re already there with me , and I start handing drinks back .
Then I make my way to the spot where my group is .
They next guy who is paying for a round usually ends up just giving me the money and having me do it …or we all just sit there parched while he calls the bartender “ Chief ” a thousand times …

Hey this is Tommy of To The Chest .
I just want to talk about something interesting that I think years possibly seeing in the news .
And it is about the Donald a .k.a.
Donald Trump .
Now you 'll hear a lot both for and against Mr. wonderful .
Some people cannot understand why so many people like him .
You hear he 's racist , condescending , bigoted , full of himself with an ego bigger than Mount Everest .
Oh I 'm sorry , Mr. President bubble head just change the name to Dinali with an executive order .
Ain't that quaint !!
Getting back to Mr. Trump .
He may be a little of some of these things .
He does seem he believes to know better than anybody else , implying that unless he knows you you 're an idiot .
But that 's really not the issue is it ?
If you take a look at his recent poll numbers , there 's a reason why so many Americans are attracted to him .
How about being tired of establishment politicians always going back on their word .
Let 's take a look at the Republican Party .
They say that their values are , pro-life , pro-business , smaller government .
Now the question is have they actually accomplish anything since the 2014 midterms ?
And what I am referring to is have that passed or blocked legislation , nominees etc , based on the platform that they ran on ?

Power A spent a good deal of time taking what 's best about the Xbox 360 controller — the most natural " traditional " controller — and bringing it to the PS3 .
It 's called the PS3 Pro Elite , and it 's only $ 50 .
You have your left analog stick up on the top left and D - Pad down on the bottom .
The palm parts extend much lower , and are coated with a grippy , but breathable material , which makes a huge difference when you play games for hours on end .

The only thing that Power A did n't bring over from the 360 are the shoulder buttons .
The L1 , R1 buttons are more mushy , and the L2 and R2 shoulder buttons are super mushy , like the PS3's .
This is my only complaint — I wish they went all the way and brought the Xbox 's triggers over .
Oh , and you still get Sixaxis capabilities , so there really is no sacrifice .
Plus you get glowing buttons , and true wireless , albeit a third - party wireless that you need a dongle for .
The dongle is included .

Ayaan Hirsi Ali enters an apartment in New York followed by a bodyguard .
The 40 - year - old , who for the last six years has been unable to turn up at a venue without it being checked by security , is a writer , polemicist and critic of Islam .
She is also a Somali immigrant , an ex-Muslim , a survivor of child genital mutilation , an exile many times over , a former Dutch MP , a black woman whose language would not , in places , look amiss in a BNP pamphlet , a remarked - upon beauty and a lady - in - peril , identities that lend her as a figurehead to disparate causes and bring on confusion in the people she meets .
" I'm a serious person , " she says , frowning , as the photographer suggests various fashion poses , but she is also quietly , almost coyly glamorous , moving around with fawn - like grace .
It 's a combination that works particularly well on male polemicists of the muscular left , who can't do enough to defend her : her gentle charm , her small wrists , her big eyes – oh , and her brave commitment to Enlightenment values – in the face of all that extremism .
It was after fleeing an arranged marriage and settling as an asylum - seeker in Holland that Hirsi Ali converted from Islam to atheism with the kind of zeal that usually powers journeys going the other way .
She can , she has said , make statements that a white person simply could not : on the " dangers " posed to the west not just by radical , but by regular Islam ; on the " backward " nature of the religion ; on how " terrible " the Qur'an is ; and , in the most startling argument of her new book , Nomad ( a follow - up to her bestselling memoir Infidel ) , how Muslims would do well to learn from Christianity .
She is aware of the liberal twitching she causes – what if accusing her of racism is in itself racist ?
What if her experience trumps all other arguments ?
In 2004 , after her friend Theo Van Gogh , the Dutch journalist with whom she made a film about women and Islam , was murdered , she was put under 24 - hour security .
( In the US it is paid for by private donors ; when she returns to Europe , where she is still a Dutch citizen , she is protected by the state . )
Two years later she left Holland following a controversy around her citizenship and for the last three years she has worked in Washington for the American Enterprise Institute , a rightwing thinktank , contributing papers on how the failures of multiculturalism have allowed for the rise of Islamic extremism in the west .
The accusation that most irritates her – that the events of her life have left her " traumatised " and an easy pawn for rightwing politicians – is , as she says , a sexist presumption .
And yet the suspicion remains : that those convictions one arrives at – and fights hardest for – via fraught personal experience are emotional , not rational , and as such beyond reach of most useful debate .
" I 'm not being rightwing , " she says .
" The people who believe themselves to be on the left , and who defend the agents of Islam in the name of tolerance and culture , are being rightwing .
Not just rightwing .
Extreme rightwing .
I do n't understand how you can be so upset about the Christian right and just ignore the Islamic right .
I 'm talking about equality . "
( She is seeing the rightwing historian Niall Ferguson , who , she wrote recently in a Dutch magazine , she is " enormously in love with " , but wo n't comment on it today , nor smile at the suggestion that in most people 's minds this will instantly reposition her on the political scale . )
The impetus to write Nomad came in 2008 , when she visited her dying father at a hospital in London and saw her family for the first time in years .
The reunion was short and inadequate , and brought about " the horrible feelings that come with death ; lots of things that I regret " .
Primarily that she had n't spoken to him sooner , but also that in what she saw as his internal fight between western and Islamic principles – he believed in educating his daughter , but forced her into a marriage and disowned her when she ran away – the latter won .
Her critique of Islam as a " moral framework not compatible with the modern westernised way of living " is rooted in a critique of her family , her father 's unbending will and particularly her mother , a woman who she says was pulled apart by the contradictions of maintaining her faith in a modern society and an identity crisis from which Hirsi Ali herself suffered .
( She speaks six languages – English , Somali , Arabic , Swahili , Amharic and Dutch . )
The phrasing she uses is startlingly direct .
When she writes that " violence is an integral part " of Islamic social discipline , or says in our interview that " Muhammad 's example is terrible , do n't follow it " , it is deliberately , almost narcissistically provocative , the result , one imagines , of a siege mentality and the defensive self - assurance that goes with it .
To Hirsi Ali , the act of speaking out , of saying what no one else will say , seems at this stage to be almost a pathology ; to override all other considerations .
The subtitle of Nomad is " A personal journey through the clash of civilisations " .
I ask if she understands why Muslims going about their business are incredibly hurt by these kinds of statements .
" But if you compare the reaction of Christians to what is written about Christianity – Richard Dawkins , who 's a supporter , says religion is a form of madness – whereby Christians just shrug their shoulders and do n't respond .
If you compare the way Muslims take offence at perceived insults that are not insults , but are just a critical way of looking at their religion , then I start to ask myself , why are Muslims so hypersensitive to criticism and why do n't they do anything with it except to respond by denying it or playing the victim ?
And I 've come to the conclusion it's because of the gradual indoctrination – from parents , teachers – that everything in the Qur'an is true ; Muhammad is infallible , you have to follow his example and defend Islam at all times , at all costs .
Instead of going along as most people are doing now and saying , OK , let 's refrain from criticising Islam , let 's refrain from calling Islamic terrorism Islamic , I think we should do the opposite . "
When people throw out accusations of racism , she says , they forget that Islam is not a race but a religion ; one chooses to follow it .
But after 7/7 , the racist on the street who 's about to beat up a foreign - looking guy does n't stop to ask him if he believes in Muhammad .
" There is racism that will fall under freedom of expression and there is racism that incites violence or is violent , and those [ violent ] people have to meet with the law , just like the radical Muslims do .
But to say that we are simply not going to talk about Islam – which inspires in today 's world the greatest possible danger to world peace – because a few people here and there get offended , I think is the wrong approach .
" The burden of proof now is on the Muslims ; if the theology they subscribe to requires you to perform jihad , I think we should engage them by saying , ' Hey , we want to talk about this with you ' ; that 's not to insult you .
It is right there in the Qur'an , it is right there in the Hadith , it 's been put into practice and it is being preached .
And the people who are preaching it are taking advantage of the full array of freedoms that a liberal democratic society has .
And we are not going to shut up and call it something else just because you are saying you are offended .
I do n't even believe they are offended .
You should be more offended for the victims of 7/7 , [ who died ] in the name of religion , than by a cartoon that is drawn of Muhammad . "
In the new book , Hirsi Ali proposes an " enlightenment project " in which " critical thinking " be introduced to her former faith through various mediums , one of which , she suggests , is the Christian church .
" That 's probably going to be the most controversial , " she says , smiling .
I 'll say .
Even if it did n't ignore the baggage of 1,000 years of history – the Crusades , anyone ?
Colonialism ?
– what is an atheist doing promoting Christianity ?
Hirsi Ali laughs .
She decided to promote Christianity , she says , because of letters she received after Infidel was published , from Muslims who were sympathetic to her cause but were reluctant to abandon their faith altogether .
" Some say , ' Oh , I have also become an atheist and I 'm happy to have shed that cruel nonsense off . '
But then some say , ' I do n't want to become an atheist . ' " Hirsi Ali dismisses the kind of Christians who picket abortion clinics as fringe elements within a faith that , generally , " talks about a concept of God that is different from the Muslim [ concept ] , where you are required to submit your will completely and conform to what is in the Qur'an .
I talk about a Christianity that is enlightened enough to separate spirituality from the rest of life .
Not just church and state , but knowledge and church .
Religious groups not telling you what you can and can't do , but religion becoming an inside thing .
It 's very hard for me to describe a thing that I do n't have – that kind of spirituality . "
The 11 - minute film Hirsi Ali made with Theo Van Gogh , broadcaster and provocateur who publicly referred to Muslims as " goat - fuckers " , was intended to symbolise what they saw as misogyny within Islam .
In it , a half - naked woman is depicted with lash marks on her back while a voiceover reads passages from the Qur'an ; elsewhere , Qur'anic excerpts relating to the submission of women are projected on to a woman 's naked back .
As Ian Buruma reported in his excellent book Murder In Amsterdam , when a Dutch news programme aired Submission to Muslim women in a shelter for victims of domestic violence , they were by and large appalled .
These were the very people Hirsi Ali was trying to help ; but her style , and her choice of cohort , offended them .
Three months after the film aired on Dutch TV , Van Gogh was murdered in the street by Mohammed Bouyeri , a Dutch - Moroccan who pinned a note to his chest , calling for holy war and naming Hirsi Ali as a target .
At the time , she was an MP in the Dutch parliament , an extraordinary ascent given that 12 years earlier she had entered the country with barely a suitcase .
In 1992 , Hirsi Ali was en route from Kenya to Canada to begin married life with a man for whom she had no respect .
During a stopover in Germany , she gathered her courage and , on the advice of a relative with knowledge of the asylum system , took a train to Holland .
( Her first choice was Britain , but she was told crossing the Channel would be too difficult . )
Holland , she was assured , had one of the most liberal asylum policies in Europe .
So began a decade during which she rose from a minimum wage job , to a degree in political science from the University of Leiden and up through the Dutch political establishment .
The uncompromising tone of Submission was inspired , in part , by Hirsi Ali 's experiences in those early years as an interpreter for social services , hearing stories that took her back to her childhood .
Her father was a political opponent of the Somali president Siad Barre .
When she was two , he was jailed , forcing the family to flee , first to Saudi Arabia , then Ethiopia , then Kenya .
Although there is in Hirsi Ali an almost aristocratic bearing , it was not an easy upbringing ; she was beaten by a religious teacher until a rib broke ; was , at her grandmother 's insistence and in her father 's absence , subjected to genital mutilation ; and in later years would watch as her sister crumbled into mental illness after a secret abortion – all acts that she believed to be sanctioned by her faith and which , as she started work in Holland , she believed the Dutch authorities wilfully ignored .
When Muslim women in the Hague were found to have high instances of vitamin D deficiency , health workers put it down to poverty and not , as Hirsi Ali says came out in the interviews , to the fact they were deprived of sunlight because they did n't have permission to leave the house until their husbands came home at night .
She calls this " the twist and turn to avoid Islam " .
When she had a platform to speak , she resolved , she would not pussyfoot around in the same manner .
And she did n't .
After gaining a masters degree , writing a series of pieces in the Dutch press and eventually standing for parliament , Hirsi Ali allied herself with the most unlikely and controversial figures in Dutch politics .
As well as Van Gogh , she spoke admiringly of Pim Fortuyn , the Dutch anti-immigration politician who was himself murdered by an animal rights activist .
At the end of Nomad , she paints a cosy picture of hanging out in New York with Oriana Fallaci , the late Italian journalist whose post - 9/11 polemic , The Rage And The Pride , invokes a seething Muslim mass trying to get into Europe and is described even by Christopher Hitchens , a supporter of Hirsi Ali's , as " a primer in how not to write about Islam " .
Hirsi
Ali says she met Fallaci socially and they did n't talk about Islam – they talked about babies .
But to refer to Fallaci so warmly , given her reputation , is of course loaded .
" First of all , " she says , " I do n't feel that there is guilt by association .
And I do n't think that human beings are perfect .
If Oriana Fallaci wrote – and I have to confess she gave me her books in Italian and I do n't read Italian – but if she made these remarks that Christopher says cross the line , it still does n't mean that she was wrong in her analysis of Islam .
OK , she did make mistakes , but she is more of an ally than an enemy . "
She continues : " If I say , OK , from now I am only going to associate with people who I agree with 100 % , that 's a very small group of people . "
She reserves her greatest disapproval not for writers such as Fallaci , but for intellectuals who she says have failed utterly in their responsibility towards non-white women .
The decadence of western feminism is where Hirsi Ali is perhaps strongest .
In the book , she attacks Germaine Greer for arguing that female genital mutilation needs to be considered " in context " , as part of a " cultural identity " that western women do n't understand .
Greer , from the quotes Hirsi Ali cites , seems to be arguing merely that female circumcision is at the extreme end of a scale that starts with women wearing high heels for men's delectation – not condoning the former , but condemning the latter as part of a continuum .
Hirsi
Ali finds this inadequate ; a strange , tangential take on the subject .
Why , she asks , are voices such as Greer 's not speaking out against the subjugation of women in the Muslim world ?
She calls for a new feminism , " that is going to focus on issues faced by non-western women , because they are the biggest issues .
To own your own sexuality , as an adult woman ; to choose your own lifestyle ; to have access to education [ when ] what we see in the Muslim world is girls being pulled out of school and married off before they 've completed their education .
These things , I think , are more basic than the stuff that current feminists are concerning themselves with – like shattering the glass ceiling or finding a balance between work and home life .
There was a long article in the New York Times that went on and on about who [ in a couple ] would load and unload the dishwasher .
If you have a career and you 're so intelligent , you can work that out .
You do n't have to have a manifesto .
There is feminism that has evolved to a kind of luxury . "
On that trip back to London to see her father for the last time , Hirsi Ali visited a cousin on a council estate in east London and saw , with horror , the life she might have led : " on welfare , " she says , with hauteur , a virtual " prisoner " , in need of her husband 's permission to leave the house and then only if encased in a " black shroud " .
She says : " And I realised , oh my goodness , if I had done what my father wanted me to do in 1992 , I would be leading a comparable life , but instead of Tower Hamlets , in Toronto . "
It is not a portrait she says her cousin would recognise .
As far as the cousin is aware , she has made the right choices .
How then does Hirsi Ali resolve the Enlightenment paradox of advocating freedom , then turning to other people and saying , I know what 's best for you ?
" But it 's not I know what is best for you .
Classic liberalism was about the individual ; [ I am talking about ] a denial of rights to an individual within a community : a girl 's genitals were being cut ; a girl was being denied education , forced into marriage ; a gay guy has to hide from his parents that he 's gay otherwise they 're going to do something to him .
That is what liberalism was all about .
It is offensive to me if a group of people deny rights to an individual human being in the name of their religion – and they want the rest of us to leave them alone ?
No way . "
Has she been radicalised by her experiences ?
How can she live with death threats and not , at some level , lose perspective ?
If she did not have a point , Hirsi Ali says , " there would be no angry Muslims plotting to kill me … people would just be shrugging their shoulders . "
In any case , she says , living in Washington with security is still better than living as a woman in Saudi Arabia without it .
" Even with protection , even with death threats , I can publish , I can travel and I can live the life that I want , and not the one my parents want , or some imam somewhere thinks I should live . "
She is not interested in going back into politics and believes she has more influence on the outside .
She is sceptical of Obama , who , she thinks , in his speech to the Muslim world in Egypt last year was optimistic to the point of delusion .
She says : " The idea that if people are just friendly and demonstrate they want peace , that will be answered with good will – that is really naive .
If you have organisations in the US that are lobbying him and Congress to allow sharia , then being nice to them is not enough . "
In terms of British politics , she is more impressed with Labour than the Conservatives , for their suggested ban on the group Islam4UK .
The Archbishop of Canterbury may be surprised to know she considers him an " appeaser " of Islam for considering limited introduction of sharia law .
The book ends with a letter to her unborn , and as yet unconceived , daughter .
Hirsi
Ali draws a line from her grandmother , a nomad who followed the tribal religious code , to her mother , caught between tribalism and modernity , to what she hopes would be her daughter 's uncomplicated relationship with the west .
" She would , " she says , " not have to deal with the identity crisis that I and my mother had to deal with . "
Hirsi Ali misses
Dutch bread and cheese ; but when she lands at JFK , these days , she thinks , " home " .
And Africa ?
She smiles .
" I do n't have much in me left for Somalia , because the country is so broken , it 's not realistic to daydream about it . "
There is one thing , she says , that annoys her about the way her former faith is depicted .
" There is this tendency to think that if you are a Muslim woman you are not strong . "
She repositions .
" They , " she says firmly , " are strong women . "

For a few years now , the topic du jour at panels and conferences has been whether or not the sky is falling on the film business .
Most panelists seem to settle on a common culprit contributing to the malaise :
Too many films being made .
Case in point : During a recent conversation between Ted Hope and Chris Hyams , hosted by TheWrap ’s Sharon Waxman , the panelists bemoaned this fact , and when Waxman commented that more than 3,000 films were submitted to Sundance last year , Chris Hyams quickly interjected that the Sundance submission number grossly underestimates the real numbers .
Based on his analysis of unique , individual entries from the thousands of film festivals that used B - Side ’s Festival Genius software to run their websites , Hyams estimated that as many as 50,000 films were made in 2009 .
Audible gasps were heard in the room , and judging by the questions and comments from the audience , on Twitter and from those watching the streaming feed , it was clear that everyone agreed that 50,000 films might be 49,850 too many .
While the field is undeniably awash in a flood of ( often mediocre ) films , we might as well accept the fact that the economics of digital filmmaking ensure that these 50,000 films will likely not just double , but square in number each year .
Contrary to accepted opinion , however , this might be the best thing that could possibly happen for the field .
How is this possible ?
Because as more people become filmmakers , they will become even greater fans of film .
They will feel a more visceral connection to filmmaking and , by extension , this will make them more avid fans of film and eager students of its history and its various niches .
For proof we need only look at music – as is so often the case when it comes to thinking about the future of film .
I never walk into the record store and think there are too many bands out there , too many albums to pick from .
Instead , I value the diversity of artists available for my listening pleasure .
We accept this crowded sphere implicitly , knowing that for every bad band we encounter , there are numerous more that will truly charm our lives .
We use trusted source filters — be they online or off — to help us find the music we like , employing a range of recommendations from friends , record - shop owners , Amazon reviewers and Pandora algorithms .
Today , while the industry struggles to adapt to new business models , consumers enjoy a time of plenty when it comes to finding their listening pleasure and musicians are finding their audience directly .
Music has always been cheaper to produce than film , on average , and it was the first of the creative industries to face an ever - larger deluge of content as digital creation on one ’s laptop replaced studio production .
While once any kid could pick up a guitar on Monday morning , learn a few chords and begin playing some sweaty club by Saturday night , they can now mix in every instrument and have 10 digital tracks for sale online by midnight .
The field is definitely more crowded , but that has n’t led to any lessening in fan appreciation of music .
Not only are people attending concerts in record numbers , but attendance at performances of more obscure music is up as well , with venues like New York ’s Le Poisson Rouge filling to capacity for jazz , classical and other formats .
Classical music sales online are robust , audiences are lining up across the country to watch the Metropolitan Opera on local megaplex screens and even avant - garde noise musicians are finding their fans in the ever - expanding “ long tail . ”
While attendance at traditional classical music venues has long been in decline , a study of classical performance attendance by the Knight Foundation gives interesting insight .
In an analysis of audiences for classical music , they found the greatest predictor of attendance at such venues was n’t ticket prices , education or income level , but whether someone had ever learned to play an instrument .
If you have musical training , you feel a more intimate connection to the music and you search out many types of music , including classical , to explore its history and its niches .
I believe that likewise , in film , we now have legions of young people who have learned to shoot , edit and make a film .
The industry tends to dismiss these as amateurs and complain about the torrential flood of their films , but we might just have the perfect generation — one that feels a visceral connection to film and wants to explore it more .
Film is no longer something mythic for them , hard to do or just for an elite few .
They now know how to make it , and this commonness may just lead to more discovery and participation .
Knowing what it takes to make a film , they might begin to seek out that retrospective screening of Kurosawa , learn about cinema pre-Tarantino and check out the newest films from Hollywood and obscure indies alike .
But if this is to happen , there needs to be a welcoming of the flood — condescension needs to be replaced by smart marketing , drawing the links between their exploration and those things that every auteur has had to learn .
We , the filmmaking community , need to encourage new methods of programming , discovery , curation and exhibition , or we ’ll be left behind as these new systems are built for everyone else — or , rather , for us , the people now making the content , the films , that everyone else is watching .
We can embrace this future or ignore it , but it ’s coming our way — in torrents .
The state NAACP is expressing “ unconditional support ” for the November ballot measure to legalize marijuana , continuing proponents ’ framing of it as a civil rights issue .
“ We are joining a growing number of medical professionals , labor organizations , law enforcement authorities , local municipalities , and approximately 56 percent of the public , in saying that it is time to decriminalize the use of marijuana , ” state NAACP President Alice Huffman said in a news release Monday .
“ There is a strong racial component that must be considered when we investigate how the marijuana laws are applied to people of color . ”
The measure , Control and Tax Cannabis Initiative 2010 , was designated Monday as Proposition 19 .
The Drug Policy Alliance will join the California State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition at a news conference Tuesday morning in Sacramento to release a report , “ Targeting Blacks for Marijuana , ” based on marijuana possession arrests of African Americans in California ’s 25 largest counties .
The alliance says the report shows African Americans are arrested for marijuana possession at higher rates than whites — at double , triple or even quadruple the rate of whites — even though the U.S. government studies consistently find that young blacks use marijuana at lower rates than young whites .
Huffman said data from the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice shows half of California ’s marijuana possession arrestees in 1990 were nonwhite and 28 percent were under age 20 , but in 2009 , 62 percent were nonwhite and 42 percent were under age 20 .
Marijuana possession arrests of youth of color rose from about 3,100 in 1990 to about 16,300 in 2008 — a surge about three times greater than that group ’s population growth , she said .
“ We have empirical proof that the application of the marijuana laws has been unfairly applied to our young people of color , ” Huffman said .
“ Justice is the quality of being just and fair , and these laws have been neither just nor fair . ”
San Diego - based nonprofit Californians for Drug Free Youth hosted an event Friday in Universal City so community leaders — including some African Americans — could speak out against the legalization measure .
“ I had a good year in 2009 ; I only buried six youths related to drugs and drug overdoses , ” said Bishop Ron Allen , president of the International Faith Based Coalition .
“ If marijuana is legalized in the state of California , crime will increase , murder will increase .
If marijuana is legalized in my community , and is legalized in my world , and our youth have an opportunity to be able to use , we will see more dropouts , we will see an increase of crime , and we will see more individuals hanging out on the corner , and I am seriously afraid we will lose generations to come . ”
Former Los Angeles City Councilman and state Senator Nate Holden said he believes legalization wo n’t stop Mexican drug cartels with big investments in marijuana .
“ They are here to stay , and they are going to destroy our society if we let them .
We are going to fight them and we are not going to let them destroy us . ”

For months , we 've been nervously awaiting new White House intellectual property " czar " Victoria A. Espinel 's Joint Strategic Plan , and the White House published it ( PDF ) this morning .
But the document turned out to be fairly innocuous ; fair use even gets a few mentions .
Rightsholders who hoped the federal government would start running " three strikes " Internet copyright tribunals or start ordering ISPs to block websites were disappointed .
Do n't get us wrong , there 's a bit of the standard rhetoric in the document , as in this :
" Today , the Internet allows for a person who illegally ' camcords ' a film at a movie theater in Moscow to distribute a bootleg copy across the globe with the push of a button , " the plan warns .
" These thieves impose substantial costs .
They depress investment in technologies needed to meet global challenges . "
On the other hand , there 's this refreshing observation :
One of the reasons that the U.S. is a global leader in innovation and creativity is our early establishment of strong legal mechanisms to provide necessary economic incentives required to innovate .
By the same token , fair use of intellectual property can support innovation and artistry .
Strong intellectual property enforcement efforts should be focused on stopping those stealing the work of others , not those who are appropriately building upon it .
And some of the recommendations , principles , and action items in the document are — dare we say it — sensible , or at least not harmful .
We like suggestion number two the most : transparency .
The JSP calls for the government to solicit more feedback on IP enforcement through hearings and public rulemakings ( as opposed to the back - room - generated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ) .
And the survey urges Washington to " lead by example " by figuring out how to buy less counterfeit stuff itself .
This is a particular concern for the FBI , miffed at the number of government agencies that buy bootleg Cisco routers ( including the FBI sometimes ) .
While the White House has ordered agencies to clean up their act , that mandate does n't extend to government contractors ; the new JSP says Federal agencies should take steps to fix this mess .
As for particular policies , here 's what stood out to us :
No help for " three strikes "
Some groups , like AT&T , asked Espinel to support things like " three strikes " tribunals that would replace the court system for simple P2P cases .
The company also wanted the government to " create and maintain a list of international websites known to host and traffic in infringed copyrighted works .
The Department of Justice would then be given the authority to require , after thorough investigation and governmental due process , that ISPs deny access to these websites . "
No dice , said Espinel .
" The Administration believes that it is essential for the private sector , including content owners , Internet service providers , advertising brokers , payment processors and search engines , to work collaboratively , consistent with the antitrust laws , to address activity that has a negative economic impact and undermines US businesses , and to seek practical and efficient solutions to address infringement . "
( Emphasis added . )
As for government help , Espinel says that the feds will continue to do what they do now : prosecute criminal cases .
That 's about it .
Circumvention devices
The plan says the government will soon begin trading samples of " circumvention devices " with the content industry " to assist in determining whether such devices violate an import prohibition . "
Obviously MPAA and RIAA do n't like modchips that allow users to end run DRM restrictions .
Groups like Public Knowledge , on the other hand , point out that educators can't exercise fair use rights if they can't access technologies to help them extract video content from DVDs .
In any event , the JSP will soon provide the Department of Homeland Security with the authority to share circumvention gadgets with rightholders , it says , so that they can " assist in accurate determinations of infringement and violation .
The U.S. Government will also take action to provide DHS components with the authority to share samples and enforcement information related to seized circumvention devices to strengthen criminal and civil enforcement . "
Here 's hoping that that sharing process will be transparent , too .
Unlicensed Internet pharmacies
The plan says the IPEC will round up about a dozen Federal bureaucracies , including the Office of National Drug Control Policy , the FBI , and the Food and Drug Administration , and come up with a strategy for fighting unlicensed Internet pharmacies .
Espinel 's office will chair the resultant committee , which will crank out a report with recommendations about what to do .
The report also promises more vigilance against " foreign - based and foreign - controlled websites and web services " that " infringe American intellectual property rights , " but acknowledges that there is n't much the US can do about them .
Nonetheless , the government will " expeditiously assess current efforts to combat such sites and will develop a coordinated and comprehensive plan to address them , " the IPEC says .
Getting some real piracy numbers
The Joint Strategic Plan does rather delicately acknowledge the Government Accountability Office 's recent report on IP theft data , which noted that most industry piracy estimates are bogus .
The GAO " questioned the piracy rates estimated by certain industry groups and certain assumptions and methodologies used in those studies , " IPEC gingerly observes .
Then it goes further , noting that " there is no known comprehensive study that attempts to measure the economic contributions of intellectual property - intensive industries across all US business sectors , " and says it 's time to produce one .
To get this started , the IPEC will authorize the Department of Commerce 's Economic and Statistics Administration to set up a framework for getting the job done .
Enforcement
Finally , and somewhat ominously , the IPEC will review all existing copyright laws " to ensure that they are providing an effective deterrent to infringement ( including , as to criminal penalties , reviewing the United States Sentencing Guidelines ) . "
This review will come 120 days after Espinel submits her plan to Congress .
She 's scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday .
The reaction we 've gotten to the document has been mostly favorable — especially from Public Knowledge , which praised Espinel 's " carefully crafted and balanced agreements within the bounds of competition to be used when the private sector undertakes enforcement actions .
In our view the private industry should not have the ability to cut off someone 's Internet access based only on unproven allegations without any due process . "
But as for the enforcement recommendations , the Administration should look at copyright law more generally rather than focusing simply on enforcement , PK's Gigi Sohn added .
" We urge the Administration to examine how overly strong copyright enforcement and outdated copyright laws can have a negative impact on the economy , on innovation and civic discourse . "
The Recording Industry Association of America sent us a positive , albeit noncommittal response .
The report " is a welcome step toward reversing the dangerous trajectory that has endangered America 's creative community , " RIAA declared .
" Addressing the problem of intellectual property theft in a meaningful way is essential to enhancing our global competitiveness and protecting American innovation . "
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has a great blog where they post images from the hi-res camera onboard .
I was perusing a recent image , and was a bit befuddled :
What the heck ?
Is this a plateau of some kind ?
Is that a small dome just below the center of it ?
The whole thing looks pitted around the edge , too , like some sort of erosion has taken place .
But that can't be right !
Happily , being an old hand with optical illusions , I knew exactly what to do .
I flipped the image over , and all became clear :
Ah , that 's better .
Now you can see what 's what : it 's a crater with boulders in it .
The small dome is now clearly a tiny meteorite impact crater .
What looked like pitting is now obviously rocks and rubble that have slid down the slope of the crater wall .
This is an old illusion .
Having evolved on the surface of a planet , we interpret our surroundings assuming sunlight is coming from above .
If we see a picture rotated such that the sunlight is coming from below , it plays tricks on our perception .
Shadows point the wrong way , making craters look like domes .
Flip the picture over , and voila !
All is as it should be .
This image is a wonderful example of this illusion ( though I 've never run across a name for it .
I suggest " Plait 's Plateau " ) .
You can take lots of lunar pictures and see it if you rotate them .
I suggest you check out the LRO archive , because it 's a terrific lesson that what you see is not always what you get ( and also because the images are simply too cool ) .
It 's incredibly easy to fool our brains , and if more people realized that then it would be a lot easier for them to be skeptical of what they see , and of claims from other people about what they see !

One of the best - looking games due for the Nintendo DS is now one of the best - looking games due for the PS3 , with this weeks '
Famitsu reporting that Level 5's Ninokuni is getting a major facelift for a home console .

What had been a quaint role - playing game for Nintendo's handheld now , even in awful photos of a magazine on a man 's lap , looks stunning on the PS3 , Studio Ghibli's ( Spirited Away , Princess Mononoke ) art design leaping off the page .
Imagine how all that animation ( Ghibli 's animators are working on a ton of material for the game ) will look in 1080 p on a big screen ...

What 's more , there 's the game 's key mechanic to consider : the DS version had the player drawing symbols on the touch - screen to cast spells , which were learned from an actual book included with the game .
Could this PS3 version include support for motion controller PlayStation Move ?
God , I hope so .
There was no actual information included in the piece aside from the shots and platform reveal ( Level 5 has a press conference scheduled for later in the week ) , so it 's unclear whether there 's still a DS version coming , or whether it was scrapped in favour of this ( which may be likely , considering the lengthy delays affecting the handheld edition ) .
Soon as we know , we 'll update you .

No , I 'm not a nationalist .
I love football , but only when it comes to the World Cup .
I do n't follow the Bundesliga at all , like many of my countrymen .
But during a World Cup we 'll wave flags and wear silly wigs painted black , red and gold .
However , playing England is nobody 's idea of fun .
We all still remember that awful moment .
You know , the one with the Russian referee .
Ball behind the line ?
Every German has seen this clip a million times .
No German team likes to play the Dutch .
But England - that should be a fascinating feast of football Marcus Schuler
That 's why we 're not keen to play England .
By the way : Who is the referee on Sunday ?
Is he Russian ?
If yes , I 'll need a forest of flags .
What I do n't understand , though , are newspaper headlines like The Sun 's " Get Ready for Germ Warfare " .
We have nothing against the English .
On the contrary : Lady Diana was our Queen Of Hearts , too .
I see little difference between the drinking habits of German and British football hooligans .
Hackneyed stereotypes
And anyway , when I talk to English friends about football , they never ever use words like " Blitzkrieg " or " Fritz " .
I have no idea why British media , especially the tabloids , use these hackneyed stereotypes .
Do n't they know better ?
World War II is long over .
I was born in 1971 .
Image caption Sunday 's match between England and Germany will be their 28th
The first foreign language I learned in school was English .
And through exchange programmes I met plenty of humorous and lovely English students that were pretty much like us ( apart from the watery beer they liked ) .
I suspect that British journalists rely on these stereotypes because they lack creativity .
There 's only one match pairing that 's like a red rag to a bull for us : Germany - Netherlands .
That would bring up plenty of bad memories .
Everybody remembers when Frank Rijkaard spat at Rudi Voeller during the 1990 World Cup in Italy .
No German team likes to play the Dutch .
Feast of football
But England - that should be a fascinating feast of football : A classic , 90 minutes of highly - emotional fair play - with one winning team at the end .
ENGLAND v GERMANY FACTS
England and Germany have been in 27 matches together of which England has won 12 and Germany 10 ( plus two more if you count penalty shootouts )
Germany 's team is their youngest for 76 years , while England have their oldest squad ever to play in a World Cup
Until 1990 , Germany played as West and East Germany
The first time the two teams met in a competitive match was at Wembley in the final of the 1966 World Cup - when England beat West Germany 4 -
2
And this time it will be very exciting : Germany has one of the youngest teams in its footballing history .
The English have stars like Wayne Rooney - who does n't score any more ( hopefully ) .
Oh , and there are our penalty shoot - out specialists .
Another opinion of a truly neutral party - the chef of our staff restaurant who is Swiss .
His bet : Germany will win on Sunday .
Why ?
" Your team is very young and is getting better with each game .
And the English team is n't that good . "
I disagree with him .
Part of me hopes we lose against England .
After all , who wants to meet Argentina in the quarter final ?
reading a lot of Jack London and building a dog sled .
After cutting the wood and nailing it all together , I set it out in the snow and tied it to our youthful Labrador Retriever , ordering her to mush .
She just sat there mulishly and gave me a look that told me to get a goddamn Siberian Husky .
One of the best things about being an incredibly childish adult is that there 's nobody to tell you that you can't use the power tools .
Or in this case , a simple ratchet and screwdriver , because that 's all I used to turn our old jogging stroller into a wagon that our German Shorthaired Pointer has been joyfully pulling around the neighborhood for a week .
And with this I have further cemented my reputation as a total nutjob among all our neighbors :
That double jogging stroller gave us a wonderful summer of use , but it had front alignment issues and it was taking up a lot of space in our basement .
When I was trying to figure out how to build an axle for a dog wagon , I remembered the jogging stroller and just took it apart to use the back axle and wheels and then detached some of the tubing to create the wagon shafts .
I used about twelve $ 1.59 hose clamps to attach everything together , knowing that I would have to make adjustments later and not wanting to drill anything yet .
But the clamps ( which require only a standard - head screwdriver ) have turned out to be really strong .
I took the handlebar seat from the Popscycle and attached it with a five inch bolt between the foot rests and an extra large clamp in the rear : I can take it off again pretty quickly when we want to go for a bike ride .
I 'm still working on a second seat ; right now the girl will occasionally sit in the basket on a broke - down toy horse we found at the thrift store .
I 'm rigging up a seat belt and handle this week .
Most of the time only one kid rides in it , and when we take the wagon to the market the groceries go in the basket ( that was scavenged from the neighbors ' trash ) .
You could probably make something similar out of any jogging stroller ( we used a Babyjogger Twinner II ) or one of those kid trailers you pull behind a bike .
If there 's any interest , I can post a more detailed how - to so you can build one for your kids and dog (s ) .
I 'd really love to see wagon pulled by a team !
I did a lot of research on the types of carts used in recreational dog carting and I was happy to read that a two - bicycle wheel sulky like this is much easier on a dog than a heavier four - wheel wagon .
I also researched the harness that the dog would need to wear , and determined I could either pay $ 70 for a nylon " one size fits all " harness , or make a leather one myself that fits Wendell perfectly .
I found diagrams online for a standard Siwash harness and went to the thrift store and bought five or six of the best quality leather belts they had .
The big coup came when I was on the way out of the store and noticed an old leather golf bag loaded with brass rings , clamps , padded leather straps , and tons of good leather , all for $ 3.40 .
I bought a bag of leather rivets and used an awl to puncture the leather and put the harness together making sure he had a nice padded piece across his chest .
I had to figure out a way to keep the shafts away from his body while still allowing him to steer the wagon and after a bit of experimentation I got it right :
The shafts are just for steering ; he " pulls " the wagon with leather traces .
I still have a bit of fine tuning to do , but I 'm pretty happy with how it all came out , using almost exclusively recycled materials and spending only around $ 30 for everything I needed to complete both the wagon and the harness .* * * * * This is the good part .
Now , I fully expect to get some nasty e-mails / comments from dog lovers telling me this is cruel .
Never mind that we 're not trekking across the Yukon Territory here ( we 're just trotting around our neighborhood ) .
Never mind that he 's pulling children , not adults .
Never mind that dogs have been pulling carts for hundreds of not thousands of years .
I would even agree that for some dogs this sort of thing might be cruel .
Carting is not for every dog , but I will say that it is for our dog .
He has boundless energy , and we went for a 5 - mile run every day for several weeks before we started carting just so I could be sure he'd be in good enough shape after the long winter .
He loves to be outside .
It would be far more cruel to leave this dog in his crate while we played outside .
His tail wags the entire time he 's pulling and he dances around with excitement whenever I pull out the harness and move the wagon towards the front door .
While he carts I keep hold of his leash and he pulls against the leash as though the wagon is n't even there .
He wants to jog with the wagon and when I get out of breath and stop he turns to look back at me as if to say , .
I did n't even really have to train him for any of this ; the first few times he was strapped in I rewarded him with treats whenever he made a confident turn or if he came when called .
But this adopted Detroit street dog truly is a natural .
When he started pulling the wagon with the kids , he became even more careful , as if he knew his kids were in there and it was his job to keep them safe .
He even loses interest in squirrels
Wherever we go , we hear a lot of the same comments , but my favorite so far is , .
Who would n't want to get pulled around in a wagon by a beloved dog , his tail tickling your knees as it wags ?
We 've taken practically every kid in the neighborhood for a ride around the block .
The girl 's best friend shouted , " I want to do this every day !
" Gram insists on wearing his new " cowboy " hat every time we go out in the wagon , and we have totally been dressing him like an Amish boy .
I am planning to buy one of those orange reflective triangles you see on the back of buggies the next time I stop by the Feed & Seed , just in case one of those Yoder boys are on Rumspringa and do n't see him as he circles the playground .
Here 's a very shaky video I made as I ran backwards ahead of the wagon trying to get some perspective other than me holding the leash .
This is not how we ordinarily do this ( but do n't worry , we were on a very safe sidewalk and I was never more than a few steps away ) :
A Wall Street Journal article today draws attention to yet another unexpected way in which Facebook 's privacy practices have not complied with its public statements and have disregarded users ' privacy rights .
Just last week , when asked about Facebook 's privacy practices with advertisers , Facebook executive Elliot Schrage wrote :
We do n’t share your information with advertisers .
Our targeting is anonymous .
We do n’t identify or share names .
Period .
As the Wall Street Journal report shows , this was not true .
In fact , Facebook 's architecture at the time allowed advertisers to see detailed personal information about some Facebook users .
The article identified a security flaw concerning referer URLs , a basic part of the web 's architecture .
For readers who are n't web gurus : A " referer " is a piece of information sent whenever you click on a link .
It tells the site you 're visiting what URL you 've just come from .
( The term 's strange spelling is one of the web 's many historical in - jokes . )
In some instances , the referer URL will also include a " query string " that reveals additional information .
Ordinarily , the query string does n't reveal anything sensitive .
In fact , it 's a maxim of web engineering that sensitive information ( like passwords ) should never be placed in the query string , exactly because doing so can cause security and privacy problems .
It 's a maxim that Facebook apparently forgot .
A paper published last August by researchers at AT&T Labs and Worcester Polytechnic ( blogged by EFF here ) showed how Facebook 's referers revealed information to advertisers that could be used to personally identify visitors .
The problem was made far worse by the changes Facebook made in December and April , which designated radically more user data as " publicly available information " and created new tech tools for mining that data .
Yesterday , facing the pressure of the impending Wall Street Journal article , Facebook fixed the worst aspects of that loophole .
They say they 're in the process of fixing the rest .
The fixes come not a moment too soon .
The flaws were not only in conflict with Schrage 's public statements , but with Facebook 's own privacy policy , which states that " We do n’t share your information with advertisers without your consent . "
Beyond the fixes Facebook has already made , what steps can be taken to prevent this kind of data leakage in the future ?
There are some steps Facebook could take , like moving users to HTTPS , which can limit transmission of referer URLs .
And users can protect themselves by using plugins like Firefox 's RefControl .
We also encourage both social networking services and web browsers to adopt emerging standards like ' noreferrer ' , which would allow sites much simpler control over how referers are handled .
Of course , as demonstrated in the AT&T / WPI paper , referer strings are not the only path by which social networks leak personal information to advertisers .
That paper found that 11 of the 12 social networking sites it examined leak personal information to advertisers by one method or another .
Hopefully , today 's WSJ article is a sign that all of these methods will soon be receiving closer scrutiny .

Sometimes a lack of sensitivity or even an innocent mistake exposes a major truth .
On the Web site of Moriah , a public company for infrastructure work that belongs to the Jerusalem municipality , one can find descriptions of various projects in which the company is involved .
Among them is the Museum of Tolerance : “ The Simon Wiesenthal Center , the entrepreneur for the construction of the Museum of Tolerance in central Jerusalem , asked Moriah to carry out preparatory and infrastructure work for the project , ” says the site .
Immediately afterward , under the heading “ Objective , ” it says : “ Carrying out infrastructure work , removal of nuisances in the area of the project ... ”
What the site calls “ nuisances ” are in fact skeletons , bones and skulls .
Hundreds of skeletons that were buried in Jerusalem ’s central Muslim cemetery over a period of some 1,000 years .
A Haaretz investigation indicates that the “ nuisances ” were cleared away from the site swiftly and clandestinely during five grueling months of nonstop work .
Testimonies of participants who worked at the site , which were obtained by Haaretz , indicate that the skeletons were removed as quickly as possible to enable the start of construction on the museum .
“ That was n’t archaeology , it was contract work , ” claimed one of the workers .
The story of the Museum of Tolerance is one of a clash between worlds , between the concealed subterranean world of dead bodies − members of the Muslim community who were buried in the soil of Jerusalem − and an American Jewish institution in Los Angeles with Hollywood - style panache , the Simon Wiesenthal Center .
The institution is headed by Marvin Hier , an American Jew who has an open door to U.S. presidents , and the man who brought California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to Israel for the museum ’s groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 .
Opposing him is the leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel , who has tried to block the project , it has been claimed , out of cynical and political motives .
The High Court of Justice was also involved in the story , with several petitions placed on its desk in an effort to prevent the realization of the ambitious and controversial project .
The permission finally granted by the High Court to go forward was based on a controversial opinion submitted to it by the Antiquities Authority , and on the fact that the project was supposed to be designed by preeminent architect Frank Gehry , who has since withdrawn from the assignment .
Also involved in the affair are two prominent former members of the Jerusalem municipality , who are currently suspected of criminal offenses in other real estate projects : former prime minister Ehud Olmert , who was mayor of Jerusalem , and former municipal engineer Uri Sheetrit .
Also involved in the story are Tel Aviv University and an archaeologist who works for the university , Alon Shavit .
Shavit is a key figure in this story , who has held many jobs related to moving the graves located beneath the land on which the museum is slated to be built .
Among other things , he was the expert responsible for the removal work and the contractor in charge of carrying it out , and the company he established paid the excavators ’ salaries .
There are also arguments among archaeologists .
Now all that is left in the long and complex unfolding of events is a large lot with a huge open pit , in the heart of the city of Jerusalem .
To this day , for most Jerusalemites , the Museum of Tolerance is the six - meter - high metal fence that surrounds a construction site that has been off - limits for the past six years .
Unlike most other building sites − here it is difficult , if not impossible , to find a slit through which to peek inside .
Along the top of the fence are security cameras and spotlights ; parts of it are edged with barbed wire .
During the months of excavation the site was probably the most secret civilian construction site in Israel .
Today it is quite deserted .
But if we could go back to the period from about November 2008 to April 2009 , we would see a place bustling with hundreds of workers employed in the excavations in three shifts around the clock .
The five months of excavation are documented in a series of exclusive pictures that are published here for the first time .
In one picture a worn cardboard box takes up most of the photograph .
Someone drew a schematic bone on the box as in a child ’s drawing and wrote “ scattered items , ” and afterward erased the words .
Other words are also erased .
The number L4316 marks the “ locus ” − a sequential serial number in archaeological jargon .
The box is far too small to contain the bones that stick out from both sides ; the cover does n’t close and is torn .
Another photograph depicts an ancient skull that was apparently exposed to the light hundreds of years after its owner was buried in the Jerusalem soil .
In the area of the crown one can see new fractures , perhaps from an imprecise blow from a hoe .
Above it there is still a large rock , and to its right a cardboard box .
In the top half of the picture one can sees it is broad daylight and young Israelis , the excavators , are engaged in their work .
Anyone who so wishes can perhaps find in the hollow eyes of the skull a look of amazement at what it is seeing .
In the past two weeks , in the open parts of the site that still constitute a cemetery , workers have suddenly begun to show up among the graves :
As with a huge puzzle , the workers are reassembling the tombstones and more or less restoring the graves .
The workers are emissaries , not of the government , but of the northern branch of Israel ’s Islamic Movement .
Mohammed ’s companions
The Ma’am Allah cemetery ‏( the name would eventually be distorted to “ Mamilla ” and expanded in meaning to describe the entire area‏ ) originated in medieval Jerusalem , at the start of the last millennium .
Burial at the site continued until the early 20th century .
Muslim tradition has it that Prophet Mohammed ’s companions were also buried here .
Another tradition mentions the burial of 70,000 of Saladin ’s soldiers in the same place .
At its peak the cemetery covered an area of about 200 dunams ‏ ( some 50 acres‏ ) , so that in effect today large parts of downtown Jerusalem are built over graves .
According to estimates , the cemetery included most of Independence Park , the Experimental School , Agron Street , Beit Agron , Kikar Hahatulot ‏( Cats ’ Square‏ ) and other areas .
The change in the situation of the cemetery began with the process by which Jerusalem expanded outside the walls of the Old City , in the mid-19th century :
By then it was no longer in a distant , peripheral area , but rather in the heart of a growing , modern city .
That was also the start of tensions between respect for the dead and tradition on the one hand , and the value of the land , which was worth its weight in gold , on the other .
Like many other Muslim cemeteries in Israel , this one was also neglected for many decades , and today is overgrown with weeds and full of broken tombstones .
It is hard to think of anything further from the old and crumbling cemetery than the life of Rabbi Marvin Hier , the founder and director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , and one of the most important and influential rabbis in the United States .
A series of pictures of Hier afford us a small glimpse into his world ; among the pictures he is seen in the company of two presidents , George W. Bush and Bill Clinton ; one pope , John Paul II ; and a large number of actors : Arnold Schwarzenegger , Will Smith , Whoopi Goldberg , Ben Kingsley and others .
The first Museum of Tolerance that was built by Hier , and opened in 1993 in Los Angeles , became amazingly successful , with a quarter of a million visitors a year who come to view the exhibits and to participate in the interactive displays in which the museum specializes .
One of Hier ’s great achievements was the passage of a law in the state requiring students and members of the security forces in California to visit his museum .
That same year , toward the end of Teddy Kollek ’s final term as mayor of Jerusalem , the idea of building a Jerusalem branch of the Museum of Tolerance − a “ Center for Human Dignity − Museum of Tolerance Jerusalem , ” by its full name − was considered .
The concept was promoted enthusiastically during the tenure of Kollek ’s successor , Ehud Olmert .
“ A glorious project that in addition to its cultural and educational objective will also constitute a work of art in itself and a site that will attract tourists to Jerusalem and contribute to the tourism industry in Israel as well ... ” − thus the museum is described in the Wiesenthal Center ’s reply , submitted to the High Court , to the Islamic Movement ’s petition for a ban on work at the site .
The initiators of the project say it was Kollek who first suggested creating a Museum of Tolerance in his city , after a visit to the original institution in Los Angeles .
Kollek ’s associate Ruth Cheshin , president of the Jerusalem Foundation , which the late mayor founded , remembers things differently : “ He was in favor of a museum of tolerance , but did n’t like the idea proposed by the Wiesenthal Center .
He said that this was not Los Angeles , and a museum for tolerance should grow out of the place rather than being ‘ imported . ’ ”
Kollek ’s successor , Olmert , was also opposed to the idea at first .
Also among the opponents were Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv , which feared the competition .
“ Building the museum is unnecessary .
It is totally unacceptable and irregular for the government to put land at the disposal of foreign citizens who do not represent any group among the Jewish people , ” said the spokeswoman of Yad Vashem at the time , Iris Rosenberg .
As a result of the pressure , the initiators of the museum promised not to deal with the Holocaust , and Yad Vashem removed its opposition , as did Olmert , who subsequently became an enthusiastic supporter of the museum .
Mayor Olmert designated the site for the Museum of Tolerance , and later , as minister of Indutry and Trade , in charge of the Israel Lands Authority , he signed the agreement awarding the Wiesenthal Center the site .
The paths of the Wiesenthal Center and Ehud Olmert also cross in the indictment now being deliberated on in the Jerusalem District Court in the so - called “ Rishon Tours ” case .
According to the charges , at the end of April 2003 , Olmert traveled to Paris and New York , with his expenses being covered by three organizations .
One of them was the Wiesenthal Center , which paid $ 5,765 for the trip .
Hier ’s son
Abe is one of the witnesses for the prosecution .
Two Olmert associates − his attorney Eli Zohar , and his spokesman from years in the Jerusalem municipality , Haggai Elias , were also employed by the project entrepreneurs .
The museum ’s site , at the corner of Independence Park in downtown Jerusalem , was chosen after a number of other locations were rejected − among them plots near the museums on Givat Ram , the old nature museum in the German Colony and even property in East Jerusalem .
The site chosen was familiar to everyone as a parking lot , which had been serving those who visit the city center since the 1960s .
Apparently nobody remembered that people were buried there .
“ Am Yisrael chai ‏( the people of Israel live‏ ) , ” declared California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in his American - Austrian accent at the museum ’s groundbreaking ceremony , in May 2004 .
It was Schwarzenegger ’s first visit outside the U.S. as governor .
Next to him on the dais was Moshe Katsav , then the Israeli president .
During his meeting with then - foreign minister Silvan Shalom , Schwarzenegger said that building museums of tolerance would promote tolerance just as building fitness clubs promoted health .
It was a meeting of two worlds : Hollywood and the subterranean .

IRELAND'S transgender community can now come out into the open to fight for their rights , campaigners said last night after the Government accepted defeat in a landmark legal battle .
Transsexual Lydia
Foy spoke of her hope that young transgender people would benefit after she won her 13 - year legal quest to be officially recognised as a woman .
The Government has formally withdrawn its Supreme Court appeal in the historic transgender court case lodged by the qualified dentist in her bid to be described as female on her birth certificate .
Dr Foy ( 62 ) , a father of two who underwent a sex - change operation in the UK in 1992 , spoke of her relief and delight that her " long and difficult " legal battle had come to an end .
The dentist , registered at birth as male , said she hoped the State 's move would help others who had " endured the pain , abuse , isolation , humiliation and fear that have been the lot of those who are transgendered " .
She urged the Government to now act swiftly to change the laws so people who have undergone operations to change their gender could be granted new birth certificates .
" It has been a very long road and at times I thought it would never end , but I felt I just had to keep going for my own dignity and self - respect and for all the other transgender people out there who were suffering in silence , " said Dr Foy , who lives in Athy , Co Kildare .
" I am also glad this ordeal is nearly over for the sake of members of my family circle . "
Solicitor Michael Farrell from the Free Legal Advice Centres ( FLAC ) , which represented Dr Foy during the case -- which began in 1997 -- described the decision as a " major development " .
" We feel that , as a result of this case , young transgender people , in particular , may feel more confident that they will be able to assert their real gender , as they see it , " Mr Farrell said .
Identity
It is estimated as many as 600 people in Ireland may be affected by gender identity disorders with many reluctant to reveal their difficulties to friends and family .
Martine Cuypers , chair of the Transgender Equality Network Ireland ( TENI ) , described the decision as a " landmark movement " both legally and socially .
Dr Foy will be grand marshal at the upcoming Dublin Pride Festival parade .
Louise Hannon , a member of the transgender community , who runs that festival , said many transgender persons emigrate as they feel more accepted abroad .
She said there was still a social stigma attached to being transgendered , particularly in rural Ireland .
The Government , which has been under fire for lagging behind its European counterparts , will now have to introduce legislation to allow people to be recognised in their new gender on their birth certificates .
The acceptance of the High Court ruling that Irish law on transgender rights breaches the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) must be reported to the Dail by Taoiseach Brian Cowen within 21 days .
A gender recognition group has been set up to advise Social Protection Minister Eamon O Cuiv on the changes to the law required to provide recognition for transsexuals ' gender .
But Mr Farrell described it as " very late in the day " as the Government had been aware since 2002 that the law would have to be changed after a key decision in a UK case taken to the European Court of Human Rights .
In the UK , laws introduced in 2004 protect the position of family members of a transgender person -- providing for succession and other rights .
The Irish Human Rights Commission said the decision was " overdue " and Ireland had been out of line with European Law .
In 1993 , Dr Foy was refused by the Registrar General 's Office after she applied for a new birth certificate as a woman following her sex - change operation .
In 2007 , a decade after Dr Foy began High Court proceedings for legal recognition as a woman , a judge ruled that Irish law on the issue was incompatible with the ECHR .
But the State appealed this decision to the Supreme Court .

I have been notified that the Haskell language significantly changed from the time the first version of this reference has been published ( especially system of modules ) .
I am working on an update !!!

Haskell is a very nice functional language .
While I have not been using it much recently , a lot of my Python and XSLT skills are derived from my playing with Haskell .
Haskell is a general purpose , purely functional programming language incorporating many recent innovations in programming language design .
Haskell provides higher - order functions , non-strict semantics , static polymorphic typing , user - defined algebraic datatypes , pattern - matching , list comprehensions , a module system , a monadic I / O system , and a rich set of primitive datatypes , including lists , arrays , arbitrary and fixed precision integers , and floating - point numbers .
Haskell is both the culmination and solidification of many years of research on non-strict functional languages .

The ECB , IMF , and now the Fed have come out with bazookas blazing in all hands .
The amount of ammunition the fools are willing to throw at " Defending the Euro " is now up to $ 962 billion .
Please consider EU Crafts $ 962 Billion Show of Force to Halt Euro Crisis .
European policy makers unveiled an unprecedented loan package worth almost $ 1 trillion and a program of bond purchases as they spearheaded a global drive to stop a sovereign - debt crisis that threatened to shatter confidence in the euro .
Jolted into action by last week ’s slide in the currency and soaring bond yields in Portugal and Spain , the 16 euro nations agreed to offer financial assistance worth as much as 750 billion euros ( $ 962 billion ) to countries under attack from speculators .
The European Central Bank will counter “ severe tensions ” in “ certain ” markets by purchasing government and private debt .
“ The message has gotten through : the euro zone will defend its money , ” French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde told reporters in Brussels early today after the 14 - hour meeting .
“ This is Shock and Awe , Part II and in 3 - D , ” Marco Annunziata , chief economist at UniCredit Group in London , said in an e-mailed note .
“ This truly is overwhelming force , and should be more than sufficient to stabilize markets in the near term , prevent panic and contain the risk of contagion . ”
World Needs Dollars To Defend The Euro
The Federal Reserve is going to reopen a program set up during the financial crisis , to make sure foreign banks have the dollars they need , the European Central Bank announced late Sunday .
The Fed will ship dollars overseas through the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the ECB and the Swiss National Bank .
The Bank of Japan will be considering similar measures soon , the ECB said .
The facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and other financial centers , the ECB said in a statement on its web site .
The ECB said the first repurchase operations for dollars against ECB - eligible collateral would be carried out on Tuesday .
Credit Lines Will Expand Fed's Balance Sheet
The Federal Reserve late Sunday opened a program to ship U.S. dollars to Europe in a move to head off a broader financial crisis on the continent .
Other central banks , including the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan also are involved in the dollar swap effort .
The move comes after the European Union and International Monetary Fund pledged a nearly $ 1 trillion defense package for the embattled euro , hoping to calm jittery markets and halt attacks on the eurozone 's weakest members .
The ECB also jumped into the bond market Sunday night , saying it is ready to buy eurozone bonds to shore up liquidity in " dysfunctional " markets .
The Fed 's action reopens a program put in place during the 2008 global financial crisis under which dollars are shipped overseas through the foreign central banks .
In turn , these central banks can lend the dollars out to banks in their home countries that are in need of dollar funding to prevent the European crisis from spreading further .
The program reopened on Sunday will expand the Fed 's balance sheet , economists say .
However , the program poses little credit risk to the Fed because the arrangements are with other central banks , they added .
Hallelujah , All Praise the " Riskless " Transaction
ECB Press Release
In view of the current exceptional circumstances prevailing in the market , the Governing Council decided :
1 . To conduct interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets ( Securities Markets Programme ) to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional .
...
2 . To adopt a fixed - rate tender procedure with full allotment in the regular 3 - month longer - term refinancing operations ( LTROs ) to be allotted on 26 May and on 30 June 2010 .
3 . To conduct a 6 - month LTRO with full allotment on 12 May 2010 , at a rate which will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations ( MROs ) over the life of this operation .
4.To reactivate , in coordination with other central banks , the temporary liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve , and resume US dollar liquidity - providing operations at terms of 7 and 84 days .
These operations will take the form of repurchase operations against ECB - eligible collateral and will be carried out as fixed rate tenders with full allotment .
The first operation will be carried out on 11 May 2010 .

Short Squeeze Coming
Flashback Wednesday , July 16 , 2008
Big brother has now decided to step in and force the price of all financial stocks up with this SEC short sale order .
So now the SEC is issuing short sale restrictions on financials because Bernanke says it 's important for them to rise .
I have news for Bernanke and the SEC .
This wo n't work .
China had short sale restrictions on and it did not stop the Shanghai index from falling over 50 % .
Insolvency cannot be cured by short sale restrictions and many of those companies are insolvent .
All these short sale restrictions are going to do is create a vacuum .
Once the shorts are driven out these shares will plunge .
And who wants to buy a bond or provide capital knowing or even thinking share prices were artificially inflated .
Flashback Friday , July 18 , 2008
Fannie Mae is up another 25 % today to $ 13.66 in the wake of Selective Enforcement of Regulation SHO and Bernanke 's statement : " It 's important for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds and stocks to rise so they can keep raising capital and aid the mortgage market . "
This move in financials is going to fail spectacularly once the panic buying ends , but for now the bulls are having a bit of fun .
Red Plenty
I recently got a review copy of Francis Spufford 's new book
It 's a bit like reading a novel by Kim Stanley Robinson , Neal Stephenson , or Ursula Le Guin - or maybe a mashup of all them ; full of arguments between passionate and intelligent people , diverting ( in both senses ) infodumps , and all about something that actually happened - and , more significantly , about something that did n't happen , and why it did n't .
Computer scientist
This is a marvelous and unusual book .
It sits in a remarkable way in between science popularisation , social history and fiction .
The author describes it variously as a novel whose hero is an idea and a fairytale .
The hero idea is that of optimal planning .
The idea of running a planned economy in just such a way as to ensure that resources are optimally used in order to deliver the ’red plenty ’ of the title .
[...]
The author shows real skill as a science populariser , explaining such diverse topics as how the Pentode valve logic of the early BESM computers worked , to the molecular mechanics of the carcinogenesis mechanism that eventually killed its designer .
He vividly portrays the enthusiasm and self confidence of the USSR in the late 50s when Khrushchev ’s boasts that they would overtake the USA by 1980 and achieve communism seemed plausible .
He gives a good didactic account both of the basic mechanisms of the Soviet Economy , and , through the lives of incidental characters paints a picture of its real operation that is more detailed and convincing than any academic history .
He traces the idea of cybernetic economic management from the hope of the 50s and early 60s to its sidelining under Kosygin , and the eventual relegation of Kantorovich to the less ambitious task of optimisating steel tube output for the oil and natural gas industry .
Ironically , says Spufford , as growth rates slipped in the 70s , it was only the exploitation of petroleum for export that allowed Soviet living standards to rise .
[...]
All in all , let me say again , this is a book that should be read by anyone with a serious interest in economic alternatives .
I recently got a review copy of Francis Spufford 's new book Red Plenty , and , like Brad DeLong , immediately dropped everything to read it .
It 's a fictionalised account , or a non-fiction novel , about the project in the early 1960s to use computers to plan the Soviet economy .
A key figure is the genius Kantorovich , who invented the mathematical technique of linear programming in 1938 .
( We follow his mind as the idea dawns on him , on a tram . )
He and other real characters such as Kosygin and Khrushchev mingle with fictious characters - some based on real people , some not , but all convincing .
It 's a bit like reading a novel by Kim Stanley Robinson , Neal Stephenson , or Ursula Le Guin - or maybe a mashup of all them ; full of arguments between passionate and intelligent people , diverting ( in both senses ) infodumps , and all about something that actually happened - and , more significantly , about something thathappen , and why it did n't .

The Puppy Linux developers have announced the availability of version 5.0 of their independent Linux distribution , code named " Lupu " .
Puppy Linux is a popular small release that is around 100 MB in size , focuses on ease of use and can run entirely from RAM .
Puppy Linux 5.0 is the first release to be based on Ubuntu and includes several changes over the previous 4.3.x branch .
The major update , also referred to as " Lucid Puppy " , was built using the Woof build system and is based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx binary packages .
Lucid Puppy features the new Quickpet package manager which allows users to install a number of Linux programs with a single click .
Available applications include the Kompozer web authoring system , GIMP for image editing and several browsers , such as Firefox , SeaMonkey , Chromium , and Opera .
Version 5.0 is also the first major edition not directly prepared by Puppy Linux founder Barry Kauler .
This release was built by the Puppy community , with Mick Amadio as its Chief developer and Coordinator Larry Short .
Kauler has released Quirky 1.1 , a bug fix update of his Linux distribution built using the same Woof build system as Puppy Linux 4.3.x and later .
Quirky is aimed at developers as a platform for trying out " some quirky ideas " .
Compared to Puppy , which is intended for most users , the Quirky distribution includes fewer kernel and video drivers , but does include a number of programs from a normal Puppy release .
More details about the Puppy release can be found in the release announcement and release notes .
Puppy Linux 5.0 is available to download from the project 's web site as a 128 MB ISO image file and is covered by the GPL / LGPL license .
Puppy Linux can boot from several types of media , including USB flash drives , hard disk drives and a LiveCD .
Built - in tools are included to create bootable USB versions , create new Puppy CDs or remaster a new LiveCD with different packages .

Google TV , the new Android - based OS for the big screen , will power Logitech 's new set - top box , the still - not - properly - named Google TV companion box .
The sleek black Apple TV–sized box will run on a 1.2 - GHz Atom processor with 4 GB memory , 802.11n Wi - Fi , dual HDMI - out ports , Dolby 5.1 surround sound and a pair of USB ports .
If you hook up a webcam , you can even video - chat at 720p .
The box , which will launch in the fall , will at first be U.S. - only .
It will hook up to your TV and then pull in content from cable , satellite and compatible DVRs .
In short , you can Google the entire internet plus your home for TV shows and watch them wherever they may be .
Even the remote controls are exciting .
While there will be some regular RF controllers available , you will be able to install an app on your iPhone or Android phone with a keyboard and a touchscreen D - pad .
These will control not only the Logitech box but compatible TVs and set - top boxes , right from the phone .
Next to the Google TV , the Apple TV is starting to look less like a " hobby " and more like an embarrassing habit Apple is trying to quit .
Video content is one place where more is better .
Sure Apple TV can grab most things from the iTunes Store , but with a built - in Chrome browser , Google TV will grab content from anywhere that puts video on the web .
The closest rival Apple has right now is probably the iPad .
Maybe this is the kick in the pants Apple needs to finally update its own set - top box to something nearing useful .

When someone composes an epic fit for the times , we call that person a “ genius ” .
When their work makes sense only within their own head , the unfortunate author is dubbed a “ crank ” instead .
Nevertheless , cranks and crackpots often go to lavish extents to deliver their personal fantasies to the world .
And there is hope within reach for all dreamers : if the resulting work is unambiguously astounding , we are forced to call the author a “ genius ” no matter how outlandish his subject .
Here , then , is a list of seven books which , despite or because of their difficult or unreadable text , have captured my imagination with their otherworldly images .
1 : Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii ( 1499 )
Long known only to antiquarians , this inexplicable incunabula was finally awarded its 15 minutes of fame with the 2004 mystery The Rule of Four .
In the mass market novel ( which I quite liked , despite the bad reviews ) , the Hypnerotomachia serves as a Dan Brown - style ciphertext with multiple layers of hidden messages , as well as the primary cause of intrigue for the collegiate team deciphering it .
The real book , although not readily revealing any more than one encrypted message , continues to bewilder with its contextual mysteries : who wrote it ?
why ?
how was it commissioned ?
The fact that the poem itself is meandering , obscure , and generally unreadable has not stopped scholars of all kinds from finding marvel within its pages , due to the ribald woodcut illustrations , which even today must be qualified as “ not safe for work ” , and unrivaled typesetting .
The poem is anonymous — as an exceptionally erotic work printed in the 15th century , it would have to be — but it is almost certainly the production of one Francesco Colonna , a Dominican monk in an era when parents would send their children to monasteries as a sort of eternal college life .
No other noteworthy events or works in his life are recorded , except for an unpublished poem .
Given the elaborate quality of the Hypnerotomachia and its illustrations , he must have not only labored many years but also devoted a fair share of his savings for it to appear in its present form .
2 : Voynich Manuscript ( early 15th century )
This multi-subject manuscript , written in a tantalizing and possibly nonsensical undeciphered script , has attracted the interest of amateur lexicographers throughout the modern era .
In the early 1600s , the occultist and polymath John Dee pored over it with no success ; later , it came into the hands of the great Athanasius Kircher , and later still it became the subject of one of the first non-military uses of the computer , the 1944 First Study Group transcription of the Manuscript into machine - readable text .
Despite the prolonged attention of the world ’s best cryptographers , none have been able to penetrate the text , much less the enigmatic drawings of flowers , geometric designs , nude women , and so forth .
The most recent theories contend that it is either in Chinese or meaningless , but both of these have their own problems .
In any case , it is apparently the work of a lone individual with a talent for bizarre imagery .
3 : Rohonc Codex ( 16th century )
The Rohonc Codex , meanwhile , has attracted several generations of would - be decipherers in Hungary , also with no success .
Its illustrations seem to portray the adventures of a king and his retainers in a realm of gnostic interfaith harmony , but it was recorded in the earliest citations as a “ Hungarian book of prayers ” , so who knows what it ’s supposed to be about ?
In any case , it is the only known example of its script in the world , so I am guessing that it was the work of a crackpot with a lot of time on his hands for manufacturing languages .
4 - 5 : Hotsuma Tsutaye and Mikasafumi ( 1775 ? )
Out of nowhere in 1770s Japan appeared a series of books handwritten by an otherwise unknown person , Yasutoshi Waniko , who claimed to simply be translating into Chinese a series of ancient Japanese histories dating to 100 CE or even 800 BCE , although he boasted that the “ translations ” required 30 years of labor .
Operating on the assumption that these books were actually forged by Waniko himself , there was some precedent for his folly ; a century earlier , the Edo court had been all a - twitter about a forgery called the Kujiki Taiseikyo , which told a new history of Japan .
Waniko simply raised the intrigue and awe to a new level by predating his “ history ” to long before Chinese writing was imported to Japan .
Of course , this raises the question , how was this written down before Chinese writing ?
Waniko ’s answer is that both the Hotsuma Tsutaye and the Mikasafumi were written in an otherwise unknown script called woshide which is either a forgotten predecessor to the Japanese syllabary or the giveaway of a clear forgery , depending on whom you ’re asking .
But what interests me about the woshide books is their strict adherence to classical Japanese meter throughout their 1500 - odd verses , which makes them the earliest instance of epic poetry in the Japanese language .
Regardless of whether they were composed in 1775 or 100 , they predate any knowledge in East Asia of Western poetic forms .
Furthermore , the book is written in Old Japanese , of which very few examples survive , and is full of obscure word - forms that somewhat resemble ancient words .
If it is a forgery , the author must have done intense research on Japanese linguistics , and he may have been familiar with Ainu epic songs , a century and a half before anyone else saw fit to write them down ; if this is the case , what else is n’t he telling us ?
Or are we willing to admit the possibility that these obscure , beautiful poems date to a distant era unknown to modern historians ?
These documents lay almost completely forgotten until 1966 , when an amateur historian stumbled upon an excerpt in a used bookstore and made it his life ’s mission to find and publish the original texts .
( The Mikasafumi has only been found in excerpts , but woshide fans maintain hope . )
But it can also be seen as the first in an interesting and understudied genre of Japanese literature , the parahistorical document .
6 : The Story of the Vivian Girls , in What is known as the Realms of the Unreal , of the Glandeco - Angelinnian War Storm , Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion ( 1973 )
Not so much a book as an unedited , sprawling 15,145 - page manuscript in 15 volumes replete with hundreds of color illustrations , the Vivian Girls was the magnum opus of a loner named Henry Darger .
It describes the rebellion by young , noble princesses from the Christian kingdom of Abbieannia against their Glandelinian abusers and flying , horned aliens called Blengigomeneans , including lengthy descriptions of carnage , torture , and various other things .
Darger , who kept his work private throughout his life , had the good fortune to be a tenant in an apartment owned by “ high artist ” Nathan Lerner , who recognized the disheveled tomes as “ outsider art ” while cleaning out Darger ’s room after his death .
Of course , the manuscript has never been published in full , and it would probably not be worth the paper to do so .
The mere fact that such a thing exists and is preserved is sufficiently eerie for my tastes .
7 : Codex Seraphinianus ( 1978 )
Luigi Serafini , the author of this incredible fantasy , is still with us today , and there ’s no mystery around the provenance of his book : he made it as a work of art , and intended it as a window into a strange and unknown world .
Nevertheless , it is filled with a deep and strange mystery ; a mixture of the familiar and foreign , it is written in an alien script that almost resembles a human language , but not quite .
Many websites and articles have already attempted to give an adequate summary of the weird creatures and devices it details , and where they have failed I hesitate to attempt .
In any case , I recommend this most accessible and imaginative crackpot book to anyone studious enough to find it .
Posted : June 19th , 2010 | Books
With the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season less than a week away , a new analysis from experts at several Texas universities is warning that a major hurricane could devastate the Houston / Galveston region .
A report issued by the Rice University - based Severe Storm Prediction , Education and Evacuation from Disasters Center ( SSPEED ) indicates that even a moderately powerful hurricane could endanger tens of thousands of lives and cripple the Houston Ship Channel , which is home to about one - quarter of U.S. refineries .
SSPEED 's report was unveiled May 27 at the 2010 Coastal Resilience Symposium , a one - day workshop at Rice that brought together regional , national and international experts to discuss how the Houston region can be made more resilient to severe storm impacts .
" There are warning signs across the board , " said SSPEED Director Phil Bedient , Rice 's Herman Brown Professor of Engineering and a co-author of the new report .
" Ike was a Category 2 hurricane , and it caused $ 30 billion in damage .
Had that same storm struck 30 miles farther south , it could easily have caused $ 100 billion in damage .
Had it struck that location as a Category 4 storm , like Carla , the results would have been catastrophic . "
The new report comes from an ongoing two - year study commissioned from SSPEED in 2009 by the nonprofit Houston Endowment .
SSPEED has assembled a team of more than a dozen leading experts from Rice University , the University of Texas at Austin , Texas A&M University , the University of Houston , Texas Southern University and several other institutions to examine flood risks , evacuation readiness , industrial vulnerability and both structural and nonstructural approaches for mitigating storm impact .
SSPEED 's report indicates :
Existing dikes and levees along the Houston Ship Channel were barely adequate during Hurricane Ike and would not protect all refineries from the storm surge of a more powerful hurricane or even an Ike - like Category 2 hurricane striking farther south .
More than 65 percent of water - crossing bridges in the Galveston Bay area may be especially vulnerable to damage from a powerful hurricane like Katrina .
Highway infrastructure to evacuate the 1 million residents living in evacuation zones today is inadequate , and 500,000 more are expected to move into these zones by 2035 .
There is a " major disconnect " between the level of coastal flooding that would be caused by a major hurricane and the 100 - year floodplains that flood insurance is based upon .
Bedient said one need look no further than the Houston Ship Channel to get a clear sense of the region 's vulnerability .
The ship channel is home to one of the nation 's busiest ports and about one - quarter of U.S. refineries .
The Coast Guard estimates a one - month closure of a major port like Houston would cost the national economy $ 60 billion .
Despite this , government regulations require dikes and levees that can protect ship channel facilities against only the 100 - year flood of 14 - 15 feet .
Bedient said that based upon results from supercomputer models at the University of Texas , Austin , Ike could have caused a 20 - to 25 - foot storm surge along the ship channel if it had struck about 30 miles farther south .
" Our team is taking an in - depth , scientific look at structural proposals like the Ike Dike and other dike solutions , as well as nonstructural proposals related to land use , " said Rice 's Jim Blackburn , professor in the practice of environmental law and co-author of the new report .
" Our work so far has revealed a number of different structural and nonstructural solutions .
There are dozens of communities along the coast , and each is unique in some way .
We are attempting to identify the most cost - effective and environmentally acceptable methods of providing a basic level of protection , including both structural barriers and nonstructural approaches that take advantage of natural features like barrier islands and storm - surge storage in wetlands . "
Blackburn said SSPEED 's goal is to propose policy options to decision makers at the state , local and federal level with an unbiased assessment of the economic and environmental costs and benefits of all approaches so that an informed decision on the future of the region can be made .
" And make no mistake about it -- the solutions that are chosen to deal with this flood - surge problem will determine the landscape of the future for the upper Texas coast , " Blackburn said .

It seems reasonable to assume that PCI Express 3.0 will be announced on June 23 at a PCI - SIG meeting in Santa Clara .
The spec itself will be published in the second half of this year .
On Friday , I received an invitation to the event , where I was told that PCI Express 3.0 was to be discussed .
“ Here you will receive a comprehensive update on PCI technologies , including information on the PCIe 3.0 specification publication coming in the second half of this year , ” a spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
Last year , 2009 , was supposed to be the year PCI Express 3.0 was supposed to have been announced .
But the standard was delayed for compatibility reasons .
At the time , PCI - SIG executives said that PCI Express 3.0 products would most likely ship in 2011 , with graphics ( and supporting motherboards ) as the first products to take advantage of the new spec .
In 2008 , the SIG began revealing the specifications of PCI Express 3.0 , which will transfer information at 8.0 gigatransfers per second , with the actual bandwidth dependent on the bit width of the interface .
That will still be a critical metric for enthusiasts and graphics designers , as it will eliminate any potential bottlenecks on the interface itself .
For most PC users , however , the additional capabilities will simply represent a higher number .
PCI - SIG executives have said previously that PCI Express 3.0 cards wo n’t require a new connector .
Recent PCI SIG events have included PCIe 2.0/3.0 compliance testing seminars .
The SIG has only scheduled a pair of compliance seminars for the remainder of the year .
The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is having only minimal environmental effects on land , but it may be causing serious problems in the water , some scientists say .
Wind , currents and chemicals being sprayed on the oil are combining to keep most of the oil gushing from the sea floor out in the water .
Scientists say they are growing increasingly concerned about two effects : the damage the oil might do to sea life and the possibility that currents might take some oil around Florida and up the East Coast .

Melbourne 's first ever public bike hire scheme is underway with the roll - out of the first 100 bicycles - although the government will not say how many people are expected to use the scheme .
The distinctive electric - blue bicycles will be available at 10 docking stations across the CBD .
Subscribers will be able to join the scheme for $ 50 a year , $ 8 a week or $ 2.50 a day .
Users will then be able to take the bicycles for 30 minutes without charge .

THE TEXAS TEXTBOOK TRAVESTY ….
After a contentious debate and international scrutiny , right - wing activists in control of Texas ’ State Board of Education did exactly what they set out to do : they approved a new social studies curriculum that ignores reality , and reflects history the way they wish it happened .
The State Board of Education Board , ending nearly two years of politically divisive deliberations , approved new social studies curriculum standards for the state ’s 4.7 million students despite vigorous objections from the board ’s five minority members .
The revisions have drawn national attention amid complaints that conservative Republicans on the board are attempting to alter history and trying to inject their political beliefs into the curriculum . [ … ]
The curriculum , which will be used in classrooms beginning with the 2011 - 12 school year , will also serve as a template for new textbooks .
They will remain in effect for more than a decade … .
With one member absent , the board voted 9 - 5 to accept the new curriculum for kindergarten , elementary school and high school .
As we ’ve been reporting for months , the board ’s version of history is a fairly ridiculous one , which will now be imposed on public school students .
The new standards say that the McCarthyism of the 1950s was later vindicated — something most historians deny — draw an equivalency between Jefferson Davis ’s and Abraham Lincoln ’s inaugural addresses , say that international institutions such as the United Nations imperil American sovereignty , and include a long list of Confederate officials about whom students must learn .
Of particular interest , the new standards dictate that students must “ describe the causes and key organizations and individuals of the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s , including Phyllis Schafly , the Contract with America , the Heritage Foundation , the Moral Majority , and the National Rifle Association . ”
A majority of the state board took an especially hostile view of the separation of church and state — which , of course , has been removed from the curriculum — and board member Cynthia Dunbar ( R ) spoke for her cohorts when she insisted the nation ’s origins were “ a Christian land governed by Christian principles , ” all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding .
At its core , this is not just a travesty for academic integrity and students in Texas , but it ’s also a reminder of what ’s gone horribly wrong with the twisted right - wing worldview .
These state officials have decided they simply do n’t care for reality , so they ’ve replaced it with a version of events that makes them feel better .
The result is an American history in which every era has been distorted to satisfy the far - right ego .
Of course , the concern outside of Texas has been that the state - mandated ignorance might spread —
Texas is the nation ’s second - largest customer for textbooks , and “ publishers craft their standard textbooks based on the specs of the biggest buyers . ”
This week , however , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told CNN that he does not believe there will be a “ ripple effect ” that undermines education elsewhere .
Texas school kids , however , will be punished by the right - wing agenda , and there ’s not much anyone can do about it .
" But there 's so much left over that they have to do something with this cash .
Sometimes all that 's left is to hoard it and hide it . "
Did you notice there was one department that did n't figure in the budget cuts ?
Yes , it was the Ministry of Defence .
Which is pretty surprising , since the UK spends more on its military than Russia .
In fact , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , last year it was the world 's third biggest spender on military matters .
We can be proud that our country , in 2009 , a time of economic chaos , managed to spend $ 69bn on warfare – I 'm sorry : " defence " .
Only China and the US spent more last year than us .
Is n't that something ?
Now you may ask : " Who are our enemies , apart from those we 've created by invading Iraq and Afghanistan ? "
After all , fundamentalist Islam was n't a problem before we started attacking Islamic countries – even secular Islamic countries like Saddam 's Iraq .
Well the answer is : " We do n't know . "
But just because we do n't know does n't mean we do n't have enemies .
They could be anywhere .
Hiding under our beds .
Peering out of our wardrobes .
The world is full of potential enemies and the key thing is to get them before they get us , like the Americans do .
George Osborne also did n't mention Trident .
Some people say : " What 's the point of lugging nuclear bombs all over the Atlantic that no one will never be able to use ?
Bombs that , if they ever were used , would kill so many innocent civilians and pollute so much of the planet , it would count as a war crime . "
Well , in the first place , they 're not our bombs .
We bought them off the Americans , and despite what endless prime ministers say , we 'd need to ask the Americans ' permission to use them .
So it would be their fault .
In the second place , realistically the only way the UK government would ever actually use Trident would be if the USA were , independently , to mount a nuclear strike against some presumably remote and sandy region , because then we would be expected to join in so that the Americans could claim to be acting in the name of the civilised world .
Now you may say that would make us more likely to be targets for nuclear retaliation , and that the Ministry of Defence ought to be renamed the Ministry of Turning Us Into Sitting Ducks .
But you must take into account the feelings of our ministers of state .
How can we possibly expect them to hold up their heads , when hob - nobbing with other global military powers , if we do n't allow them their weapons of mass destruction ?
They 're only human , after all , and giving up Trident would be like getting knocked out of the World Cup in round two !
According to the British American Security Information Council ( or BASIC ) , the cost of running and maintaining Trident is roughly £ 5 bn a year .
That 's about the cost of 1,000 new secondary schools , 200 new hospitals , 1.2 p off income tax and £ 10 a week increase on state pensions .
So giving up Trident is n't going to benefit bankers or hedge - fund managers , is it ?
And what 's even worse , it may make the country safer instead of more vulnerable , which is bad news , if you want to instil fear of terrorism into the population .
Now the chancellor must have been sorely tempted to save £ 4.5 bn a year by pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan .
But thank goodness he resisted , knowing that our presence there helps to fan the flames of Islamic fundamentalist resentment against the UK .
In any case , how else could we be able to kill lots of people attending weddings and going about their own business , in a part of the world that has no impact on us , apart from oil .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that the impact of the budget will bear down five times harder on the poorest 10th of the population than on the richest , by 2015 .
It is truly inspiring to see how inclusive our society has become under this government .
And we can only applaud our poorest citizens , who are now not only subsidising the bankers but subsidising the military and , in consequence , the whole of the arms industry as well .
Good for them !
Keep it up !
Back in 1971 , Rep. Tom ( not “ Tim ” ) Moore , Jr. of Waco , Texas — knowing that his fellow legislators in the Texas House of Representatives often passed bills and resolutions without fully reading or understanding them — pulled an April Fool ’s joke on the House by sponsoring a resolution commending Albert de Salvo for his unselfish service to “ his county , his state and his community . ”
That resolution read , in part :
This compassionate gentleman ’s dedication and devotion to his work has enabled the weak and the lonely throughout the nation to achieve and maintain a new degree of concern for their future .
He has been officially recognized by the state of Massachusetts for his noted activities and unconventional techniques involving population control and applied psychology .
The joke , of course , was that Albert de Salvo was more commonly known as the Boston Strangler , assumed to be responsible for the murders of thirteen women in the Boston area between 1962 and 1964 .
( Technically , de Salvo was never convicted or put on trial for any of those killings — he was sentenced to life in prison for sexual assaults on several other women and confessed to the thirteen murders as well .
He was stabbed to death in prison in 1973 , and whether he actually committed the murders he confessed to has been a subject of controversy ever since . )
As Rep .
Moore expected , he saw his resolution passed unanimously ; he then withdrew it and explained that he had offered the motion only to demonstrate a point .
( A bit of sardonic humor offered at the time claimed that perhaps Moore was wrong : maybe the legislators had been paying attention . )
Although we would hope our elected representatives would pay enough attention to their jobs not to pass resolutions commending murderers , that Moore ’s stunt succeeded was n’t necessarily as outrageous as it might seem .
Federal and state legislators see a steady stream of resolutions that have no real legal impact and are offered mostly as public relations measures on behalf of one group or another .
Poring over each and every one would take an inordinate amount of a legislator ’s time ( especially in states like Texas where the legislature might be in session only relatively briefly and infrequently , creating a large number of bills and resolutions to be voted upon in a very short time ) .
If a fellow legislator introduces a resolution to honor some favored person or group , you ’re expected to rubber stamp it as a gesture of good will — after all , you ’ll want him to return the favor when you need to boost your popularity with your constituents by extending similar honors to some of them .
Welcome to the World Cup ; here 's your spiked condom .
At the soccer tourney in South Africa , the inventor of the Rape - aXe antirape system ( formerly known as Rapex ) plans to give away 30,000 of the condoms for free .
Dr. Sonnet Ehlers came up with the concept for Rape - aXe — a latex sheath with " razor - sharp barbs " — after hearing a sexual assault victim say " if only it had teeth down there . "
A noble notion , but in reality , Rape - aXe sounds sort of scary , not to mention misguided :
The device is worn in her vagina like a tampon .
When the attacker attempts vaginal penetration the barbs attach themselves to the penis , causing great discomfort .
The device must be surgically removed , which will result in the positive identification of the attacker and subsequent arrest .
Better identification and prosecution of sexual attackers is certainly an issue that needs addressing , but is Rape - aXe the answer ?
Given that it 's being launched in South Africa , which historically has one of the highest incidences of rape in the world , Rape - aXe could be read as a desperate measure or a deleterious gimmick .
Here 's why .
As Lara Williams writes in the Guardian , " Advocating placing a foreign object inside your body as a matter of course places the prevention of rape , once again , squarely with women . "
Given that women are often held accountable for rape , even by fellow women , a victim wearing this device could be branded with the dreaded " she was asking for it . "
Rape - aXe can thwart an attack and physically punish the criminal , but how would a woman know she needs to be wearing one ?
I 'd rather see more preventative and educational measures , for both men and women , aimed at stopping sexual assault in the first place .
It will be interesting to see what kind of reaction the Rape - aXe handouts prompt at the World Cup , but until then , tell me what you think .

HUNTSVILLE , AL -- Chewbacca is a bear .
Luke is Leia 's father .
Darth Vader wore a polka dot ascot .
If you thought any of those statements were true , you 're not cut out to work at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center during the " Star Wars : Where Science Meets Imagination " exhibition .
Almost a year ago , when the space center began preparing for the upcoming exhibition , which opens on Friday , officials began thinking about the center 's staff .
Would its employees know the difference between the Rebels and the Empire ?
A Tie fighter and a X - Wing ?
Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon ?
Luke and Leia ?
In order to ensure its employees working with the exhibition understood the basics of the film saga , officials at the center wrote and administered a " Star Wars " trivia test .
" We have to be sure they represent the ( " Star Wars " ) brand and the franchise well , " said Jason Quinn , one of two people who helped create the " Star Wars " test .
Based on the six films , the test consisted of 30 trivia questions and 35 photos , which test takers had to identify .
Most questions tested basic " Star Wars " knowledge , but a few were difficult .
For example , in Episode IV , at what docking bay did Han Solo meet Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker ?
The test , according to officials , helped weed out people who knew absolutely nothing about one of the highest grossing films series of all time .
Officials said they needed the test because fans of " Star Wars " would expect the people employed by the host venue to know something about the films .
Also , because of a lack of time , officials could n't hold " Star Wars " 101 classes .
The test was first developed for the Jedi Experience trainers .
The sold - out Jedi Experience is a three - day , Space Camp - like program where participants build light sabers , craft podracers and learn about The Force .
While teaching the Jedi Experience , the trainers , most of whom double as Space Camp trainers , act like real Jedi .
A bit of a " Star Wars " enthusiast , Quinn , a Jedi Experience supervisor , said he and fellow Jedi Experience supervisor Daren Cox wrote the test .
" We just sat down and thought out questions , " Quinn said " We did most of it from memory . "
Geoff Abrams , director of special exhibition operations , which includes the " Star Wars " exhibit , also used the test to find " coherent , informed " tour guides .
Abrams did n't want anyone giving tours who thought Yoda lived on Earth .
( Someone did ) .
Abrams said 42 people applied for the tour guide positions .
He hired 31 .
Nine people aced the test .
Abrams said he missed one question , the docking bay one .
The answer is 94 .
Once hired , guides were given non -" Star Wars " related training on how to work on the museum floor .
The Jedi Experience trainers went through another level of training , which included another 50 - question test and a homework assignment to re-watch all six movies .
That 's 800 minutes or more than 13 hours of " Star Wars . "
Quinn said the Jedi Experience trainers can answer just about any basic " Star Wars " question .
But if some super " Star Wars " fanatic asks a question about an obscure Sith Lord , the trainers can dodge it .
" They 'll say , " I may have heard rumblings of that Sith Lord , but I have never met them . "
Take the test below :
The U.S. Space & Rocket Center could n't release the " Star Wars " test it gave to its employees .
They plan on hiring a few more and did n't want anyone to have an unfair advantage .
The Times has decided to make up its own " Star Wars " test .
Go ahead , see how much you know about a galaxy far , far away :
1 . Which planet is Princess Leia from ?
2 . Which actor played C - 3PO ?
3 . Who killed the Emperor in " Return of the Jedi " ?
4 . In " Attack of the Clones , " how does Jango Fett die ?
5 . Who is the director of " Return of the Jedi " ?
6 . When we first meet C - 3P0 in " The Phantom Menace , " what is he missing when Anakin turns him on ?
7 . Who said , " Laugh it up , fuzzball ? "
8 . Who kills Mace Windu in " Revenge of the Sith " ?
9 . When Han Solo is captured in " The Empire Strikes Back , " what material is he frozen in ?
10 . What are Darth Vader 's last words ?
BALTIMORE — I ’m only here for the day .
No time to dine on soft - shell crab ; barely enough for a glance at Camden Yards , where the Orioles play baseball .
I ’m a digital tourist , here mainly to stare at a glowing LCD screen .
Still , I ’m enjoying the tiny view ; Web pages and Internet videos downloaded at amazing speed by a device that fits into a shirt pocket , lets me shoot high - definition videos , and can still be used to call the folks back home .
It ’s called the EVO 4G , and it ’s our first glimpse at the next big thing in smartphones .
When cellular carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. begins selling the EVO on June 4 , it will be America ’s first 4G cellphone , capable of far greater speed than the 3G iPhones and BlackBerries we have come to love .
But why fly 360 miles to check it out ?
Because Boston does n’t have a working 4G network yet .
Baltimore is one of about two dozen US cities where you can find one .
Sprint says it ’s building more 4G coverage as fast as it can ; Boston is on the list for sometime this year .
Today ’s 3G services will let you download perhaps a million bits of data per second on a good day with a strong tailwind .
In normal use , you ’re more likely to top out at 600,000 bits per second .
But 4G promises speeds as high as 12 million bits per second , with 3 to 6 megabits being the likely norm .
That means we ’re on the verge of having portable , pocket - size devices that can download data as fast as the broadband connections in our homes .
Sprint already sells portable data hotspots and laptop cards that will deliver 4G speeds .
The EVO 4G , made by the Taiwanese company HTC , packs 4G technology into a sleek , feature - packed smartphone .
You will still enjoy the phone , 4G or not .
It ’s thinner than an iPhone , but longer , with a screen that ’s nearly an inch wider when held sideways .
That makes the EVO an excellent video player .
The EVO uses Google Inc. ’s Android operating system , a worthy rival to Apple ’s phone software .
You get two cameras for the price of one .
There ’s an 8 - megapixel autofocus camera that shoots video , as well as a 1.3 - megapixel front - facing camera .
But it ’s the EVO ’s broadband firepower that really matters .
I tested it with help from Ookla , a company with software for measuring data speed on mobile devices .
I installed Ookla ’s Speed Test app on the EVO and on an Apple iPhone 3GS running on AT&T Inc. ’s 3G network .
It was n’t even close .
The iPhone ’s 3G speeds were around 600,000 bits per second .
Meanwhile , the EVO 4G was hauling down the data at more than 3 megabits , or five times faster .
That ’s enough bandwidth to share with friends and colleagues , and you can .
The EVO 4G is also a Wi -Fi mobile hotspot .
Up to eight other Wi-Fi-equipped devices can draw data from the phone ’s 4G connection .
For some reason — envy ? — my iPhone would n’t speak to the EVO 4G , but my BlackBerry Bold happily hooked up , as did the Netgear Wi-Fi card in my battered old Dell laptop .
But all this digital splendor comes at a steep price .
The EVO devours battery power .
With its 4G modem switched on , I got just over three hours out of it .
The phone ’s $ 200 price tag is quite attractive — two - year contract , $ 100 mail - in rebate and all .
But you must also pay $ 80 a month minimum for unlimited voice and data service , $ 10 a month more than Sprint charges for its 3G plans .
You will have to pay this price even if you live in a city that has n’t gotten 4G coverage yet .
And using the phone as a mobile hotspot costs an additional $ 30 a month .
Still , the future is rarely cheap , and the EVO 4G is the most advanced smartphone yet .
There are rumors of a 4G iPhone , perhaps to be unveiled by Steve Jobs at Apple ’s software developers ’ conference on June 7 , three days after the EVO goes on sale .
But Apple ’s cellular partner , AT&T , ca n’t even get its 3G network to function properly .
So unless Apple breaks its exclusive deal with AT&T , the EVO 4G will continue to outperform the iPhone , especially in Baltimore .

Fact : James Cameron's Mass Effect would be the best thing to happen in the history of ever .
Second fact :
It 's not gonna happen , sadly .
With the exception of Aliens and True Lies , Avatar boy usually makes films he 's built from the ground up .
And Joss Whedon , while also an excellent candidate , is too busy doing this thing called Avengers .
But we think these six directors are the next best thing for what could be the best videogame movie ever .
The dense , action - packed Mass Effect universe is perfect for taking to the big screen , and the people behind The Dark Knight and 300 are going to take it there .
We hope they listen to our wish - list of directors - if they know what 's good for 'em .
And Mass Effect fans ?
Yeah , send us your suggestions in the comments .
<i>Star + Trek</i>+was+basically+an+audition+for+<i>
Mass + Effect </i>.
J.J. Abrams is the new darling child of the science - fiction scene .
He helped spearhead Lost , one of the most popular and mind - bending TV shows in recent memory .
He successfully resuscitated the ailing Star Trek franchise and made being a Trekkie cool again .
Cloverfield was a fun mash - up of Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project , and its pseudo follow - up Super 8 looks to be equally entertaining .
All of these projects prove Abrams has what it takes to tackle creative sci-fi concepts and draw in audiences by the millions .
Mass Effect offers Abrams a chance to work on a scale that dwarfs even Star Trek .
And no matter how big the budget , we know we can count on the director never to lose sight of the fun of the story .
When it comes to thinking man 's sci - fi , you can't do better than Alfonso Cuarón .
This director gave us Children of Men , a thoughtful tale set in a dark future where no new babies have been born for many years .
Cuarón 's movies often have an independent flair , but the director is n't above dabbling in popular franchises .
Most agree his Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the six Potter movies .
Azkaban is proof that the guy has a strong sense of visual style , in addition to being a master storyteller .
And you can consider his recent sci- fi project , Gravity , his bid for going bigger and better with the Mass Effect Universe .
Cuarón 's emphasis on character and visual design are unique amongst the blockbuster scene .
It will be through visual design and the strength of the characters that Mass Effect shrugs off the inevitable Star Wars comparisons and attracts audiences interested in something new .
Action +<i> and</i>+drama ?+ Check.+New+take+on+aliens ?+Check .+
Neill Blomkamp is a relative newcomer to the sci - fi scene , but he certainly left his mark last year with District 9 .
A far cry from an alien invasion movie like Independence Day , District 9 was a tale about men and aliens struggling to co-exist in South Africa .
The movie functioned as a metaphor for racism and apartheid , only with the alien Prawns bearing the brunt of South Africa 's ill will .
District 9 also included plenty of memorable action scenes , not least of which being an epic battle with an alien mech suit .
Fans will know Blomkamp also directed a live - action Halo short film to coincide with the release of Halo 3 .
The director was attached in the past to the actual Halo movie , but that project can't seem to find steady legs .
Rather than wait for Halo to get off the ground once more , Blomkamp 's talents might be better served bringing another popular Xbox franchise to life on screen .
Scott's +< i> Mass + Effect</i>+would+make+<i>Alien</i>+look+like+<i>Interiors</i>.
Scott 's returning to his roots by ( thankfully ) helming the Alien prequel .
Which is refreshing , because we 've grown tired of the " been there , done that " feel of his earth - bound historical epics .
Robin Hood had a lot going on , but unfortunately none of it was tethered to a cohesive narrative or a hero worth feeling for as he went through the motions .
And Kingdom of Heaven , while a brave and engaging epic , requires the director 's cut to fully appreciate what the less - than - successful theatrical cut set out to do .
Imagine what Scott could do with the budget of his sword and arrow epics when applied to a space - based story interweaving multiple characters across infinite galactic warfare .
Awesome sauce is what that would be .
Scott is not getting any younger , but the director shows no signs of slowing down .
He 's basically daring Hollywood to outlive his output , which consists of a very crowded production slate .
The right script , and the perfect Commander Shephard , could be what takes Mass Effect the movie to the top of his to - do list , and to the top of Hollywood 's most anticipated releases .
Like Neill Blomkamp , Duncan Jones is an up - and - coming director who managed to rock the sci - fi world in 2009 with Moon , a film with few actors or sets but with plenty of storytelling goodness .
If Jones can deliver such a worthy project with so little , we can only imagine what he could accomplish with the budget and star power Mass Effect would bring with it .
Moon is very much a story of human conflict first and science - fiction second .
Mass Effect hinges on the attachment gamers develop for Commander Shephard and his crew .
Jones seems like just the sort of director to capture those strong character dynamics .
Honorable Mention – Alex Proyas
We have our five selections for potential Mass Effect directors , but there are still more in Hollywood who have the potential to do the franchise justice in Hollywood .
Alex Proyas would be another interesting choice for director .
Proyas is well - known for his dark superhero film The Crow and his trippy sci-fi noir Dark City .
The latter in particular has us interested in what Proyas could bring to the table .
The only thing that worries us about Proyas is that his recent sci - fi work has been less than inspired .
I , Robot was a fairly entertaining summer blockbuster , but a far cry from the classic Isaac Asimov story .
2009 's
The Knowing was generally panned by critics and ignored by audiences .
Were Proyas to take on Mass Effect , we'd want to see more of the qualities that made the director stand out in the '90s .
Put down that controller and get some fresh air , you Mass Effect addicts .
Then -- sound off in the comments about our picks , and fire off a few of your own .
Cool ?
Cool .
It ’s back !!

Call for Cartoonists to provide Guest Cartoons
Taking some time off in June so looking for guest cartoons to fill the void .
Obviously I do n’t have recurring characters but last years call to highlight your characters in new ways was well received .
So here is the challenge .
Replace the actor(s ) in your favorite movie / television show with one or more of your characters .
Submissions can take the form of fake posters , single panel or strip .
Keep submissions within 600 pixels wide .
Here is just one example from the Family Guy ( obviously does n’t need to be that in depth ) .
If you need inspiration , check out my recent post on recreating 35 famous movie posters .
Thanks for your continued support .
So here ’s one way to be just a little more welcome at that backyard barbecue slash rooftop grill - out slash pot luck picnic you were heading to this weekend .
Maybe you were going to bring your usual — that pie , some buns , a slaw , an addictive potato salad , right ?
Maybe even some lemonade ?
And oh , what friends you ’ll make if you do .
Everyone loves a good slaw , most especially this girl .
But how about something a little crunchy , a little sweet to accompany that burger recipe your dad has been perfecting since the horse and buggy days .
It ’s the kind of thing you might only know about from a jar , which means that you probably pass them over at picnics without a second thought .
It ’s the kind of thing you might not have thought to make at home , I know I did n’t , especially because we ’re more of the garlickly - Kosher dill category of pickle eaters , ourselves .
I had a bag of kirby cucumbers I ’d picked up at the market this week for my husband who loves to snack on them .
And then one day last week I followed a link from The Facebook or The Twitter or wherever you kids are hanging out these days and landed smack dab in the middle of a bread and butter pickle recipe and pretty much dropped everything to co-opt Alex ’s supply to make it .
Poor guy , though he ’s probably used to it by now .
[ “ Do n’t eat those berries !
I ’m saving them for pie ! ” ]
And they ’re so good !
They taste like the kind you can buy but that much better — crunchier and wonderfully spiced .
Something about them makes me want to drop everything and crash someone ’s barbecue , armed with a jar .
You would n’t mind , right ?
Especially if I bring this little derelict with me ?
One year ago : Cheese Straws and seriously , I cannot believe it has been a year since I made these .
Where did it go ?
What did I do ?!
Two years ago : Pistachio Petit - Four Cake
Three years ago : Strawberry Tart
Bread and Butter Pickles
Adapted from The Dispatch Kitchen , a few other sources and personal taste
Big important note , especially if you are unfamiliar with bread and butter pickles : these babies are sweet !
So very sweet !
So sweet that I thought that the sugar level was a typo but sure enough , every other recipe I found listed sugar amounts in cups .
Ayee .
This one only called for one but I reduced my batch to 3 / 4 of a cup for a bread - and - butter pickle we find on par with the level of sweetness you expect from them .
As in , it is probably “ correct ” .
But , I will still reduce it to a 1 / 2 cup next time , to accommodate my taste preference , as you should adjust it to yours .
I also reduced the turmeric , which seemed like way too much , and added celery seed , because I like it with pickles .
Makes 4 cups of pickles , filling a 1 - quart jar
1 pound cucumbers , sliced 1/4 - inch thick — “ pickling ” or kirby cucumbers work best here
1 large sweet onion , thinly sliced
1/4 cup Diamond Kosher salt [ Updated : Why Diamond ?
Read this first . ]
1/2 to 3/4 cups sugar ( see note above )
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon coriander seeds ( if ground , use 1 teaspoon )
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
In a medium bowl , combine the cucumbers , onion and salt .
Mix well .
Cover the mixture with ice .
Let stand at room temperature for two hours .
In a pot , bring sugar , vinegar and spices to a boil .
Drain cucumbers and onions .
Add to vinegar mixture and bring almost back to a boil .
Remove from heat and cool .
You can store the pickles in an airtight container for up to three weeks in the fridge .
They will begin tasting pickled in just a couple hours .

Haymarket Martyr Louis Lingg Says Good-bye
The Chicago radicals convicted of the infamous May 4 , 1886 Haymarket Square bombing in which one policeman was killed remained openly defiant to the end .
Twenty - one - year - old German - born Carpenter Louis Lingg enthusiastically embraced the principles of anarchism and the violence he thought necessary to emancipate the working class in his final address before the court that convicted him of participating in the bombing .
Court of Justice !
With the same irony with which you have regarded my efforts to win in this “ free land of America , ” a livelihood such as humankind is worthy to enjoy , do you now , after condemning me to death , concede me the liberty of making a final speech .
I accept your concession ; but it is only for the purpose of exposing the injustice , the calumnies and the outrages which have been heaped upon me .
You have accused me of murder , and convicted me :
What proof have you brought that I am guilty ?
In the first place , you have brought this fellow Seliger to testify against me .
Him I have helped to make bombs , and you have further proven that with the assistance of another , I took those bombs to No. 58 Clybourn avenue , but what you have not proven — even with the assistance of your bought “ squealer , ” Seliger , who would appear to have acted such a prominent part in the affair — is that any of those bombs were taken to the haymarket .
A couple of chemists also , have been brought here as specialists , yet they could only state that the metal of which the haymarket bomb was made bore a certain resemblance to those bombs of mine , and your Mr. Ingham has vainly endeavored to deny that the bombs were quite different .
He had to admit that there was a difference of a full half inch in their diameters , although he suppressed the fact that there was also a difference of a quarter of an inch in the thickness of the shell .
This is the kind of evidence upon which you have convicted me .
It is not murder , however , of which you have convicted me .
The judge has stated that much only this morning in his resume of the case , and Grinnell has repeatedly asserted that we were being tried not for murder , but for anarchy , so the condemnation is — that I am an anarchist !
What is anarchy ?
This is a subject which my comrades have explained with sufficient clearness , and it is unnecessary for me to go over it again .
They have told you plainly enough what our aims are .
The state ’s attorney , however , has not given you that information .
He has merely criticized and condemned , not the doctrines of anarchy , but our methods of giving them practical effect , and even here he has maintained a discreet silence as to the fact that those methods were forced upon us by the brutality of the police .
Grinnell ’s own proffered remedy for our grievances is the ballot and combination of trades unions , and Ingham has even avowed the desirability of a six - hour movement !
But the fact is , that at every attempt to wield the ballot , at every endeavor to combine the efforts of workingmen , you have displayed the brutal violence of the police club , and this is why I have recommended rude force , to combat the ruder force of the police .
You have charged me with despising “ law and order .
” What does your “ law and order ” amount to ?
Its representatives are the police , and they have thieves in their ranks .
Here sits Captain Schaack .
He has himself admitted to me that my hat and books have been stolen from him in his office — stolen by policemen .
These are your defenders of property rights !
The detectives again , who arrested me , forced their way into my room like housebreakers , under false pretenses , giving the name of a carpenter , Lorenz , of Burlington street .
They have sworn that I was alone in my room , therein perjuring themselves .
You have not subpoenaed this lady , Mrs. Klein , who was present , and could have sworn that the aforesaid detectives broke into my room under false pretenses , and that their testimonies are perjured
But let us go further .
In Schaack we have a captain of the police , and he also has perjured himself .
He has sworn that I admitted to him being present at the Monday night meeting , whereas I distinctly informed him that I was at a carpenters ' meeting at Zepf ’s Hall .
He has sworn again that I told him that I also learned to make bombs from Herr Most ’s book .
That also is a perjury .
Let us go still a step higher among these representatives of law and order .
Grinnell and his associates have permitted perjury , and I say that they have done it knowingly .
The proof has been adduced by my counsel , and with my own eyes I have seen Grinnell point out to Gilmer , eight days before he came upon the stand , the persons of the men whom he was to swear against .
While I , as I have stated above , believe in force for the sake of winning for myself and fellow - workmen a livelihood such as men ought to have , Grinnell , on the other hand , through his police and other rogues , has suborned perjury in order to murder seven men , of whom I am one .
Grinnell had the pitiful courage here in the courtroom , where I could not defend myself , to call me a coward !
The scoundrel !
A fellow who has leagued himself with a parcel of base , hireling knaves , to bring me to the gallows .
Why ?
For no earthly reason save a contemptible selfishness — a desire to ' rise in the world “ — to ” make money , " forsooth .
This wretch — who , by means of the perjuries of other wretches is going to murder seven men — is the fellow who calls me “ coward ” !
And yet you blame me for despising such “ defenders of the law ” such unspeakable hypocrites !
Anarchy means no domination or authority of one man over another , yet you call that “ disorder . ”
A system which advocates no such “ order ” as shall require the services of rogues and thieves to defend it you call “ disorder . ”
The Judge himself was forced to admit that the state ’s attorney had not been able to connect me with the bombthrowing .
The latter knows how to get around it , however .
He charges me with being a “ conspirator . ”
How does he prove it ?
Simply by declaring the International Working People ’s Association to be a “ conspiracy . ”
I was a member of that body , so he has the charge securely fastened on me .
Excellent !
Nothing is too difficult for the genius of a state ’s attorney !
It is hardly incumbent upon me to review the relations which I occupy to my companions in misfortune .
I can say truly and openly that I am not as intimate with my fellow prisoners as I am with Captain Schaack .
The universal misery , the ravages of the capitalistic hyena have brought us together in our agitation , not as persons , but as workers in the same cause .
Such is the “ conspiracy ” of which you have convicted me .
I protest against the conviction , against the decision of the court .
I do not recognize your law , jumbled together as it is by the nobodies of bygone centuries , and I do not recognize the decision of the court .
My own counsel have conclusively proven from the decisions of equally high courts that a new trial must be granted us .
The state ’s attorney quotes three times as many decisions from perhaps still higher courts to prove the opposite , and I am convinced that if , in another trial , these decisions should be supported by twenty - one volumes , they will adduce one hundred in support of the contrary , if it is anarchists who are to be tried .
And not even under such a law — a law that a schoolboy must despise — not even by such methods have they been able to “ legally ” convict us .
They have suborned perjury to boot .
I tell you frankly and openly , I am for force .
I have already told Captain Schaack , “ if they use cannons against us , we shall use dynamite against them . ”
I repeat that I am the enemy of the “ order ” of today , and I repeat that , with all my powers , so long as breath remains in me , I shall combat it .
I declare again , frankly and openly , that I am in favor of using force .
I have told Captain Schaack , and I stand by it , “ if you cannonade us , we shall dynamite you . ”
You laugh !
Perhaps you think , “ you ’ll throw no more bombs ” ; but let me assure you I die happy on the gallows , so confident am I that the hundreds and thousands to whom I have spoken will remember my words ; and when you shall have hanged us , then — mark my words — they will do the bombthrowing !
In this hope do I say to you : I despise you .
I despise your order , your laws , your force - propped authority .
Hang me for it !

The Coalition : Our Programme for Government
This was what really was said when Cameron and Clegg met in Downing Street
What Dave and Nick really said to each other on the steps of No 10
Cameron God , but I love you . . .
Clegg
It is the love that dare not speak its name .
Cameron
To hell with what anyone may think , I want the whole world to know I would gladly melt into your arms for ever .
Clegg
Say you 'll never leave me .
Cameron I 'm yours and yours alone .
At least for a couple of months .
Clegg I 've got to have you .
Right here , right now .
Cameron
That tie goes so well with your hair .
Clegg
You feel a - m - a - a - a - a-zing .
Your arms are so buff .
Cameron I bet you say that to all the boys .
Clegg
Do n't tease me .
I 'm feeling very vulnerable .
Cameron
Has anyone ever told me how much you remind me of my fag ?
Clegg I would have died to be your fag .
Cameron
Your political career just has .
Clegg
That 's odd , so has yours .

Princeton economist Paul Krugman has finally disavowed his earlier position of euro - optimism .
In his New York Times column Firday , he writes that he could " see three ways Greece could stay on the euro . "
Unfortunately , " none of these alternatives seem politically plausible . "
As a result , the " unthinkable " may well happen , with Greece leaving the euro , " send[ing ] shock waves through Europe , possibly triggering crises in other countries . "
He thinks it 's still possible this result could be avoided if " European leaders are able and willing to act far more boldly than anything we ’ve seen so far . "
But as of now , the euro abandonment is " where this is heading . "
Not all agree with Krugman , though .
Harvard economist Greg Mankiw quibbles a bit , while a Council on Foreign Relations Fellow thinks leaving the euro is the wrong path and former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson and London School of Economics economist Peter Boone think they might see another option .
The debate has extra urgency given that some are blaming yesterday 's 1,000 - point Dow plunge on the European and , more specifically , Greek instability .
Was n't the Early U.S. Kind of Like Today's E.U. ?
Mankiw says " a large part of [ Krugman 's ] argument is that Europe is not an optimal currency area because it lacks a large central government enacting transfer payments among the various regions . "
But 19th - century U.S. had a common currency without a " large , centralized fiscal authority , " too , and it " worked out fine . "
Two possible differences between the past U.S. and present E.U. might be the former 's different labor system , which " facilitated the adjustment of wages , " and " labor mobility . "
If the wage adjustment is the key difference , then perhaps Europe should try the wage route .
If the issue is mobility , that 's harder to change : " Greeks have to stay in Greece because they do n't speak German . "
In that case , " Paul may well be right that the Euro experiment is over . "
No , Actually Edward Harrison at Credit Writedowns highlights , as does The Economist 's Ryan Avent , the importance of language and cultural differences rendering European country borders a bit thicker than the borders between American states .
In other words , they think mobility is a significant difference here .
Greece Ditching the Euro Just Makes Things Worse , argues Marc Levinson at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Adopting its own currency in place of the euro would not spare Greeks the pain of adjustment , " while " keeping Greece within the eurozone is in the interest of other European countries , too , for reasons of politics as much as economics .
The aspiration to be part of the European Union and the eurozone has been an extraordinarily important force in southern and eastern Europe . "
But Greece leaving would lead these other countries to " conclude they have no hope of joining . "
One ' Narrow Escape Path '
There remains another possibility , argue Simon Johnson and Peter Boone on a New York Times blog .
European leaders could " talk down the euro , " causing bond yields to " rise on the euro zone periphery . "
There would be " episodes of panic . "
Then , declare European Central bank support of the euro at the lowered levels and support the " peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent by buying their bonds . "
Only once this is completed , European leaders would have to " push weaker governments to restructure , " after which " European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced . "
Their reasoning here : " This is a massive failure of euro groupthink -- including most notably at the political level -- but there is no question that bank executives have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse . "

Miley Cyrus sports a tiny polka dot bikini during a family break in Mexico with her country star father Billy Ray
In recent months Miley Cyrus has shed her butter - would n't - melt Disney image for altogether more raunchy style .
However , once back in the company of her country singing father the 17 - year - old is , of course , on her best behaviour .
Although Billy Ray may have eyed with some suspicion the tiny two - pieced polka dot bikini the Hannah Montana star wore on the beach in Mexico .
Daddy 's girl : Miley Cyrus and her father Billy Ray spend some quality time together on the beach while on holiday in Mexico
Itsy bitsy : The Hannah Montana star wore a tiny , red polka dot , bikini as she relaxed with her country star father
However , many fathers would n't envy his job convincing the precocious young starlet not to wear the skimpy number .
But everything seemed bright and breezy between the pair as they relaxed in the sun .
They took a stroll along the sandy dunes , before heading towards the sea - letting the waves lap at their feet .
Quality time :
The singer and her father take a stroll on the beach together - Miley has finished working on childrens ' favourite Hannah Montana
All grown up :
The 17 - year - old lets the waves lap at her feet - she has sexed up her image since leaving the Disney show that made her famous
Miley , who is dating actor Liam Hemsworth , recently threw a party to celebrate her departure from childrens ' favourite Hannah Montana .
Now concentrating on a full - blown musical career , she has sexed up her squeaky clean image and will now focus on more serious acting roles .
However , with her career going from strength to strength , the actress has risked setting a bad example to her young fans ( and the wrath of her parents ) by deciding against going college .
Career focus :
Miley may have risked the wrath of her father after revealing that she does not intend to go to college for the forseeable future
She recently admitted she has no immediate plans to continue her studies and will put education on hold while she focuses on acting and singing .
In an interview on Q100's Bert Show , she said : ' I am a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want , because my grandma went back to college at 62 years old . '
The star also confessed that she feels pressure from the public to maintain a certain child - like persona .
New direction : Miley and her father enjoy the Mexican sun - she recently recorded a remix of her new song Can't Be Tamed with rap star Lil Jon
' No - one ever wants to see someone grow up .
It 's like when Hilary Duff started growing up off the Disney Channel .
' Everyone thought she was anorexic and she did this and that .
It 's just because she grew up !
She did n't look like a 12 - year - old anymore . '
Meanwhile , Miley 's music career is already floruishing and moving into new , unexplored terrain .
She recently recorded a remix of her new song Can't Be Tamed with rap star Lil Jon .
The song , taken from the singer 's album of the same name , was re-recorded at the Rock Mafia recording studio in Santa Monica , California .
Miley and Lil Jon got together by accident after Lil Jon was amusingly given Cyrus ' old mobile phone number , and began receiving phone calls for her .
Their remix has yet to be released but Lil Jon revealed : ' [ It 's ] crazy , it 's crazy .
I think everybody 's gonna really enjoy the song . '
The rock theme will be continued on Lil Jon 's long - awaited album , Crunk Rock , which is set for a June 8 release .
Review : Split / Second
by Binh Nguyen [ Monday , 24th of May 2010 - 10:18 PM ]
Get Ready , Set , Go :
The first thing you do in the game is go through their tutorial .
( Read : how the mechanics works in the game , especially how to raise your Power Play bar by Drifting , Jumping , and Drafting . )
Afterwards you will notice that there are no options to change the difficulty of the game .
You maybe wondering why .
The game progressively gets harder as you go through each Episode .
That is all well and good , but for those new to racing games or have never been a huge fan , it can get exceedingly difficult as you progress through the game .
Looks a lot like Burnout Paradise :
Okay so it looks like a mix of Burnout and Need for Speed , but there is not much more I can really say about that .
Graphically it certainly feels a lot better than most of the arcade style racing games out there .
It may not meet the exacting standards of a Forza or Gran Turismo , but it certainly does the job really well .
This is evident from the ' Close Call ' effects to the explosions of buildings to playing chicken with a cargo airplane .
Basic sounds for all :
The music is nothing impressive at all and it sounds like any other generic arcade game out there .
Where it shines is in the vehicle and explosion sounds .
This is top notch as you can feel how close each of the explosions are when they go off .
What is very disappointing is while the game promotes a “ Reality T.V. ” feel , it offers no sort of commentary while you are racing .
Very disappointing .
I was really hoping they would have the " show 's " commentary in the game .
Then again if they did have the commentary they would probably need to find a couple of charismatic people to do the commentary so we the gamers are n't annoyed by it .
Can I suggest a DLC to have Scarlett Johansson do the commentary ?
Oh wait that is just a fantasy of mine .
The Fewer the Better :
The button system is really , really simple .
R2 to drive .
L1 to show replay of a power play .
L2 to brake / drift .
X to activate power play .
Circle to activate power play level 2 . Right analog stick to steer .
Left analog stick to look around you .
Very simple and nothing overly too complex .
Those who are picking up a racing game for the first time should have a easy time becoming familiar with the controls .
The only thing I can think that could give players a hard time is getting used to each car and their capabilities .
All the Modes of the World :
Okay maybe there are only a few modes you can play within the game that are challenging at times , but they can also be very frustrating .
Of course you have Race Mode , where you race against the NPC or people online .
Here are the others :
Detonator Mode is a Time Trial race where you are racing against more than the clock - there is a twist .
The Power Plays that you would normally set off are trying to slow you down .
It can get frustrating at times .
My suggestion is to stick with it until you learn the course well enough to beat the course .
Survival Mode is what it sounds like .
Semi trucks loaded with barrels of explosives are dumping off the barrels at you .
Your goal here is try to avoid the barrels as much as you can and over take the Semis .
Sounds simple enough until you realize there are NPCs around blocking your way .
Air Strike is very interesting experience as well .
This is where you are racing through a course as military helicopters are shooting missiles at you .
Your objective ?
Well it is to avoid them at all costs to rack up as many points as you can .
Again it sounds easy enough until the helicopter is shooting up to ten missiles at a time .
Elimination is a fun but annoying experience at the same time .
Think of it as a normal Race but with a timer .
As the timer counts down to zero , whoever is in last place gets eliminated by being blown up .
Only the Race , Survival and Elimination modes are available for Online play that I have seen so far .
All the modes add a nice twist to a racing game that needed something to spice it up .
Split / Second certainly did that .
Lacking Much ?:
Most modern racing games give you the ability to customize your car 's look , performance and all that jazz .
Split / Second only gives you the option to change a single color of the color scheme and even that is very limited .
I know this is more of an arcade style of game over competitors like Need for Speed where it is all about customization , but at least give me a bit more customization than just the color scheme .
As of right now the field of people for online play is very , very thin , which is fine for now , but as the game gets a bit older , will the competition stay or will it slowly die off ?
Only time will tell on that .
Another lacking aspect has to be the realism of collisions .
The game does n't mind if you crash into the walls at full force ; you still manage to keep the majority of your speed .
On the flip side , one wrong angle on the front of your car and BAM there it goes .
It can be frustrating at times when you are trying to win a race and you ended up drifting a bit too much and slam right into the wall , forcing you to lose the race .
My Take :
Is Split / Second worth the $ 60 dollar price tag ?
That depends on whether or not you are looking for a new racing game with a different twist from the rest that are out there .
Very few racing games give me the thrill I need for my adrenaline to flow while racing through the various tracks .
The majority of the explosions are awesome to watch , even when you are using the Power Plays over and over again .
Sure it has it flaws , but what game does n't ?
I hope Black Rock Studio and Disney Interactive release some sort of DLC for new seasons and tracks for the game .
The way the game is set up they can have a new season every 2 - 3 months .
Overall it is a solid game and it is worth at least a rent .
Split / Second was developed by Black Rock Studios and published by Disney Interactive for the PS3 , XBox 360 , PC on May 18th .
A copy of the game was provided by the publisher for review purposes .
I played through up to episode 6 on the PS3 .
So this poor whale , malnourished , weak and unable to migrate to Alaska and probably not even able to survive the cold , finally succumb today and I was there .
I decided to go with Charlotte , my Mother and husband down to Dana Point and see if she was still hanging out around the harbor , as she had for the past few days .
When we got there we walked just a bit to see people were gathered at the beach .
Not a good sign .
Someone had binoculars and I asked if I could borrow them .
And unfortunately Lily had indeed washed up enough on shore where she was stranded .
It had just happened .
She was stuck .
I started walking , quickly .
I crawled down the rocks that led to the beach and I for some reason had to get to her .
There was nothing I could do , it was just time for her to go .
But I kept walking faster , keeping on the wet sand so that my feet would n't sink so fast .
My calves burned as I walked faster .
All I could think was , please do n't let her suffer anymore , she had been alone for so long .
Who knows how long she or he had been alone .
And there she was , washed ashore , to die alone .
And yet , I had to be there .
And as I walked up there were some State park rangers and they were keeping people away from Lily .
I asked and she had just recently been moving her tail , so her passing had been so recent , she could still be alive .
And yet there she was so close and yet so far , dying alone .
And I stood there as nothing happened except for tripods and photographers .
I know , they could n't do anything .
But why let her die alone .
I wanted so badly to wade out and look her in the eye , let her know , if she was still hanging on that she was not alone .
Her skin was covered with barnacles and lice , and in places , looking so red that it might be peeling , it was hard to tell , I was n't very close , they would n't let anyone near her .
She was being pushed around in the surf as if she was nothing , tail moving now and again .
Was she still there ?
People were taking photos , camera phones coming out around me and I did everything I could to hold back sobs .
Why are n't we doing something ?
The last thing I wanted to do was take a photo of her .
Was I the only one who wanted to let her know she was n't alone .
Do n't we hold our beloved pets when they are put to sleep ?
I know , she was probably beyond that by then , but I just could n't stand the thought of it .
And the helicopter came .
And the people were still there .
And I still sobbed .
Someone understood , a photographer who said he had named her Lily got what I meant when I said she had died all alone , he hugged me .
I could n't stay because the crowds were growing as was the media , they had learned that Lily had washed up on the beach as well .
It was time for us to go .
There was nothing I could do .
And they waited for her to die before they went near her .
No one had it in them to go to her while she was alive and be near her when it would have actually mattered .
Safety of the public is one of the reasons why the carcass of Lilly the whale is being towed out to sea now , a park official said .
The whale washed up around 4 p.m. about 30 feet ahead on the sand in front of San Juan Creek .
" They want to get the animal off , " said Cordaro of state park officials ' decision to tow Lilly out to sea right away .
" They feel this is their best chance to get rid of the carcass . ''
The mammal will be returned to the sea about 10 miles from the shoreline , Cordaro estimated .
But the majestic creature 's saga tugged hearts and touched people in different ways during the week .
Some hope the whale rescue that unfolded in the harbor before the eyes of children and adults , visitors in town and locals , encourages more care towards the ocean environment and curiosity about the great mammals of the sea .
" I am saddened by it , of course , we 're all whale lovers down here in Dana Point , " said Mike Bursk , a marine biologist and captain of the institute 's research boat Sea Explorer , who reported he could see the creature on the sand from the boat .
OC Register
How often is it that we can be there for another creature such as Lily ?
And no one was there .
I know we could not have saved her , her fate was sealed .
But why could have no one just touched her , or done something to let her know , before she left this earth that she was not ALONE ?
Maybe I am Lily .
I want to matter .
That this middle aged , fat , unemployed blogger wants to matter and that I 'm not just out here treading water waiting to wash up on shore someday .
That the fear , the sadness that 's been dragging me down deeper made me feel so much for this creature with no hope of making it .
And thinking that if we can't save this one whale , what are we going to do about an entire ocean like the Gulf ?
What then ?
And I 'm crying again , looking into that empty eye , I keep going back to that empty eye of hers , feeling that I have failed her , that I have failed me .
Lets not fail Lily .
Cany makes a very valid point about wild animals and my making assumptions .
The reason I come to my conclusion has to do with the fact that these animals live in pods , so they are social and that they are not all afraid of humans .
Some are even curious .
She might have been curious , alone , who knows , I 'm putting MY feelings on this dear creature , I get that .
But these animals do display higher intelligence , bonds with their young as mammals and give me other reasons to think that contact matters .
I remember reading this a while back when I was doing research about sonar and whales .
When I first contacted Frohoff , a specialist in whale well - being and stress , back in January in Seattle , where she lived at the time , she mentioned that she would soon be heading down to Baja as part of her ongoing research into “ the human - whale interactions there . ”
Each winter and early spring , gray whales , members of the baleen family ( named for the keratin mouth plates through which they filter their food ) arrive by the thousands to the warm , placid lagoons off Baja ’s western coast , where the mothers give birth and nurse their calves for two to four months before beginning the migration northward to their feeding grounds in the subpolar waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas .
Typically such child - rearing is a time of intense seclusion and protectiveness among mammalian species , but many of the grays of Baja , Frohoff told me , treat their days of birthing and nursing there as a kind of protracted coming - out party .
“ It ’s extraordinary , ” she said .
“ At precisely the time when you ’d expect them to be the most defensive , they ’re incredibly social .
They ’ll come right up to boats , let people touch their faces , give them massages , rub their mouths and tongues . ”
“ She ’s coming straight this way , ” Frohoff shouted as she reached for the sound - recording device she has fondly dubbed Fluffy — a two - foot - long , cylindrical microphone sheathed in a filtering fleece of shaggy fur — and held it off the bow toward a darkening wave of advancing whale .
...
And then , within moments , the mother was surfacing again off to our stern and doubling back in our direction , but this time with her newborn male in tow : a miniature version of herself — if two tons of anything can be referred to as miniature — the calf ’s skin still shiny and smooth .
The baby gray glided up to the boat ’s edge , and then the whole of his long , hornbill - shaped head was rising up out of the water directly beside me , a huge , ovoid eye slowly opening to take me in .
I ’d never felt so beheld in my life .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
I will never forget reading this and always remember this when I think of Gray whales or any large whales like them .
This is part of my reason for feeling so much for Lily , for learning so much about these amazing animals .
A plan by Senate Democratic leaders to reform the nation ’s immigration laws ran into strong opposition from civil liberties defenders before lawmakers even unveiled it Thursday .
Democratic leaders have proposed requiring every worker in the nation to carry a national identification card with biometric information , such as a fingerprint , within the next six years , according to a draft of the measure .
ADVERTISEMENT
The proposal is one of the biggest differences between the newest immigration reform proposal and legislation crafted by late Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Sen. ( R- Ariz . ) .
The national ID program would be titled the Believe System , an acronym for Biometric Enrollment , Locally stored Information and Electronic Verification of Employment .
It would require all workers across the nation to carry a card with a digital encryption key that would have to match work authorization databases .
“ The cardholder ’s identity will be verified by matching the biometric identifier stored within the microprocessing chip on the card to the identifier provided by the cardholder that shall be read by the scanner used by the employer , ” states the Democratic legislative proposal .
The American Civil Liberties Union , a civil liberties defender often aligned with the Democratic Party , wasted no time in blasting the plan .
“ Creating a biometric national ID will not only be astronomically expensive , it will usher government into the very center of our lives .
Every worker in America will need a government permission slip in order to work .
And all of this will come with a new federal bureaucracy — one that combines the worst elements of the DMV and the TSA , ” said Christopher Calabrese , ACLU legislative counsel .
“ America ’s broken immigration system needs real , workable reform , but it cannot come at the expense of privacy and individual freedoms , ” Calabrese added .
The ACLU said “ if the biometric national ID card provision of the draft bill becomes law , every worker in America would have to be fingerprinted .
” A source at one pro-immigration reform group described the proposal as “ Orwellian . ” But Senate Democratic Whip ( Ill. ) , who has worked on the proposal and helped unveil it at a press conference Thursday , predicted the public has become more comfortable with the idea of a national identification card .
“ The biometric identification card is a critical element here , ” Durbin said .
“ For a long time it was resisted by many groups , but now we live in a world where we take off our shoes at the airport and pull out our identification .
“ People understand that in this vulnerable world , we have to be able to present identification , ” Durbin added .
“ We want it to be reliable , and I think that ’s going to help us in this debate on immigration .
” Implementing a nationwide identification program for every worker will be a difficult task .
The Social Security Administration has estimated that 3.6 million Americans would have to visit SSA field offices to correct mistakes in records or else risk losing their jobs .
Angela Kelley , vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank , said the biometric identification provision “ will give some people pause . ”
But she applauded Democrats for not shying away from the toughest issues in the immigration reform debate .
“ What I like about the outline is that Democrats are not trying to hide the ball or soft - pedal the tough decisions , ” Kelley said .
“ It seems a very sincere effort to get the conversation started .
This is a serious effort to get Republicans to the table . ”
Reform Immigration for America , a pro-immigrant group , praised Democrats for getting the discussion started but said the framework fell short .
“ The proposal revealed today [ Thursday ] is in part the result of more than a year of bipartisan negotiations and represents a possible path forward on immigration reform , ” the group said in a statement .
“ This framework is not there yet . ”
Democrats and pro-immigration groups will now begin to put pressure on Republicans to participate in serious talks to address the issue .
The bipartisan effort in the Senate suffered a serious setback when Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamComey defends FBI Russia probe from GOP criticism The Hill 's Campaign Report : Debate fallout l Trump clarifies remarks on Proud Boys l Down to the wire in South Carolina Poll finds Trump , Biden in statistical dead heat in South Carolina MORE ( R - S.C. ) pulled back from talks with Sen.
Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerFirst woman sentenced for her role in Nxivm sex cult Ocasio - Cortez calls Trump a ' white supremacist ' after debate Democrats rip Trump for not condemning white supremacists , Proud Boys at debate MORE ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ We call on Republican Senators to review this framework and sit down at the negotiating table in good faith , ” Reform Immigration for America said in a statement .
“ This is a national problem that requires a federal solution and the input of leaders in both parties . ”
Durbin said Democratic leaders are trying to recruit other Republican partners .
“ We ’re making a commitment to establishing a framework to work toward comprehensive immigration reform , and I think it ’s a good framework and now we ’re engaging our friends on the other side of the aisle to join us in this conversation , ” Durbin said .
It occurs to me that I 've used up a lot of my ( and your ) time filling everyone 's ears about what a great game Prince of Persia : Sands of Time on the PS2 is , but have n't had much chance to go into a significant degree of detail .
Which I imagine some people might want to hear , because I may sometimes give the impression of being difficult to please ( OH GEE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT YAHTZEE ) so any game I like - and not merely because it's ' adequate ' or ' functional ' but because I find it truly , historically great - deserves in - depth examination .
First I should clearly state now that it 's not perfect .
I feel I 'm still yet to play a game I 'd consider ' perfect ' .
Portal is as close as it's gotten but loses another point every time internet fuckheads make a cake reference .
Prince of Persia : Sands of Time had a big combat problem ; long , repetitive fights with an annoying ' have to stab enemies in a certain way before they die for reals ' mechanic , and a system wherein each type of enemy will always be affected by some combat moves and never by others , which felt rather limiting .
To say nothing of the birds that had to be hit with a perfectly - timed swipe , or the bats that would attack you during platforming sections and which you just had to flail at while hanging from a ledge like a paranoid sloth .
These were teething troubles , resoundingly fixed in sequels , although one or two rookie mistakes can sometimes be endearing .
More so than committee - designed quality - controlled soulless mediocrity .
The platforming was the solid part of the gameplay .
What I liked about it most was that it flowed so well .
Once you had the motions down , the Prince was like a swarthy trout swimming downstream , instantly switching between running , jumping , swinging , climbing and falling fifty feet to a bone - shattering death .
But the time - reversing mistake - correcting element fit so naturally with the smooth rhythm of the gameplay that in every platform game since , my finger has unconsciously made for the rewind button every time I drop off a cliff .
The one thing that broke flow was the spike trap that you had to walk slowly across .
Again , this was fixed in the sequels .
" What 's all this about stuff being fixed in the sequels ? " I hear you interject .
" Why are n't you championing the sequels as the best games ever , then ?
Are you just prejudiced against incremental storytelling ?
Are you some sort of sequel Hitler ? "
You know , I 've just made myself wonder :
Can a churned - out sequel to a decent game with identical gameplay but a few rough edges sanded off honestly be called a ' better ' game , or does the fact that it is n't new anymore mark it down ?
I digress .
The point I was aiming for is that Sands of Time has very good writing .
The writing was the work of Jordan Mechner himself , the original developer of the first 2D Prince of Persia , and apparently also a talented writer on top of being a pioneer of pyjama rotoscoping .
It 's a fairly classic plot on the surface - hero and heroine thrown together in battle for survival , inevitable romance , evil vizier twirls evil moustache and so on - but what I like most about it is the development and interplay between the two lead characters .
It 's actually a convincing romance in a videogame .
No mere case of helpless princesses waiting for rescue at the end of a conga - line of baddies , or the hero putting his tongue in the only female on the cast as part of his big reward at the end .

In an article inspired by Jon Bentley ’s classic book , Programming Pearls , Mike Taylor invites his readers to implement the binary search algorithm .
To spice things up , he requests we work :
without reference to any existing implementation without calling any library routine , such as bsearch without writing tests .
Mike Taylor does n’t formally specify the problem .
He ’s confident his readers will know what a binary search is , and if not , the description he quotes from Programming Pearls should suffice :
Binary search solves the problem [ of searching within a pre-sorted array ] by keeping track of a range within the array in which T [ i.e. the sought value ] must be if it is anywhere in the array .
Initially , the range is the entire array .
The range is shrunk by comparing its middle element to T and discarding half the range .
The process continues until T is discovered in the array , or until the range in which it must lie is known to be empty .
So could our binary search implementation simply return a binary result , true if T is in the array , false otherwise ?
Well , Yes .
And No. A binary search can provide more information , as Mike Taylor hints when he mentions bsearch .
Jon Bentley and Mike Taylor are primarily interested in how often programmers make a mess of what appears to be a simple assignment and in how to avoid this mess .
In this article , I ’d like to point out that the problem specification needs attention too .
The C library ’s bsearch function returns the location of T , if found , or a sentinel value otherwise .
We might use the array index of T or - 1 as location and sentinel .
Standard C uses pointers :
NAME bsearch -- binary search of a sorted table SYNOPSIS # include < stdlib.h > void * bsearch ( const void * key , const void * base , size_t nel , size_t width , int ( * compar ) ( const void * , const void *) ) ; DESCRIPTION
The bsearch ( ) function searches an array of `nel` objects , the initial member of which is pointed to by `base` , for a member that matches the object pointed to by `key` .
The size ( in bytes ) of each member of the array is specified by `width` .
The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according to the comparison function referenced by `compar` .
The `compar` routine is expected to have two arguments which point to the `key` object and to an array member , in that order .
It should return an integer which is less than , equal to , or greater than zero if the `key` object is found , respectively , to be less than , to match , or be greater than the array member .
RETURN VALUES
The bsearch ( ) function returns a pointer to a matching member of the array , or a null pointer if no match is found .
If two members compare as equal , which member is matched is unspecified .
Void pointers , function pointers , raw memory — generic functions in C are n’t pretty .
How would this function look in a language with better support for generic programming ?
C++ programmers can of course use bsearch directly since C++ includes the standard C library .
The C++ counterpart would seem to be std::binary_search .
At first glance std:: binary_search appears to be a weakened version of bsearch .
Like bsearch , it searches for a value .
Unlike bsearch , it simply returns a boolean result : true if the value is found , false otherwise .
Nonetheless , it can tell us more than bsearch in some circumstances .
Let ’s return to Mike Taylor ’s second constraint , the one about implementing functions which already exist in standard libraries .
In a follow up article he explains :
… sometimes you do need to write a binary search , and the library routines wo n’t get the job done .
Or if they will , they ’re grotesquely inefficient .
For example , suppose you have a 64 - bit integer , and you need to find out whether it ’s among the nine billion 64 - bit integers that are stored in ascending order in a 72 Gb file .
The naive solution is to read the file into memory , making an array ( or , heaven help us , an Array ) of nine billion elements , then invoke the library search function .
And of course that just plain wo n’t work — the array wo n’t fit in memory .
Agreed !
We should know how our wheels work and be ready to reinvent them when necessary : but C++’s std:: binary_search will solve this problem efficiently .
All we need is a suitable iterator over the file , in this case one which :
increments in 8 byte steps
uses file seeks for larger steps
is dereferenced by reading 8 byte values from the file
stores file position , for use in ordering and distance operations
I include an implementation of just such an iterator towards the end of this article .
My aging laptop did n’t have enough disk space for a 72 GB data file but I found room for a 5 GB one .
Std::binary_search ( ) took milliseconds to test the presence of values in this file , and the times improved dramatically on repeat runs ; using a linear search , the time extended to minutes , and repeat runs showed no such improvements .
It ’s fair to suggest that creating a custom iterator just so we could use std:: binary_search merely moves the problem .
The iterator ’s implementation is longer and arguably more fiddly than any custom binary search function would be .
Why could n’t we use a standard input stream iterator with the standard binary search algorithm ?
The reason is that std :: istream_iterator s are input iterators , suitable only for single pass algorithms .
Binary search does n’t need to take any backwards steps but it does need to be able copy its iterators and advance them repeatedly .
As a minimum , then , it requires forwards iterators .
Note the algorithm ’s complexity !
The number of comparisons is logarithmic : at most log ( last - first ) + 2 .
If ForwardIterator is a Random Access Iterator then the number of steps through the range is also logarithmic ; otherwise , the number of steps is proportional to last - first .
In the case of our large file of numbers , comparisons are cheap ; there ’s little point minimising them if we ’re going to take billions of short steps through the file .
This is why we created a random access file iterator [ 1 ] .
A more subtle point is that binary search deals with equivalence rather than equality : it only requires a less - than operator ( or a comparison function ) , and returns true if it can find an element x which satisfies !( x < t ) && !( t < x ) .
The point I ’m making is that C++ does a nice job of separating algorithms and containers , which is why the same algorithm can be used on vectors , files , arrays etc .
It also carefully defines minimum requirements on the types used by algorithms [ 2 ] .
We noted earlier that std:: binary_search delivers nothing more than a binary result .
Is the element there or not ?
From the SGI STL documentation :
Note that this is not necessarily the information you are interested in !
Even bsearch tells us where it found the match ; or rather , where it found a match , since there could be several .
This imprecision is one of bsearch ’s failings — but it really lets us down when it ca n’t find the element : in this case , it subdivides the range until it finds where the element would be if it were there , realises there is no match , then throws all positional information away and returns a null pointer .
Suppose our large file represents a set of numbers and we want to know where our test number should go in this file , if it is n’t already present ?
A C++ binary search algorithm can do this , but it is n’t std::binary_search .
Here ’s another problem binary search can solve .
Suppose we want to know how many runners finished the 2010 London marathon in a time between 3 and 4 hours .
Let ’s suppose we ’ve already loaded the ordered finishing times into an array .
We might try using bsearch to find the position of the runners who finished with a time of exactly 3 hours and with a time of exactly 4 hours .
Then the answer would be the difference between these two positions .
There are two problems with this approach :
what if no one finished with a time of exactly 3 or 4 hours ?
what if more than one runner finished with a time of exactly 3 or 4 hours ?
In the first case bsearch returns a null pointer and we can’t complete our calculation .
In the second case , bsearch makes no guarantees about which of the equally - placed runners it will find , and even if we can make our calculation , we can not be sure it is correct .
Bsearch is not much use , then , but a binary search can give us our answer .
Imagine we had a late result for the race , a runner who recorded a time of exactly 3 hours .
What ’s the first position in the array at which we could place this runner , whilst maintaining the array ordering ?
Similarly , where ’s the first position at which we could insert a runner with a time of 4 hours , maintaining the array ordering .
Both these positions are well defined and precise — even if everyone finished the race in less than 3 hours , or even if no one ran the race — and the correct answer is their difference .
C++ supplies just such an algorithm .
It goes by the name of std::lower_bound , but really it ’s good old binary search .
We want to find the first place our target element could go , whilst maintaining the ordering , which we do by repeatedly splitting the range .
while the range is non-empty
look at the element in the middle of the range
is its value less than the target value ?
if so , continue looking in the top half of the range
if not , continue looking in the bottom half of the range
The while loop exits when the range has been reduced to a single point and this point is what we return .
On my platform , the code itself reads a bit like :
template < typename fwd_it , typename t> fwd_it lower_bound ( fwd_it first , fwd_it last , const t & val ) { typedef typename iterator_traits < fwd_it > :: difference_type distance ; distance len = std:: distance ( first , last ) ; distance half ; fwd_it middle ; while ( len > 0 ) { half = len >>
1 ; middle = first ; std ::advance ( middle , half ) ; if ( * middle < val ) { first = middle ; ++ first ; len = len - half - 1 ; } else len = half ; } return first ; }
I think this version of binary search is yet another gem from the C++ standard library .
As Jon Bentley and Mike Taylor eloquently point out , the implementation is subtle — in particular , if ( * middle < val ) we must eliminate middle or risk an infinite loop — but by tightening the problem specification and paring back the requirements we ’ve created a function which is far more useful than bsearch and arguably simpler to code .
For comparison , here ’s the bsearch implemented by glibc , version 2.11 .
/* Perform a binary search for KEY in BASE which has NMEMB elements of SIZE bytes each .
The comparisons are done by ( * COMPAR ) ( ) .
*/ void * bsearch ( const void * key , const void * base , size_t nmemb , size_t size , int ( * compar ) ( const void * , const void *) ) { size_t l , u , idx ; const void * p ; int comparison ; l = 0 ; u = nmemb ; while ( l < u ) { idx = ( l + u ) / 2 ; p = ( void *) ( ( ( const char *) base ) + ( idx * size ) ) ; comparison = ( * compar ) ( key , p ) ; if ( comparison < 0 ) u = idx ; else if ( comparison >
0 ) l = idx + 1 ; else return ( void *) p ; } return NULL ; }
On my platform , std:: binary_search is built directly on std::lower_bound .
Here ’s the code .
template < typename fwd_it , typename t> fwd_it lower_bound ( fwd_it first , fwd_it last , const t & val ) { fwd_it i = std::lower_bound( first , last , val ) ; return i != last && !( val < * i ) ; }
Std:: upper_bound searches a sorted range to find the last position an item could be inserted without changing the ordering .
Std ::equal_range returns a pair of iterators , logically equal to make_pair ( lower_bound ( ... ) , upper_bound ( ... ) ) .
The iterator class I created to use std:: binary_search on an file containing fixed width binary formatted numbers appears below .
To determine whether the file numbers .bin contains the target value 288230376151711744 , we would write something like :
#include < algorithm > .... typedef binary_file_number_iter<long long , 8 > iter ; long long target = 288230376151711744LL ; bool found = std::binary_search(iter(" numbers.bin " , iter :: begin ) , iter ( " numbers.bin " , iter : :end ) , target ) ;
To test the performance of these iterators I created a 5 GB binary file packed with 8 byte numbers .
These numbers were multiples of 3 :
0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , ... , 2015231997
I then timed how long it took to search this file for 10 interesting numbers ( and to confirm the returned results were as expected ) .
- 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 1007616000 , 1007616001 , 1007616002 , 1007616003 , 2015231997 , 2015232000
Binary_search ( ) recorded a time of 0.308 seconds on a rather old MacBook [ 3 ] .
Using a hand - coded linear search the run time was just over 38 minutes .
That is , the binary search ran 7000 times faster on this sample .
Interestingly , repeated runs of the binary search test using the same input file and the same targets ran in an average time of just 0.030 seconds , a 10 - fold times speed up over the first run .
Similarly repeating the linear search showed no such improvement .
I ’m attributing this to operating system file caching , but I do n’t pretend to know exactly what ’s going on here .

In this article we ’ve discussed binary search :
referring to existing implementations calling library routines , such as std:: binary_search and written some tests .
Despite this indiscipline , we never even bothered to roll our own binary search : we ’ve tackled the exact opposite of the problem which Mike Taylor set .
Programming tasks rarely start with a clear specification , and even if they do , the specification needs questioning .
My thanks to pinprick for the cheese photos , and for this delicious description .
morbier is a soft - ripened , washed rind cheese .
the tradition of bathing the rinds in salty water ( or strong ale ) goes back to trappist monks , who perfected the art .
washing the rind makes it tougher , protecting the cheese and making it last longer .
washing the rind also makes it a place where a certain bacteria , b. linens , love to hang out .
while they work their magic , making the cheese inside smooth and creamy and silky , they also make the outside stinky .
there is n’t any good way to put it .
however , most stinky cheese taste amazing , and once you realize that , you find that you love the smell of stinky cheese .
stink on the outside means gold on the inside ! — pinprick

[ 1 ] :
Well , something which masquerades as a random access iterator .
Files are not usually random access devices , and the time taken by a seek operation may well vary with the seek offset .
By supplying random access scaffolding , we at least ensure that a single , efficient , seek operation is used each time we advance the file position .

Unfortunately C++ implementations provide little support for enforcing these requirements .
Violations are likely to be punished by grotesque compiler warnings .

HOUSTON — A charter school fired a science teacher after a student shot cell phone video of her beating a 13 - year - old classmate .
Sheri Lynn Davis , 40 , was fired from her job at the Jamie 's House Charter School on Monday night .
Principal David Jones said he reviewed the video and determined there was " no excuse for a teacher to behave in this way with a child .
" KRIV -TV in Houston reported that the video was shot in late April .
The student who was beaten , Isaiah Johnson , received a black eye and other bruises in the attack , said his mother , Alesha Johnson .
School spokeswoman Sue Davis , who is not related to the teacher , said Tuesday that Sheri Lynn Davis was put on administrative leave May 5 , after the boy 's mother notified the school about the incident .
There was no online telephone listing for a Sheri Lynn Davis in Houston .
Someone named Sheri Davis had a telephone number but it was unpublished .
The Harris County Sheriff 's Office is investigating the incident , Deputy Janie Wagner said .
She declined to elaborate .
Isaiah Johnson is still enrolled in the school and was attending classes Tuesday , Sue Davis said
The Green Day Rock Band demo is up on Xbox Live now and when you quit the demo an interesting image comes up ( props to Kotaku for the screen shot ) .
Take a look at the instruments in the above image .
Besides the standard instruments we already have , let ’s first focus on the multiple microphones in the picture .
This confirms an earlier rumor out there that Rock Band 3 will include vocal harmonies just like it was incorporated for The Beatles Rock Band .
Also , an image of a keyboard appears giving us a hint of another peripheral on the way ( is it time for some Billy Joel ) ?
By judging the screen shot it looks like Rock Band 3 will give us the opportunity to have a 7 person band playing together in game .
Harmonix has been teasing that “ you ’ll be surprised at just how big Rock Band 3 will be ” and considering the potential here , they were n’t kidding !
I have enjoyed having local parties at my home and Rock Band is always a must play .
It is amazing how everybody gets in to it especially after the initial fear of trying it out .
While I am excited of this tease , it will be interesting to see how this will affect current songs in your Rock Band library .
Since Harmonix has let us export songs from previous versions or DLC will we be able to in Rock Band 3 ?
My guess here is we will be able to but the imported songs wo n’t have the full capabilities of songs within Rock Band 3 or future DLC .
Considering I have well over 500 songs in my library , I will be following this closely and looking forward to this Fall when I can pick up my copy .
MUMBAI : Drastic changes proposed to strengthen rape and sexual assault laws , so that women have more protection , will almost blur the difference between the two crimes .
In fact , reactions to the draft bill , sent to the Union home ministry , have termed it " anti-men " with wide scope for misuse .
While there were indications earlier that the draft might propose a gender - neutral law , the draft uploaded by the ministry to invite responses from the public shows that the amendments specifically target crimes by men against women .
Women activists told TOI that the proposals were long - pending and necessary .
Under the draft bill , if a man forcibly even puts his finger into a woman 's mouth — or lets his tongue enter her mouth during a kiss — he could end up in jail for sexual assault with the sentence being no less than the punishment for rape , which is seven years to life .
The draft bill also seeks a stricter age of consent , raising it from 16 to 18 .
The proposals would drastically change the manner in which cases of alleged sexual assault are dealt with by the courts and law - enforcing agencies .
Presently , any sexual misdemeanour less than rape , or forced sexual intercourse , is dealt with under the lesser category of molestation and the guilty face a maximum term of two years .
Legal experts have complained for years that Indian laws on sexual assault are extremely weak .
The Union government then set up a high - powered committee to review existing rape and sexual assault laws .
In March 2010 , the committee finalised a draft bill for the complete overhaul of Sections 375 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ) , which presently deal with rape .
The ministry invited comments from the general public on the draft bill till May 15 .
The bill mainly replaces the term ‘ rape ' with ‘ sexual assault ' , which means that the current penalty for rape — seven years — would apply to a broader category of sexual offences .
Bringing sexual assault and rape under a single umbrella , the draft bill describes sexual assault as an act in which a man " penetrates " the vagina , anus , urethra or mouth of a woman with " any part of his body " or " any object manipulated by him " .
The draft bill excludes penetrations by objects carried out for hygienic or medical reasons .
Reactions from men have ranged from apprehensions that such a law could be used to extort money , to outright panic that the doors would be thrown open for false cases that destroy a person 's reputation .
Rajesh Kumar , a Delhi - based lawyer and " men 's rights activist " , posted a copy of the bill for discussion on the internet and said it had elements which made it " patently anti-men " .
Kumar worried that the nuances of the law could be used to file false cases against men even if a sexual relationship was consensual .
He also said that the law was gender discriminatory as it recognized only sexual assault of women by men and not the other way around .

BANGKOK — A bloody crackdown in Bangkok by the Thai military set off rioting and arson attacks on Wednesday in several places across Thailand , threatening to expand unrest and further aggravate the deep rifts that have hobbled Thai society for the past four years .
Troops and armored military vehicles overcame grenade - wielding militants allied with antigovernment protesters in Bangkok , forcing the movement ’s leaders to turn themselves in to the police .
But even as the government declared victory in quashing a debilitating protest that had shut down parts of Bangkok for two months , the rampage across Bangkok and in at least three provinces in the country ’s populous northeastern hinterland raised concerns about the conflict ’s spreading and the future of the current government .
The government declared a curfew in 24 of the country ’s 76 provinces , a radical move underlined by its announcement that looters or arsonists would be shot .
A secretive group linked to a leading European chemical company has joined the campaign to defeat Barack Obama 's green agenda , taking the fight beyond the traditional players – the big oil and coal firms – the Guardian has learned .
The previously unknown Coalition for Responsible Regulation Inc ( CRR ) is at the forefront of a strategy to strip the Obama administration of its powers to regulate greenhouse gas emissions should Congress fail to act on climate change .
The group , which refuses to disclose its complete membership and which does not have a website , has joined more than a dozen states and a host of industry groups in 17 legal challenges to the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency .
The connection to the chemical firm Solvay suggests opposition to action on global warming , once spearheaded by big oil , is spreading to other industries that will also be affected by proposals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases .
Several of the petitioners against the EPA are household names , such Peabody Energy Corp , America 's biggest coal mining company , and the Chamber of Commerce , which has led opposition to Obama 's climate agenda .
They also include prominent rightwing thinktanks .
But some of those launching legal challenges against the EPA have appeared as if from nowhere – such as the CRR .
Court documents filed in Texas identify Richard Hogan , chief executive of Solvay 's wholly owned US subsidiary , as one of three directors of the CRR , the lead petitioner on the legal challenge to the EPA 's authority to act on greenhouse gas emissions .
The filings give Solvay 's Houston office as Hogan 's address .
The coalition was apparently created to block Obama 's efforts to deal with climate change .
The filings with the Texas authorities reveal the coalition was founded on 10 November last year – a day after the EPA announced its scientists had determined that greenhouse gases were a public danger .
The group filed its challenge to the EPA on 23 December .
Eric Groten , an attorney for the coalition , said it plans to file at least three more legal challenges against the EPA , which could tie up the agency in paperwork .
Such challenges to the EPA have intensified since last November when the agency signalled it was preparing to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , a measure widely seen as a backstop in case Congress failed to pass climate change legislation .
At least 15 state legislatures are now considering motions casting doubt on climate science or seeking to overturn the EPA 's authority to regulate emissions .
Republicans in Congress have filed separate resolutions to set aside the EPA 's finding about the dangers of greenhouse gases , and the Senate may reportedly seek to strip the EPA of powers in a climate bill expected to be rolled out next week .
Court documents identify the CCR as a non-profit membership corporation " for the purpose of promoting social welfare , particularly to ensure that the clean air act is properly applied to greenhouse gases .
Its members include business and trade associations engaged in activities that would likely be subject to regulation under the clean air act . "
The court documents list six companies and trade associations representing mining and beef interests among its members – but not Solvay .
Groten said there were more members – individual as well as corporate .
He refused to identify members beyond those listed on the court petition , but compared the group to the Sierra Club , the popular grassroots conservation network .
" Those who want to support its objectives contribute financially to it , " he said .
Carrying the analogy further , Groten said membership was determined by donation .
" One becomes a member of the organisation just as one becomes a member of the Sierra Club by donated money to it . "
Solvay Chemical 's connection to the legal challenges seems at odds with the company 's stated commitment to sustainable development on its website .
" We commit ourselves to take into account , in a way that is comprehensive and integrated in all our activities , the triple demand of economic , societal and environmental sustainability , " the statement says .
Mark
Wheeler , communications director for Solvay in America , denied the company was a member of CCR .
Kert Davies , research director for Greenpeace , said Brussels - based Solvay produces sulphur hexafluoride ( or SF6 ) , used for industrial cleaning , but also an extremely potent greenhouse gas .
Each kilogram of SF6 produces an atmospheric warming effect equivalent to nearly 24,000kg of carbon dioxide .
The EPA proposed last year to begin regulating SF6 .
The secrecy enveloping the CRR is typical of the efforts to block regulation of greenhouse gases , according to Greenpeace , which has spent years tracking the behind - the - scenes efforts by oil companies such as Exxon and Koch Industries to deny the science of climate change .
Also among the EPA 's opponents this time around is the Alliance for Natural Climate Change Science .
That organisation appears to exist only as a Fort Worth post office box on the original court filings , which list Alexis Hathaway and William Orr as contacts .
Orr , a Colorado businessman , was convicted in 2008 on several counts of defrauding public funds and private investors for a project purporting to produce an alternative fuel that received a $ 3.6 million grant from Congress .
However , subsequent filings link the legal challenge to Bonner Cohen , a fellow of the Committe for Constructive Tomorrow , a well - known climate sceptic group .
" [ Orr ] is no longer affiliated with the organisation , " Cohen said .
Oxfam's Kert Davies said the link between the CRR and Solvay could be an indicator that the opposition to climate change regulation is spreading to new sectors of the economy .
" The industrial bloc is powerfully organised and rich .
They have all the tools and all the lawyers and they are going to do all they can to stop carbon regulation , " he said .
" It is going to take a generation to really regulate greenhouse gas emissions in this country , just as it has taken a generation to get action on other pollutants . "
Analysis :
Why target the EPA ?
The EPA has become a prime target for politicians and industries seeking to slow down or block moves to curb greenhouse gas emissions in America .
The fiercest opponents of the EPA accuse the agency of trying to put in place a top - down regulatory regime that would stifle economic growth and monitor every puff of human breath for carbon dioxide .
But the Obama administration says the EPA has no choice but to put in place a regulatory regime , should Congress fail to pass a climate change law .
The supreme court ruled two years ago that the agency had a duty and authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
So the EPA could open itself up to a whole slew of new court challenges if it does not act on climate change .

The assault was described as out of character
The keyboard player with pop group Wet Wet Wet has been ordered to take part in a domestic violence programme after he admitted assaulting his girlfriend .
Neil Mitchell , 44 , from Glasgow , pushed and punched his partner Olivia Warren during a drunken row at her home in Fulham , south - west London , last July .
Kingston Crown Court heard she suffered a black eye and a bruised shoulder in the " shameful " attack .
The court heard the couple still hoped to have a future together .
He accepts that he punched a woman in the face and that is something that he is deeply ashamed of Defence lawyer Jill Evans
The pair argued after consuming three bottles of wine , said Jill Evans , representing Mitchell .
" There is significant bruising but a significant amount of that came from falling against the furniture .
" He accepts that he punched a woman in the face and that is something that he is deeply ashamed of . "
The 5ft 4in musician , whose band had hits including Love Is All Around , Angel Eyes and Goodnight Girl , sought help from a psychotherapist after the attack .
Miss Warren had trouble sleeping and was prescribed Valium to help , said prosecutor James Edenborough .
' Mild - mannered man '
Mitchell had earlier denied assaulting Miss Warren , causing actual bodily harm , but changed his plea at a hearing last month .
Sentencing , Judge Shani Barnes handed him a two - year community order with the condition he attends a domestic violence programme .
She said : " It is shameful that you should come before the courts at all - let alone for using such violence against your partner .
" I have no doubt that you are a mild - mannered gentle man by nature .
" Domestic violence is never acceptable , even if the young woman gave as good as she got , the injuries she sustained were far more impactful than anything she could have done to you . "
man : this date is going really well !
woman : yeah !
i'm having a great time !
* hands something to the woman * man : here you go woman : what 's this ?
man : i have my dates fill out an evaluation form mid-date man : that way , i can learn from the feedback and make the second half of the date even better !
woman ( reading form ) : " on a scale from one to ten , how likely are you to sleep with me tonight ? " ?!
man : oh , i'm sorry man : that 's the form for after the first date woman : i'm going to fill it out anyway !
* hearts surrounding her* woman : eleven

Dahr Jamail on how the WikiLeaks video of the New Baghdad Massacre “ is not uncommon ” through the mouths of “ several soldiers who shared equally horrific stories of the slaughtering of innocent Iraqis by U.S. occupation forces ” .
by Dahr Jamail
7 Apr 2010 | Truthout
On Monday , April 5 , Wikileaks.org posted video footage from Iraq , taken from a U.S. military Apache helicopter in July 2007 as soldiers aboard it killed 12 people and wounded two children .
The dead included two employees of the Reuters news agency : photographer Namir Noor - Eldeen and driver Saeed Chmagh .
The U.S. military confirmed the authenticity of the video .
The footage clearly shows an unprovoked slaughter , and is shocking to watch whilst listening to the casual conversation of the soldiers in the background .
As disturbing as the video is , this type of behavior by U.S. soldiers in Iraq is not uncommon .
Truthout has spoken with several soldiers who shared equally horrific stories of the slaughtering of innocent Iraqis by U.S. occupation forces .
“ I remember one woman walking by , ” said Jason Washburn , a corporal in the U.S. Marines who served three tours in Iraq .
He told the audience at the Winter Soldier hearings that took place March 13 - 16 , 2008 , in Silver Spring , Maryland , “ She was carrying a huge bag , and she looked like she was heading toward us , so we lit her up with the Mark 19 , which is an automatic grenade launcher , and when the dust settled , we realized that the bag was full of groceries .
She had been trying to bring us food and we blew her to pieces . ”
The hearings provided a platform for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan to share the reality of their occupation experiences with the media in the U.S .
Washburn testified on a panel that discussed the rules of engagement ( ROE ) in Iraq , and how lax they were , to the point of being virtually nonexistent .
“ During the course of my three tours , the rules of engagement changed a lot , ” Washburn ’s testimony continued , “ The higher the threat the more viciously we were permitted and expected to respond .
Something else we were encouraged to do , almost with a wink and nudge , was to carry ‘ drop weapons ’ , or by my third tour , ‘ drop shovels ’ .
We would carry these weapons or shovels with us because if we accidentally shot a civilian , we could just toss the weapon on the body , and make them look like an insurgent . ”
Hart Viges , a member of the 82nd Airborne Division of the Army who served one year in Iraq , told of taking orders over the radio .
“ One time they said to ﬁre on all taxicabs because the enemy was using them for transportation … .
One of the snipers replied back , ‘ Excuse me ?
Did I hear that right ?
Fire on all taxicabs ? ’
The lieutenant colonel responded , ‘ You heard me , trooper , ﬁre on all taxicabs . ’
After that , the town lit up , with all the units ﬁring on cars .
This was my ﬁrst experience with war , and that kind of set the tone for the rest of the deployment . ”
Vincent Emanuele , a Marine rifleman who spent a year in the al - Qaim area of Iraq near the Syrian border , told of emptying magazines of bullets into the city without identifying targets , running over corpses with Humvees and stopping to take “ trophy ” photos of bodies .
“ An act that took place quite often in Iraq was taking pot shots at cars that drove by , ” he said , “ This was not an isolated incident , and it took place for most of our eight - month deployment . ”
Kelly Dougherty — then executive director of Iraq Veterans Against the War — blamed the behavior of soldiers in Iraq on policies of the U.S. government .
“ The abuses committed in the occupations , far from being the result of a ‘ few bad apples ’ misbehaving , are the result of our government ’s Middle East policy , which is crafted in the highest spheres of U.S. power , ” she said .
Michael Leduc , a corporal in the Marines who was part of the U.S. attack on Fallujah in November 2004 , said orders he received from his battalion JAG officer before entering the city were as follows :
“ You see an individual with a white ﬂag and he does anything but approach you slowly and obey commands , assume it ’s a trick and kill him . ”
Brian Casler , a corporal in the Marines , spoke of witnessing the prevalent dehumanizing outlook soldiers took toward Iraqis during the invasion of Iraq .
“ [ O ] n these convoys , I saw Marines defecate into MRE bags or urinate in bottles and throw them at children on the side of the road , ” he stated .
Scott Ewing , who served in Iraq from 2005 - 2006 , admitted on one panel that units intentionally gave candy to Iraqi children for reasons other than “ winning hearts and minds .
“ There was also another motive , ” Ewing said .
“ If the kids were around our vehicles , the bad guys would n’t attack .
We used the kids as human shields . ”
In response to the WikiLeaks video , the Pentagon , while not officially commenting on the video , announced that two Pentagon investigations cleared the air crew of any wrongdoing .
A statement from the two probes said the air crew had acted appropriately and followed the ROE .
Adam Kokesh served in Fallujah beginning in February 2004 for roughly one year .
Speaking on a panel at the aforementioned hearings about the ROE , he held up the ROE card soldiers are issued in Iraq and said , “ This card says , ‘ Nothing on this card prevents you from using deadly force to defend yourself ’ . ”
Kokesh pointed out that “ reasonable certainty ” was the condition for using deadly force under the ROE , and this led to rampant civilian deaths .
He discussed taking part in the April 2004 siege of Fallujah .
During that attack , doctors at Fallujah General Hospital told Truthout there were 736 deaths , over 60 percent of which were civilians .
“ We changed the ROE more often than we changed our underwear , ” Kokesh said , “ At one point , we imposed a curfew on the city , and were told to fire at anything that moved in the dark . ”
Kokesh also testified that during two cease - fires in the midst of the siege , the military decided to let out as many women and children from the embattled city as possible , but this did not include most men .
“ For males , they had to be under 14 years of age , ” he said , “ So I had to go over there and turn men back , who had just been separated from their women and children .
We thought we were being gracious . ”
Steve Casey served in Iraq for over a year starting in mid-2003 .
“ We were scheduled to go home in April 2004 , but due to rising violence we stayed in with Operation Blackjack , ” Casey said , “ I watched soldiers firing into the radiators and windows of oncoming vehicles .
Those who did n’t turn around were unfortunately neutralized one way or another – well over 20 times I personally witnessed this .
There was a lot of collateral damage . ”
Jason Hurd served in central Baghdad from November 2004 until November 2005 .
He told of how , after his unit took “ stray rounds ” from a nearby firefight , a machine gunner responded by firing over 200 rounds into a nearby building .
“ We fired indiscriminately at this building , ” he said .
“ Things like that happened every day in Iraq .
We reacted out of fear for our lives , and we reacted with total destruction . ”
Hurd said the situation deteriorated rapidly while he was in Iraq .
“ Over time , as the absurdity of war set in , individuals from my unit indiscriminately opened fire at vehicles driving down the wrong side of the road .
People in my unit would later brag about it .
I remember thinking how appalled I was that we were laughing at this , but that was the reality . ”
Other soldiers Truthout has interviewed have often laughed when asked about their ROE in Iraq .
Garret Reppenhagen served in Iraq from February 2004 - 2005 in the city of Baquba , 40 kilometers ( about 25 miles ) northeast of Baghdad .
He said his first experience in Iraq was being on a patrol that killed two Iraqi farmers as they worked in their field at night .
“ I was told they were out in the fields farming because their pumps only operated with electricity , which meant they had to go out in the dark when there was electricity , ” he explained , “ I asked the sergeant , if he knew this , why did he fire on the men .
He told me because the men were out after curfew .
I was never given another ROE during my time in Iraq . ”
Emmanuel added : “ We took fire while trying to blow up a bridge .
Many of the attackers were part of the general population .
This led to our squad shooting at everything and anything in order to push through the town .
I remember myself emptying magazines into the town , never identifying a target . ”
Emmanuel spoke of abusing prisoners he knew were innocent , adding , “ We took it upon ourselves to harass them , and took them to the desert to throw them out of our Humvees , while kicking and punching them when we threw them out . ”
Jason Wayne Lemue is a Marine who served three tours in Iraq .
“ My commander told me , ‘ Kill those who need to be killed , and save those who need to be saved ’ ; that was our mission on our first tour , ” he said of his first deployment during the invasion .
“ After that the ROE changed , and carrying a shovel , or standing on a rooftop talking on a cell phone , or being out after curfew [ meant those people ] were to be killed .
I ca n’t tell you how many people died because of this .
By my third tour , we were told to just shoot people , and the officers would take care of us . ”
When this Truthout reporter was in Baghdad in November 2004 , my Iraqi interpreter was in the Abu Hanifa mosque that was raided by US and Iraqi soldiers during Friday prayers .
“ Everyone was there for Friday prayers , when five Humvees and several trucks carrying [ U.S. soldiers and ] Iraqi National Guards entered , ” Abu Talat told Truthout on the phone from within the mosque while the raid was in progress .
“ Everyone starting yelling ‘ Allahu Akbar ’ ( God is the greatest ) because they were frightened .
Then the soldiers started shooting the people praying ! ”
“ They have just shot and killed at least four of the people praying , ” he said in a panicked voice , “ At least 10 other people are wounded now .
We are on our bellies and in a very bad situation . ”
Iraqi Red Crescent later confirmed to Truthout that at least four people were killed , and nine wounded .
Truthout later witnessed pieces of brain splattered on one of the walls inside the mosque while large blood stains covered carpets at several places .
This type of indiscriminate killing has been typical from the initial invasion of Iraq .
Truthout spoke with Iraq war veteran and former National Guard and Army Reserve member Jason Moon , who was there for the invasion .
“ While on our initial convoy into Iraq in early June 2003 , we were given a direct order that if any children or civilians got in front of the vehicles in our convoy , we were not to stop , we were not to slow down , we were to keep driving .
In the event an insurgent attacked us from behind human shields , we were supposed to count .
If there were thirty or less civilians we were allowed to fire into the area .
If there were over thirty , we were supposed to take fire and send it up the chain of command .
These were the rules of engagement .
I do n’t know about you , but if you are getting shot at from a crowd of people , how fast are you going to count , and how accurately ? ”
Moon brought back a video that shows his sergeant declaring , “ The difference between an insurgent and an Iraqi civilian is whether they are dead or alive . ”
Moon explains the thinking : “ If you kill a civilian he becomes an insurgent because you retroactively make that person a threat . ”
According to the Pentagon probes of the killings shown in the WikiLeaks video , the air crew had “ reason to believe ” the people seen in the video were fighters before opening fire .
Article 48 of the Geneva Conventions speaks to the “ basic rule ” regarding the protection of civilians :
“ In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects , the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives . ”
What is happening in Iraq seems to reflect what psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton calls “ atrocity - producing situations . ”
He used this term first in his book “ The Nazi Doctors . ”
In 2004 , he wrote an article for The Nation , applying his insights to the Iraq War and occupation .
“ Atrocity - producing situations , ” Lifton wrote , occur when a power structure sets up an environment where “ ordinary people , men or women no better or worse than you or I , can regularly commit atrocities … .
This kind of atrocity - producing situation … surely occurs to some degrees in all wars , including World War II , our last ‘ good war . ’
But a counterinsurgency war in a hostile setting , especially when driven by profound ideological distortions , is particularly prone to sustained atrocity – all the more so when it becomes an occupation . ”
Cliff Hicks served in Iraq from October 2003 to August 2004 .
“ There was a tall apartment complex , the only spot from where people could see over our perimeter , ” Hicks told Truthout , “ There would be laundry hanging off the balconies , and people hanging out on the roof for fresh air .
The place was full of kids and families .
On rare occasions , a fighter would get atop the building and shoot at our passing vehicles .
They never really hit anybody .
We just knew to be careful when we were over by that part of the wall , and nobody did shit about it until one day a lieutenant colonel was driving down and they shot at his vehicle and he got scared .
So he jumped through a bunch of hoops and cut through some red tape and got a C - 130 to come out the next night and all but leveled the place .
Earlier that evening when I was returning from a patrol the apartment had been packed full of people . ”

History does not repeat itself
Hilary Mantel says history is never repeated .
But , it can be lived again through art .
Project Amiga Juggler Step 0 Programming — especially when you are just starting out , learning how to code — endows you with a sense of control , a sense of power .
Often , its like playing a God game , at least when you do it recreationally .
Of course , you need to spell out to extremely high precision exactly what you want the machine to do .
But , then its forced to carry out your instructions .
It s forced to obey .
You can derive a similar sense of fun from mathematics .
You can force math to do amazing things on your behalf .
Of course , you need to figure out the right equations , but once you code them into your programs , the formulae are under your control .
They too will obey .
To show you what I mean , lets do some recreational programming .
Let s recreate the Amiga Juggler from scratch using core Java .
In the fall of 1986 , Eric Graham discovered that the Amiga 1000 personal computer , running at a meager 7.16 MHz , was powerful enough to ray trace simple 3D scenes .
His test animation consisted of an abstract , humanoid robot juggling 3 mirrored balls .
It stunned the Amiga community including the executives at Commodore , who later acquired the rights to the animation for promotional purposes .
I want to share some of the pain that Eric Graham went through by coding this from first principles .
To accomplish this , Ill have to develop a mini ray tracer , a program that generates images by simulating the optical properties of light interacting with an environment .
Ill delve into linear algebra , geometry , trigonometry and a bit of calculus .
Hopefully , you vaguely remember learning about these topics back in school .
Let s review .
Step 1
A three - dimensional vector is simply a list of 3 numbers .
It can represent a point in space , a direction , a velocity , an acceleration , etc .
It can even represent a color in RGB color space .
For coding simplicity , Ill represent a vector as an array of doubles of length 3 .
An object with 3 double fields is probably more efficient , but I m trying to minimize the amount of code to write .
Many vector functions act on the individual components independently .
For example , to add 2 vectors together , you simply need to add each pair of components together .
// a = b + c
public static void add ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b , double [ ] c ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
a [ i ] = b [ i ] + c [ i ] ;
}
}
The magnitude of a vector ( the length of a vector ) is computing using the 3 - dimensional version of the Pythagorean Theorem .
// |v|
public static double magnitude ( double [ ] v ) {
return Math.sqrt ( v [ 0 ] * v [ 0 ] + v [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] + v [ 2 ] * v [ 2 ] ) ;
}
You can scale a vector ( change its length ) by multiplying it by a constant ( a.k.a. a scalar ) .
// a = b * s
public static void scale ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b , double s ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
a [ i ] = b [ i ] * s ;
}
}
You can negate a vector by scaling by −1 , reversing its direction .
If you divide a vector by its magnitude ( scale by 1 / magnitude ) , you end up with a unit vector ( a vector of length 1 ) .
Vectors can do cools things .
Consider an astronaut floating in space at some origin point o that fires a gun in direction d ( a unit vector ) .
The bullet leaves the gun and it continues to travel indefinitely in a straight line at a constant velocity ( a unit of distance for every unit of time ) .
Its position at any time is given by the ray equation .
Above , a vector is scaled by a constant and the result is added to another vector .
// a = b + c * s
public static void ray ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b , double [ ] c , double s ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
a [ i ] = b [ i ] + c [ i ] * s ;
}
}
Most vector functions are intuitive , but 2 are mysterious : dot - product and cross-product .
You may recall this trick involving a determinant that is helpful for remembering how to perform cross product :
The notation used in the trick actually reveals a little bit about the historic origin of dot product and cross product .
They come from a number system invented by William Hamilton in 1843 called quaternions .
Hamilton attempted to extend complex numbers by introducing a new imaginary - like constant j , but he could not work out a self - consistent system .
According to legend , while out on a walk in Dublin by the Brougham Bridge , formulae that would work popped into his head .
He was so overcome by excitement in his revelation that he impulsively vandalized the bridge by scratching the equations into the stonework ( WTF ? ) .
Hamiltons solution involved introducing 2 new imaginary - like constants :
You can multiply pairs of those constants in 6 different ways .
Below , note that the commutative property of multiplication does not work here ( order matters ) .
Using those pairs , it s possible to multiply 2 quaternions together .
When the real components are both 0 ( absent ) , you end up with this :
The real part on the left is the negative dot product and vector part on the right is the cross product .
As mathematicians used quaternions in the decades after their discovery , they began to recognize that they were often using them to compute exactly those values .
To make life easier , the vector product operators were introduced .
Dot product is an operation that takes place on the plane for which the vectors reside .
The image below shows a view of that plane .
These vectors contain only direction information ; you can think of their tails as touching the origin .
Vector u defines a line and vector v casts a perpendicular shadow onto that line .
The problem is find vector p .
You can redraw it as 2 right triangles that share a common side and height .
From there , its just a matter of applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice .
In addition to finding p , I wrote down a useful equation that shows that dot product is proportional to the magnitude of the vectors involved and the cosine of the angle between them .
Note if the angle is 90 degrees , then the dot product is 0 .
If the angle is less - than 90 , then the dot product is positive .
And , if the angle is greater - than 90 , then the dot product is negative .
But , what if vector u was a lot shorter than vector v ?
As you can see , you end up with exactly the same answer .
If the angle is greater than 90 degrees , you can negate one of the vectors to end up with something similar to one of the pictures above .
Again , youll get the same answer .
Cross product is used to find a vector , w , perpendicular to the plane that u and v reside .
The angle between u and v is not necessarily 90 , but the angles between u and w and v and w are both 90 .
From dot product , that gives us :
If u and v reside on a plane , as opposed to a line , then they can not be parallel .
But , if they were parallel , then they would only be distinguishable by some constant k .
If they are not parallel , then at least one of the following relationships cannot exist .
Suppose that the first or the second relationship is false .
Then , we can rewrite the 2 original equations like this :
Next , we solve for g and h using Cramers Rule .
Note that if the first and the second of the aforementioned relationships were both true , then we would be dividing by 0 .
We end up with this :
Now , you have some freedom here .
You can actually set i to any value of your choosing and compute g and h accordingly .
The resulting vector , w , will be perpendicular to the uv-plane .
But , you may happen to notice that the ( non- zero ) denominators of both fractions in the formulae are the same .
If you set i to that value , the denominators vanish and the result is the definition of cross product .
If the first and the second of the aforementioned relationships were true , then you could make a similar argument using the second and the third instead since at least one of them must be false assuming the vectors are not parallel .
When they are parallel , the cross product is a null vector .
One important aspect of cross product ( not proved here ) is that it obeys the right - hand rule .
Finally , using all these vector ideas , I put together the following utility class .
public final class Vec {
private Vec ( ) {

It s unfortunate that Java does not support operator overloading .
Instead , this is an all static class like the Math class .
Step 2
The original Amiga Juggler animation was a 1 second loop consisting of 24 frames rendered at 320×200 resolution .
I am aiming for 30 frames rendered at the HD resolution of 1920 ×1080 .
However , during testing , Ill render 1 frame at a third of that resolution ( 640×360 ) .
To that end , I need some boilerplate code to save an image .
import java.awt.image .*;
import javax.imageio.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util .*;
public class Main {
public static final int SQRT_SAMPLES = 1 ;
public static final int IMAGE_SCALE = 3 ;

public static final String OUTPUT_FILE = " output . " + IMAGE_TYPE ;
public static final double GAMMA = 2.2 ;
public static final int SAMPLES = SQRT_SAMPLES * SQRT_SAMPLES ;
public static final double INVERSE_SAMPLES = 1.0 / SAMPLES ;
public static final double INVERSE_GAMMA = 1.0 / GAMMA ;
public static final long SECOND_MILLIS = 1000L ;
public static final long MINUTE_MILLIS = 60 * SECOND_MILLIS ;
public static final long HOUR_MILLIS = 60 * MINUTE_MILLIS ;
private double [ ] [ ] [ ] pixels = new double [ HEIGHT ] [ WIDTH ] [ 3 ] ;
public void launch ( ) throws Throwable {
saveImage ( ) ;
}
private void saveImage ( ) throws Throwable {
int [ ] data = new int [ WIDTH * HEIGHT ] ;
for ( int y = 0 , k = 0 ; y < HEIGHT ; y++ ) {
for ( int x = 0 ; x < WIDTH ; x++ , k++ ) {
int value = 0 ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
int intensity = ( int ) Math.round ( 255
* Math.pow ( pixels [ y ] [ x ] [ i ]
* INVERSE_SAMPLES , INVERSE_GAMMA ) ) ;
if ( intensity < 0 ) {
intensity = 0 ;
} else if ( intensity > 255 ) {
intensity = 255 ;
}
value <<= 8 ;
value |= intensity ;
}
data [ k ] = value ;
}
}
Buffered Image image = new BufferedImage (
WIDTH , HEIGHT , BufferedImage .
TYPE_INT_RGB ) ;
image.setRGB
( 0 , 0 , WIDTH , HEIGHT , data , 0 , WIDTH ) ;
ImageIO.write ( image , IMAGE_TYPE , new File ( OUTPUT_FILE ) ) ;
}
public static void main ( String ... args ) throws
Throwable {
long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis () ;
Main main = new Main ( ) ;
main.launch ( ) ;
long interval = System.currentTimeMillis () - startTime ;
long hours = interval / HOUR_MILLIS ;
interval %= HOUR_MILLIS ;
long minutes = interval / MINUTE_MILLIS ;
interval %= MINUTE_MILLIS ;
long seconds = interval / SECOND_MILLIS ;
interval %= SECOND_MILLIS ;
System.out.format ( " %d hour %s , %d minute %s , %d second %s , %d millisecond %s %n " ,
hours , hours == 1 ? " " : " s " ,
minutes , minutes == 1 ? " " : " s " ,
seconds , seconds == 1 ? " " : " s " ,
interval , interval == 1 ? " " : " s " ) ;
}
}
0 hours , 0 minutes , 0 seconds , 191 milliseconds

As you can see , it stores an all black image .
The main method contains code that outputs the rendering time ( ray tracing is a slow process ) .
The pixels array will store the RGB values of each pixel in the image as it is rendered .
Each color intensity component is in the range of 0.0 ( darkest ) to 1.0 ( lightest ) .
However , to compute the color value of a pixel , the code will statistically sample that part of the 3D scene a specified number of times ( the constant SAMPLES ) and it will average the samples together .
The pixels array stores the sum of all the samples for each pixel .
The saveImage method divides by the number of samples to convert the sum into an average .
For saving , the pixels array is temporarily converted into a Buffered Image .
The BufferedImage.setRGB method expects an integer array where color intensities are in the range of 0 to 255 .
Unfortunately , we cannot simply multiply the pixels array values by 255 because the relationship between them is not linear .
The actual brightness of a monitor pixel increases exponentially with the size of that integer value by a power of a constant called gamma ( typically 2.2 on PCs and 1.8 on Macs ) .
To compensate , the pixels array values are raised to the inverse of gamma before multiplying .
Step 3
To push this machine to the max , I added code to render in parallel executing threads .
private int runningCount ;
private int rowIndex ;
public void launch ( ) throws Throwable {
int processors = Runtime.getRuntime ( ) .availableProcessors () ;
updateRunningCount ( processors ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < processors ; i++ ) {
new Thread ( Integer.toString ( i ) ) {
@ Override
public void run ( ) {
render ( ) ;
updateRunningCount ( - 1 ) ;
}
} .start ( ) ;
}
synchronized ( this ) {
while ( runningCount != 0 ) {
wait ( ) ;
}
}
saveImage ( ) ;
}
private void render ( ) {
while ( true ) {
int y = getNextRowIndex ( ) ;
if ( y >= HEIGHT ) {
return ;
}
for ( int x = 0 ; x < WIDTH ; x++ ) {
}
}
}
private synchronized void updateRunningCount ( int dx ) {
runningCount += dx ;
if ( runningCount == 0 ) {
notifyAll ( ) ;
}
}
private synchronized int getNextRowIndex ( ) {
return rowIndex ++;
}
This is a Dell Studio XPS 435T with an Intel Core i7 CPU 920 at 2.67 GHz with 64 - bit Vista . Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors ( ) returns 8 and I confirmed that it takes 8 threads before the Task Manager reports 100 % CPU usage .
Each thread will work on separate rows of the image .
The getNextRowIndex method returns the next row of the image yet to be rendered .
Step 4
I decided it would be nice to see the output as it is slowly generated .
To make that happen , I created a panel capable of displaying images .
import java.awt .*;
import javax.swing .*;
import java.awt.image .*;
public class ImagePanel extends JPanel {
private Buffered Image image ;
public ImagePanel ( Buffered Image image ) {
this .image = image ;
setPreferredSize ( new Dimension ( image.getWidth ( ) , image.getHeight ( ) ) ) ;
}
@ Override
protected void paintComponent ( Graphics g ) {
g.drawImage ( image , 0 , 0 , this ) ;
}
}
Next , I created a frame to display the panel .
The constructor captures a BufferedImage and calling the imageUpdated method forces it to repaint .
import java.awt .*;
import javax.swing .*;
import java.awt.image .*;
public class RenderFrame extends JFrame {
private ImagePanel imagePanel ;
public RenderFrame ( Buffered Image image ) {
setTitle ( " Amiga Juggler " ) ;
setContentPane ( imagePanel = new ImagePanel ( image ) ) ;
setDefaultCloseOperation ( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE
) ;
setResizable ( false ) ;
pack ( ) ;
setLocationRelativeTo ( null ) ;
setVisible ( true ) ;
}
public void imageUpdated ( ) {
EventQueue.invokeLater ( new Runnable ( ) {
@ Override
public void run ( ) {
imagePanel.repaint () ;
}
} ) ;
}
@ Override
public void setTitle ( final String title ) {
EventQueue.invokeLater ( new Runnable ( ) {
@ Override
public void run ( ) {
RenderFrame .
super .setTitle ( title ) ;
}
} ) ;
}
}
To support the frame , I had to move some stuff around .
There is no longer a global pixels array .
Instead , the render method allocates an int array representing color intensities of a single row with RGB values compatible with Buffered Image .
The render method does the conversion itself from double intensities to int intensities by dividing by the number of samples to compute the average , applying gamma correction and then multiplying by 255 .
When it finishes rendering a row , it invokes rowCompleted .
That method updates the BufferedImage and it forces the RenderFrame to repaint .

To test it out , the inner loop in the render method contains code to slowly set pixels red .
Step 5
The virtual camera is based on the camera obscura and the pinhole camera .
Surprisingly , a real camera does not actually need a lens to function .
A pinhole - sized aperture ensures that each spot on the film is only exposed to light arriving from one particular direction .
Unfortunately , in the real world , the smaller the aperture , the longer the exposure time .
Instead of putting virtual film behind the pinhole , a virtual screen is placed in front of it .
Geometrically , it works the same way .
Rather than a pinhole , consider it as the pupil of a virtual eye staring at the center of the virtual screen .
The ray tracer will follow the pathway of light backwards from the eye , through the virtual screen and out into the scene .
In this way , the virtual screen acts like a window .
Each pixel in the image has a corresponding point on the virtual screen in 3D space .
Before it can cast a ray out into the scene , it has to figure out the direction of the ray .
I should mention that the coordinate system used looks like this :
The position and the orientation of the virtual screen is determined by 3 things : the location of the eye , e ; a point that the eye is looking at , l ; and , the distance , D , between the eye and the center of the virtual screen , c .
We need to construct an orthonormal basis ( ONB ) situated at the center of the screen , c .
The unit vectors , u , v and w , are perpendicular to each other .
Collectively , the point c and the ONB define a right - handed coordinate system .
The point c acts like the origin .
The vector u serves as the x-axis of the virtual screen .
The vector v acts as the y - axis of the virtual screen .
And , the vector w points toward the eye .
If you had some point p = ( a , b , e ) and you wanted to know where it was located in that coordinate system , you could position it using a variation of the ray equation .
In our case , p represents a point on the virtual screen ; so , e = 0 .
For the general case , I added 2 new methods to the Vec utility class .
// p = o + p [ 0 ] u + p [ 1 ] v + p [ 2 ] w
public static void transform (
double [ ] p , double [ ] o , double [ ] u , double [ ] v , double [ ] w ) {
double x = o [ 0 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 0 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 0 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 0 ] ;
double y = o [ 1 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 1 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 1 ] ;
double z = o [ 2 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 2 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 2 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 2 ] ;
p [ 0 ] = x ;
p [ 1 ] = y ;
p [ 2 ] = z ;
}
// q = o + p [ 0 ] u + p [ 1 ] v + p [ 2 ] w
public static void transform (
double [ ] q , double [ ] p , double [ ] o , double [ ] u , double [ ] v , double [ ] w ) {
double x = o [ 0 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 0 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 0 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 0 ] ;
double y = o [ 1 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 1 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 1 ] ;
double z = o [ 2 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 2 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 2 ] + p [ 2 ] * w [ 2 ] ;
q [ 0 ] = x ;
q [ 1 ] = y ;
q [ 2 ] = z ;
}
The unit vector w is the easiest of the 3 to obtain :
The formula inspired this addition to the Vec utility :
// v = ( head - tail ) / | head - tail |
public static void constructUnitVector (
double [ ] v , double [ ] head , double [ ] tail ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
v [ i ] = head [ i ] - tail [ i ] ;
}
double s = 1.0 / Math.sqrt ( v [ 0 ] * v [ 0 ] + v [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] + v [ 2 ] * v [ 2 ] ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
v [ i ] = v [ i ] * s ;
}
}
There is already a subtract method to construct a non - unit vector from 2 point vectors .
Now that we have w , we can find c by starting at e and traveling a distance of − D along w using the ray equation ( w points toward the e ) .
On the picture of the virtual screen above , observe points r and s. Imagine that the virtual screen were a camera that you were holding with your hands over r and s .
You can rotate around ( shoot the photo in any direction ) and you can tilt the camera upwards and downwards .
But , you would typically keep the line between r and s level .
In this way , when you take the picture , the horizon will be parallel to the bottom of the photograph .
Rarely do you roll the camera because it produces strange photographs .
Well construct the remainder of the ONB with the assumption that there is no roll .
If you do need to roll the virtual camera , you can rotate u and v around w after the ONB is fully constructed .
No camera roll is used in this project .
If there is no roll , then u is perpendicular to the normal of the ground plane that the juggler stands on , n = ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) .
And , by the definition of the ONB , u is also perpendicular to w .
Hence , we can find u using :
Again from the definition of the ONB , we can now solve for v .
You can verify that applying cross products in this sequence does produce a right - handed coordinate system .
There is only 1 catch with the above construction :
If w is parallel to the ground normal , n , then taking the cross product produces a null vector .
Meaning , if you are looking straight up or straight down , then it will fail .
But , it s clear what u and v should be in those cases .
I added these methods to Vec :
public static final double TINY = 1e - 9 ;
// a == b
public static boolean equals ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
if ( Math.abs ( a [ i ] - b [ i ] ) > TINY ) {
return false ;
}
}
return true ;
}
// v == ( x , y , z )
public static boolean equals ( double [ ] v , double x , double y , double z ) {
return Math.abs ( v [ 0 ] - x ) <= TINY
&& Math.abs ( v [ 1 ] - y ) <= TINY
&& Math.abs ( v [ 2 ] - z ) <= TINY ;
}
// w -> u , v
public static void onb ( double [ ] u , double [ ] v , double [ ] w ) {
if ( equals ( w , 0 , 1 , 0 ) ) {
assign ( u , 1 , 0 , 0 ) ;
assign ( v , 0 , 0 , - 1 ) ;
} else if ( equals ( w , 0 , - 1 , 0 ) ) {
assign ( u , 1 , 0 , 0 ) ;
assign ( v , 0 , 0 , 1 ) ;
} else {
assign ( u , w [ 2 ] , 0 , -w [ 0 ] ) ;
cross ( v , w , u ) ;
}
}
The input of the onb method is w and the output is u and v .
Putting it all together , I added this to the top of the render method :
double [ ] u = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] v = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] w = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] c = new double [ 3 ] ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( w , EYE , LOOK ) ;
Vec.ray ( c , EYE , w , - DISTANCE_TO_VIRTUAL_SCREEN
) ;
Vec.onb ( u , v , w ) ;
Step 6
We normally think of addressing pixels in an image or on the screen in terms of row and column index .
The upper - left corner is origin and the y - axis points downwards .
Consider this 4×4 image :
The width and height are 4 , but we use the indices 0 to 3 ( inclusive ) .
Instead of row and column indices , consider the upper - left corner of each pixel as the origin of that pixel .
For instance , the upper - left corner of the lower - rightmost pixel is ( 3 , 3 ) .
The lower - right corner of that pixel is ( 4 , 4 ) .
In this way , it is possible to refer to points anywhere on the image , even within pixels .
Now , consider some arbitrary point on the image that we want to find the equivalent point in 3D space on the virtual screen .
The image has a width and height of W and H respectively .
First , without modifying the image , Ill move the origin to the lower - left and Ill reverse the direction of the y - axis .
To address the same point on the image , the coordinates need to change to :
Again , without modifying the image , Ill move the origin to the center of the image and adjust the points coordinates to compensate .
Now , lets assume that the virtual screen has the same aspect ratio as the image .
Well specify the width of the virtual screen as a constant in the program .
For this discussion , Ill refer to the virtual screen width as A and the virtual screen height as B .
That gives us a way to find the virtual screen height :
If we had some arbitrary point ( x , y ) in the image aspect ratio and we needed to convert it to the virtual screen aspect ratio , we could accomplish the conversion with this :
Combining the last 2 concepts leaves us with this :
Finally , we have a way to transform some arbitrary 2D point ( a , b ) on the image to a 3D point on the virtual screen .
That formula inspired these additions to Vec :
// p = o + p [ 0 ] u + p [ 1 ]
v
public static void map (
double [ ] p , double [ ] o , double [ ] u , double [ ] v ) {
double x = o [ 0 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 0 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 0 ] ;
double y = o [ 1 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 1 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] ;
double z = o [ 2 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 2 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 2 ] ;
p [ 0 ] = x ;
p [ 1 ] = y ;
p [ 2 ] = z ;
}
// q = o + p [ 0 ] u + p [ 1 ]
v
public static void map (
double [ ] q , double [ ] p , double [ ] o , double [ ] u , double [ ] v ) {
double x = o [ 0 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 0 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 0 ] ;
double y = o [ 1 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 1 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 1 ] ;
double z = o [ 2 ] + p [ 0 ] * u [ 2 ] + p [ 1 ] * v [ 2 ] ;
q [ 0 ] = x ;
q [ 1 ] = y ;
q [ 2 ] = z ;
}
// q = o + x u + y v
public static void map (
double [ ] q , double [ ] o , double [ ] u , double [ ] v , double x , double y ) {
double i = o [ 0 ] + x * u [ 0 ] + y * v [ 0 ] ;
double j = o [ 1 ] + x * u [ 1 ] + y * v [ 1 ] ;
double k = o [ 2 ] + x * u [ 2 ] + y * v [ 2 ] ;
q [ 0 ] = i ;
q [ 1 ] = j ;
q [ 2 ] = k ;
}
Since the point , p , on the virtual screen is known , we can finally compute the direction of the ray , d :
Step 7
As mentioned above , the ray tracer will fire several rays through each pixel at slightly different coordinates to sample the 3D scene and then it will assign that pixel to the average of the results .
To accomplish this , an image pixel is uniformly divided into a grid .
Within each grid cell , a random point is chosen .
This is known as jittered sampling .
There are superior sampling techniques , but this technique works well enough and its easy to code .
Below is an example of a sampled image pixel .
Generating pseudorandom values may be a computationally expensive operation .
To guard against that possibility , I created a utility class that stores a large cache of random values .
public class RandomDoubles {
private static volatile double [ ] values ;
private int index ;
public RandomDoubles ( ) {
synchronized ( RandomDoubles . class ) {
if ( values == null ) {
values = new double [ 70001 ] ;
for ( int i = values .
length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i-- ) {
values [ i ] = Math.random ( ) ;
}
}
index = ( int ) ( Math.random ( ) * values.length ) ;
}
}
public double random ( ) {
if ( index >= values.length ) {
index = 0 ;
}
return values [ index ++ ] ;
}
}
The cache is initialized when the first instance of RandomDoubles is created .
70001 is a prime number .
I chose a prime to reduce the chances of strange patterns from showing up in the output image as a consequence of cyclically using the same set of random values .
Here is the render method after introducing random sampling :
private void render ( ) {
double [ ] u = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] v = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] w = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] c = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] p = new double [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] d = new double [ 3 ] ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( w , EYE , LOOK ) ;
Vec.ray ( c , EYE , w , - DISTANCE_TO_VIRTUAL_SCREEN
) ;
Vec.onb ( u , v , w ) ;
RandomDoubles randomDoubles = new RandomDoubles ( ) ;
int [ ] pixels = new int [ WIDTH ] ;
double [ ] pixel = new double [ 3 ] ;
while ( true ) {
int y = getNextRowIndex ( ) ;
if ( y >= HEIGHT ) {
return ;
}
for ( int x = 0 ; x < WIDTH ; x++ ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < SQRT_SAMPLES ; i++ ) {
double b = y + INVERSE_SQRT_SAMPLES
* i ;
if ( SQRT_SAMPLES == 1 ) {
b += 0.5 ;
} else {
b += randomDoubles.random ( ) ;
}
b = VIRTUAL_SCREEN_RATIO
* ( HALF_HEIGHT - b ) ;
for ( int j = 0 ; j < SQRT_SAMPLES ; j++ ) {
double a = x + INVERSE_SQRT_SAMPLES
* j ;
if ( SQRT_SAMPLES == 1 ) {
a += 0.5 ;
} else {
a += randomDoubles.random ( ) ;
}
a = VIRTUAL_SCREEN_RATIO * ( a - HALF_WIDTH ) ;
Vec.map ( p , EYE , u , v , a , b ) ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( d , p , EYE ) ;
// ... USE d ...
}
}
int value = 0 ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
int intensity = ( int ) Math.round ( 255
* Math.pow ( pixel [ i ]
* INVERSE_SAMPLES , INVERSE_GAMMA ) ) ;
if ( intensity < 0 ) {
intensity = 0 ;
} else if ( intensity > 255 ) {
intensity = 255 ;
}
value <<= 8 ;
value |= intensity ;
}
pixels [ x ] = value ;
}
rowCompleted ( y , pixels ) ;
}
}
The square - root of the number of samples , SQRT_SAMPLES , can be increased to improve image quality .
Notice that when it is 1 , instead of using a random sample , the sample is taken in the center of the pixel .
Step 8
The juggling robot is constructed entirely out of spheres .
The sky also appears to be a hemisphere .
So , it is pertinent to work out how to intersect a ray and a sphere .
Below , a sphere of radius R is centered about p. A ray originating from o , fired in direction d , strikes the sphere at some point ( x , y , z ) .
Now we have the amount of time it takes for the ray to reach a sphere from the virtual eye .
We will apply this formula to every sphere in the scene .
If the value within the square - root is negative , then the ray does not intersect the sphere .
Of the ones that do intersect , the one with the minimal time is the one that we see .
Well almost .
If a sphere is behind the eye , this formula will output a negative time value .
Intersection only took place if time is positive .
We actually need to constrain time a bit more .
The eye is not the only point that we will be casting rays from .
For example , when a ray bounces off one of the mirrored spheres , we will cast a new ray off its surface .
To prevent the possibility of intersection between a ray and a surface that emitted the ray , we need to make sure that time is greater than a tiny positive value that well call epsilon .
Also , we need to make sure that time is smaller than some max value .
For example , to determine if a surface is illuminated , well cast a ray back to a light source .
In that case , time can not be greater than the time it takes to reach the light source .
Any intersections that occur beyond the source of light cannot be considered .
Once we locate the intersection with minimal time , well compute the color of the hit point using Phong Shading .
Phong Shading takes into account the following vectors :
All of the vectors are unit vectors .
The vector d is the direction of the incident ray .
The negation of d points back to the rays origin , back to the virtual eye .
The vector n is the surface normal .
In case of a sphere , it is the vector between the hit point and the center of the sphere , normalized .
However , it is possible that we may need to negate the normal to face the viewer .
The angle between n and −d must be less - than - or - equal - to 90 degrees .
Meaning , if n dot d is positive , then we reverse the normal .
The sky is a good example of this .
It is the interior surface of a hemisphere and the normal must point inwards .
The vector l is a unit vector pointing toward a light source .
And , finally , the vector r is the mirror reflection of the vector l .
It represents light originating from the light source and bouncing off of the surface .
Since Phong
Shading uses a mirror reflection vector , lets consider bouncing a ray off of one of the mirror spheres .
Below , a ray traveling in direction d strikes a surface at point h with normal n and then it reflects in direction r.
Vector p is the projection of −d onto n ( vector projection was illustrated in step 1 ) .
But , for Phong Shading , vector l actually points toward the light source ; its in the opposite direction that the light ray travels .
If we negate the ray direction , we end up with :
Note , if l dot n < 0 ( greater than 90 degrees ) , then the light source is on the opposite side of the surface and none of its light reaches the side that we are viewing .
Also , we need to cast a ray back to the light source to determine if there are any objects in the way .
If the path to the light source is interrupted , then the surface is in shadow and only ambient light comes into play .
Finally , to shade the surface , we apply the Phong reflection model .
L represents radiance .
We need to apply this formula 3 times , once for each RGB color intensity component .
There is only one light source in this project .
If there were multiple light sources , we would have to apply it to each of them and add them together .
There are 2 dot products in the formula .
If one of them returns a negative value , change it to 0 .
Meaning , if the light source and the normal are on opposite sides , then the light does not contribute to the color of the surface .
And , if the reflected light ray cannot be viewed seen , then it does not contribute to the color either .
The 4 terms represent ambient , diffuse , specular and reflected light .
Each term is weighted by a k constant that is typically between 0 and 1 .
Collectively , the constants enable you to change the behavior of the surface .
k a :
The ambient reflection constant considers light arriving at the surface from all directions as opposed to some specified light source .
: The ambient reflection constant considers light arriving at the surface from all directions as opposed to some specified light source .
c d :
The diffuse color is the color of the surface if the light source were directly over it ( n dot l = 1 ) .
: The diffuse color is the color of the surface if the light source were directly over it ( dot = 1 ) .
l s :
This is a radiance scaling factor .
This allows you to scale the resulting sum .
: This is a radiance scaling factor .
This allows you to scale the resulting sum .
c a :
This is the color of the ambient surrounding light .
It s typically just white .
: This is the color of the ambient surrounding light .

k d :
The diffuse reflection constant considers the diffuse color of the surface and the angle between the surface normal and a light source .
: The diffuse reflection constant considers the diffuse color of the surface and the angle between the surface normal and a light source .
c l :
This is the color of the light source .
: This is the color of the light source .
k s :
The specular reflection constant determines the strength of the highlights .
: The specular reflection constant determines the strength of the highlights .
e :
When the shininess constant is large , the specular highlight is small .
c s :
This is the color of the specular highlight .
If you set this to c d , it produces a metallic - like surface .
: This is the color of the specular highlight .
If you set this to c , it produces a metallic - like surface .
k r :
The reflection constant adjusts the strength of the reflected ray .
: The reflection constant adjusts the strength of the reflected ray .
c r :
The reflection color filters the reflected ray .
: The reflection color filters the reflected ray .
L 1 : This is the radiance of the reflected ray computed by recursively applying the overall formula once again .
I created a class to describe the material of a surface .
public class Material {
public double ambientWeight ;
public double diffuseWeight ;
public double specularWeight ;
public double reflectionWeight ;
public double shininess ;
public double [ ] diffuseColor ;
public double [ ] highlightColor ;
public double [ ] reflectionColor ;
public Material (
double ambientWeight ,
double diffuseWeight ,
double specularWeight ,
double reflectionWeight ,
double shininess ,
double [ ] diffuseColor ,
double [ ] highlightColor ,
double [ ] reflectionColor ) {
this .ambientWeight = ambientWeight ;
this .diffuseWeight = diffuseWeight ;
this .specularWeight = specularWeight ;
this .reflectionWeight = reflectionWeight ;
this . shininess = shininess ;
this .diffuseColor = diffuseColor ;
this .highlightColor = highlightColor ;
this .reflectionColor = reflectionColor ;
}
}
Next , I created a class to house different types of materials .
Right now , there is only red plastic .
It s a bright red material that has a white specular highlight .
public final class Materials {
private Materials ( ) {
}
public static final Material RED_PLASTIC
= new Material (
0.1 ,
2.0 ,
1.0 ,
0.0 ,
10.0 ,
new double [ ]
{ 1 , 0 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 1 , 1 , 1 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 }
) ;
}
For ray - object intersection , I created an object called Intersection that represents the result .
It contains the hit time , the hit point , the surface normal and the surface material at the hit point .
public class Intersection {
public double time ;
public double [ ] hit = new double [ 3 ] ;
public double [ ] normal = new double [ 3 ] ;
public Material material ;
}
3D objects in the scene are represented by the following interface :
public interface IObject {
public boolean intersect (
double [ ] o , double [ ] d , boolean primaryRay , double maxTime ,
double [ ] [ ] temps ,
Intersection intersection ) ;
}
The intersect method returns true if the ray intersects the 3D object .
If the primary Ray parameter is set to true , then additional information about the intersection will be stored in the intersection parameter .
The parameters o and d are the origin and direction of the ray respectively .
The maxTime parameter is the intersection time upper - bound .
The epsilon lower - bound constant is defined in Main .
Finally , the temps parameter are temporary vectors that can be used during the intersection calculation .
The render method passes in 16 of them .
Here is an implementation using the ray - sphere intersection formula from above .
Notice that if primaryRay is not set to true , it does not bother to compute the hit point and the surface normal .
When casting shadow rays and when casting ambient occlusion rays , we only care about the return value .
public class Sphere implements IObject {
public double [ ] center = new double [ 3 ] ;
public double radius = 1 ;
public Material material ;
public Sphere (
double x , double y , double z , double radius , Material material ) {
Vec.assign ( center , x , y , z ) ;
this .radius = radius ;
this .material = material ;
}
public boolean intersect (
double [ ] o , double [ ] d , boolean primaryRay , double maxTime ,
double [ ] [ ] temps ,
Intersection intersection ) {
Vec.subtract ( temps [ 0 ] , o , center ) ;
double B = 2.0 * Vec.dot ( d , temps [ 0 ] ) ;
double C = Vec.magnitude2 ( temps [ 0 ] ) - radius * radius ;
double square = B * B - 4 * C ;
if ( square >= 0 ) {
double sqrt = Math.sqrt ( square ) ;
double t1 = 0.5 * ( - B - sqrt ) ;
double t2 = 0.5 * ( - B + sqrt ) ;
boolean intersected = false ;
if ( t1 >= Main .
EPSILON && t1 <= maxTime ) {
intersected = true ;
intersection .time = t1 ;
} else if ( t2 >= Main .
EPSILON && t2 < maxTime ) {
intersected = true ;
intersection .time = t2 ;
}
if ( primaryRay && intersected ) {
Vec.ray ( intersection .hit , o , d , intersection .
time ) ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( intersection.normal , intersection .hit , center ) ;
intersection .
material = material ;
}
if ( intersected ) {
return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
}
Finally , I updated the render method using the Phong Shading model and I tested it with a scene containing a single sphere .
private volatile IObject [ ] scene

If you study the code , youll notice that I did not plug in the reflection term of the Phong Shading model yet .
Step 9
The ground is a checkerboard covered plane .
Below is a plane containing point p with a surface normal of n .
The point ( x , y , z ) is some other point on the plane .
Note that the vector between that point and p is perpendicular to n .
Since those vectors are perpendicular , we can take advantage of dot product to derive the equation for the plane .
But , for this project , the ground is just the xz-plane .
Meaning , p = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and n = ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) .
That leaves us with just y = 0 .
Nevertheless , we can still derive the generic equation for ray - plane intersection .
Our case is a little simpler :
Above , y = 0 , simplifying it further .
Below is an aerial view of the xz-plane looking straight down the y - axis .
The checkerboard consists of squares with side length s.
For some point on a square , if we divide each coordinate by s and then floor it , we get a pair of integer coordinates of the upper - left corner of the square .
Notice that diagonals always have the same color .
We can represent diagonals going from the lower - left to the upper - right by the following equation where t and a are integers .
Above , a is the z-intercept .
Adjusting it affects where the diagonal line crosses the z -axis .
If we add the components together , we get :
2t is an even number .
Even plus even is even and even plus odd is odd .
The parity ( even /odd ) of the sum is completely determined by a .
This means we can determine the color of any point on the plane by dividing each coordinate component by s , flooring them and adding the resulting integer components together .
The parity of the sum determines the color .
Based off the above discussion , I created the Ground :
public class Ground implements IObject {
public double squareSize ;
public double inverseSquareSize ;
public Material material1 ;
public Material material2 ;
public Ground ( double squareSide , Material material1 , Material material2 ) {
this .squareSize = squareSide ;
this .material1 = material1 ;
this .material2 = material2 ;
inverseSquareSize = 1.0 / squareSize ;
}
public boolean intersect ( double [ ] o , double [ ] d , boolean primaryRay ,
double maxTime , double [ ] [ ] temps , Intersection intersection ) {
if ( d [ 1 ] == 0 ) {
return false ;
}
intersection .time = -o [ 1 ] / d [ 1 ] ;
if ( intersection .
time >= Main.EPSILON && intersection .time <= maxTime ) {
if ( !primaryRay ) {
return true ;
}
Vec.assign ( intersection .hit , o [ 0 ] + d [ 0 ] * intersection .time , 0 ,
o [ 2 ] + d [ 2 ] * intersection .time ) ;
Vec.assign ( intersection.normal , 0 , 1 , 0 ) ;
long a = ( ( long ) Math.floor ( intersection .hit [ 0 ] * inverseSquareSize ) ) & 1 ;
long b = ( ( long ) Math.floor ( intersection .hit [ 2 ] * inverseSquareSize ) ) & 1 ;
intersection .material = ( (( a + b ) & 1 ) == 0 ) ?
material1 : material2 ;
return true ;
}
return false ;
}
}
I was worried that the sum of the floors might cause the long to overflow ; so , I and - ed it with 1 to keep only the least - significant bit .
The sum of those bits is all that matters in determining the parity of the sum .
I added 2 matte materials ( materials without specular highlights and without reflections ) to the Materials collection .
public static final Material GREEN_MATTE = new Material (
0.1 ,
2.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 1 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 }
) ;
public static final Material YELLOW_MATTE = new Material (
0.1 ,
2.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
new double [ ]
{ 1 , 1 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 }
) ;
Finally , I created a scene containing the ground to test it out .
Below is the result with 256 samples per pixel .
0 hours , 0 minutes , 3 seconds , 244 milliseconds

Step 10
As mentioned above , the juggler lives under a giant dome also known as the sky .
To generate the sky , I first updated the Materials class to make it easier to define materials .
public final class Materials {
private Materials ( ) {
}
public static final Material RED_PLASTIC
= createPlastic ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) ;
public static final Material BLUE_MATTE = createMatte ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) ;
public static final Material GREEN_MATTE = createMatte ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ;
public static final Material YELLOW_MATTE = createMatte ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) ;
public static Material createPlastic ( double ... color ) {
return new Material (
0.1 ,
2.0 ,
1.0 ,
0.0 ,
10.0 ,
color ,
new double [ ]
{ 1 , 1 , 1 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 }
) ;
}
public static Material createMatte ( double ... color ) {
return new Material (
0.1 ,
2.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
0.0 ,
color ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 } ,
new double [ ]
{ 0 , 0 , 0 }
) ;
}
}
Next , I defined this scene in Main :
private volatile IObject [ ] scene = {
new Ground ( 25 , Materials .
GREEN_MATTE , Materials .
YELLOW_MATTE ) ,
new Sphere ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 E6 , Materials .
BLUE_MATTE )
} ;
Heres the result ( 256 samples per pixel ) :
0 hours , 0 minutes , 5 seconds , 959 milliseconds
source
Step 11
I added a white matte material to Materials and then I defined a scene consisting of the ground , the sky and a sphere .
private volatile IObject [ ] scene = {
new Ground ( 25 , Materials .
WHITE_MATTE , Materials .
WHITE_MATTE ) ,
new Sphere ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 E6 , Materials .
WHITE_MATTE ) ,
new Sphere ( 0 , 50 , 0 , 50 , Materials .
WHITE_MATTE )
} ;
Here is the result :
The shadow on the ground is exactly the same color as the dark side of the sphere .
Consequentially , there is no visual indication of where one ends and the other begins .
This effect is the result of the Phong Shading model .
It says if the light source cannot reach a surface , then the surface is colored based off ambient light resulting in a uniform dark color .
Well enhance the image using ambient occlusion .
Ambient occlusion estimates the amount of ambient light reaching a surface by firing random rays off of the surface originating from the hit point .
If the random ray strikes an object within some threshold distance , then there is no ambient light coming from that direction .
The possible random rays exist within a hemisphere around the surface normal .
Similar to RandomDoubles , I created a class called RandomRays .
It pre-calculates a large number of random unit vectors .
public class RandomRays {
private static volatile double [ ] [ ] rays ;
private int index ;
public RandomRays ( ) {
synchronized ( RandomRays . class ) {
if ( rays == null ) {
rays = new double [ 24001 ] [ 3 ] ;
for ( int i = rays .
length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i-- ) {
do {
for ( int j = 0 ; j < 3 ; j++ ) {
rays [ i ] [ j ] = 2.0 * Math.random () - 1.0 ;
}
} while ( Vec.magnitude2 ( rays [ i ] ) > 1.0 ) ;
Vec.normalize ( rays [ i ] ) ;
}
}
index = ( int ) ( Math.random ( ) * rays.length ) ;
}
}
public void randomRay ( double [ ] ray ) {
if ( index >= rays.length ) {
index = 0 ;
}
Vec.assign ( ray , rays [ index ++ ] ) ;
}
}
To generate the random unit vectors in a uniform way , the inner loop creates a random vector within a within a cube bounded between ( −1 , −1 , − 1 ) – ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) .
A unit sphere fits snuggly within the cube .
If the vector is outside of the unit sphere , it is thrown away .
Otherwise , it is normalized , extending it to the surface of the unit sphere .
Next , the Material object was modified to include an ambientOcclusionPercent field .
This is the percentage ( 0 to 1 ) of the ambient term for which well apply the occlusion test .
If the hit point is fully occluded , well still give it a bit of ambient light equal to 1 minus that field .
public class Material {
public double ambientWeight ;
public double ambientOcclusionPercent ;
public double diffuseWeight ;
public double specularWeight ;
public double reflectionWeight ;
public double shininess ;
public double [ ] diffuseColor ;
public double [ ] highlightColor ;
public double [ ] reflectionColor ;
public Material (
double ambientWeight ,
double ambientOcclusionPercent ,
double diffuseWeight ,
double specularWeight ,
double reflectionWeight ,
double shininess ,
double [ ] diffuseColor ,
double [ ] highlightColor ,
double [ ] reflectionColor ) {
this .ambientWeight = ambientWeight ;
this .ambientOcclusionPercent = ambientOcclusionPercent ;
this .diffuseWeight = diffuseWeight ;
this .specularWeight = specularWeight ;
this .reflectionWeight = reflectionWeight ;
this . shininess = shininess ;
this .diffuseColor = diffuseColor ;
this .highlightColor = highlightColor ;
this .reflectionColor = reflectionColor ;
}
}
The render method will not fire multiple occlusion rays off of the hit point .
Instead , for each pixel sample , it will fire only 1 .
That means that the number of pixel samples needs to be large to enable many occlusion tests to average out .
I added a boolean constant to Main turn on / off ambient occlusion .
For test images , Ill shut it off when the number of samples is below some threshold .
The occlusion test ray needs to be within a hemisphere around the surface normal .
This is accomplished by computing the dot product between the normal and the random occlusion ray .
If the dot product is negative , then the occlusion ray is negated forcing the angle between the normal and the occlusion ray to be less - than 90 .
if ( hit ) {
if ( Vec.dot ( bestIntersection.normal , d ) >= 0 ) {
Vec.negate ( bestIntersection.normal ) ;
}
if ( bestIntersection.material.ambientWeight > 0 ) {
double ambientPercent = 1.0 ;
if ( AMBIENT_OCCLUSION
&& bestIntersection.material.ambientOcclusionPercent > 0 ) {
randomRays.randomRay ( ar ) ;
if ( Vec.dot ( ar , bestIntersection.normal ) < 0 ) {
Vec.negate ( ar ) ;
}
for ( int k = scene .
length - 1 ; k >= 0 ; k-- ) {
IObject object = scene [ k ] ;
if ( object.
intersect ( bestIntersection .hit , ar , false ,
MAX_OCCLUSION_DISTANCE , temps , tempIntersection ) ) {
ambientPercent = 1.0
- bestIntersection.material.ambientOcclusionPercent ;
break ;
}
}
}
for ( int k = 0 ; k < 3 ; k++ ) {
pixel [ k ] += bestIntersection.material.ambientWeight
* bestIntersection.material.diffuseColor [ k ]
* RADIANCE_SCALE
* AMBIENT_COLOR [ k ]
* ambientPercent ;
}
}

Step 12
The shadows currently have hard edges .
This is because the light originates from a point - source .
To alleviate that situation , well use a spherical light source .
I added a constant , LIGHT_RADIUS , to Main that specifies the radius of our single light source .
I modified the render method to pick a random point on the sphere .
That point will act as a point - light - source for the pixel sample .
In the average , we will get the effect of a spherical light source .
The random point needs to be on the hemisphere around the vector defined between the hit point and the light center point .
Similar to what was done for ambient occlusion , if the dot product between that vector and the random vector is negative , the random vector is negated .
if ( LIGHT_RADIUS > 0 ) {
Vec.subtract ( l2 , bestIntersection.hit , LIGHT ) ;
randomRays.randomRay ( l ) ;
if ( Vec.dot ( l , l2 ) < 0 ) {
Vec.negate ( l ) ;
}
Vec.ray ( l , LIGHT , l , LIGHT_RADIUS ) ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( l , bestIntersection .hit ) ;
} else {
Vec.constructUnitVector ( l , LIGHT , bestIntersection.hit ) ;
}
Below you can see the result with 1024 samples per pixel .
The hazy part of the shadow is called the penumbra . 

Heres the same scene , but colorful materials are used :
Step 13
In a typical ray tracer , reflection is generated by recursively applying the Phong Shading formula ( see the fourth term in the sum ) .
When a ray strikes a translucent material , it splits into a reflected ray and a transmitted ray .
Recursion is used to follow those branching rays similar to traversing a tree data structure .
However , in this project , there are no translucent materials , only reflective ones .
The ray never splits .
This means that a for - loop can be used to effectively expand the Phong Shading formula out for a specified number of iterations .
As a first step , I dropped Pi from the Phong Shading diffuse shading term .
This simplifies specifying the constants when creating materials .
Next , I added a method to Materials to make metals .
public static final Material YELLOW_METAL = createMetal ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) ;
public static Material createMetal ( double ... color ) {
return new Material (
0.1 ,
1.0 ,
0.7 ,
1.0 ,
0.2 ,
20.0 ,
color ,
color ,
color
) ;
}
Note that the diffuse , specular and reflective colors are all the same .
Next , I defined a color vector f within the render method to act as a filter .
It is initialized to the radiance scaling factor ( l s in the Phong Shading model ) and I replaced the uses of the radiance scaling factor with the components of f .
Meaning , each term of the Phong Shading model is scaled by f instead of l s .
I modified the render method to apply the Phong Shading formula up to MAX_DEPTH times .
Vec.assign ( f , RADIANCE_SCALE , RADIANCE_SCALE , RADIANCE_SCALE ) ;
reflectionLoop : for ( int m = 0 ; m < MAX_DEPTH ; m++ ) {
At the very bottom of the loop , the code tests if the hit material is reflective .
If not , it breaks out of the loop .
If the material is reflective , the code reduces the values of the filter f in accordance with the Phong Shading model ; it scales them down by the reflection weight and reflection color .
If all 3 components of the filter drop below a specified threshold , then it breaks out of the loop because the filter would wipe out any effect of successive iterations .
Finally , the direction vector is reflected around the surface normal using the formula discussed above .
if ( bestIntersection.material.reflectionWeight > 0 ) {
boolean aboveMinColorIntensity = false ;
for ( int k = 0 ; k < 3 ; k++ ) {
f [ k ]
*= bestIntersection.material.reflectionWeight
* bestIntersection.material.reflectionColor [ k ] ;
if ( f [ k ] >= MIN_COLOR_INTENSITY ) {
aboveMinColorIntensity = true ;
}
}
if ( !aboveMinColorIntensity ) {
break reflectionLoop ;
}
Vec.ray ( d , bestIntersection.normal ,
- 2 * Vec.dot ( bestIntersection.normal , d ) ) ;
} else {
break reflectionLoop ;
}
This reflection loop is nested within the sampling loop .
Meaning , the reflected rays contribute to the same pixel sample .
Here are the results with 256 samples per pixel .
Note that the sphere does not reflect the sky because the reflection color , yellow , does not contain a blue component .
However , yellow does contain a green component ; hence , it is able to reflect both colors of the checkered ground .

To create a mirrored sphere , the ambient and the diffuse weights are set to 0 .
The reflective weight is set to 1 and the reflective color is set to white .
The specular weight should also be set to 0 , but I set it to 0.5 to create a specular highlight on the mirrored sphere .
In the real world , a specular highlight is a blurry reflection of a light source .
On a perfectly mirrored sphere , instead of a specular highlight , you would see a light bulb or the sun .
In fact , the specular term of the Phong Shading model is essentially a hack .
It can be replaced by modifying the reflective term to handle glossy reflections .
A glossy reflection of a glowing object would appear as a specular highlight .
But , for this project , I am not going to implement glossy reflections or glowing objects .
Ill stick with the hack and just add a specular highlight to the mirrored sphere .
Below is a mirror sphere computed with 1024 samples per pixel .

Here is a red metallic sphere , a mirrored sphere and a yellow metallic sphere rendered at 256 samples per pixel .
If you carefully compare the image below against the 2 previous images above , youll notice that there is something slightly wrong with the 2 previous images .
Above , the reflective spheres do not reflect their own shadows .
This is due to a bug that was fixed before generating the image below .
Consider this document as a progress log .
I am writing it in one pass as I develop the code and I failed to notice the problem when I attached the previous images .

Step 14
To simulate motion blur , the scene must be updated between each pixel sample in accordance with the motion occurring in that animation frame .
This animation will consist of 30 frames indexed from 0 to 29 ( inclusive ) , but time will go from 0 to 30 time units where each time unit is 1/30th of a second .
Some arbitrary frame , x , represents the time period x ( inclusive ) to x + 1 ( exclusive ) .
In the timeline below , the vertical lines are points in time .
Below the timeline are the frame indices .
A unit of time needs to be sampled similarly to how a pixel is sampled .
The time unit will be divided by the number of samples and within each division , a random sample will be selected .
Each pixel sample will have an associated time sample from 0 ( inclusive ) to 1 ( exclusive ) .
However , pixel sampling is occurring within each pixel by scanning from left - to - right , top - to - bottom .
I want to make sure that there is no correlation between the pixel sample and the time sample ; that is , I do not want the upper - left corner of a pixel to always have a small time sample and the lower - right corner of a pixel to have a high time sample .
To that end , I created a class called RandomTimes .
After it divides up the unit time and selects random times within each division , it shuffles the order of the samples .
import java.util .*;
public class RandomTimes {
private static volatile double [ ] [ ] times ;
private int index ;
public RandomTimes ( ) {
synchronized ( RandomTimes . class ) {
ArrayList < Double > doubles = new ArrayList < Double > ( ) ;
if ( times == null ) {
times = new double [ 503 ] [ Main .
SAMPLES ] ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < times .
length ; i++ ) {
doubles.clear ( ) ;
for ( int j = 0 ; j < Main.
SAMPLES ; j++ ) {
doubles.add ( Main.INVERSE_SAMPLES
* ( j + Math.random ( ) ) ) ;
}
for ( int j = 0 ; j < Main.
SAMPLES ; j++ ) {
times [ i ] [ j ] = doubles .remove ( ( int ) ( Math.random ( ) * doubles.size ( ) ) ) ;
}
}
}
index = ( int ) ( Math.random ( ) * times.length ) ;
}
}
public double [ ] random ( ) {
if ( index >= times.length ) {
index = 0 ;
}
return times [ index ++ ] ;
}
}
Since each thread will update the scene between casting rays , each thread needs its own copy of the scene .
To generate it , I added a createScene method .
To update the scene , I introduced an updateScene method that takes as parameters : the frame index , the time sample within the frame ( 0 to 1 ) , and the scene to be updated .
As a test , I created a scene containing the ground , the sky and a red metallic sphere .
The updateScene method moves the red metallic sphere linearly based on the time sample .
private IObject [ ] createScene ( ) {
return new IObject [ ] {
new Ground ( 25 , Materials .
YELLOW_MATTE , Materials .
GREEN_MATTE ) ,
new Sphere ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 E6 , Materials .
BLUE_MATTE ) ,
new Sphere ( - 20 , 50 , 0 , 50 , Materials.RED_METAL
) ,
} ;
}
private void updateScene ( int frame , double t , IObject [ ] scene ) {
Sphere sphere = ( Sphere ) scene [ 2 ] ;
sphere.center [ 0 ] = - 20 + 40 * t ;
}
The nested loops within render now looks like this :
while ( true ) {
int y = getNextRowIndex ( ) ;
if ( y >= HEIGHT ) {
return ;
}
for ( int x = 0 ; x < WIDTH ; x++ ) {
Vec.assign ( pixel , 0 , 0 , 0 ) ;
double [ ] times = randomTimes.random ( ) ;
int times Index = 0 ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < SQRT_SAMPLES ; i++ ) {
double b = y + INVERSE_SQRT_SAMPLES
* i ;
if ( SQRT_SAMPLES == 1 ) {
b += 0.5 ;
} else {
b += randomDoubles.random ( ) ;
}
b = VIRTUAL_SCREEN_RATIO
* ( HALF_HEIGHT - b ) ;
for ( int j = 0 ; j < SQRT_SAMPLES ; j++ ) {
double a = x + INVERSE_SQRT_SAMPLES
* j ;
if ( SQRT_SAMPLES == 1 ) {
a += 0.5 ;
} else {
a += randomDoubles.random ( ) ;
}
a = VIRTUAL_SCREEN_RATIO * ( a - HALF_WIDTH ) ;
Vec.map ( p , c , u , v , a , b ) ;
Vec.constructUnitVector ( d , p , EYE ) ;
Vec.assign ( o , EYE ) ;
Vec.assign ( f , RADIANCE_SCALE , RADIANCE_SCALE , RADIANCE_SCALE ) ;
updateScene ( frameIndex , times [ times Index ++ ] , scene ) ;
reflectionLoop : for ( int m = 0 ; m < MAX_DEPTH ; m++ ) {
Above , for each pixel , the code obtains a new set of time samples .
Just before it enters the reflection loop , it updates the scene with a different time sample .
The results look like this ( 256 samples / pixel ) :
0 hours , 0 minutes , 13 seconds , 401 milliseconds

Step 15
Typically , when a person learns to juggle , the first thing he or she picks up is a figure - eight pattern known as the cascade .
But , the Amiga Juggler tosses balls in a circular pattern called the shower . 
The pattern consists of 2 arcs .
It tosses balls on a high arc from his left hand to his right hand .
It returns the balls in a low arc directly below the high arc .
When a ball is tossed from hand - to - hand it follows a ballistic trajectory .
The x and the y components of the trajectory are independent .
The ball moves linearly in the x-direction starting from an initial value of x 0 and travels at a constant rate v 0 .
In this way , the x component is governed by the ray equation .
We know the amount of time it takes for the ball to traverse the arc and that provides a way to compute the velocity in the x-direction .
The maximum velocity in the y - direction , v , is a function of the height of the arc , h , and the acceleration due to gravity , g . Since all the potential energy stored in the ball at the apex is converted into kinetic energy when it reaches the bottom of the arc , we can express the relationship between v , h and g by equating the formulae for both types of energy .
Movement in the y - direction is governed by the parabolic formula below where y 0 is the initial height of the ball , v 0 is the initial velocity in the y - direction , g is the acceleration due to gravity ( a positive constant ) and t is time .
Due to the symmetry of the arc , the starting and the ending heights are the same .
Also , the magnitudes of the starting and ending velocities in the y - direction are the same , but opposite in sign .
The derivation below shows that the height of the arc and the time it takes the ball to traverse the arc determines the maximum velocity of the ball in the negative y- direction .
Also , from above , the acceleration due to gravity is computable from the maximum velocity and the arc height .
To test out these formulas , I modified the launch method to generate 30 animation frames .
public void launch ( ) throws Throwable {
image = new BufferedImage ( WIDTH , HEIGHT , Buffered Image .
TYPE_INT_RGB ) ;
if ( RENDER_IN_WINDOW ) {
renderFrame = new RenderFrame ( image ) ;
}
int processors = Runtime.getRuntime ( ) .availableProcessors () ;
for ( int frameIndex = 0 ; frameIndex < 30 ; frameIndex ++ ) {
if ( RENDER_IN_WINDOW ) {
renderFrame.setTitle ( " Amiga Juggler [ " + frameIndex + " ] " ) ;
}
resetRowIndex ( ) ;
updateRunningCount ( processors ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < processors ; i++ ) {
final int _frameIndex = frameIndex ;
new Thread ( Integer.toString ( i ) ) {
@ Override
public void run ( ) {
render ( _frameIndex ) ;
updateRunningCount ( - 1 ) ;
}
} .start ( ) ;
}
synchronized ( this ) {
while ( runningCount != 0 ) {
wait ( ) ;
}
}
saveImage ( " balls " + (( frameIndex < 10 ) ? " 0 " : " " ) + frameIndex ) ;
}
}
Next , I added a series of constants to control the arcs .
Essentially , you can specify the coordinates of the hands and the height of the upper arc .
The rest of the constants are derived from these values and the fact that it takes 30 frames to traverse the lower arc and 60 frames to traverse the upper arc .
public static final double JUGGLE_X0 = - 75 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_X1 = 75 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_Y0 = 10 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_H_Y = 90 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_H_VX = ( JUGGLE_X0 - JUGGLE_X1 ) / 60.0 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_L_VX = ( JUGGLE_X1 - JUGGLE_X0 ) / 30.0 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_H_H = JUGGLE_H_Y - JUGGLE_Y0 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_H_VY = 4.0 * JUGGLE_H_H / 60.0 ;
public static final double JUGGLE_G = JUGGLE_H_VY * JUGGLE_H_VY
/ ( 2.0 * JUGGLE_H_H ) ;
public static final double JUGGLE_L_VY = 0.5 * JUGGLE_G * 30.0 ;
Then it was just a matter of modifying the createScene and updateScene methods to incorporate the parabolic arc formulae .
private IObject [ ] createScene ( ) {
return new IObject [ ] {

Step 16
The arms and legs of the juggler consist of spheres packed into lines .
As far as I can tell , the juggler stands with his right foot forward and his left foot back .
As he juggles , the hips move up and down .
In one animation frame , the left leg looks almost straight ; where as the right knee is slightly bent .
Each appendage consists of 2 line segments connected by a joint .
To make appendages easy to control , I established the following model :
The lengths of the line segments are A and B .
The appendage exists in a plane with normal w .
The end points of the appendage are p and q .
The normalized difference between those points establishes a vector v .
The cross product of v and w generates u , completing an orthonormal basis ( ONB ) for the appendage .
I need to find the location of the joint , ( x , y ) , which appears in the direction of positive u .
The point ( x , y ) is in the coordinate system defined by the ONB where p is the origin and z = 0 .
You can redraw the appendage as 2 right - triangles that share a common height .
From there its just a matter of applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice and solving for x and y .
If the value within the square - root is negative , then it is not possible to construct an appendage with the specified parameters .
To test the concept , I created a scene containing an appendage .
The appendage consists of 2 segments , each composed of 8 spheres , plus an extra sphere for the joint .
In total , that s 17 spheres .
private IObject [ ] createScene ( ) {
IObject [ ] scene = new IObject [ 2 + 8 + 1 + 8 ] ;
scene [ 0 ] = new Ground ( 25 , Materials .
YELLOW_MATTE , Materials .
GREEN_MATTE ) ;
scene [ 1 ] = new Sphere ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 E6 , Materials .
BLUE_MATTE ) ;
for ( int i = 2 ; i < scene.
length ; i++ ) {
scene [ i ] = new Sphere ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 10 , Materials .RED_PLASTIC
) ;
}
return scene ;
}
Below is a method I added to update an appendage based on the parameters discussed above .
sceneIndex is the offset into scene where the appendage is stored .
The parameters p , q , w , A and B control the appendage as described above .
countA and countB are the number of spheres in each segment .
Neither count includes the joint ; the total number of spheres in the appendage is countA + 1 + countB .
The spheres must be in the following order within scene : segment A spheres from p to j , the joint sphere at j , and segment B spheres from q to j .
The temps parameter is a set of temporary vectors used for intermediate calculations .
private void updateAppendage (
IObject [ ] scene , int sceneIndex ,
double [ ] p , double [ ] q , double [ ] w , double A , double B ,
int countA , int countB , double [ ] [ ] temps ) {
double [ ]
U = temps [ 0 ] ;
double [ ]
V = temps [ 1 ] ;
double [ ]
W = temps [ 2 ] ;
double [ ] j = temps [ 3 ] ;
double [ ] d = temps [ 4 ] ;
Vec.subtract ( V , q , p ) ;
double D = Vec.magnitude ( V ) ;
double inverseD = 1.0 / D ;
Vec.scale ( V , inverseD ) ;
Vec.normalize ( W , w ) ;
Vec.cross ( U , V , W ) ;
double A2 = A * A ;
double y = 0.5 * inverseD * ( A2 - B * B + D * D ) ;
double x = Math.sqrt ( A2 - y * y ) ;
Vec.map ( j , p , U , V , x , y ) ;
Vec.subtract ( d , j , p ) ;
Vec.scale ( d , 1.0 / countA ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i <= countA ; i++ ) {
double [ ] center = (( Sphere ) scene [ sceneIndex + i ] ) . center ;
Vec.ray ( center , p , d , i ) ;
}
Vec.subtract ( d , j , q ) ;
Vec.scale ( d , 1.0 / countB ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < countB ; i++ ) {
double [ ] center = (( Sphere ) scene [ countA + 1 + sceneIndex + i ] ) . center ;
Vec.ray ( center , q , d , i ) ;
}
}
Finally , I modified updateScene to move the appendage .
The appendage exists within the xy - plane , parallel to the virtual screen .
The code anchors point p and it moves point q in a circular motion .
private void updateScene (
int frameIndex , double t , IObject [ ] scene , double [ ] [ ] temps ) {
double [ ] w = temps [ 5 ] ;
w [ 0 ] = 0 ;
w [ 1 ] = 0 ;
w [ 2 ] = 1 ;
double [ ] p = temps [ 6 ] ;
p [ 0 ] = - 75 ;
p [ 1 ] = 50 ;
p [ 2 ] = 0 ;
double angle = 2.0 * Math .
PI * ( frameIndex + t ) / 30.0 ;
double [ ] q = temps [ 7 ] ;
q [ 0 ] = 75 + 5 * Math.cos ( angle ) ;
q [ 1 ] = 50 + 5 * Math.sin ( angle ) ;
q [ 2 ] = 0 ;
updateAppendage ( scene , 2 , p , q , w , 80 , 80 , 8 , 8 , temps ) ;
}
Heres the result ( 320×180 , 256 samples / pixel ) :

Step 17
Here is a frame from the Amiga Juggler animation .
I added black bars to the left and right to force the image into the aspect ratio that I am interested in and then I scaled it to the size of my other test images .
The horizon line is slightly above center , which means that the camera is tilted somewhat downwards .
To help me match the original animation , I modified the program to load and blend this frame with my own .
I introduced the following method to load the image into a double [ ] [ ] [ ] array .
Note that it applies gamma correction .
private void loadImage ( String name ) throws Throwable {
BufferedImage blendImage = ImageIO.read ( new File ( name ) ) ;
blendPixels = new double [ blendImage.getHeight ( ) ] [ blendImage.getWidth ( ) ] [ 3 ] ;
int [ ] row = new int [ blendImage.getWidth ( ) ] ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < blendImage.getHeight () ; i++ ) {
blendImage.getRGB
( 0 , i , blendImage.getWidth ( ) , 1 , row , 0 ,
blendImage.getWidth ( ) ) ;
for ( int j = 0 ; j < blendImage.getWidth () ; j++ ) {
for ( int k = 2 ; k >= 0 ; k-- ) {
int intensity = row [ j ] & 0xFF ;
row [ j ] >>= 8 ;
blendPixels [ i ] [ j ] [ k ] = Math.pow ( intensity / 255.0 , GAMMA ) ;
}
}
}
}
Blending occurs within the render method using a weighted average .
Currently , its equally weighted .
pixel [ i ] = 0.5 * pixel [ i ] + 0.5 * blendPixels [ y ] [ x ] [ i ] ;
The launch method loads the image and then it attaches a key listener to the frame .
By pressing the up or down arrow - keys , I can control the y - coordinate of the look point .
This enabled me to find the camera tilt .
Ill reuse this framework in successive steps to further match the original animation .

Step 18
It dawned on me while I was trying to work out the camera angle that the Amiga 1000 does not display square pixels .
To compensate , I scaled the animation frame horizontally by 86 % .
Here is my attempt at reproducing the same view .
It s not a perfect match , but its close enough .
Step 19
Using the shadows , the square tiles and the spheres in the original animation frame as a guide , I worked out key coordinates in space that will help me align everything else .
Below is my attempt to orient the mirrored spheres .
Now all I need is the juggler .
0 hours , 1 minute , 10 seconds , 138 milliseconds
source
Step 20
Next , I sized and positioned the head , neck and torso spheres ( 64 samples / pixel ) .
0 hours , 0 minutes , 40 seconds , 529 milliseconds
source
It s unclear if the juggler in the original animation has a large , white button on his chest or if that is just a large specular highlight as seen in the above animation .
Step 21
The torso definitely bobs up and down during juggling .
I measured the range of the bob and I used cosine to simulate the effect .
Below is the result with 64 samples / pixel .
0 hours , 0 minutes , 42 seconds , 385 milliseconds
source
Step 22
The head also sways side - to - side .
To achieve that , I constructed an orthonormal basis centered at the crotch point between the hips .
In the image below , the unit vector v follows a circular path .
Using v and the ray equation is sufficient to position the torso , the neck and the head .
The unit vector u will be used with v for the shoulders , the hips and the appendages .
Here is the result with 64 samples per pixel .
0 hours , 0 minutes , 45 seconds , 459 milliseconds
source
Step 23
Using the ONB created in the prior step , I attached the legs .
Below you can see the result with 64 samples / pixel .
The knees bend independently because one foot is forward and the other is back and because the hips are tilting from side - to - side .
The thigh is 80 % shorter than the calf .
0 hours , 2 minutes , 15 seconds , 349 milliseconds
source
Step 24
Again using the crotch - centered coordinate system , I attached the arms to the shoulder points .
The normal vector of each arm plane is based on the angle between the elbow point and the shoulder point .
The hand points rotate around an arbitrary point in space such that the angle is based on cosine of time .
Below is the result with 16 samples / pixel .
0 hours , 0 minutes , 54 seconds , 850 milliseconds
source
Step 25
To help me match colors sampled from frames of the original animation , I added 2 new methods to the Materials class .
public static double [ ] createColor ( int hexColor , double scale ) {
double [ ] color = new double [ 3 ] ;
createColor ( color , hexColor , scale ) ;
return color ;
}
public static void createColor (
double [ ] color , int hexColor , double scale ) {
for ( int i = 2 ; i >= 0 ; i-- ) {
int intensity = hexColor & 0xFF ;
hexColor >>= 8 ;
color [ i ] = Math.pow ( scale * intensity / 255.0 , Main . GAMMA ) ;
}
}
They accept a color in the form of an RGB hex value , the format readily available from photo - editing software .
Gamma correction is applied to convert the color into the form necessary for the ray tracer .
The second parameter provides a convenient way to scale the result .
In the original animation , the yellow and green squares closest to the viewer are pure , max yellow and green respectively .
On the ground , within the jugglers shadow , the squares are reduced to 40 % of their original color intensities .
This means that the ambient weight in the Phong Shading Model is set to 0.4 for the ground material .
For the spheres , it is closer to 0.15 .
It was relatively easy to measure colors and to derive materials from them to color the ground and the spheres ; however , the sky proved to be a bigger challenge .
Close to the horizon the sky color is washed out with a high saturation , but high above , the sky is dark blue as revealed by the reflection in the mirrored spheres .
Thats an effect that cannot be produced by diffuse and specular lighting with a single point light source .
To overcome the problem , I added a method called update to the Material class .
The method is an empty stub .
public void update ( double [ ] hitPoint ) {
}
I modified the render method to call update with the ray - intersection hit point just prior to using the material in the Phong Shading Model .
Then , I introduced a class that extends Material and overrides update to color the sky based on elevation .
public class SkyMaterial extends Material {
private double [ ] minColor = Materials.createColor ( 0xBDBDFF , 1.0 ) ;
private double [ ] maxColor = Materials.createColor ( 0x2223F6 , 1.0 ) ;
public SkyMaterial ( ) {
super ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , new double [ 3 ] , new double [ 3 ] , new double [ 3 ] ) ;
}
@ Override
public void update ( double [ ] hitPoint ) {
Vec.interpolate ( diffuseColor , minColor , maxColor , hitPoint [ 1 ] * 1 E- 6 ) ;
}
}
Notice that the sky material uses only ambient lighting , ignoring the other terms of the Phong Shading Model .
The interpolate method used within update is essentially the ray equation .
It performs linear interpolation between 2 specified points .
// a = b + ( c - b ) * s [s = 0 is b , s = 1 is c ]
public static void interpolate ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b , double [ ] c , double s ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
a [ i ] = b [ i ] + ( c [ i ] - b [ i ] ) * s ;
}
}
// a = a + ( b - a ) * s [s = 0 is a , s = 1 is b ]
public static void interpolate ( double [ ] a , double [ ] b , double s ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
a [ i ] = a [ i ] + ( b [ i ] - a [ i ] ) * s ;
}
}
Here is the result with 256 samples per pixel .
0 hours , 1 minute , 41 seconds , 322 milliseconds
source
On a side note , in the original animation , I found a frame where one of the balls casts a shadow over the jugglers chest .
The white button vanishes in the shadow , which demonstrates that it is indeed just a specular highlight .
Step 26
Next , I worked out the position of the eyes and the hair .
Below is the result with 49 samples / pixel .
0 hours , 2 minutes , 26 seconds , 609 milliseconds
source
Heres a frame rendered with 1024 samples / pixel .
Step 27
Now , it s time to render .
But , before we do , lets take a look at the final versions of createScene and updateScene .

}
As you can see , the scene consists of 85 spheres and the ground plane .
Any initial sphere positions specified in createScene are actually overridden by the formulae in updateScene .
The createScene method only determines the sizes and the materials of the spheres .
I rendered the frames at 640×360 and at 1920 ×1080 with 1024 samples / pixel .
At the larger ( HD ) resolution , it took approximately 1 hour to render each frame .
Ironically , according to Eric Grahams documentation , each frame of the original animation also took about an hour to render on the Amiga 1000 .
But , the original animation was rendered at 320×200 and the renderer only used 1 sample / pixel .
That s 64,000 rays versus 2,123,366,400 rays for each image .
It s also unlikely that it applied ambient occlusion or that it used double - precision floating - point operations .
Being conservative , it would have taken about 114 years to generate the complete HD animation on the Amiga 1000 .
If you launched the program back in 1985 when the Amiga 1000 was introduced , on 5 of those machines , they would have collectively completed the job in 2008 .
I merged the frames together using VirtualDub .
At 30 frames / sec , there is only 1 second of animation .
I wanted it to loop 30 times , but I could not get VirtualDub to import the images more than once .
So , I simply wrote a program to duplicate the files and then I imported all 900 .
package jugglerfilenames ;
import java.io .*;
public class Main {
private static final String path
= " C:/NetBeansProjects/JugglerFileNames / files / " ;
private static byte [ ] buffer = new byte [ 1024 * 1024 ] ;
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Throwable {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 30 ; i++ ) {
String inputFile = String.format ( " % sjuggler%02d.png " , path , i ) ;
for ( int j = 0 ; j < 30 ; j++ ) {
String outputFile = String.format (
" %sjuggler%03d.png " , path , j * 30 + i ) ;
copy ( inputFile , output File ) ;
}
}
}
private static void copy ( String file1 , String file2 ) throws Throwable {
FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream ( file1 ) ;
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream ( file2 ) ;
while ( true ) {
int bytes = in.read ( buffer ) ;
if ( bytes < 0 ) {
break ;
}
out . write ( buffer , 0 , bytes ) ;
}
in.close ( ) ;
out.close ( ) ;
}
}
The original animation was accompanied by a clank sound every time the mirrored spheres contacted the robots arms .
I decided to add some royalty free music reminiscent of the demoscene .
I downloaded " Double O " by Kevin MacLeod ( incompetech.com ) , I edited it with Audacity and then I imported it into VirtualDub .
VirtualDub produced an uncompressed AVI file .
I used SUPER © to compress it into an MP4 before uploading it to YouTube .
Here is the final version of the source used to render the HD frames .
Below are results .

Half a century ago , a middle - aged newspaperman with a few obscure books to his name sat down to pursue a pet obsession based on a story that had never sold .
The ensuing 1965 novel -- in which his agent had no confidence -- sagged at first .
But within a few years , it was a pop-culture sensation , and this year , on its 45th anniversary , “ Dune ” is one of science fiction ’s best - known books and probably the field ’s bestselling novel .
The mystery of why some works continue to speak to us is heightened with a book like “ Dune ” : Frank Herbert ’s desert - planet epic not only remains popular and well - known , but this tale has anticipated many of our contemporary concerns .
Its saga of dueling great houses , the fight for a rare resource and a young aristocrat ’s coming of age was set 200 centuries in the future .
But it grapples with numerous issues pressing in the 21st : the fragility of the environment , the shortage of fossil fuels , the threat of religious jihad , the unpredictable effects of mind - bending drugs .
“ It was the SF book that everybody in the mainstream culture was reading , ” recalls Northern California novelist Kim Stanley Robinson .
“ But it was n’t like Vonnegut ’s ‘ Cat ’s Cradle , ’ which was essentially a mainstream novel .
Herbert was doing hard - core SF in the anthropological and world - building sense .
People went for its huge back story taking off from [ the prophet ] Mohammed ’s life . ”
Advertisement
That the novel was planned and researched during the Eisenhower and Camelot years -- before widespread Muslim fundamentalism , OPEC , mainstream narcotics use and other issues that seem to inspire the narrative -- underscores the author ’s prescience .
The book also helped galvanize the environmental movement :
Set on a world far from ours , its rich description of a water - poor planet is credited by some as the inspiration for Earth Day .
Because of its huge following , fast - moving plot and opportunities for special effects , “ Dune ” has repeatedly attracted other artists -- it ’s been the source of a video game , a board game , numerous posthumous sequels and several adaptations .
And though a 1984 film was widely considered a failure and two subsequent Sci-Fi Channel miniseries were made , Paramount recently selected a director for a big - budget movie .
The inspiration
“ I am a political animal , ” Herbert said in a 1983 promotional interview .
“ And I never really left journalism .
I am writing about the current scene -- the metaphors are there . ”

The novel was sparked when , in the late 1950s , Herbert flew to Florence , Ore. , in a small chartered plane to write about a U.S. Department of Agriculture effort to stabilize sand dunes with European beach grasses .
The author was struck by the way dunes could move , over time , like living things -- swallowing rivers , clogging lakes , burying forests .
“ These waves can be every bit as devastating as a tidal wave . . . they ’ve even caused deaths , ” he wrote his agent , beginning an article , “ They Stopped the Moving Sands , ” that was never published .
Despite his agent ’s indifference , Herbert dug in :
He was fascinated by the project and superimposed the history of another sandy place -- including Arabs and Islam ’s Mohammed -- into an adventure novel originally called “ Spice Planet . ”
When he hit his stride , Herbert was writing 70 pages a week .
At the time , science fiction was at the tail end of its Golden Age , dominated by brisk tales of interstellar war and planet hopping .
Several icons of midcentury were doing major work -- Robert Heinlein , for instance , published his campus sensation “ Stranger in a Strange Land ” in 1961 -- but the field ’s energy was flagging , and the magazine market had imploded .
( A 1961 fanzine was titled “ Who Killed Science Fiction ? ” )
Herbert and his gargantuan manuscript were turned down by dozens of publishers but eventually accepted by Chilton , a small press known for auto manuals .
Advertisement
Herbert ’s story of young aristocrat Paul Atreides , along with maps , appendixes , glossary and epigrams ran to more than 500 pages .
After almost two years , the book took off in 1967 .
The novel was a hinge between new and old , says Annalee Newitz , editor of science fiction blog io9 .
“ ‘ Dune ’ functions nicely as a transition between classic SF -- focused on space opera and astro-politics of the kind Isaac Asimov and other golden age authors wrote -- and the next generation , ” she says .
“ In the ‘ 60s , we saw a shift away from science fiction focused on space travel and space politics to anthropology .
You are n’t rushing between planets , you ’ve landed on one and you talk about that one ” -- including its biology and sociology .
Writers had imagined life on other planets and written of environmental catastrophe .
But the scale of “ Dune ” was unprecedented , comparable , as Arthur C. Clarke said at the time , only to “ The Lord of the Rings . ”
“ The planet was something you could really feel , ” says Robinson , whose latest novel is “ Galileo ’s Dream . ”
“ Herbert spent a lot of time outdoors -- you can see it in the writing , he ’s seen things you can only see if you ’ve been there .
It ’s physical and expansive . ”

Still , the novel ’s pulp roots show .
“ Parts of it are almost poetic , ” says Rob Latham , who teaches science fiction at UC Riverside .
“ But the villains are comically ridiculous .
Baron Harkonnen could have been played by Sydney Greenstreet or Charles Laughton , say -- ‘ swishy . ’
And I do n’t know what we ’re supposed to think of the eugenics .
There are all sorts of half - baked ideas in there . ”
‘ A real mess ’
Thanks to the novel ’s success , plans for a “ Dune ” film began as early as 1971 , when producers wanted David Lean , whose “ Lawrence of Arabia ” is in some ways a precursor , to direct .
Another early version would ’ve enlisted Orson Welles , Salvador Dalí , Gloria Swanson , Hervé Villechaize and Alain Delon in a 10 - hour epic -- before financing evaporated .

Today , the 1984 movie directed by David Lynch and starring Kyle McLachlan and Sting has gained cult status .
An endless shoot in Mexico City and the dunes of Chihuahua engaged 1,700 people :
As the costs stretched , Lynch ’s film was sliced to two hours , and he was denied final cut .
Roger Ebert , not known for his vitriol , called the movie “ a real mess . . . incomprehensible , ugly , unstructured , pointless . ”
Lynch all but disowned the movie and rarely discusses it in interviews .
Herbert , however , deemed Lynch ’s baroque film “ a visual feast . ”
The current adaptation comes from the wreckage of a project that was to be helmed by “ Friday Night Lights ” creator Peter Berg and with Charlize Theron as Jessica , Paul ’s mother .
After considering Neill Blomkamp ( political - SF sleeper “ District 9 " ) and Neil Marshall ( low - budget hit “ The Descent ” ) , Paramount opted for Frenchman Pierre Morel .
( Chase Palmer , a relatively unknown writer , will work with an existing screenplay by Josh Zetumer . )
Morel -- director of “ Taken ” and “ From Paris With Love ” -- has discussed his aim to make the film faithful to the novel , which he says he ’s read 10 times .

Optimists hope that the director can do for Herbert ’s book -- and maybe its sequels -- what Peter Jackson did with Tolkien ’s “ Lord of the Rings , ” finding a balance among action , story and ideas .
It could also , of course , be cheap .
“ If they want to reawaken it as a film franchise , ” says io9 ’s Newitz , “ it ’s hard to imagine that it would not just be action - packed , with a video - game tie - in . ”
Lasting effect
For a book that ’s enjoyed such critical and popular success and continued interest from Hollywood , the legacy of “ Dune ” is not especially clear .
Advertisement
It ’s not quite New Wave -- which developed in the late 1960s -- not an antecedent to cyberpunk , nor a precursor to the recent space - opera renaissance .
“ It ’s some kind of singularity , ” says Latham .
“ Dune ” both channeled and stoked a greater environmental consciousness in SF : Important later novels by Ursula Le Guin , John Brunner and Octavia Butler looked at planetary ecology .
The original novel ’s most evident influence is on the science - fiction tradition of world - building , for which it raised the bar considerably .
Writers and scientists had been envisioning other planets for a century , but not this deeply :
The rituals by which the Fremen , the planet ’s desert people , deal with water are especially well imagined .
Many consider Robinson ’s trilogy about the terra - forming of Mars the best - realized exercise in the form since Herbert ’s .
Robinson calls “ Dune ” a big influence :
The book showed him , he says , that “ you could talk about the future of the wilderness .
It gave me courage .
I knew that people were willing to read at great length and that the world could be a character . ”
Advertisement
But Herbert ’s future vision of a galaxy with numerous populated worlds seems out of step with the deflated present .
“ The future , ” says Robinson , “ does n’t look to be off - planet in any near - future time frame . ”
A less encouraging descendant of the original “ Dune ” novel is the large number of other Dune novels .
The first sequel , the much slimmer “ Dune Messiah , ” came out in 1969 ; Herbert published the sixth of the original series , “ Chapterhouse : Dune , ” in 1985 .
And though Herbert died the following year , while recovering from cancer surgery , Dune ’s universe has been extended by his son Brian and journeyman writer Kevin J. Anderson .
Some think these posthumous prequels and sequels have confused the legacy by dumping less serious books into the marketplace .
“ They ’ve gone from something profound and thought - provoking , ” says Newitz , “ to being something like candy , like the ‘ Star Wars ’ novelizations . ”
Whatever the book ’s influence and implications , the original continues to attract readers :
It ’s sold an estimated 10 million copies .
To Latham , it remains “ a weird kind of in - between thing . ”
Advertisement
“ It culminates a pulp tradition , with ridiculous villains and a pseudo - medieval empire set in outer space , and some bad writing , ” he says .
“ Then it has these ‘ 70s elements -- environmental concerns , drugs and mystical experiences .
And somehow it managed to coalesce all of them . ”

A while ago , I decided to switch to MP3 music instead of CD ’s , so I painstakingly ripped all my CD ’s ( 500 + ) onto my computer .
It ’s much easier finding albums on a computer than it is sifting through piles of CD ’s only to find out that I put the wrong CD in the case that I was looking for .
Plus , I really love “ super random ” play .
Anyways , I did all my encoding at 128 kbps .
After I finished ( a week later ! ) , I was talking to a friend of mine who had just finished doing the same thing with all of his CD ’s , except he did then at 320 kbps .
He and everyone I spoke with told me that at 128 kbps the audio is pretty much garbage and that I needed to do it all over again .
I thought to myself :
Why did n’t I rip them at 320 kbps ?
Now I have to deal with inferior quality music or go through the entire ripping process again ! ” .
Can you hear the difference ?
In any case , I have a fun test for everyone : Listen to these 2 clips .
One is encoded at 128 kbps and the other is encoded at 320 kbps ( over twice the bit rate ) .
Can you tell the difference ?
Listen carefully
Clip # 1 Clip # 2
Which audio clip sounds better to you ( and find out the answer ) ?

NEW YORK - The media firestorm over the Rolling Stone profile ( 6/22/10 ) of General Stanley McChrystal mostly
missed the real point of the article , which was a damning portrait of
the U.S. war in Afghanistan .
Much of the media coverage stressed the criticism
and insults hurled by McChrystal and his staff at various
administration figures .
Some of these remarks were more substantive
than others .
A joke about Joe Biden ( " Bite Me " ) has been overblown ;
McChrystal and his staff seemed to be suggesting a list of possible
gaffes the general might make following a speech .
The real significance of the piece is in the
criticism -- voiced by soldiers in Afghanistan and military experts -- of
the war itself .
" Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of
counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to accomplish
in Afghanistan , it 's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert
Storm , " wrote Rolling Stone 's Michael Hastings .
A senior adviser to McChrystal stated , " If
Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war , it
would become even less popular . "
Hastings added that some officials see
the war requiring a much larger troop presence : " Instead of beginning
to withdraw troops next year , as Obama promised , the military hopes to
ramp up its counterinsurgency campaign even further . "
Hastings conveyed a sense of confusion over
precisely what the mission in Afghanistan is supposed to be .
Some
soldiers complained that the rules of engagement put them at greater
risk , though they were uncertain whether these were McChrystal's
intended policies or rules that have been , as Hastings put it ,
" distorted as they passed through the chain of command . "
Hastings also pointed out that McChrystal 's history
has been glossed over by the media , beginning in Iraq : " When Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ' stuff happens ' remark
during the looting of Baghdad , McChrystal backed him up .
A few days
later , he echoed the president 's Mission Accomplished gaffe by
insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over . "
After Army ranger ( and former pro football player )
Pat Tillman was killed in 2004 , McChrystal " signed off on a falsified
recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed
by enemy fire .
( McChrystal would later claim he did n't read the
recommendation closely enough - - a strange excuse for a commander known
for his laserlike attention to minute details . ) "
In 2006 , there was a scandal about torture and
abuse reminiscent of Abu Ghraib at another detention facility in Iraq
that was overseen by McChrystal .
" McChrystal was not disciplined in the
scandal , " Rolling Stone reported , " even though an interrogator
at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times . "
Hastings concluded that the media have mostly
" given McChrystal a pass " on these controversies .
Indeed , a Washington
Post story ( 6/24/10 ) on McChrystal 's ouster noted in passing
that he " had to fend off allegations that he played a role in the
Army 's mishandling of the death of Ranger Cpl. Pat Tillman , " and that
he " faced criticism for his oversight of detention facilities where
prisoner abuse occurred . "
Discussing the broader message of the Rolling
Stone article is clearly not something the White House wants -- and
neither do corporate media , preferring the personal drama of military
officials making politically damaging comments about political leaders ,
and the White House 's attempt to assert control .
Thus , Obama 's decision to dismiss McChrystal and
bring in General David Petraeus seemed to bring sighs of relief .
As Washington
Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote ( 6/23/10 ) , it was a " rare " but
welcome sight : " The commander in chief was being commanding . "
Milbank
added that Obama 's " best moments as president " including " defying his
own party to ecalate the fight in Afghanistan . "
The fact that he named Petraeus as McChrystal's
replacement was essentially swapping one media favorite with another ( Extra ! ,
11-12/07 ) .
" Naming the highly respected Petraeus as
the new commander is by all accounts a great save , " explained ABC
Pentagon reporter Martha Raddatz ( Nightline , 6/23/10 ) .
" It allows the
administration to continue the same counterinsurgency strategy in
Afghanistan without missing a beat . "
Raddatz helpfully added this
assessment : " A warrior and a scholar , Petraeus is sometimes jokingly
referred to as a water walker , since almost everything he touches seems
to turn to gold . "
Similar pronouncements were heard throughout the
corporate media .
The right - wing Media Research Center gathered them in a
video reel , which Fox host Bill O'Reilly
used on his June 24 show .
Apparently the media 's gushing enthusiasm for
Petraeus is yet another sign of their left - wing bias .
So a story that was an indictment of the war became
a lesson in how the White House would be sticking with its plan .
As the
Washington Post ( 6/24/10 ) put it , Obama 's " decision to turn
over the Afghan command to Gen. David H. Petraeus allowed the president
to keep his war strategy intact . "
NBC Pentagon reporter Jim
Miklasziewski ( 6/23/10 ) declared that " the military is very high on
David Petraeus , and there should be no slowdown or hitch in the
Afghanistan strategy . "
NBC reporter Chuck Todd ( 6/23/10 ) noted
that the " one thing the president made clear :
He may be changing
commanders , but not the mission ....
Trading McChrystal for Petraeus
neutralized what could have turned into another political mess . "
Of course , the war in Afghanistan would already
seem to qualify as a " mess , " to say the very least .
But for now , Obama
asserted presidential control -- and that 's something most reporters and
pundits were eager to cheer .
Das Kirchenaustrittserschwerungsgesetz und das Amtsgericht Aachen
Die katholische Kirche steht in Deutschland wegen des aktuell aufgekommenden Missbrauchskandals ja mal wieder ziemlich in der Kritik .
Bischof Mixa hat seinen Rücktritt angeboten , Papst Benedikt steht unter Beschuss , hält sich aber trotz der heftigen Vorwürfe bedeckt und der Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung für eine Kirche die sich derart ignorant gibt schwindet dahin .
Ich möchte mich dem an dieser Stelle aus aktuellem , persönlichen Anlass anschließen und über meine Erlebnisse der letzten Wochen berichten , die im weitesten Sinne mit der ( nicht vorhandenen )
Trennung von Staat und Kirche und den Konsequenzen daraus zu tun haben .
Um genau zu sein fängt die Geschichte damit an , dass ich Atheist bin und daher aus der katholischen Kirche austreten wollte .
An sich schien mir das keine große Sache zu sein , bis ich nach einiger Recherche feststellen musste , dass dieser – per Grundgesetz – neutrale Staat scheinbar ein Interesse besitzt mich an einem Austritt zu hindern .
Das hat mich ziemlich geärgert und ist der Grund für einige Dinge die geschehen sind , und einiges was noch kommen wird .
Ich möchte erst noch ein paar Worte zu meinem persönlichen Hintergrund verlieren .
Ich bin wie schon erwähnt Atheist , und das nicht erst seit gestern .
Ich bin katholisch getauft und bin zur Kommunion gegangen .
Danach war ich mehrere Jahre Messdiener in der Kirchengemeinde in meinem Heimatdorf .
Trotzdem habe ich nie an Gott oder irgendeine andere übernatürliche Macht geglaubt und mich konnte man daher auch noch nie als „ religiös “ bezeichnen .
Was mir daher auch wichtig ist : Religiösität und die Mitgliedschaft in der Kirche sind meines Erachtens zwei völlig unterschiedliche Zustände die sich gegenseitig weder bedürfen noch bedingen .
Diesen
Punkt zu beachten halte ich für wichtig , meine Kritik an der Kirche ist nämlich um ein vielfaches größer als die Kritik an der Religiösität .
In der neunten Klasse habe ich schließlich zum frühestmöglichen Zeitpunkt „ aus Gewissensgründen “ den Religionsunterricht abgewählt und stattdessen das Fach praktische Philosophie belegt .
Ich hatte das Glück , dass dieses
Fach von einem strengen aber sehr guten Lehrer unterrichtet wurde und habe erlebt wie Werte und Weltsichten völlig ohne religiösen Unterton und Zwang gelehrt bzw .
diskutiert werden können .
Damals habe ich mir noch nicht viel dabei gedacht , ich habe den Religionsunterricht einfach für mich persönlich abgelehnt .
Durch die politische Arbeit bei der Piratenpartei bin ich nun aber sehr oft mit dem Themengebiet Grundrechte , Selbstbestimmung und Freiheit in Kontakt bekommen und stelle nun fest , dass in Deutschland ordentlich was falsch läuft .
Der Religionsunterricht ist zwar nur ein Puzzleteil im Gesamtbild , dadurch das er aber so gut wie jeden schonmal betroffen hat aber ein netter Diskussionsgegenstand .
Zurück also zum Kirchenaustritt .
Diesen hatte ich mir schon vor Jahren vorgenommen , bin aber aus Bequemlichkeit nie dazu gekommen .
Als Student zahle ich schließlich keine Einkommens - und damit auch keine Kirchensteuer , da fehlt zumindest der finanzielle Anreiz für einen solchen Schritt .
Trotzdem stieg bei mir mit dem Laufe der Zeit das Unbehagen über meine Konfession , letztlich störte mich schon , dass ich als Mitglied in der Statistik auftauche und die Kirche das nutzen könnte um über Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung oder Ähnlichem zu argumentieren .
Der Skandal um die Missbrauchsfälle in katholischen Einrichtungen hat bei mir dann schließlich nur noch einen draufgesetzt und das Fass zum Überlaufen gebracht .
Wo ist nun also das Problem ?
Der ganze Spaß kostet Geld !
Ja ganz recht , wenn man in NRW aus der Kirche austreten möchte , kostet das seit dem 08.07.2006 geschmackvolle 30 € !
Am 08.07.2006 ist das von der schwarz - gelben Landesregierung beschlossene Kirchenaustrittsgesetz [ 1 ] in NRW in Kraft getreten und belegt nun diesen blasphemischen
Akt mit einer Strafgebühr .
Offiziell werden diese 30 € als Gebühr für den Verwaltungsaufwand gerechtfertigt , den das Amtsgericht mit dem Austritt hat .
Diese Behauptung ist aber ziemlicher Blödsinn oder zumindest vorgeschoben , das sieht man gleich an mehreren Punkten :
Sind sowohl Kircheneintritt bzw .
Kirchenwiedereintritt als auch der Kirchenübertritt ( z.B. von katholisch zu evangelisch ) kostenlos .
Der Verwaltungsaufwand von einem Kircheneintritt ist mit dem Austritt verständlicherweise zu vergleichen , wenn er nicht sogar mehr Arbeit macht .
Das riecht verdächtig nach Kalkül .
Lässt sich das Finanzamt den Verwaltungsaufwand des Kirchensteuereinzug z.B. schon mit mehreren Prozent vom Kirchensteueraufkommen bezahlen .
Das Erzbistum Köln bezahlt 2010 für diesen Service zum Beispiel alleine 18 Millionen Euro [ 2 ] .
Davon müssten ja ein paar Ein- und Austritte gerade so mitzufinanzieren sein oder etwa nicht ?
Ist die Kirchensteuer als Sonderausgabe steuerlich absetzbar .
Mal abgesehen davon , dass die Kirche hier einen deutlichen Vorteil gegenüber anderen Organisationen mit „ grundgesetzlich verankerter Relevanz , zum Beispiel Parteien und Gewerkschaften “ hat , finanziert dieser neutrale Staat ( also ich ) die Kirche indirekt pro Jahr mit 3 Milliarden Euro ( in Worten : Drei Milliarden ! ) [ 3 ] .
Bevor wir für Kirchenaustritte also Geld nehmen , sollten wir endlich mal aufhören die Kirche so heftig zu subventionieren .
Ist eine Austrittsgebühr ( und damit auch eine Bearbeitungsgebühr ) laut Deutschem Vereinsrecht nicht zulässig , da sie eine „ unzulässige Erschwerung des Austritts “ darstellt .
Das dieses Schutzrecht gerade in einem so sensiblen Bereich wie bei Religions - und Weltanschauungsgemeinschaften keine Verwendung finden soll , dafür gibt es einfach keine vernünftige Erklärung .
Diese Punkte sind zusammengenommen der Grund , warum ich das Gesetz zu dem umgenannt habe was es in meinen Augen ist : Ein Kirchenaustrittserschwerungsgesetz .
In unserem NRW , in dem wie im Rest von Deutschland Kirche und Staat nicht ordentlich voneinander getrennt sind , hatte die CHRISTLICH Demokratische Union offenbar eine Lösung gesucht , um dem massiven Mitgliederschwund aus der Kirche [ 3 ] entgegenzuwirken .
Meiner Meinung nach sollte sich die Politik aus dem Neutralitätsgrundsatz heraus überhaupt nicht für Kirchenein - und Kirchenaustritte interessieren , hier ist die Motivatin der Politik aber leider kaum noch zu übersehen .
Gegen die Einführung der Kirchenaustrittsgebühr , die es mittlerweile in fast allen Bundesländern gibt [ 5 ] , hatte der Internationale Bund für Konfessionslose und Atheisten e.V. ( IBKA ) schon eine Klage bis in die höchste Instanz unterstützt .
Er sieht darin eine Einschränkung der „ negativen Religionsfreiheit “ , nämlich der Freiheit keiner Religion anzugehören und befürchtet , dass sich wirtschaftliche schwache Personen ( z.B. Arbeitslose oder Schüler ohne eigenes Einkommen ) von der Gebühr abschrecken lassen aus der Kirche auszutreten .
Ich teile diese Ansicht und kann sogar aus dem persönlichem Bekanntenkreis Beispiele nennen , wo genau diese Situation der Fall ist , nämlich das Menschen aus finanziellen Gründen in einer Organisation bleiben mit der sie sich nicht identifizieren können .
Die Klage scheiterte leider beim Bundesverfassungsgericht , das am 02 .
Juli 2008 lediglich feststellte , dass es eine Möglichkeit zur Reduzierung oder sogar dem Erlass geben müsste , „ mit Rücksicht auf die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Zahlungspflichtigen oder sonst aus Billigkeitsgründen “ [ 6 – Absatz - Nr. 38 – 41 ] .
In der höchsten Instanz , dem Europäischen Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte ist die Beschwerde schließlich am 24.09.2009 als unzulässig zurückgewiesen worden [ 7 ] .
Diese Entscheidung markiert bislang den Schlussstrich unter der Geschichte , d.h. eine Aufhebung der Kirchenaustrittsgebühr wird nur noch über die Legislative möglich sein .
Sollte es in NRW zu einer Koalition mit der CDU kommen , kann man sich von dieser Hoffnung aber getrost verabschieden .
Trotzdem ist es erfreulich , dass sich immer mehr Menschen in Deutschland von einer repressiven Kirche abwenden und ein Leben ohne religiöse Zwänge leben wollen .
Denn die Kirchenaustrittsgebühr vermag einen
Trend nur abzumildern , nicht zu verhinden : Dass sich immer weniger Menschen mit den Idealen und Wertevorstellungen der Kirche , vor allem aber wohl mit den vorgelebten Werten identifizieren können .
Das Gebaren der Kirche wird 2010 wohl zu einer sehr großen Anzahl an Austritten führen , die den Aufwärtstrend der letzten Jahre übertreffen dürfte .
Zahlen für 2009 konnte ich leider keine finden , daher ist hier die Statistik von 1970 – 2008 .
Überschrift : Gottlos glücklich .
Nun aber weg von der Statistik , hin zu meinem speziellen Fall .
Wie ich geschrieben habe , hat das BverfG eine Möglichkeit zur Reduzierung oder sogar zum Erlass der Austrittsgebühr eingeräumt um die negative Religionsfreiheit wirklich zu gewährleisten .
Da ich als Student über wenig Einkommen verfüge habe ich also einen entsprechenden Antrag gestellt , meine finanzielle Situation dargelegt und um eine entsprechende Berücksichtigung gebeten .
Wie sich das Amtsgericht Aachen ( bzw. der betreffende Mitarbeiter ) mir aber daraufhin gegenüber verhalten hat war schon sehenswert .
Bei meinem ersten Besuch im AG
Aachen , der nebenbei mein erster in einem deutschen Gerichtsgebäude überhaupt war , wurde ich als Reaktion auf meinen Antrag vom verantwortlichen Mitarbeiter in einem derartigen
Ton angegriffen , dass man das Gefühl bekommen konnte ich hätte ihn gerade auf unterstem Niveau persönlich beleidigt oder was auch immer !
Die Möglichkeit eines solchen Antrages wurde vehement abgestritten und erst als sich der Mitarbeiter nach mehrfacher Aufforderung meinerseits den entsprechenden Teil der Entscheidung des BverfG , den ich ausgedruckt und markiert dabei hatte durchgelesen hat , war er überhaupt bereit den Antrag anzunehmen .
Der Höhepunkt dieses Besuches war das folgende Zitat des netten Mitarbeiters : „ Es gibt da im Internet immer wieder so Zeitgenossen die das Gegenteil behaupten , aber so einen Antrag gibt es nicht !
Entweder zahlen sie die 30 € oder sie lassen es ! “
Ich kam mir ein bisschen vor wie jemand der bei der Polizei steht und eine Anzeige wegen seines gestohlenden Autos erstatten möchte , die Polizisten sich aber vehement weigern die Anzeige aufzunehmen mit der Begründung der Diebstahl eines Autos sei in Deutschland generell nicht strafbar …
Entgegen dieser Aussagen kann ein Antrag auf Erlass oder Ermäßigung der Kirchenaustrittsgebühr aber sehr wohl gestellt werden .
Ich habe meinen Antrag ( der laut IBKA formell in Ordnung war ) mal als Musterschreiben angehängt .
Dazu weitere Unterlagen , die normalerweise auch ein uninformiertes Amtsgericht überzeugen sollten .
Mein Musterschreiben bezieht sich auf meine Situation als Student , als Empfänger von ALG II oder als Schüler ohne Einkommen muss jeweils die Darstellung der finanziellen Lage angepasst werden .

Schreiben des IBKA e.V. an das Justizministerium NRW – Eine Anfrage vom 20.08.2008 bezüglich der Anträge an die Amtsgerichte und deren Form .
Antwort des Justizministerium NRW auf die Anfrage vom IBKA e.V. – Die Antwort vom 29.08.2008
Als Sahnehäubchen habe ich meinem Antrag noch die unten verlinkte Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichtes [ 6 ] angehängt .
Das ist aber eigentlich schon völlig übertrieben und geht weit über das hinaus , was von einem antragstellenden Bürger erwartet werden kann .
Das mein Antrag trotzdem abgelehnt worden ist zeigt nur deutlicher wie wenig geltendes Recht und das Verhalten des Amtsgerichtes miteinander zu tun haben .
Aber Moment mal , abgelehnt ?
Mein Antrag ist erstmal gar nicht abgelehnt worden , sondern nur „ abgewimmelt “ .
Das ist einer kleiner , aber feiner Unterschied den man als Normalbürger erstmal kennen muss .
Und ehrlich gesagt muss ich zugeben , dass ich ohne die Hilfe des IBKA hier schon längst hätte aufgeben müssen .
Was vom Amtsgericht zurückkam war nämlich kein offizieller Bescheid sondern ein Schreiben ohne Geschäftsnummer und ohne rechtliche Wirksamkeit .
Tricky , was ?
So sieht ’s aus :
Antwort_AG_Aachen_18042010.pdf
Hier wird also vom AG Aachen versucht , die Leute mit ganz toll wichtig aussehenden Briefen abzuwimmeln ohne das man sich der Sache richtig annehmen muss .
Da es sich beim ersten Brief nicht um einen Bescheid gehandelt hat , konnte ich dagegen nichtmal Einspruch einlegen .
Also musste ich das Amtsgericht erstmal darum bitten , mir doch bitte einen „ klagenfähigen Bescheid “ auszustellen .
Nachdem die erste Antwort vom AG einen Monat auf sich hat warten lassen ging der Bescheid nun ziemlich schnell , nämlich nur noch eine Woche .
Ein Wunder ist das aber nicht , schließlich unterscheidet sich der Bescheid nun nur durch das Wort „ Bescheid “ drüber und einem Stempel drunter vom ersten Brief .
Naja , wer es gern sehen will , so sieht der Bescheid aus :
Beschluss_AG_Aachen_28042010.pdf
Und hier bin ich dann nach 1900 Wörtern am aktuellen Stand der Dinge angekommen .
Das Amtsgericht
Aachen geht auf meine finanzielle Situation überhaupt nicht ein , sondern lehnt eine Ermäßigung generell ab .
Das steht in meinen Augen im krassen Widerspruch zur Entscheidung des BverfG .
Der IBKA sieht das zum Glück auch so hat mir bei den weiteren Schritten bereits Unterstützung zugesagt .
Das letzte
Wort ist in der Geschichte also noch nicht gesprochen und ich werde an dieser Stelle auf jeden Fall noch über den Ausgang berichten .
Ich bin absolut schockiert wie sich die Behörden in dem Fall verhalten und möchte mit diesem Blogeintrag auf diesen Missstand aufmerksam machen .
Außerdem möchte ich anderen Austrittswilligen eine Hilfe sein zu ihrem Recht zu kommen .
Zum Glück sind von anderen Amtsgerichten in NRW auch positive Ausgänge zu vermelden , in denen z.B. Schüler problem - und kostenlos aus der Kirche austreten konnten .
Das AG
Aachen ist hier scheinbar schon ein außergewöhnliches Beispiel .
Der nächste Schritt ist nun eine Beschwerde gegen den Bescheid einzulegen , der erneut vom Amtsgericht geprüft werden muss .
Sollte diese Beschwerde abgelehnt werden bleibt nur noch die letzte Möglichkeit der Klage .
Der IBKA unterhält zum Glück einen Rechtshilfefond , der für solche Situationen eingerichtet wurde .
Sollte es hart auf hart kommen , muss ich mir also finanziell keine Sorgen machen , aufwändig könnte es aber noch werden .
Wem nun die 30 € aber total egal sind und wer nur so schnell wie möglich aus der Kirche austreten möchte , der kann das mit einer sehr schön gemachten ( aber wenig ernst gemeinten ) Austrittserklärung der taz machen .
Hier kann man zusätzlich zu dem formell Notwendigen noch ankreuzen ob einem die Kirche zu „ frauenfeindlich , schwulenfeindlich , judenfeindlich , reaktionär , pädophil , Ratzinger “ is t [ 8 ] .
Hier möchte ich nach einen Hinweis durch den IBKA aber nochmal darauf hinweisen , dass es tatsächlich keinerlei Begründung bedarf und das Formular wirklich nur als Scherz anzusehen ist !
Leider gab es nämlich auch schon den Fall , dass das Amstgericht einen Austrittsantrag abgelehnt hat , weil er nicht ausreichend begründet war .
Richtig ist aber , dass eine ‚ modifizierte ’ Austrittserklärung , also mit einem Zusatz wie einer Begründung , in Deutschland eigentlich gar nicht zulässig ist .
Im Internet findet man außerdem reichlich generelle Informationen und Hilfestellungen zum Austritt aus der Kirche :

A Brazilian judge has refused to grant a woman an abortion of a fetus developing without a brain after deciding " there was no imminent danger of death for the mother , " the daily Estado de Sao Paulo reported Tuesday .
The judge ruled that , under the circumstances , granting a termination of the pregnancy would violate the right to life enshrined in Brazilian law , which prohibits abortions with rare exceptions , the newspaper said in the report carried on its website .
Only cases of rape or a threat to the mother 's life can justify a legal abortion in Brazil .
Millions of women undergo voluntary abortions in the country in illicit operations that cost the lives of thousands each year , according to the health ministry .
The leftwing government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has sought to decriminalize abortions but has butted up against fierce opposition from the influential Catholic Church .
Lewis Hamilton has dismissed claims his aggressive driving style causes his tyres to deflate so often .
Joan Villadelprat , a F1 veteran who is bidding to bring his Spanish - based Le Mans team Epsilon Euskadi onto the grid next year , said after the Briton 's crash in Barcelona that Hamilton " needs to calm down . "
The tire deflation was one of several in Hamilton 's career so far , but McLaren has clarified that it was caused by a loose wheel nut leading to a failed rim .
" It makes me laugh to be honest , " Hamilton told the Daily Telegraph .
" Everyone always talks about my aggressive style .
Before they even knew what the issue was last week , they said 'he needs to calm down , he needs to look after his tyres , he needs to do this , he needs to do that , ' which is absolute rubbish .
" In actual fact , the way I look after my tyres , you know , I have grown a lot over the past couple of years .
In the last race the tyres were sweet , really sweet . "
Asked if he was more sensitive about the issue since the arrival of Jenson Button , whose style is very different , Hamilton said : " I 'm not really sensitive about it because [ other people 's opinions ] does n't really have any impact on me as such .
I know how to use my tyres . "
After Republicans twice stalled it , the America COMPETES
Act was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 262-150 .
Hurray !
I have the history of this bill outlined in an earlier post .
It failed the first time it went to vote because a Republican Congressman used some shameful politics to derail it , and the second time because to bring the Act to the House Floor for a vote , the Democratic majority had to put it in to pass with a 2/3 majority .
Too many Republicans still voted against it , claiming it was too much spending .
That , to be blunt , is garbage .
This
Act makes sure we have enough money funding science and technology to grow our economy .
Not passing it would be like eating your seed corn .
As Representative Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) says ,
" It should n’t take three votes to pass legislation to support the research vital to long term economic growth .
If half of economic growth in the last half century is attributable to technological developments and innovations , then we ca n’t afford to presume that U.S. leadership in innovation is a given .
If we intend to lead the global economy , we must tend to our innovation infrastructure , as this bill does . "
This bill will continue the funding of the first Act , which was passed with broad bipartisan support under the Bush Administration ( when Congress still had a Republican majority as well ) in 2007 .
This time , to get it passed , the Democrats did something clever ( I know ) :
When consideration resumed , Chairman Gordon moved a division of the question on the amendment included in the Republican Motion to Recommit passed by the House on May 13 .
This effort allowed the House to consider and vote separately on several parts of the Motion to Recommit .
Ha !
This " division of the question " forced Congressmen to vote separately on the amendments added last time to scuttle the bill , so they are on record .
This is clever because the first time the Republicans sank the bill , they did so by adding an amendment forbidding salaries to be paid to government employees who downloaded porn .
The only way to vote on the bill would have been to kill that amendment , so then the noise machine ( cough cough Fox cough ) could say the Democrats voted to pay people who surf porn on government machines * .
By forcing this amendment - by - amendment vote , the Democrats could vote for the porn amendment , shutting down the right - wing machine before it can even get started .
Even so , I 'll note that only 17 out of 167 Republicans voting voted to pass the bill .
Every Democrat voted to pass it , and every single one of the 150 no votes came from the right .
Fascinating .
The bottom line is , I am very happy this finally passed .
It will fund a lot of science research as well as educational efforts for the next few years .
As Rep .
Holt points out , science always pays off far more than you invest , always .
America will be better off and stronger because of this .
^* See ?
I told you it was shameful .

With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard last August , Apple rolled out a rudimentary antimalware feature which allows the operating system to detect specific malware threats in downloads and warn users accordingly .
Far from offering true antivirus functionality , however , the feature requires that Apple manually update a property list file in OS X if it wishes to add entries to its watch list .
Security firm Sophos today notes that Apple has finally offered an update to the antimalware features watch list with Mac OS X 10.6.4 , expanding for the first time beyond the two threats included at Snow Leopard 's launch .
The addition includes multiple entries for identifying what Apple calls " OSX.HellRTS " .
HellRTS , which Sophos products have been detecting as OSX / Pinhead - B since April , has been distributed by malicious hackers disguised as iPhoto , the photo application which ships on modern Mac computers .
If you did get infected by this malware then hackers would be able to send spam email from your Mac , take screenshots of what you are doing , access your files and clipboard and much more .
As a firm that writes and sells antivirus software , Sophos unsurprisingly takes the position that Apple 's antimalware feature , while welcome , is insufficient for proper protection against threats .
In fact , the blog post from Sophos notes that nowhere in the Mac OS X 10.6.4 documentation does Apple announce this antimalware , leading to speculation by Sophos that Apple is simply trying to downplay security threats for marketing purposes and thus providing users with a false sense of security .
I can’t believe they want coffee .
Granted , it is 9:30 a.m. when I pick up my friends Jim and Lenora at the Portland airport .
But in the weeks I ’ve anticipated their visit , I ’ve had beer on my brain .
FOR THE RECORD :
Portland restaurant :
An article in Sunday ’s Travel section on microbreweries in Portland , Ore. , misspelled the name of the Indian restaurant Vindalho as Vindahlo . —
Jim is a home brewer — or was , back in the dark ages before the microbrewery renaissance .
Some of my fondest memories of our long friendship involve conversations over bottles cooled in the crawlspace of his New Mexico house .
So I was eager to show off , if not my own brewing chops , those of my new hometown .
With about 40 small breweries in town — new ones open so frequently it ’s hard to keep track —
Portland has overtaken Munich , Germany , as the brewing capital of the world .
But numbers alone do n’t capture Portland ’s status among true beer aficionados , the kind who would sooner quaff hemlock than a Miller or a Bud .
There ’s something about this most livable of cities that encourages innovation .
“ You ’ve got to have the right culture of people , ” says Marc C. Martin , a local beer writer who is launching a brewery tour business .
“ Portland is eco-friendly , green , bicycling , Birkenstock - wearing — it ’s a culture that lends itself to unusual and unique things . ”

Nationwide , so - called craft breweries account for only about 4 % of all beer consumed ( in Oregon , it ’s 12 % ) , but they inspire near - religious devotion .
Oregon ’s breweries draw more tourists than its fabled wineries , according to a 2006 study conducted for the state .
But Portland is known for great coffee too .
So from the airport we make a beeline to Helser ’s , a breakfast spot in the city ’s northeast quadrant , for caffeine and generous plates of buttermilk pancakes and salmon hash .
Thus fortified , we head to our first beer tasting — at the Portland Farmers Market .
Do you sense a theme here ?
Portlanders are passionate about fresh , local food , whether vegetables , cheese or beer made from just - picked hops .
Fueling Oregon beer mania is the abundance and variety of hops planted here .
Beer ’s other key ingredients are plentiful as well : top-quality water , barley for making malt and a laboratory that is one of the nation ’s two main producers of brewer ’s yeast .
My goal at the bustling market , held Saturdays on the Portland State University campus , is a stall operated by Upright Brewing .
Though just a year old , it is generating lots of chatter among beer geeks .

Jim lifts a small plastic cup of Gose beer to his nose and inhales deeply .
The cacophony of the market fades .
We could be in Paris for a wine judging .
“ Citrus , ” he says .
Inhales again .
“ Lemon . ”
He takes a sip , making little lip - smacking sounds .
“ Effervescent , ” he says .
I ca n’t tell whether he ’s just humoring me .
Upright is — and is n’t — a classic example of Portland craft beer .
It is n’t “ hoppy , ” a heavy - on - the - hops style that has come to define Pacific Northwest ales .
But in creating something that ’s not typical , Upright owner and brewer Alex Ganum is very much in the Portland tradition .
Advertisement
Many of his beers are Belgian and French farmhouse - style ales .
Gose is an obscure German - style wheat beer with the unusual addition of coriander and salt , the latter contributing that hint of sparkle .
We taste Upright ’s light and refreshing Four , named for the percentage of alcohol it contains , and the dry Flora Rustica , then go in search of a classic hoppy ale .
But man cannot live on beer alone , so first we stop at Quintana Galleries .
Jim and Lenora are avid collectors of Pueblo Indian art from New Mexico .
Quintana — owned , it turns out , by a former New Mexican — carries dazzling examples of Northwest coast masks , boxes and intricately carved panels .
The gallery is in Portland ’s Pearl District , blocks of downtown warehouses converted to shops , restaurants — and pubs .
We stop at the first one we come to , Rogue Ales Public House , where we are promptly overwhelmed by the 32 beers on tap .

Jim orders the Juniper Pale Ale ; he pronounces the after - taste more bitter than floral .
( Bitter is not an insult but a characteristic of hoppy beer . )
Lenora has the Mocha Porter .
“ Delicious , ” she says , “ A hint of chocolate on the back of the tongue . ”
I settle on the Château Rogue Single Malt Ale with floral hops and a slightly sweet aftertaste .
We nurse our beers at a sidewalk picnic table until the patchy sunshine gives way to rain .
Fortunately , we ’re within dashing distance of Powell ’s City of Books , the grand dame of independent bookstores , with more than 1 million new and used volumes .

After an hour , we ’ve browsed up a thirst .
The tiny Tugboat Brewing Co. is tucked away on a downtown side street .
It is as different from the Rogue pub as a pilsner is from a stout .
Where Rogue is busy and a bit overwhelming , Tugboat has just six house beers on tap and a chatty bartender to guide our choices .
The brew pub specializes in British - style ales , but its forte is its cozy ambience , with book - lined walls and wooden , lamp - lighted library tables .
Nixing plans for a brew - pub dinner , Lenora lobbies for Vindahlo , an Indian restaurant featuring Northwest ingredients .
We feast on roasted pumpkin samosas with fresh mint chutney , saag paneer with house - made cheese , fresh spinach and tomato masala , and tender , organic lamb braised in coconut milk , chilies and curry leaves .

Like any self - respecting Portland eatery , Vindahlo has Oregon beers on tap .
We order a hoppy , citric Double Mountain India Pale Ale , brewed in Hood River , Ore. , and an amber ale from Eugene ’s Oakshire Brewing Co .
The next day we achieve Beervana .
First , the requisite coffee , from the Blue Kangaroo , my neighborhood roastery .
Then a long ramble through Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge on the Willamette River , Portland ’s east - west divide .
After walking up a thirst , we head to Hopworks Urban Brewery to quench it .
The 2 - year - old Hopworks is the quintessential Portland brewery :
Its ales are crafted from organically grown ingredients in an eco-friendly building .
It even has a traveling bike bar : a locally built cargo bicycle that holds two kegs beneath an inlaid wood bar .
Advertisement
The beer itself is so enticing we order a sampler for the table : oversized shot glasses of all six of Hopworks ’ regular ales plus four seasonals , or one - offs .
Our friendly waitress throws in a bonus — cask - conditioned versions of two of the beers .
“ They ’re all organic , so they ’re good for you , ” she assures us as she sets down the tray .
In a town where brewmasters are rock stars ( albeit understated , Portland rock stars ) , Hopworks owner and brewer Christian Ettinger is Elvis .
He makes beers to swoon over .
Lenora favors a seven - grain stout made with Stumptown Hairbender espresso ( that coffee thing again ) .
I am intrigued by the Secession Black IPA , a dark ale that tastes like a pale one .
Jim is looking rhapsodic over the Gold Medal - winning regular IPA , especially the cask - conditioned version , an unfiltered , unpasteurized ale with no added carbonation .
That night over dinner at Alameda Brewhouse in the city ’s northeast quadrant , we order vegetarian burgers ( made with the brewer ’s spent grain ) and down three fine examples of very different beers : a single - hop pale ale , an unusual Belgian - style IPA and a porter .
“ How many breweries does Portland have ? ” Jim asks on the way to the airport .

“ Forty , ” I tell him .
“ We ’ve barely dented them ! ” he says .
I know he ’ll be back .

It 's not as bad as getting on the wrong side of the Soup Nazi , but Lady Gaga has drawn verbal fire from comedian / baseball fan Jerry Seinfeld for her recent antics at the two New York ballparks .
PHOTO GALLERY : Lady Gaga
" I do n't understand how this is good for her , but I 'm sure she understands her milieu better than I ever could , " Seinfeld said in an interview on New York radio station WFAN , according to ESPNNewYork.com .
The comedian said he can't believe Mets officials put Gaga in his unoccupied private box without his permission after she flipped off photographers taking pictures of her in the box seats at Citi Field on July 10 .
" You give people the finger and you get upgraded ?
Is that the world we 're living in now ? "
Seinfeld joked .
Last weekend , she created another scene , showing up at Yankee Stadium with a team jersey half - buttoned ( revealing her black bra ) , fish - net stockings and a bikini bottom .
" Oh please , " Seinfeld said .
" Wake me when it 's over .
Get an act .
Rhinestone bikinis and giving people the finger . "

Trust is absolutely critical to any attorney - client relationship .
Unfortunately , some lawyers today do n’t seem to understand that trust is also a two - way street .
No one owes it to you ; you have to earn it .
Since 1979 , professionals at the law offices of Andrew Rubin have been earning the trust of individuals and business clients in Essex County , and throughout northern and central New Jersey .
Doris Eaton Travis , the last of the " Ziegfeld girls " , has died at 106 .
People toss around the term " end of an era , " but rarely is it so apt :
Between 1907 and 1930 , showman Flo Ziegfeld 's " follies " epitomized Broadway glitz .
The shows contained comedy and variety , but were known for one constant : the comely , extravagantly - costumed " Ziegfeld girls . "
As The New York Times describes them in Travis ' obituary , " Beneath towering , glittering , feathered headdresses , the Ziegfeld Girls floated across grand Broadway stages in lavish pageants known as the Ziegfeld Follies , often to the wistful tune that Irving Berlin wrote just for them : " A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody . "
Advertisement
Travis , in addition to being the oldest Ziegfeld girl , may also have been amongst the youngest : she lied about her age and began performing at 14 .
" Doris began as a chorus girl and understudy to the show 's star .
In 1919 , she wore a red costume and played the paprika part in the salad dance .
In 1920 , she had a solo , a jazzy tap dance . "
After the follies , she performed in various venues and claims to have originated " Singin ' in the Rain . "
During the Depression , she taught at an Arthur Murray school and was reduced to taxi- dancing .
Later , she married and , with her husband , raised quarter - horses in Oklahoma .
In her 70s , she earned first a high school diploma and later a college degree , graduating Phi Beta Kappa at 88 .
But she never gave up performing completely :
In 2007 , Oakland University in Michigan gave Mrs. Travis an honorary doctorate .
She responded by singing and dancing " Ballin ' the Jack , " a song popularized by Lillian Lorraine , a renowned Ziegfeld Follies ' star .
A little more than two weeks ago Mrs. Travis returned to Broadway to appear again at the annual Easter Bonnet Competition held by Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS , this time at the Minskoff Theater .
She did a few kicks , apologizing that she no longer performed cartwheels .
Advertisement
The " Follies " have been the source of nostalgia for years - think Sondheim ''s 1971 musical - but it's only now that the era can truly be said to have ended .
It 's not just about the glam - what Travis , in an interview , termed " beauty and elegance like a French painting of a woman 's body " - but the hard - boiled grit of these career performers .
Like the late June Havoc , Travis was born into show - business and knew no other life .
It was a tough one .
And these were tough ladies .
It may be a cliche , but seriously : they do n't make 'em like that anymore .

For the first time , scientists have detected clear signs of recent lava flows on the surface of Venus .
The observations reveal that volcanoes on Venus appeared to erupt between a few hundred years to 2.5 million years ago .
This suggests the planet may still be geologically active , making Venus one of the few worlds in our solar system that has been volcanically active within the last 3 million years .
The evidence comes from the European Space Agency 's Venus Express mission , which has been in orbit around the planet since April 2006 .
The science results were laid over topographic data from NASA 's Magellan spacecraft .
Magellan radar - mapped 98 percent of the surface and collected high - resolution gravity data while orbiting Venus from 1990 to 1994 .
Scientists see compositional differences compared to the surrounding landscape in three volcanic regions .
Relatively young lava flows have been identified by the way they emit infrared radiation .
These observations suggest Venus is still capable of volcanic eruptions .
The findings appear in the April 8 edition of the journal Science .
" The geological history of Venus has long been a mystery , " said Sue Smrekar , a scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , and lead author of the paper describing the work .
" Previous spacecraft gave us hints of volcanic activity , but we did n't know how long ago that occurred .
Now we have strong evidence right at the surface for recent eruptions . "
The volcanic provinces , or hotspots , on which Smrekar and her team focused are geologically similar to Hawaii .
Scientists previously detected plumes of hot rising material deep under Venus ' surface .
Those plumes are thought to have produced significant volcanic eruptions .
Other data from the planet suggest that volatile gases commonly spewed from volcanoes were breaking down in its atmosphere .
The rate of volcanism will help scientists determine how the interior of the planet works and how gases emitted during eruptions affect climate .
Something is smoothing Venus ' surface , because the planet has only about 1,000 craters , a relatively small amount compared to other bodies in our solar system .
Scientists think it may be the result of volcanic activity and want to know if it happens quickly or slowly .
The Venus Express results suggest a gradual sequence of smaller volcanic eruptions as opposed to a cataclysmic volcanic episode that resurfaces the entire planet with lava .
Smrekar and her team also discovered that several volcanic features in the regions they studied show evidence of minerals found in recent lava flows .
These mineral processes correspond to the youngest volcanic flows in each region , giving scientists additional support for the idea they formed during recent volcanic activity .
On Earth , lava flows react rapidly with oxygen and other elements in the atmosphere when they erupt to the surface .
On Venus , the process is similar , although it is more intense and changes the outer layer more substantially .
Scientists call Venus Earth 's sister planet because of similarities in size , mass , density and volume .
Scientists deduce that both planets shared a common origin , forming at the same time about 4.5 billion years ago .
Venus also is the planet on which the runaway greenhouse effect was discovered .
The planet is cloaked in a much less friendly atmosphere than that found on Earth .
It is composed chiefly of carbon dioxide , which generates a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead , and a surface pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth .
The small group of worlds in our solar system known to be volcanically active today includes Earth and Jupiter 's moon Io .
Crater counts on Mars also have suggested recent lava flows .
Scientists are studying evidence of another kind of active volcanism that involves ice - spewing volcanoes on other moons in our solar system .
NASA sponsored Smrekar 's research .
The European Space Agency built and manages Venus Express .
JPL is managed for NASA by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .

MILWAUKEE — Josh Fraundorf remembers when yellow perch were so plentiful in Lake Michigan that people pulled out all they could eat with just a bamboo pole and some worms .
Now , they have to come to places like this old factory south of downtown .
With the lake 's population of wild perch decimated , Mr. Fraundorf is helping the fish make an unlikely ...
Updated : On Tuesday night , Rand Paul stood as the victorious symbol of the Tea Party after capturing the Republican nomination for senator in Kentucky by defeating an opponent who had the backing of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Senate minority leader .
But throughout the primary campaign , Democrats – and some Republicans – had said that Mr. Paul would prove to be a much stronger candidate in the limited field of a primary than in a general election .
Democrats had made no secret that they would prefer to run against Mr. Paul than his opponent , Trey Grayson , the secretary of state , a more moderate and politically experienced choice .
And since Tuesday , the reason for Democrats ’ optimism — and for the apprehension of Republicans like Mr. McConnell – has become clear as Mr. Paul has struggled to account for his views on issues like segregation , and to explain why a candidate of the Tea Party would hold his victory night celebration at a posh country club in Bowling Green .
In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC , Mr. Paul appeared uncertain about whether he would have supported forcing private businesses to desegregate in the 1960s , suggesting that might run afoul of his libertarian philosophy .
His views emerged as Ms. Maddow asked Mr. Paul if he thought a private business had the right to refuse service to a patron who was black .
( Mr. Paul ’s campaign issued a statement late Thursday morning following the Maddow interview , in which he said he supported the Civil Rights Act .
It appears below . )

“ I ’m not in favor of any discrimination of any form , ” he said . “ I would never belong to any club that excluded anybody for race .
We still do have private clubs in America that can discriminate based on race . ”
But things got murky from there in the interview : “ Well , what it gets into is , is that then if you decide that restaurants are publicly owned and not privately owned , then do you say that you should have the right to bring your gun into a restaurant , even though the owner of the restaurant says , well , no , we do n’t want to have guns in here ?
The bar says we do n’t want to have guns in here , because people might drink and start fighting and shoot each other .
Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant ?
Or does the government own his restaurant ? ”
Democrats were quick to pounce , suggesting that the interview showed that Mr. Paul in fact thought that private businesses had the right to refuse service to patrons based on race .
Update : Mr. Paul ’s campaign issued a statement this morning in response to the uproar over his remarks .
In it , he said that he supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the landmark anti-discrimination law . :
“ I believe we should work to end all racism in American society and staunchly defend the inherent rights of every person , ” he said .
“ I have clearly stated in prior interviews that I abhor racial discrimination and would have worked to end segregation .
Even though this matter was settled when I was 2 , and no serious people are seeking to revisit it except to score cheap political points , I unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . ”
Mr. Paul disputed the claim by opponents that he would support repealing the Civil Rights Act .
“ These attacks prove one thing for certain : the liberal establishment is desperate to keep leaders like me out of office , and we are sure to hear more wild , dishonest smears during this campaign , ” he said .
And in an interview on “ Good Morning America ” on ABC , Mr. Paul argued that his decision to hold his election night celebration at a fancy country club was not in any way at variance with the grass - roots movement he has now come to epitomize .
And in the process of explaining his decision , Mr. Paul invoked Tiger Woods , the golfer .
“ I think at one time , people used to think of golf and golf clubs and golf courses as being exclusive , ” Mr. Paul said , adding , “ Tiger Woods has helped to broaden that , in the sense that he ’s brought golf to a lot of the cities and to city youth . ”
These interviews have come at a propitious time for Democrats , who greeted Mr. Paul ’s victory by noting past interviews in which he hinted at views that appear out of the mainstream , like his favoring abolishing the Department of Education and the income tax , and raising the retirement age .

Inside the Ricoh Coliseum , it was a reception worthy of a rock star : lights , cameras , screaming and applause .
The honouree Sunday morning was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who made a pit stop in Toronto to speak to more than 7,000 supporters hours before the annual Walk with Israel parade .
While the crowds inside cheered , hundreds of protestors outside the Princes ’ Gates at Exhbition Place voiced their concerns .
Netanyahu arrived in Canada on Sunday for a visit that includes a meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa on Monday .
This was the first time since 1978 an Israeli prime minister has spoken in Toronto .
Netanyahu offered his gratitude toward the local Jewish community and the Canadian government for its unequivocal support of Israel .
“ Our ties , the ties between Canada and Israel have never been stronger , ” said Netanyahu , who was speaking from behind bulletproof glass .
“ This comes from the people and comes from the government .
“ Prime Minister Harper has been an unwavering friend of Israel .
He ’s been a great champion of Israel ’s right to defend himself .
And he stands against all the efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state . ”
Netanyahu also spoke about preventing Iran from acquiring “ weapons of mass death , ” ensuring a future Palestinian state is demilitarized and achieving a peace built around security .
Outside , more than 200 demonstrators stood behind a banner that read “ War Criminals Not Welcome Here ” and denounced Netanyahu ’s visit .
They accused him of breaking international law and denying Palestinians access to basic human rights , like clean water and medicine .
“ We ’re sending a message to Netanyahu .
What you ’re doing in Palestine is unacceptable and what ’s happening to the Palestinian people is simply illegal , ” said Rafeef Ziadah , an organizer with the Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid .
The demonstrators were a smorgasbord of diversity , including everyone from Palestinian refugees to orthodox rabbis .
Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss accused Israel and its prime minister of hijacking the Jewish identity for a nationalistic cause .
“ What ’s being done in our name is murder and we ca n’t stand by silently .
World , wake up , ” he said as a crowd cheered behind him .
On the other side of Strachan Ave. , about 100 supporters carried Israeli flags in a bid of support for Netanyahu .
Meir Weinstein , national director of the Jewish Defense League , said it is important for Canada to support Israel because it is “ the beacon of democracy in the Middle East . ”
“ People on the other side of the street represent a view that would send us back to the dark ages , ” he said .
The pro-Palestinian crowd dispersed around 11 a.m. , before Netanyahu took the stage .
“ We sent our message , ” said Ziadah , “ He ’s not worth us getting heat stroke over . ”
Security was tight around the building with more than a dozen police officers , some on horses , standing by the gates to the CNE grounds .
Inside the hall , dozens of officers stood in front of the stage .
The supporters who wanted to get in to see Netanyahu speak underwent security checks and had to check all bags before entering the arena .

The United Jewish Appeal ’s walk is expected to raise $ 500,000 , which will benefit the children of Bat Yam , a poor community in Israel .
In 2002 , organizers had to cancel a Netanyahu speech at Montreal ’s Concordia University after an angry reaction from students and activists .
Canada recently urged the resumption of Middle East peace talks and has called the expansion of Jewish settlements a barrier to peace .

Justice Ginsburg wrote that those who dispute her interpretation of the Constitution can " shove a fat one so far up their ass they choke . "
WASHINGTON — In a decisive and vulgar 7 - 2 ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court once again upheld the constitution 's First Amendment this week , calling the freedom of expression among the most " inalienable and important rights that a motherfucker can have . "
Advertisement
" It is the opinion of this court that the right to speak without censorship or fear of intimidation is fundamental to a healthy democracy , " Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority .
" Furthermore , the court finds that the right to say whatever the hell you want , whenever the hell you want , is not only a founding tenet , but remains essential to the continued success of this nation . "
Added Ginsburg , " In short , freedom of speech means the freedom of fucking speech , you ignorant cocksuckers . "

The decision came Monday in response to the case of a Charleston , WV theater troupe that had been sued by city officials for staging a sexually explicit play with public funds .
Reversing the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ' decision , the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the theater , an outcome free - speech advocates are calling a victory and Justice Ginsburg called " a bitch - slap in the face of all those uptight limp - dicks . "

The ruling in City of Charleston v. The Kanawha Players marks the first time in 220 years that the nation 's highest court has taken such a fiercely profane stance .
During oral arguments , Charleston 's chief counsel Dan Roy said his clients could restrict any public speech they deemed offensive , an argument quickly dismissed by Justice John Paul Stevens , 90 , who turned to his colleagues and made a repeated up - and - down hand motion intended to simulate masturbation .
Advertisement
" I 'm beginning to wonder if you really understand what ' abridging the freedom of speech ' means at all , " said Stevens , a 34 - year veteran of the court known for his often - nuanced interpretations of the First Amendment .
" I 'm also wondering whether you and your fat - faced plaintiffs over there need to have some respect for constitutionally protected expression fucked into your empty hick skulls . "
Justice Clarence Thomas , who voted with the majority , wrote a concurring opinion in which he made little mention of established court precedents but emphasized that he himself had viewed materials " way , way nastier than this stupid play . "

" I do n't know what kind of bullshit passes for jurisprudence down in the 4th Circuit these days , " Thomas wrote .
" But those pricks can take their arguments about speech that ' appeals only to prurient interests ' and go suck a dog's asshole . "
Added Thomas , " Just suck it .
Get in there and seriously suck it . "
Writing in dissent , however , Justice Antonin Scalia contemplated the limits of the constitutional guarantee of free speech .
Advertisement
" The court has an interest in protecting meaningful human communication , which is jeopardized when every other word out of someone 's mouth is ' F this ' or ' F that , ' " Scalia wrote .
" In practice , such an expansion of free expression becomes far too unwieldy and large to accommodate . "
To which Justice Ginsberg immediately replied , " Yeah , that 's what his mom said . "
Conservative constitutional scholars have criticized the Supreme Court 's decision , calling it not only a license to provoke , but also an act of provocation in itself , one that saw several justices repeatedly refer to the plaintiffs as " fuckwits , " " asshats , " and " cumsacks " before informing them that with their appeals exhausted , their only remaining legal recourse would be to " piss up a rope or take two fists in the mommy slot . "

More than 18 months after the suit was first brought against the theater group , defense lawyers said the road to the Supreme Court was " hard as shit , " but well worth it .
" This is a historic victory for free speech , and I would n't be surprised if , a hundred years from now , the hallowed walls of this court bear an inscription taken from the eloquent decision handed down today , " lead defense attorney Carl Huddleston said .
" Particularly the phrase ' That which erodes human rights serves to erode humanity , fuckface . ' "
I think there should be a " Bad Theology " column , along the lines of Ben Goldacre 's " Bad Science " column in the Guardian .
There would be no shortage of candidates and , while some atheists would qualify , so would many theologians .
But to refer to bad theology implies that there 's also good theology – a suggestion which would be ridiculed by those who regard all theology as being on a par with studying tooth fairies and orbiting teapots .
So what is good theology ?
The response to that question would depend on who you ask .
The word " theology " comes from the Greek theos and logos , which could be translated as reasoning about God .
Although there are Jewish , Muslim and other non-Christian theologies , I write as a Catholic theologian with a feminist bias .
( John Ruskin described the study of theology as a " dangerous science " for women ) .
Sometimes , debates between theologians and scientists give the impression that God is a being who can be spoken of objectively like any other being .
To borrow a phrase from philosopher Grace Jantzen , they speak as if God is " an infinitely extended ( and disembodied ) version of an Oxford professor " who may or may not exist .
But as good theologians know , the word " God " does not refer to anything that the human mind can comprehend , so theological language has at its heart an all - pervasive mystery which haunts human consciousness .
The task of theology is like Penelope weaving her shroud – what we weave during the day we must unravel by night .
That is why theology is derided by those who insist that all claims to knowledge must be rooted in rationality and factual evidence .
Classical theology understands
God not as a being but as the very condition of all being , so that the word " being " is better understood as a verb than a noun .
" The being of God is the doing of the world " , to quote one theologian writing about Thomas Aquinas .
Good theology approaches the question of God not as this or that being , but as the continuous activity of creating and sustaining all being , as the redeemer of creation from within through the incarnation of Jesus Christ , and as the revealing love of the holy spirit .
To speak of the existence of God in this sense is more like speaking of the existence of love or beauty than of mountains or daffodils .
We say that love exists , not only because it affects our world but also because we look for evidence of its existence in the ways in which people who use that word behave towards one another .
Good theology involves doing as well as thinking , for the theologian must give material expression to her use of the word " God " in a way that counts as meaningful .
Theology is at its best when it works in a triangular relationship with scripture , creation and culture , continuously asking how the texts and traditions of the Christian faith are to be interpreted in the light of the questions of our time .
According to the classic doctrine of grace , articulated by Aquinas , " grace perfects nature " , so that there is no inherent contradiction between faith and reason , theology and science .
Good theology serves as an intellectual rudder which steers faith along the narrow pathway between tradition and transformation , mystery and knowledge , contemplation and action , always seeking to bring the claims of revelation into creative dialogue with the discoveries of science and other forms of human understanding .
But theology also belongs within the secular study of the history of ideas , since it has had a formative influence in the making of the western world in its beliefs and values and its forms of artistic and cultural expression .
To deny theology 's historical significance is to succumb to the anti-intellectualism of a rigid secularist ideology which infects many modern universities .
Those who lack any theological education simply do not have the resources for a meaningful engagement with much of western history and culture .
The refusal to allow theology a place in the university also plays into the hands of religious extremists , for it suggests that religion is only for the ignorant and the credulous , leaving vast numbers of the world 's people at the mercy of bigots , tyrants and madmen .
To do theology well is to empower people to resist religion 's co-option by the powers of fanaticism and violence , and that is why the theological education of women is particularly important .
John Ruskin was right – it is dangerous for women to study theology , not for women themselves but for a male theological elite which continues to exercise power in the name of a God it seeks to control .
Good theology challenges claims to knowledge of God which refuse to engage with the demands of justice and reason , providing reason is understood not in the narrow terms of scientific rationalism but more broadly as the ability to give a coherent account of what one believes and why .
Finally , theology is concerned with questions about the conditions under which science is possible at all : why is there something rather than nothing , and why is that something intelligible to human consciousness ?
To ask such questions is human .
To answer them may be divine .
Young mother used sunbeds five times a week ... now she is facing death from cancer
She once used sunbeds up to five times a week because she thought her tan ' made her look healthy ' .
But Joanne Cobb 's obsession with having a golden glow has left her facing a possible death sentence .
She has found herself battling nodular melanoma , an aggressive form of skin cancer , and has had to accept that her four young boys could be left without a mother .
' Tanorexic ' : Mrs Cobb with , from left , Alfie , Jack , Harry and Archie
The disease spread through her blood into her groin and pelvis and she had to have glands all over her body removed .
Doctors have given her the all - clear for now but say there is a 50 per cent chance the disease will return within five years - and if it does , it will be fatal .
' I feel like I am living on borrowed time , ' said Mrs Cobb , 28 .
' I worry all the time about what will happen if I die .
Missing out on my boys growing up is the thing that devastates me most .
' The thought of them being left without a mother makes me cry . '
Mrs Cobb , a mother to Jack , ten , Harry , three , and twins Alfie and Archie , 21 months , said she was ' indescribably angry ' with herself for being what she calls a tanorexic .
Possible death sentence : Mrs Cobb has had to accept that her four young boys could be left without a mother
I just wish I could turn back the clock , ' she said .
' If I had n't ignored the risks I would never have found myself in this position .
' I try not to think about it , but the reality is that my life will be a lot shorter thanks to skin cancer . '
Mrs Cobb , from Gravesend , Kent , was 15 when she first went on a sunbed and she soon became addicted to having a tan .
Between the ages of 21 and 23 , she used sunbeds five times a week .
On holidays abroad she would spend hours in the sun with little skin protection .
' I would definitely describe myself as tanorexic , ' she said .
' It reached the point where I would feel panicked every time my tan started to fade . '
Days after her wedding to Andrew , 33 , in July 2009 , she discovered a mole on her leg was a malignant melanoma .
' I immediately made the connection between the condition and all those years I had spent in the sun , ' she said .
' I vowed there and then never to go on a sunbed again . '
In April this year Mrs Cobb was told the cancer had spread and she had lymph nodes removed .
If the cancer returns , doctors say there will be nothing they can do .
Her husband , who is a restaurant manager , said : ' I try to stay positive and hope . '
Caroline Cerny , from Cancer Research UK , said : ' Every time you use a sunbed you damage the DNA in your skin , increasing your risk of developing skin cancer and speeding up the ageing process . '
Acid reflux is painful .
Food and acid splash into the esophagus and cause belching , heartburn and , in some severe cases , chest pains .
Some individuals have experienced pain so intense they thought they had a heart attack .
If a person experiences acid reflux — also called gastroesophageal reflux — on a regular basis , the acids will irritate the esophagus , which may advance to scarring , ulceration , swelling , or hemorrhaging .
What is the risk of acid reflux ?
Many experts agree , if acid reflux persists , it can even lead to esophageal cancer . [ 1 ]
If you suffer from acid reflux , take inventory of your life and determine what 's causing or exacerbating the concern .
Start off with a review of dietary habits .
Changing your diet is crucial in eliminating and preventing acid reflux .
[ 2 ]
There are other measures you can take ; here is a video describing six of them .
Top 6 Natural Remedies for Acid Reflux Length : 4 minutes
6 Natural Remedies for Balancing Acid Reflux
1. Balance Your Hydrochloric Acid Levels
Increasing natural production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach is the first step to preventing acid reflux for many people .
I recommend taking a plant - derived betaine HCL supplement before meals .
[ 3 ]
This is extremely effective in preventing acid reflux for many people .
I also recommend you replace cheap table salt with high - quality sea salt .
I use and recommend Himalayan crystal salt because it contains chloride and dozens of trace minerals the body needs .
2. Change Your Diet
Processed foods and sugars are almost a guaranteed way to worsen acid reflux and create a bacterial imbalance in the stomach and intestinal tract .
[ 4 ]
To combat this , change your diet !
Eat more fresh and raw organic fruits and vegetables .
People struggling with acid reflux should be careful to avoid common trigger foods , like tomatoes , sugar , chocolate , garlic , spicy chilies , and high - fat foods .
Check out my body cleansing diet article for more information on an overall healthy approach to eating .
Taking a probiotic supplement like FloraTrex™ will also help balance the gut with good bacteria .
3 . Take a Digestive Enzyme Supplement
Enzymes are found in abundance in raw food , but the act of cooking food over 116° Fahrenheit destroys the health - promoting enzymes in most cases .
Living and raw foods are high in nutrients and contain active enzymes [ 5 ] that are crucial to combat acid reflux .
There are also many good enzyme supplements available ; I recommend VeganZyme™ .
4. Raw Organic Apple Cider Vinegar
Taking one tablespoon of raw organic apple cider vinegar mixed in about 4 ounces of purified water before each meal can help .
This helps calm the stomach and supports digestion .
[ 6 , 7 ]
It 's my favorite , fast - acting home remedy for acid reflux .
5. Take Organic Baking Soda
Bicarbonate is a wonder product .
Mix a spoonful in a glass of water , stir , and drink before it stops fizzing .
[ 8 ]
However , some doctors are skeptical , so if you have high blood pressure or if you are on a sodium - restricted diet it 's best to get advice first .
6. Take Organic Aloe Vera
Aloe vera is commonly used to calm an upset stomach , diarrhea , occasional constipation , and systemic redness and swelling associated with bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis .[ 9 , 10 , 11 ] Inner
Aloe vera leaf gel supports digestion and can be another great alternative to soothing acid reflux . [ 11 ]
Some studies on aloe have shown inconclusive results , but the good news is they also found few adverse side effects ; in other words aloe is quite safe . [ 11 ]
Additional Tips
I also suggest a full body cleanse , beginning with a comprehensive colon cleanse .
Accumulated toxins from processed foods and sugars can disrupt digestion and lead to acid reflux symptoms .
Regularly performing a full body cleanse can flush out your system and help promote acid balance . [ 12 ]
Eliminating the discomfort of acid reflux can be done without expensive over - the - counter medications .
There are many natural remedies readily available .
Feel better naturally ; your body will thank you !

There has been tremendous criticism in the media of late regarding BP 's response to the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and the subsequent spilling of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
An ABC news / Washington
Post poll shows that 81 percent of those polled stated they thought unfavorably of the response by BP to the spill .
The same poll shows that nearly two - thirds of those responding favor criminal charges against BP and other companies involved in the spill .
Although I am not one to condone negligence or malice , I have no intention of adding my voice to the chorus bashing BP .
After all , they are one of many companies providing fuel for our cars , generating electricity to power our homes , and enabling so many aspects of our lives today .
I could not readily type this short article , and expect to send it to an editor who will read it within a few hours and let me know whether he is interested , without companies like BP .
Instead , I want to illustrate that while BP is being bashed for the company - wide effort to contain its recent spill in the Gulf of Mexico ( amidst cries for government to " DO SOMETHING ! " ) , the spill is so difficult to deal with precisely because of government intervention in the marketplace .
Government Intervention : A Major Contributor to the Mess
After first hearing about the problem BP as a company currently faces , I became curious about the positions of oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico .
I am no expert , but drilling in over five thousand feet of water sounds hard .
So , I searched for something to show me where the platforms are located and found the following map , which I find useful for discussion .
I 've seen the total number of platforms estimated at around 4,000 , with up to 100 drilling rigs operating at a time .
One of the interesting things to me about this map is that it shows no rigs in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico .
It turns out this is due to a moratorium on drilling first put in place by President Bush in 1990 .
In 1998 , President Clinton extended the moratorium until 2012 .
So , one government intervention has resulted in a situation in which drilling operations are constrained west of the border between Alabama and Mississippi , with a concentration of drilling off the coast of Louisiana .
Another interesting thing I noticed is that there are many platforms that are a great distance from the shoreline — particularly off the Louisiana coast .
Wondering why this is the case , I did some research and found one particularly compelling explanation .
Incentivizing Risk
In 1995 , President Bill Clinton signed into law the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act ( DWRRA ) , which was " intended to encourage natural - gas and oil development in the Gulf of Mexico in waters at least 200 meters ( 656 feet ) deep by offering royalty relief on qualifying natural gas and oil lease sales . "
This act has since expired , but there remain continued incentives for drilling in deep water .
For example , a report from the DOE written in 2005 states that after the conditions of the DWRRA expired in 2000
the MMS adopted a program which determines royalty relief on a lease - specific basis .
Under the revised method , leases located in the same water depth may have different volumes exempt from royalty charges if the economic conditions vary .
For example , if one natural gas field is more expensive to access , then it may potentially receive more royalty relief than a field in the same water depth with lower costs to access .
In other words , the government specifically passed laws that gave the oil companies incentives to drill far offshore — that is , in deeper water where risk is presumably higher .
In addition to the higher risk of accidents , the cost of solving any problems are necessarily greater in five thousand feet of water than in , say , 250 feet of water .
How much of an incentive was there to drill in deeper water ?
The same DOE report contains the following table .
It seems that it would have been downright foolish for a company to spend much effort drilling in shallow , more easily accessible regions nearer to the coastline , when by law there was a five - fold incentive for them to go out into deeper waters .
Who could blame a company for trying to achieve a minimum relief volume , which would guarantee billions of dollars in royalty - free sales of petroleum and natural gas ?
To see how this affected the amount of oil taken from deep waters , let 's examine a second table from the same DOE report .
As is seen from this table , the production of crude oil in deep waters increased dramatically after the passage of the DWRRA in 1995 .
As of 2003 , there was more than a 250 percent increase in the percentage of total oil produced in the deep - water regions of the gulf , with about 70 percent of all drilling taking place there .
It seems the DWRRA law was passed with precisely the intention of encouraging deep - water drilling , and it accomplished this goal .
Unfortunately , accomplishing this goal led necessarily to higher risk and unintended consequences .
Unintended Consequences
The problems caused by the current spilling of oil into the Gulf of Mexico will certainly have tremendous impact on the residents of the coastal states , on the fishermen , on the beaches and wildlife , and not least of all on BP as a company .
There are some who think BP may end up in bankruptcy .
In the meantime , it seems the company is doing quite a bit to make good on promises to clean up the problem and to take care of damages .
Stepping back from all this and taking a look from a free - market perspective , it is clear that the incentives put in place by the state — undoubtedly at the behest of lobbyists for oil companies — led to drilling in deep water , leading to increased risk .
The incentives encouraged drilling in water that had been previously deemed economically unattractive by those same companies .
Additionally , a liability cap of $ 75 million for the oil companies was put in place by law .
This is an incredible use of the control of the political means to make favorable dealings for oneself in the economy .
In fact , it is the very definition of corporatism : First , individuals within a company work to get laws passed to reward companies for taking risks previously deemed unworthy of the time , energy , and capital expenditures .
Then , those same individuals within the company work to get other laws passed to limit liability when things go wrong .
This oil spill is something that we in engineering and science refer to as a three - sigma event , in that it is a very low - percentage occurrence .
In other words , Congress and big oil companies colluded to reward risky behavior and lost their bet .
Comically , we now see Congress — who encouraged the risks — cry " foul ! "
They are demanding that the previously set damage cap be raised , retroactively , to another arbitrary figure deemed more appropriate for BP 's sins : at present , $ 20 billion , although this may change in the near future .
Conclusion
Predictably , in response to the mess , there have been calls for more and tighter regulation on the industry .
President Obama recently said he is interested in finding out who deserves punishment for the crime of the oil spill .
( Maybe he can blame Congress ? )
Also predictably , there is scarcely a mention of the role of government intervention in the mess in any of the traditional state media .
Instead , there is the standard demonizing of " unfettered capitalism " and the cries about the failure of the free market .
Barely a mention is made that safety on drilling platforms has been under the purview of government regulators within the US Minerals Management Service and that the Deepwater Horizon was deemed a model for industry safety just last year .
In a free market , where BP would bear full responsibility for damages caused by its operations , there might not be such a mess to deal with in the gulf .
Additionally , private insurers for BP would not have allowed for such a shoddy inspection record on the safety of a very complicated and difficult operation .
Drilling far out in the ocean waters would likely have been pursued in some form , but with the companies bearing all the risk — and certainly not being rewarded for taking economically unsound actions — there would have been far less activity in deep waters .
Many people agitate for BP to hold true to its corporate line of moving " Beyond Petroleum " to alternative energy sources .
The environmental disaster in the gulf will undoubtedly place further pressure on the company .
Yet how can we ever know if that direction is feasible without freedom in the markets ?
True freedom would put the costs at the level that are truly indicative of risks and rewards involved with each activity .
For now , the vast majority of what we do in our lives is in one way or another dependent upon petroleum .
With that in mind , we can only hope that the damage can be cleaned up quickly and that the coastal towns can move on to brighter days .
Dozens of people outraged by a deadly Israeli commando raid on ships taking humanitarian aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip have protested outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington .
Open gallery view Demonstrators wait in front of the Israeli consulate , May 31 , 2010 Credit : Reuters
Demonstrators formed long lines and walked in circles Monday afternoon , chanting End the siege in Gaza now and Shut down the embassy !
Stop Israeli piracy !
Some held large Palestinian flags and signs reading One more Israeli massacre .
Israel said the activists attacked its commandos as they boarded the six ships taking tons of supplies to Gaza , while the flotilla 's organizers said the Israeli forces opened fire first .
The group gathered later Monday in front of the White House , chanting , Hey
Obama , ca n't you see ?
Palestine will be free .
Earlier , pro-Palestinian demonstrators took to the streets in cities from Istanbul to Paris on Monday to protest a deadly Israel Navy raid on a flotilla of international activists attempting to bring humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip .
At least nine of the activists were killed in the clashes that ensued .
Dozens of protesters surrounded Israel 's consulate in Istanbul from the early hours of the day until well into the evening , hurling stones and burning Israeli flags .
CNN - Turk and NTV showed dozens of angry protesters scuffling with Turkish police guarding the consulate in downtown Istanbul .
" Damn Israel , " the protesters shouted .
Swelling demonstrations were underway outside the Israeli embassy in Paris , where riot police forcibly drove back scores of protesters .
The demonstrators blocked traffic as they charged toward the building , leading officers to respond by firing tear gas .
In Jordan , hundreds urged their government to follow Turkey 's lead and cut ties with Israel .
Dozens of Egyptians protested outside the foreign ministry in Cairo criticizing the Egyptian government holding pictures of late President Gamal Abdel Nasser .
Dozens of angry students pelted the UN offices in Teheran with stones and eggs in protest , burning Israeli flags and chanting , death to Israel and down with U.S. Police blocked them from reaching the building .
The president of Iran , a key supporter of Hamas , called the raid an inhuman act .
In Baghdad , an estimated 3,000 Shiite followers of the anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr shouted " Death , death to Israel ! " and " Death , death to America ! "
In Beirut , about 500 Palestinian and Lebanese activists protested in front of the UN headquarters , setting Israeli flags on fire .
In neighboring Syria , more than 200 Syrian and Palestinian protesters staged a sit -in before the offices of the United Nations .
There were also demonstrations in Rome , Cyprus and more than 20 cities in Greece , including Athens and Thessaloniki , where some 2,000 people were marching .
The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes in The Keynesian Dead End :
Like many bad ideas , the current Keynesian revival began under George W. Bush .
Even the Wall Street Journal knows how toxic George W. Bush is , so they start by associating him with Keynesian .
No mention is made of Bush 's two huge tax cuts ( for the wealthy ) or the way that Bush and the Republican controlled Congress allowed the PAYGO law to expire , or the way they doubled the national debt in just 8 years .
It was n't until after Bush 's Supply Side economic policies failed and the recession started that Bush went along with a mild package of $ 168 billion in spending and one - time tax rebates .
The cash did produce a statistical blip in GDP growth in mid-2008 , but it did n't stop the financial panic and second phase of recession .
As if that mild stimulus package could undo the damage cause by the previous 6 years of Bush and the Republican Congress ' bad economic policies .
Should one expect it to undo the repeal of Glass–Steagall Act or the Housing Bubble or the Financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 ?
It is a ridiculous suggestion yet here is the Wall Street Journal suggesting it .
They then move on the Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
When Congress was done two months later , in February 2009 , the amount was $ 862 billion .
A pair of White House economists famously promised that this spending would keep the unemployment rate below 8 % .
This is one of those Republican talking points that is intentionally misleading .
What they do n't mention is that the unemployment rate in February 2009 was already 8.2 % .
The economy was sinking so fast that over three million jobs were lost in the last five months of the Bush Administration , pushing the unemployment rate from 6.2 % in September 2008 to 8.2 % just five months later .
Were the Wall Street Journal to mention that fact they would discredit their own talking point .
Seventeen months later , and despite historically easy monetary policy for that entire period , the jobless rate is still 9.7 % .
The Wall Street Journal fails to mention that unemployment peaked in Oct 2009 , just six months after the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
The unemployment rate has fallen .4 percentage points since the peak .
Just to review the numbers that the Wall Street Journal does not mention , in the 3 quarters ( 9 months ) before Obama 's Stimulus the economy " grew " - 2.7 % , - 5.4 % and - 6.4 % .
( the negative sign means the economy was shrinking ) .
In the three quarters after passing the Obama 's Stimulus , the economy improved by 5.7 , 2.9 , and 3.4 percentage points , a swing of 12 percentage points of GDP growth .
Here 's the chart :
Quarter GDP rate Change from previous quarter
Q3 2008 - 2.7 % - 4.2
Q4 2008 - 5.4 % - 2.7
Q1 2009 - 6.4 % - 1.0 <--
Bush leaves office , Stimulus passes < br>Q2 2009 - 0.7 % 5.7
Q3 2009 2.2 % 2.9
Q4 2009 5.6 % 3.4
Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis
Yesterday , the Bureau of Economic Analysis once again reduced the GDP estimate for first quarter growth , this time to 2.7 %
The Wall Street Journal wo n't show their readers those numbers because the conclusion is that Obamas American Recovery and Reinvestment Act turned the economy around .
The Wall Street Journal cannot be accused of not knowing the Bureau of Economic Analysis numbers because they write :
2.7 % is higher than the average growth rate in George W. Bush 's 8 years .
As the nearby table shows , this is a far cry from the snappy recovery that typically follows a steep recession , most recently in 1983 - 84 after the Reagan tax cuts .
Notice how they do n't mention that Ronald Reagan 's tax cut was in 1981 ?
The fact is the unemployment rate increased for nearly two years after Reagan 's 1981 tax cut , going from 7.5 % in January 1981 to 10.8 % in November 1982 .
It was n't until January 1983 that the unemployment rate started to fall .
The fact is that unemployment peaked six months after Obama 's stimulus package was passed versus neatly two years after Reagan 's tax cut was passed .
Had the Wall Street Journal printed the full chart , here is what it would have shown :
Quarter GDP rate Change from previous quarter
Q1 1981 8.6 % 1.0 <- Carter 's last quarter < br>Q2 1981 - 3.2 % - 11.8
Q3 1981 4.9 % 8.1
Q4 1981 - 4.9 % - 9.8
Q1 1982 - 6.4 % - 1.5
Q2 1982 2.2 % 8.6
Q3 1982 - 1.5 % - 3.7
Q4 1982 0.3 % 1.8
The larger lesson here is about policy .
The original sin— and it was nearly global — was to revive the Keynesian economic model that had last cracked up in the 1970s , while forgetting the lessons of the long prosperity from 1982 through 2007 .
The Wall Street Journal has simply written the first two years of Reagan 's policies out of existence .
Contrast that economic performance with Obama 's record ( above ) .
Note also how Obama inherited an economy shrinking at a 6.4 % rate while Reagan inherited an economy growing at an 8.6 % rate .
Notice how the Wall Street Journal stops history at 2007 the start of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression ?
If George W. Bush 's Supply Side economic policies had worked they would not have resulted in an ecoonomic meltdown .
The Reagan and Clinton - Gingrich booms
Clinton - Gingrich !!!
Gingrich opposed Clinton 's economic policies .
Gingrich said that Clinton 's budget would cause a recession ( it did n't ) and not balance the budget ( it did ) .
Yet when Clinton 's policies work , the Wall Street Journal tries to credit Gingrich who opposed Clinton 's policies .
The spending restraint began to end in the late 1990s , sound money vanished earlier this decade
The spending restraint ended when George W. Bush and the Republican Controlled Congress decided bypass PAYGO , then let PAYGO expire , so they could cut taxes ( for the wealthy ) without offsetting spending cuts and increase spending ( Drugs , Iraq ) without raising taxes .
Deep down , the Wall Street Journal editorial writers are not completely crazy .
They offer this insightful paragraph :
Notice that we are n't saying that spending restraint alone is a miracle economic cure .
The spending cuts now in fashion in Europe are essential , but cuts by themselves wo n't balance annual deficits reaching 10 % of GDP .
That requires new revenues from faster growth , and there 's a danger that the tax increases now sweeping Europe will dampen growth further .
The Wall Street Journal is admitting that the Republican / Tea Party spending cuts wo n't fix the economy .
They admit that " new revenues " are needed .
Yet they do n't say how .
Maybe Santa Clause will bring it .
President Obama 's tragic mistake was to blow out the U.S. federal balance sheet on spending that has produced little bang for the buck .
The Wall Street Journal will not admit that George W Bush left a $ 1.3 trillion budget deficit .
They wo n't admit that Bush and the Republican Congress abandoned PAYGO , ran wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on credit , and doubled the national debt in 8 years .
They blame Obama for the mess George W. Bush left .
They will not admit that Obama got the economy growing again and producing jobs .
Speaking of jobs , so far this year the number of private sector jobs has increased by nearly a half million ( 495,000 ) .
How does that contrast with the Bush Administration ?
At the end of the Bush Administration there were 110,961,000 private sector jobs .
Four years earlier ( Jan 2005 ) there were 110,718,000 a net increase of 243,000 jobs in four years .
The simple fact it more private sector jobs have been added in the first five months this year than in the last four years of the Bush Administration .
Somehow the Wall Street Journal has missed that .
With the economy in recession in 2008 and 2009 , we argued that some stimulus was justified and an increase in the deficit was understandable and inevitable .
However , we also argued that permanent tax cuts aimed at marginal individual and corporate tax rates would have done far more to revive animal spirits , and in our view would have led to a far more robust recovery .
The Wall Street Journal fails to admit that George W Bush tried that an it failed miserably .
Now the Wall Street Journal wants more George W Bush economic policies .
They wo n't call them George W Bush economic policies as if readers wo n't notice .
What the world has now reached instead is a Keynesian dead end .
It is the Wall Street Journal editorial board that has reached the dead end .
When the facts do n't support their ideology they simply go into denial : pretending that the first two years of the Reagan Administration did n't exists , pretending that " Clinton - Gingrich " existed , pretending that Bush and the Republican Congress did n't abandon PAYGO and intentionally run up the deficit .
By ignoring the facts it is the Wall Street Journal editorial board that is admitting they have reached the end .
G20 Toronto -
Police make there move when he least expects it
Blair Peach died at a demonstration against the National Front A police officer is likely to have " struck the fatal blow " which killed a protester in west London 31 years ago , a Scotland Yard report reveals .
Anti-racism activist Blair Peach died after he was hit during a protest in Southall in April 1979 .
The previously secret report attaches " grave suspicion " to an officer , who it says may also have been involved in a cover - up along with two colleagues .
But the Metropolitan Police said no officers would face further action .
Mr Peach 's family have long campaigned for the report - written by Commander John Cass - to be released .
His partner , Celia Stubbs , said the report " totally vindicated " what the family had always believed .
ANALYSIS Dominic Casciani , BBC News
The Cass report into the death of Blair Peach is not a dry internal police review document .
But we may never discover which one of the unnamed officers struck the fatal blow - and Blair Peach 's family say they have never expected a prosecution .
What they wanted , at the very least , was openness and recognition that an officer killed the teacher .
Police chiefs say modern policing is accountable and the release of the Cass report is a symbolic moment to that end .
The death will remain a key point in a political battle over police reforms - but campaigners are now looking at the death at last year 's G20 protests of Ian Tomlinson .
Prosecutors have spent more than six months looking at the evidence - but are yet to make a decision on any charges .
Blair Peach report :
What it said " I never really expected a prosecution .
I do n't regret that , I am just pleased that we have the report so we can see what happened on the day , " she said .
A
Met statement said : " We have gone to great lengths to ensure that all investigative options currently available have been exhausted .
" To this extent the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) has provided us with independent advice stating that there is nothing which would currently justify carrying out a further investigation . "
Mr Peach , a 33 - year - old teacher from New Zealand , was taking part in a demonstration against the National Front .
The protest led to clashes with the police and he was later found with fatal head injuries .
A police radio or truncheon is thought to have delivered the fatal blow .
The Cass report does not name any of the implicated officers , but said six were on board a van belonging to the now disbanded Special Patrol Group identified as carrier U.11 .
It said there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone over the death but recommended action for perverting the course of justice for three officers , and there was " grave suspicion " over one of them , only identified as " Officer E " .

The 1979 report said : " Whilst it can reasonably be concluded that a police officer struck the fatal blow , and that that officer came from carrier U.11 , I am sure that it will be agreed that the present situation is far from satisfactory and disturbing . "
It went on : " The attitude and untruthfulness of some of the officers involved is a contributory factor .
" It is understandable that because of the events of the day officers were confused , or made mistakes , but one would expect better recall of events by trained police officers .
" However , there are cases where the evidence shows that certain officers have clearly not told the truth . "
Officer E , Officer F and Officer H " clearly obstructed " police officers carrying out investigations , it added .
The Met said the names of the officers had been removed from the report for legal reasons .
There are cases where the evidence shows that certain officers have clearly not told the truth
1979 Cass report
A lengthy campaign Troubling answers from the Met over Blair Peach A spokeswoman said : " Some of the information has been redacted to prevent the identification of members of the public and police officers who contributed to the investigations into Blair Peach 's death . "
One of the officers on duty that day , Alan Murray , told BBC News he believed he was Officer E .
But he denied the allegations in the report , describing them as a " total distortion and a disgrace " .
The former Scotland Yard inspector , 59 , who led a unit of the Special Patrol Group at the demonstration and is now a Sheffield University lecturer , says none of his officers was involved .
' Uncomfortable reading '
Last year , Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the report should be published after being reviewed by lawyers .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) completed that review and advised Scotland Yard that charges could only be brought if there was sufficient new evidence , such as a confession .
Sir Paul said the report made " uncomfortable reading " and it was a matter of " deep regret " the police had been unable to provide Mr Peach 's family with a " definitive answer " .

" As a police officer with over 34 years service reading and being briefed on the investigation reports leaves me feeling deeply uncomfortable , " he said .
Following a death in the course of police work , forces these days are required to immediately refer the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for investigation .
Deborah Coles , of campaign group Inquest , called upon Sir Paul to publicly acknowledge that a Metropolitan Police officer was responsible for the fatal blow on Mr Peach .
At an inquest at the time , the jury returned a verdict of " death by misadventure " .
Mr Peach 's family felt sure the Met investigation , conducted by a team of 30 detectives under Commander Cass in the force 's Complaints Investigation Bureau , held the key to the truth behind his death .

Millions of websites together formed the internet .
Where HTML is the building block of all these websites .
Beginner ’s Q&A
1- What is HTML ?
HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language .
It is the standard language for tagging contents for web browsers .
HTML is represented by “ Elements ” .
Elements are also known as “ Tags ” .
2- Why is HTML needed ?
Web browsers can only render a website when it is written in their supported language .
HTML is the most common markup language and has the highest acceptance to web browsers .
That 's why you need HTML .
3- Is HTML case sensitive ?
HTML is not case sensitive .
But the best practice is to write HTML with proper cases .
Steps for Creating Your First HTML File
You can create a basic HTML file using the Notepad on your computer .
But it will be painful for writing many lines of codes .
You need a Code Editor .
A good code editor will make it easier to write and organize large codes .
I use and recommend Notepad ++ ( free and open - source ) for writing web languages .
There are other editors you may use like Sublime Text , Atom etc .
Here is what you need to do :
Install a code editor Open it up Create a new file Save it as a .html file
You are ready to go !

1- Hello World !
Copy and paste the following code into your new HTML file and save it .
Now run it on your web browser .
Code : <! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < title >
My first web page < / title > </head > < body > < p>
Hello World !</p> </ body > </html > Output :
Congrats !
You have created your very first HTML file .
You do n't have to understand it at this point .
We will cover it shortly .
Understanding HTML Structure
Every HTML file has a common naked structure .
This is where everything starts .
And every large page of codes will come to this structure after trimming down .
So let 's try to understand it from the “ Hello World ! ” code .
The following elements are the mandatory parts for every HTML file .
<! DOCTYPE html > =
It is a declaration to the browser that this is an HTML file .
You must specify it before the < html > tag .
= It is a declaration to the browser that this is an HTML file .
You must specify it before the < html > tag . < html > </html > =
This is the root element of an HTML file .
Everything you write goes between < html > and < /html > .
= This is the root element of an HTML file .
Everything you write goes between < html > and < /html >. < head > </ head > =
This is the meta information part for a browser .
Codes inside this tag have no visual output .
= This is the meta information part for a browser .
Codes inside this tag have no visual output . < body > </ body > =
This is the part that a web browser renders .
What you exactly see on a website is the rendering of codes between < body > and < / body > .

2- HTML Tags
HTML is the collaboration of hundreds of different tags .
You need to learn how they work .
You also have to make sure that they have used them in the right way .
HTML tags usually have an opening and a closing tag .
The opening tag has the keyword surrounded by a less than ( <) and a greater than ( > ) sign .
The closing tag has everything same but an extra forward slash ( / ) after the less than ( <) sign .
( 2a ) Head Tags
All the head tags go between < head > and < / head > .
They contain meta information for web browser and search engines .
They basically have no visual output . < title > </ title >
Title tag defines the title of a web page which is visible on the browser tab .
This information is used by web programs and search engines .
You can have highest one title per HTML file .
Code : < title >
My first web page < / title > < link >
Link tag links your HTML page with external resources .
Its main use is linking HTML page with CSS stylesheets .
It is a self - closing tag and does n’t need the ending </ link > .
Here rel stands for relation with the file and src means the source .
Code : < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " src=" style.css " > < meta >
Meta is another self - closing tag that provides meta information of an html file .
Search engines and other web services use these information .
Meta tags are a must if you want to optimize your page for search engines .
Code : < meta name =" description " content =
" This is the short description that search engines show " < script > </ script >
The script tag is used for including a server - side script or making a link to an external script file .
It can have two attributes in the opening tag .
One is the type and another is the source ( src ) .
Code : < script type =" text / javascript " src=" scripts.js " ></ script > < noscript > </noscript >
Noscript tag works when scripts are disabled in a web browser .
It makes a page compatible to them who do n't allow scripts in their web browsers .
Code : < noscript >< p> Alas !
Scripts are disabled .</p></noscript>
( 2 b ) Body Tags
All the body tags go between < body > and < / body > .
They have visual outputs .
This is where the most work is done .
You have to use these tags to structure your main page content .
< h1 > </h1 > to < h6 > </ h6 >
These are the heading tags .
The most important heading is tagged with < h1 > and the least important with < h6 > .
You should use them in the correct hierarchy .
Code : < h1 > This is a h1 heading </h1 > < h2 > This is a h2 heading </ h2 > < h3 > This is a h3 heading </h3 > < h4 > This is a h4 heading </ h4 > < h5 > This is a h5 heading </h5 > < h6 > This is a h6 heading </ h6 >
Output : Formatting Tags
Text in an html file can be formatted using many formatting tags .
It will be necessary when you want to highlight a word or line from your content .
Code : < p > You can highlight your text in many ways .
</p> < p > You can < strong > bold </ strong > , < u>underline </u > , < em>italic</em > , < mark > mark </ mark > , < sub>subscript</sub > , < sup>superscript</sup > and more !</p>
Output : <!– –>
You can deviate some codes from rending using the comment tag .
The code will show up in the source code but will not be rendered .
The main use of this tag is for creating documentation of html files for future reference .
Example : <!-- < p>You can comment out any code by surrounding them in this way </ p> -->
( 2c ) Other Important HTML Tags
< a > </a>
Anchor is an invaluable tag which is used almost everywhere .
You will not see any web page online without at least one anchor link .
The structure is same .
It has an opening < a > and a closing part < /a >.
The text you want to anchor goes between < a > and < /a >.
There are some attributes that define where and how the user goes after clicking on it .
ahref= ” “ =
It defines the destination link .
The link goes between the double quotes .
= It defines the destination link .
The link goes between the double quotes .
target= ” “ =
It defines whether the URL will open in a new browser tab or in the same tab .
target = ” _blank ” is for the new tab and target = ” _self ” is for opening in the same tab .
= It defines whether the URL will open in a new browser tab or in the same tab .
target = ” _blank ” is for the new tab and target = ” _self ” is for opening in the same tab .
rel= ” “ =
It defines the relation of the current page with the linked page .
If you do n't trust the linked page , you can define rel= ” nofollow ” .
Code : < p > < a target = " _blank " href = " https://www.google.com/ " >Click here </a> to go to Google .
It will open in a new tab .
</ p> < p >< a target = " _self " href = " https://www.google.com/ " >Click here </a>.
It will also take you to Google but will open in the current tab .
</p> Output :
<img />
Image tag is another important tag without which you cannot imagine many image - based websites .
<img /> is a self - closing tag .
It does n't need the traditional closing like < / img > .
There are some attributes you need to know before you can use it correctly .
src= ” “ =
This is for defining the source link of the image .
Put the link right between the double quotes .
= This is for defining the source link of the image .
Put the link right between the double quotes .
alt= ” “ =
It stands for alternative text .
When your image is not loading , this text will give users an idea about the missing image .
= It stands for alternative text .
When your image is not loading , this text will give users an idea about the missing image .
width= ” “ =
It defines the width of an image in pixels .
= It defines the width of an image in pixels .
Height = ” “ =
It defines the height of an image in pixels .
Example : < p > This is the Googleplex in August 2014 .
</p> < p > This image has a width of 500 pixels and a height of 375 pixels .
</ p> < img src= " https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Googleplex-Patio-Aug-2014.JPG
" alt =" Google 's Headquarter in August 2014 " width = " 500 " height = " 375 " />
Output :
Tips :
Want to insert a clickable image ?
Wrap the image code with an < a > tag .
See how it goes .
< ol > </ol > or < ul > </ul >
List tag is for creating a list of items .
< ol > stands for ordered lists ( numbered list ) and < ul > stands for unordered lists ( bullet points ) .
The list items inside the < ol > or < ul > is tagged with < li > </li >. li stands for list .
You can have as many < li > as you want inside the parent < ol > or < ul > tag .
Code : < p > This is an ordered list : </ p> < ol > < li>
Item 1</li > < li> Item 2</li > < li> Item 3</li > </ol > < p
> This is an unordered list : </ p> < ul > < li> Item 1</li > < li> Item 2</li > < li> Item 3</li > </ul >
Output :
< table > </table >
Table tag is for creating a table of data .
There are a few inner level tags that defines table headers , rows and columns .
< table > </ table > is the outer parent code .
In this tag , < tr > stands for table row , < td > stands for table column and < th > stands for table header .
Code : < table > < tr > < th> Name</th > < th> Age</th > < th> Profession </ th > </tr > < tr > < td > Jo < td>27</td > < td> Businessman</td > </tr > < tr> < td> Carol</td > < td>26</td> < td > Nurse</td> </tr > < tr> < td > Simone</td > < td>39</td> < td> Professor</td > </tr > </table >
Output :
Note : Values inside the first < tr > are headings .
So , we used < th > which applies bold text effect to the text .
Table Grouping
You can extend a table ’s functionality using table grouping elements .
There will be times when you need to create large tables that split into multiple pages .
Grouping your table data into header , body and footer , you can allow independent scrolling .
The header and body part will print to every page where your table has spanned .
The table grouping tags are :
< thead > </ thead > =
For wrapping the headings of a table .
It prints to every split page of the table .
= For wrapping the headings of a table .
It prints to every split page of the table . < tbody > </tbody > =
For wrapping the main data of a table .
You can have as many < tbody > as you need .
A < tbody > tag means a separate group of data .
= For wrapping the main data of a table .
You can have as many < tbody > as you need .
A < tbody > tag means a separate group of data . < tfoot > </tfoot > =
For wrapping the footer information of a table .
It prints to every split page of the table .
Please note that it is not mandatory to use grouping .
You may use it to make bigger tables more readable .
While some special developers markedly use these tags as CSS Selectors .
Here is how we can group our exemplified table into < thead > , < tbody > and < tfoot > :
Code : < table > < thead > < tr > < th> Name</th > < th> Age</th > < th> Profession </ th > </tr > </ thead > < tbody > < tr > < td> John</td> < td>27</td> < td> Businessman</td > </tr > < tr> < td> Carol</td > < td>26</td> < td > Nurse</td> </tr > < tr> < td > Simone</td > < td>39</td> < td> Professor</td > </tr > </tbody > < tfoot > < tr > < td> Total Persons :</td > < td>3</td> </tr > </tfoot > </ table >
Output :
< form > </ form >
Form element is used for creating interactive forms for web pages .
An HTML form contains several consecutive elements .
For example : < label > , < input > , < textarea > etc .
The action attribute in form is very important .
It points to a server - side or a third - party page for processing the information .
For processing , you need to define a method first .
You can use either of two methods , get or post .
Get sends all the information in the URL format where Post sends the information in the message body .
There are many types of input for forms .
The very basic input type is text .
It is written as < input type = ” text ” >.
Types might also be radio , checkbox , email and so on .
There should be a submit type input at the bottom for creating a submit button .
< label > tag is used for creating labels and associating them with inputs .
The rule of associating labels with the inputs is that have the same value in for= ” ” attribute of label and id= ” ” attribute of input .
Code : < form action= " # " > < label for =" firstname " >
First Name : </ label > < input type =" text " id =" firstname " >< br > < label for =" lastname " >
Last Name : </ label > < input type =" text " id =" lastname " >< br > < label for = " bio " >
Short Bio : </ label > < textarea id =" bio " rows = " 10 " cols = " 30 " placeholder =
" Enter your bio here ... " ></textarea >< br> < label > Gender :</ label >< br> < label for = " male " >
Male </ label > < input type =" radio " name = " gender " id =" male " >< br > < label for = " female " >
Female </ label > < input type =" radio " name = " gender " id =" female " >< br > < input type =" submit " value = " Submit " > < form >
Output :
Note : I have pointed action to a null value because it was not connected to any server to process the information .

3- HTML Attributes
Attributes are one type of modifiers for HTML tags .
They add new configurations to the HTML tags .
An attribute looks like attributename= ” ” and sits in the opening HTML tag .
The value of the attribute goes between the double quotes .
id= ” ” and class= ” ” id and class are the identifiers of HTML tags .
Different names are designated to different HTML elements using identifiers .
You can use one class identifier for multiple elements .
But you cannot use one id identifier for multiple elements .
Code : < h1 class = " heading " >
This is the main title < / h1 > href= ” ” href stands for Hypertext Reference .
They point users to reference links .
Anchor tag < a > uses href to send users to a destination URL .
Code : < a href = " https://www.google.com/ " >Google </a> src= ” ” src stands for source .
It defines the source of a media or resource you are using in the HTML file .
The source can be either local or third - party URL .
Code : < img src= " https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Googleplex-Patio-Aug-2014.JPG
" /> alt= ” ” alt stands for alternative .
It is a backup text that comes in use when an HTML element cannot load .
Code : < img src= " https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Googleplex-Patio-Aug-2014.JPG
" alt = " Google 's Headquarter " /> style= ” ” style attribute is often used in HTML tags .
It does the job of CSS within the HTML tag .
Your styling properties go between the double quotes .
Code : < h2 style = " color: red " >
This is another title </ h2 >
Go Top
4- Code Display : Block vs Inline
Some elements always start on a new line and take the full available width .
These are “ Block ” elements .
Ex : < div > , < p > , < h1 >-< h6 > , form etc .
Some elements take only the required space and do n't start on a new line .
These are “ Inline ” elements .
Ex : < a > , < span > , < br > , < strong > , < img > etc .
You will need to differentiate block elements from inline when you will be using CSS styles .
In this HTML guide , it is not very necessary .
Code : <! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < title >
My first web page < / title > </ head > < body > < h2 > This is a H2 heading .
It has Block display .</h2 > < h2 > This is < u> another </u> H2 heading .
Here the underline tag has Inline display .
</h2 > </ body > </html >
Output :
Go Top
5- Double quote vs single quote in HTML
This question is very obvious .
What should you use in HTML ?
Single quote or double quote ?
People seem to use both but which one is correct ?
In HTML , single quote and double quote are same .
They do n't make any difference in the output .
You can use anyone you prefer .
But mixing up both in a page of codes is considered a bad practice .
You should be consistent with any one of them .
Go Top
6- Semantic HTML vs Non-semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is the latest version of HTML , which is also called HTML5 .
It is the developed version of non-semantic HTML and XHTML .
Why is HTML5 better ?
In previous versions , HTML elements were identified by id / class names .
For example : < div id =” article ” > </ div > was considered an article .
In HTML5 , < article > </article > tag represents itself as an article without needing any id / class identifier .
For the sake of HTML5 , now search engines and other web applications can better understand a web page .
Semantic websites have proven to do better for SEO .
Here is a list of some popular HTML5 tags :
< main > </ main > =
This is for wrapping the main content that you want to show your viewers .
= This is for wrapping the main content that you want to show your viewers .
< header > </ header > =
This is for marking up the header part of a content such as title or author meta .
= This is for marking up the header part of a content such as title or author meta .
< article > </ article > =
It specifies a user - defined or independent content to your viewers .
= It specifies a user - defined or independent content to your viewers .
< section > </section > =
It can group any code such as header , footer or sidebar .
You can say , it is the semantic form of a div .
= It can group any code such as header , footer or sidebar .
You can say , it is the semantic form of a div . < footer > </ footer > =
This is where your footer content , disclaimer or copyright text belong .
= This is where your footer content , disclaimer or copyright text belong .
< audio > </audio > =
It enables you insert audio files without having any plugin problem .
= It enables you insert audio files without having any plugin problem .
< video > </ video > = Like < audio > , you can insert videos using this tag without plugin problems .
A simple HTML5 structure would look like this :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " utf - 8 " /> < title >
My first web page < / title > </ head > < body > < header > < nav > < ul > < li>Menu 1</li > < li> Menu 2</li > </ul > </ nav> </ header > < main > < article > < header > < h2 > This is the title of the article </ h2 > < p > Posted by John Doe</ p> </ header > < p > Content of the article goes here </ p> </ article > </ main > < footer > < p> Copyright 2017 John Doe </ p > </ footer > </ body > </html >

7- HTML Validation
Most of the web professionals validate their code after finishing it .
Why is it necessary to validate a code when it is working fine ?
There are two possible reasons for validating your codes :
It will help you make your code cross - browser and cross-platform compatible .
The code may not show any error in your current browser , but it might in another one .
Code validation will fix it up .
Search engines and other web programs may stop crawling your page if you have errors in it .
You can confirm through validation that you do n't have any major error .
W3C Validator is the most popular service for code validation .
They have several methods for validating codes .
You can either upload a file or directly input the code in their validation engine .

OK , people .
I tweeted Palin ’s CSU Stanislaus speech tonight so you would n’t have to listen .
I thought it was going well ( sliding scale ) , and breathed a sigh of relief for her when it ended … only to be SHOCKED by hearing reporters discussing her performance in a brutally frank manner , reminiscent of Peggy Noonan ’s open mic debacle regarding Palin .
Of course , Peggy ’s open mic moment left us wondering why the pundits were not being honest with us about Palin .
Clearly they knew she was n’t up to the task of Vice President .
But I digress ….
As we know , where ever Sarah goes , drama follows .
During the live mic drama at the end , the reporters said now they know that her “ dumbness does n’t come from soundbites ” and wondered if she had finished ONE statement , but decided , no she had not .
They laughed derisively and made jokes about having to text their conservative friends about this .
Other various comments :
Advertisements
“ I feel like I just got off a rollercoaster . ”
“ She did n’t finish a statement . ”
“ I do n’t know how you ’re gonna make a story out of that . ”
“ Well , that ’s the story . ”
“ Did she even make a point ? ”
“ Lots of Reagan . ”
“ Just put as many random quotes in as you can . ”
Listen Here ( courtesy of Palingates ) :
Or , you can you can listen to Tammy Bruce ’s conservative podcast , but note that in perfect Palin fan style , she calls the techs / reporters / students “ dumb bastards ” — so family values !
Keepin ’ it classy , Tammy .
Spare yourself the swearing and go to the middle of the podcast .
Oh , dear .
The reporters were none too impressed .
Perhaps it ’s because while she was speaking at a University , she never discussed education .
She use the word 4 times and still managed to never discuss it .
She spoke in front of a sign reading : Vox Veritas Vita .
Orwell would have been so pleased .
# Sarah Reese Jones srjones66 – Twitter Feed Sarah Palin CSU speech ( Presented in reverse order because it ’s 1 AM and I just listened to an entire Sarah Palin speech ) :

# CSU , you should be ASHAMED .

This is OUTRAGEOUS .
Clown show .

She ’s using random quotes from real thinkers ….. but they ’re a mess .
not attached to an idea — just throwing them out like jingles .
She just argued against academic freedom
There is no repayment for this ….. She blew my ears out .

The end .
Must go drink .
For those who want to view the speech …..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DaF88ieiw
Updated at 4:00 AM to reflect that the people heard talking were reporters according to the Fox News station affiliate that provided the live feed .
Update : The Fox outlet notes : “ During that stream , other reporters in the media overflow room were heard on our microphone , due to the unusual circumstances of how we managed to bring the live feed .
First , FOX40
News was the only station streaming a live signal from CSU Stanislaus during Sarah Palin ’s presentation .
Friday , we were told by officials organizing the speech that we were not permitted to beam a live signal direct from the dining hall where Sarah Palin was presenting .
Instead , we were offered the opportunity to aim a FOX40 camera at a projection screen inside a room for assembled media several hundred feet from where Sarah Palin was speaking .
They would not allow us to get a direct feed of audio , so we had to hold a mic up to their speakers . ”
Yes , see… .
If Sarah had n’t sent the press to Siberia and just let them do their job the way they do it with every other politician / public speaker , this never would have happened .
In other words , this is a result of Palin ’s fear of the press and her resulting crazy demands .
NO ONE shoots a SCREEN or holds audio equipment up to speakers in the grown up world , because grown up politicians do not demand that the press be banished from the room and from the live feed .
This is ABSURD .
What is Sarah Palin SO afraid of ?
Here is the full transcript of her speech courtesy of palingates .
A SPATE of suicides at its factories has reportedly prompted Apple manufacturer Foxconn to ask workers to promise not to kill themselves .
Workers have reportedly been told to sign letters promising not to kill themselves and even agreeing to be sent to psychiatric institutions if they appear to be in an " abnormal mental or physical state for the protection of myself and others ' ' .
Nets were also reportedly being hung around buildings to deter suicidal employees .
The measures came after a 19 - year - old employee fell to his death at the Shenzhen factory yesterday - the ninth apparent suicide at the enormous site this year .
The deaths have raised questions about conditions for millions of factory workers in China , especially at Foxconn , where labour activists and employees say long hours , low pay and high pressure are the norm .
The company is the world 's largest maker of computer components .
It makes iPhones for Apple and also boasts Dell and Hewlett - Packard among its clients .
Terry Gou , chairman of Foxconn 's Taiwanese parent company Hon Hai Precision , flew into the booming city of Shenzhen aboard his private jet today with reporters , whom he urged to see the factory for themselves .
Labour activists in nearby Hong Kong called on Tuesday for a boycott of the next generation of Apple 's iPhone , which is assembled by Foxconn , days ahead of the international launch of the iPad .
The Taiwanese technology giant , which also boasts Dell and Hewlett - Packard among its clients , has defended its practices and Mr Gou on Monday said he was not running " blood and sweat factories ' ' .
" You know , Hon Hai has more than 800,000 workers worldwide , and it's not easy to manage such a large team , '' he said .
But workers spoke of long hours , harsh supervisors and low pay .
A 21 - year - old employee from the southern province of Guangxi told the South China Morning Post how she worked 12 hours a day , six days a week .
" The atmosphere inside our workplaces is so tight and depressing that we 're not allowed to speak to each other for 12 hours or you 'll be reproached by your supervisors . ''
Another worker , from the central province of Hunan , complained that the assembly line moved too fast and she had to check thousands of motherboards for electronic gadgets every day .
The 22 - year - old 's monthly salary , including overtime , was only 2000 yuan ( $ A363.46 ) - about the same as the US price of a 32 gigabyte iPhone .
" I feel like I have an empty life and work like a machine , '' she told the paper .
Foxconn is taking bizarre action to try to prevent further suicides - notably getting staff to sign a letter promising not to kill themselves , according to Taiwan 's CTI cable TV channel .
Roof patrols are also being arranged and nets installed around buildings to deter suicidal workers , it added .
" If they jump , they 'll fall into the safety nets , so their lives will be saved , " a contractor told the channel .
The Guangzhou - based Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper today published a photo of a memo with a Foxconn letterhead that it said all employees were being asked to sign .
The letter instructed employees to report to a supervisor or seek medical help if they experienced any difficulties or frustration .
" I promise never to hurt myself or others in an extreme manner , " said a pledge section of the letter .
The letter also contained a section asking employees to allow the company to send them to a medical institution if they appeared to be in an " abnormal mental or physical state for the protection of myself and others " .
One Foxconn worker told the newspaper he had refused to sign because the company was seeking the right to institutionalise employees .
" If I bicker with my supervisor , will I be sent to a mental hospital ? " the employee told the paper .
But there was no shortage of people trying to get through the factory gates .
Around 8,000 people apply to work at the factory every day , Foxconn spokesman Liu Kun told the state - run China Daily newspaper .
The company has come under pressure from Beijing today , as China 's Taiwan Affairs Office said it was working with Foxconn to implement " effective measures " .
" We are deeply sorry for the Foxconn employees who jumped to their death , " the office 's spokesman , Yang Yi , told a news conference .
Mr Yang said the suicides would have no impact on China 's relations with self - ruled Taiwan .

EVER since he took charge of 65,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan in June last year , General Stanley McChrystal had acquired a reputation for straight talk about the war .
He gave reporters free access to meetings in which the bleak progress of the drive against the Taliban was bluntly discussed .
Frank and open - minded , genuinely interested in alternative views , the general happily took the press into his confidence .
In Dand , for example , a dusty region on the southern outskirts of Kandahar , he recently exhorted his troops , in front of this correspondent , to tell him what they thought was “ wrong ” with their effort to secure Afghanistan , whether they thought it was “ doable ” .
He minced no words in telling them “ what would cause us to lose . ”
And in a long interview , not short of self - criticism and uncertainty , he issued a daunting to - do list by the end of the year for southern Afghanistan , the Taliban 's heartland .
“ I think I 'll need to be able to say there 's clear progress , and in some places irreversible progress , in the Helmand river valley and hopefully Kandahar , ” he said .
In other words : without convincing — and improbable — improvements in security in those areas , NATO 's current efforts may be more or less over by Christmas .
Such candour was impressive , and an effective way of managing the press .
But it blew back in General McChrystal 's face this week , with the release of a profile of the general in Rolling Stone magazine that seemed to include every unguarded sentence he , or his aides , might have uttered .
Asked about Joe Biden , an opponent of the surge in NATO troops now under way — with an extra 30,000 American troops being deployed to the south , including those in Dand — the general says : “ Are you asking about Vice - President Joe Biden ?
Who 's that ? ”
Of similar opposition from America 's ambassador in Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , to his review of NATO 's operations , General McChrystal says : “ Here 's one that covers his flank for the history books .
Now if we fail , they can say ‘ I told you so ' . ”
None of this is exactly surprising .
That Mr Obama 's overcrowded team of senior advisers on Afghanistan have disagreed over what to do there — in the absence of any obvious good option — is well known .
In particular , many senior Americans , and also Europeans and South Asians , share General McChrystal 's aversion to the rootless office of Richard Holbrooke , America 's AfPak special envoy : “ Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke .
I do n't even want to open it , ” the general groans .
Among their own , senior soldiers have always grumbled about their civilian masters .
General McChrystal 's blunder was to put too much trust in Rolling Stone .
Yet the article appeared shortly after American casualties in Afghanistan had passed 1,000 and when even close aides to General McChrystal had been expressing grave pessimism about their prospects in the nine - year war .
Its effect was devastating .
After issuing his “ sincerest apology ” for the piece and offering to resign , General McChrystal was summoned to Washington to see an “ angry ” Mr Obama on June 23rd .
He was sacked and replaced by General David Petraeus , chief of the US Central Command .
Shifts and successes
Politically , the general probably had to go : leaving him in place would have been seen as weakness .
General Petraeus , America 's most admired soldier , is also a formidable replacement , not least because of his greater clout in Washington .
But in Afghanistan General McChrystal will be much missed .
With support from Mr Obama , who inherited ( and publicly embraced ) a losing cause from his predecessor , General McChrystal first rewrote the campaign plan .
The effect was to refine the haphazard counter - insurgency efforts of his predecessors , who include Mr Eikenberry : for example , by replacing a forlorn hope of controlling all Afghanistan with a serious bid to secure the densely populated reaches of the south .
This is still a daunting ambition .
Kandahar and Helmand are the heartland of an insurgency that affects most of southern and eastern Afghanistan and an increasing portion of the north and west .
A recent American survey of 120 insurgency - stricken districts ( around a third of all districts ) found that only a quarter of the population supported the government , and that over a third were sympathetic towards , or openly supported , the insurgents .
To beat back the insurgency , the American troops now being deployed to the south will have to bring both security and a massive change of heart .
This effort , concentrated in a summer offensive in Kandahar , is likely to determine the success of what is now General Petraeus 's mission .
The coalition — a 46 - nation mélange dominated by America , which will soon have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan — is meanwhile killing as many Taliban leaders as it can .
American , British and other special - force soldiers are conducting over a dozen operations a night for this purpose — including one last month that accounted for Mullah Zergay , the Taliban “ shadow ” governor of Kandahar .
This is part of a wider NATO effort to use violence more discriminately , in particular by limiting the aerial bombing that has killed hundreds of Afghan civilians .
In the ten months to April NATO planes dropped 2,838 bombs , a 19 % reduction on the previous ten months , despite an overall increase in fighting .
Atrocities persist , for which General McChrystal issued extraordinary apologies .
He also started punishing the culprits : last month six American officers received career - blighting black marks over the killing of 23 civilians .
In an escalating war , with insurgency - related violence up by 87 % in the six months to March , NATO 's losses are also climbing .
On June 7th - 8th , 12 soldiers were killed , including five Americans by a roadside bomb : the deadliest 24 - hour period this year .
Change has been ordered from Washington , too .
The cases of thousands of Afghan detainees have been reviewed , and over 200 released or handed over to Afghan custody .
On the battlefield , American troops are also said to be making more conspicuous efforts to respect their enemies ' rights .
In a well publicised assault in February on Marja , a Taliban - administered segment of the fertile and crowded Helmand river valley west of Kandahar , American troops took pains to get enemy wounded to hospital .
Aid workers in Afghanistan , who have long been scornful of American blundering there , are full of praise for these measures .
One senior figure describes the McChrystal makeover as “ a change in military culture ” .
It has brought some overdue realism , too .
NATO 's main enemies , the Taliban and two other insurgent groups , both linked to al - Qaeda and led by former commanders of the anti-Soviet jihad , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani , are based across the border in Pakistan — in the city of Quetta , in Baluchistan , and the rugged tribal areas .
This makes them virtually unbeatable : no counter - insurgency has been won against enemies enjoying such a sanctuary .
NATO 's surge is therefore mostly designed to weaken the Taliban , the biggest group , sufficiently to allow the weak and corrupt government of President Hamid Karzai to start administering areas they now control .
To stand half a chance , governance will have to be vastly improved .
A parallel army of foreign trainers and consultants has therefore been set to this task , in a simultaneous “ civilian surge ” .
As the government consolidates and the insurgency cools , NATO fancies , many jobbing insurgents — or “ $ 10 - a - day Taliban ” , as it calls them — will accept inducements to stop fighting .
In fact , there is little evidence that this describes many of NATO 's enemies , or that they will do any such thing .
More reassuringly , Afghanistan 's army and police force , which have been long neglected but are now being trained at express pace , will soon take the field in earnest .
That , more or less , is the plan .
And it had better start working soon .
To placate domestic opponents of the war , chiefly within his own party , Mr Obama has promised to start withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan in July 2011 .
Struggling in Helmand
No one familiar with the complacency and drift that has characterised NATO 's efforts in Afghanistan can be unimpressed by this new sense of purpose .
It represents the apogee of a decade of hard and often inglorious fighting by American troops , and a reorientation of the world 's most formidable war machine .
But will it be sufficient to avert defeat in Afghanistan ?
Probably not .
There is almost no chance that Afghanistan will be transformed by the time of Mr Obama 's deadline .
The insurgency is too robust .
The government is too weak .
Too much time has been lost .
According to a senior NATO official , it takes on average 13 years to win a counter - insurgency campaign ; and this campaign is , in effect , in year two .
In fact , the campaign 's mismanagement has done great damage : a congressional report on $ 2 billion of NATO contracts in Afghanistan , details of which were leaked this week , describes a hideous new mafia of politically connected warlords , enriched by contracts to protect the NATO convoys which some also allegedly attack .
If General McChrystal 's plan is to be given a fair trial , the promised American withdrawal will therefore have to be remarkably gradual .
Indeed , the expected withdrawal of 4,500 Dutch and Canadian troops over the next year will leave more gaps for Americans to fill .
But Mr Obama , as General McChrystal noted , will be hard - pressed to sanction this unless there is a significant success for his plan .
So far , not much is evident .
Bits of Helmand , where a vicious micro-conflict is fuelled by tribal rivalries and drug rackets , have been somewhat calmed since the arrival of 20,000 American troops last year to bail out 8,000 badly overstretched Brits .
As evidence of progress in Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital , Britain 's ambassador , William Patey , says that on a ( thickly guarded ) walk through the town 's bazaar , two - thirds of the locals were prepared to shake his hand .
Perhaps more telling is that one - third refused , in a province where nearly 300 British troops have lost their lives .
There is even less good news in nearby Marja .
Before launching an airborne assault there in February , General McChrystal earmarked it as a testing - ground for his strategy .
Once security was established there , he predicted , a “ government - in - a - box ” could be swiftly unpacked in the town , delighting its 60,000 inhabitants .
But American forces in Marja are now under nightly attack , locals have been beheaded by the Taliban for co-operating with them , and there is little government in evidence .
Given the town 's recent history , the transformation was always unlikely .
If in fact it reeked of desperation , the Taliban could smell it .
The men NATO needs , alas
This has put enormous pressure on NATO 's plans for Kandahar , Afghanistan 's second - biggest city and the former seat of Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader .
It is a violent place .
The militants are considered to have freedom to operate in four of its ten parishes .
They control much of Panjwayi , Zhari and Arghandab , three neighbouring districts , and have a strong influence in Dand , between Kandahar and Quetta .
In response to NATO 's push , the insurgents have announced a fresh offensive of their own .
The assassination of around 30 aid workers and officials in Kandahar in recent weeks may be a sign of this ; pro-government local strongmen are also alleged to be involved .
On June 9th a bomb - blast at a wedding - party in Arghandab killed 40 people , including many members of an American - raised local - defence militia .
The district 's American - befriended governor was murdered shortly afterwards .
Kandahar is mostly in government hands — but what hands they are .
Ahmed Wali Karzai , the president 's half - brother , is the city 's main power - broker .
He stands accused of running a mafia - style empire of illegal and legal businesses , backed by government and NATO patronage , enforced by violence , and including drug - trafficking , construction and private security .
He denies these allegations , for which there appears to be no hard evidence .
He is also alleged to have made millions of dollars from foreign contracts , some of them allegedly through a militia , Kandahar Strike Force , which works for the CIA .
In 2009 its gunmen also murdered Kandahar 's police chief .
Rightly or not , many Kandaharis believe the main representative of the law in Kandahar is above it .
At the least , the power and money that flows from Ahmed Wali to members of his small Popalzai tribe have exacerbated local jealousies .
Warlord - contractors
To improve security in and around Kandahar , NATO is now deploying an additional 10,000 American troops there , including those already in Dand .
In Panjwayi and Zhari this will involve a battle — sometime after mid-September , when the leaves wither on the grape - vines where insurgents hide .
With its slow progress in Marja in mind , however , NATO 's main focus is on improving Kandahar 's government .
Even setting aside its alleged robber baron , this will be tough .
The city 's police are largely untrained and corrupt , only eight of 120 stipulated judges are doing their jobs , and mains electricity and water are , for many Kandaharis , a rare treat .
Even gauging what sort of progress Kandaharis want is not easy .
Opinion polls in Afghanistan unsurprisingly point to Afghan unhappiness with insecurity , corruption and lack of economic opportunity .
But nobody knows the degree to which these things drive them to the Taliban , or what sort of progress might win them to the government .
Asked what NATO really understands about Afghan wants and fears , a senior adviser to General McChrystal says : “ I think we know we do n't know much , though it 's not for lack of trying . ”
Random straw - polling of southern
Afghans invariably shows little support for NATO 's coming offensive — and a good deal of suspicion about what , after all these years , the foreigners are really up to in Afghanistan .
“ Sometimes the foreign forces come to our village and sometimes the Taliban .
It 's a terrible situation .
Both sides are creating problems for us and both suspect us , ” says Muhammad Khan , one of four turbaned farmers of Zhari gathered in a guesthouse in Kandahar .
Two houses of his , he claims , were destroyed by NATO bombing , and he has received none of the compensation he was promised .
“ If they really want to push the Taliban out of area , they can easily do so — after all , in 2001 they occupied the whole country , ” he says of the Western forces .
“ We think they are not sincere , they do n't want to beat the Taliban at all . ”
But in case they are sincere , Mr Karim offered this advice .
“ Corruption is why people are turning to the Taliban .
If thousands of [ NATO ] operations are carried out it will make no difference so long as these corrupt officials are in place . ”
Western officials have been bad - mouthing Ahmed Wali for years .
This has merely annoyed Mr Karzai , for whom his half - brother allegedly did valuable vote - rigging service in last year 's rotten presidential poll .
With parliamentary elections due in September , Ahmed Wali remains a crucial placeman .
NATO 's best hope is therefore to sideline him , partly by starving him , and other parvenu warlords , of some of their fat contracts .
At a meeting in Kandahar to discuss the unwanted effects of NATO contracts , General McChrystal was informed that 570 of them , worth millions of dollars , had been issued from NATO 's airbase in Kandahar , and nobody was quite sure to whom .
The general consoled his aides : “ We were in a hurry , we were ignorant , we created a business environment , and now it 's come back to hurt us . ”
Yet it seems improbable that NATO , now in more of a hurry than ever , can fix this mess .
Private security companies now play a big role in this war .
They are estimated to employ around 50,000 gunmen .
In Kandahar there are 23 unregistered security companies , not including militias working with American special - forces soldiers and the CIA .
In the short term — on which NATO is being judged — cutting off the cash to these mobs would lead to yet more insecurity .
The abandoned turbine
In these circumstances , turning Kandahar round can seem less like a plan than an aspiration .
And there is more than a whiff of unreality to NATO 's chief development proposal : to splurge over $ 200 m on three vast diesel generators .
America 's State Department has opposed the scheme , arguing that it would be unsustainable for a government that raises only $ 1.2 billion in taxes and tariffs .
And a big hydropower plant at the nearby Kajaki dam should be able to light up Kandahar for a fraction of the cost .
Alas , the turbine dispatched for this purpose , in an operation involving 5,000 British troops , still lies in the Kajaki dirt , the Taliban having made it impossible to truck in cement to install it .
In approving the generator proposal , General McChrystal told his staff : “ While I think Kajaki is critical for a long - term solution , there ain't no long - term if we do n't win short - term . ”
The situation is grim .
To stand even a moderate chance of success , General McChrystal 's counter - insurgency strategy would require more time than American and European governments are prepared to give it .
Instead , NATO countries , perhaps including a reluctant America , are increasingly concluding that there will have to be a negotiated end to the war .
But the Taliban are in no rush to talk .
Their position is strong .
Perhaps the best that can be hoped for NATO 's current operations is to weaken the militants sufficiently to bring them to the table .
That near - impossible task now falls to the impressive , persistent , but human General Petraeus .
A few months ago I was contacted by Stephanie Johnnidis , who is a travel - blog writer , about a reservation for two villas for a couple of nights in April for herself and cousin Jon Johnnidis .
We talked a little about journalist discounts , but initially it was not something I was very interested in .
I get these scam requests every once in awhile from backpackers on surf trips , who I do n’t hear from again after I ask for their superiors ’ email addresses .
As it turns out , Stephanie is a professional and will be including Bocas Villas in a blog reviewing different hotels she visited in Bocas and Panama .
And Jon , who owns Axios Productions , a New York City based video production company , has produced content for various adventure travel destinations in the past and offered to create something for Bocas Villas for our online marketing campaign , which is something Blake Urmos and I had planned to do .
Jon and his stand - in production crew , which consisted of a buddy with a clipboard and some sort of mixed drink , were only at Bocas Villas for a few days .
The first was rainy and the forecast did n’t look good .
Brown says the Ngobe Indians throw a cat in the water when they need it to rain , but did n’t have any ideas about calling out the sun .
We did get some great weather , though , and had a couple of good days to send Jon on some tours that we do .
Their first day they went ( in the rain ) to Redfrog Beach on Bastimentos Island to look for some surf and got the shot you see in the video of a poison dart frog .
The next day , when the sun came out , they did another full - day tour , going through Dolphin Bay to Coral Key and the Zapatillas Islands in the Bastimentos Marine Park .
That ’s really a great day .
It ’s about 45 minutes to get there , but you go through a lot of the mangrove islets , see really unique sand beach islands , and get to do some great snorkeling .
We also did a quick trip to Starfish Beach and Bocas del Drago .
That ’s one of my favorites because its so easy and close and has everything I like in a beach : sand , shade and a bar .
Jon ended up getting some excellent raw footage and then he needed to interview me for the information .
I was in my own house , talking about something I talk about every day , was in a good mood , but , man , talking on cue for the camera really freaked me out .
The interview was well edited , but I can hear in my voice in a couple parts that I start to lose my shit a little bit .
Jon is a good sport , though , and produced a great video with some beautiful weather and my spotty performance .
The video is a nice feature for guests to view and learn what they are getting into .
But we also want to use it as a marketing tool , to get people to see our website and make a reservsation .
I do n’t know the real details of how this happens , but that is Blake ’s professional focus and his blog has some helpful information on how to use features like this .
We are also going to track as precisely as possible the impact this video has on traffic and conversions , and both Blake and Jon will be able to provide details about that .
Assuming this goes well their services are available .

TORONTO -
It was a day of unprecedented chaos in downtown Toronto as roving bands of G20 protesters set fire to police vehicles and smashed windows Saturday despite a $ 1 - billion security tab and thousands of police at the ready .
A core group of militant protesters , disguised with dark bandanas , wearing black bike helmets and using what 's referred to as a Black Bloc tactic , remained at large after their campaign of violence .
Still , police vowed to bring them to justice .
Police in riot gear marched through city streets for hours , pounding their shields in warning as they tried to restore order in a city under siege .
The violence came as leaders of the world 's G20 nations met behind the steel and concrete barrier that has earned the city the moniker " Fortress Toronto . "
With protesters seemingly running free through the streets , Toronto Mayor David Miller defended how police responded to the splinter groups that broke off from a larger , peaceful protest march .
" A small group of people essentially runs in a deliberate pattern away from that demonstration , a very difficult task to immediately redeploy everybody , " Miller said .
" The police have to protect the site where the G20 leaders are . "
That appeared to be the strategy , as police held their lines just north of the G20 security zone , metres away from a chaotic scene that saw bank windows smashed with hammers and storefronts destroyed by hurled rocks .
When reinforcements did arrive the protesters were long gone , leaving officers the task of driving back non-violent demonstrators .
" Our streets ! " the protesters chanted in response .
As night fell hundreds of protesters mounted a futile campaign .
Chanting " To the fence , " the group made several attempts to approach the security barrier , but was blocked by riot police at every turn .
Earlier , a newspaper photographer was shot with a plastic bullet in the backside , while another had an officer point a gun in his face despite identifying himself as a member of the media .
The Integrated Security Unit confirmed police fired plastic bullets during the protests .
The chaotic situation saw Toronto police use tear gas for the first time in the city 's history , said Chief Bill Blair , who added the city has never seen that level of violence in its streets .
Some 5,100 officers from forces across the province have been tasked with protecting the summit .
Security has been pegged at $ 1 billion .
A thick plume of dark grey smoke hovered above the city 's financial district at Bay and King streets after three police vehicles were set ablaze .
When the skies cleared , the damage was laid bare -- at least one cruiser was completely gutted by fire and the other two badly scorched .
Graffiti was scrawled on bank towers .
Hours later another police car was set on fire -- and then another .
The Prime Minister 's Office condemned the violence .
" Free speech is a principle of our democracy , but the thugs that prompted violence earlier today represent in no way , shape or form the Canadian way of life , " spokesman Dimitri Soudas said in a statement .
Miller made his remarks from the Direct Energy Centre , where international reporters covering the summit are stationed .
Four massive screens suspended from the ceiling showed a live shot of Toronto 's silhouetted cityscape dominated by the CN Tower , but not a sign of the chaos in the streets .
" That 's what they 're showing in here ? " he wondered aloud .
Police said more than 100 arrests were made , and that tally was expected to grow through the night .
The hospitals on University Avenue , where the march began , and the Eaton Centre shopping mall were put under lockdown .
There were reports of looting at the mall , a popular tourist attraction .
Downtown subway lines and commuter trains were shut down at the request of police at the height of the violence .
At the Ontario legislature riot police formed a line , three deep and began moving forward en masse to push back the crowd of a few hundred people .
Several times a group of about seven or eight officers would suddenly break out of the line , grab one of the protesters , handcuff them and drag them back behind the line .
The group chanted " shame " and " the world is watching , " while police told them it was an unlawful assembly .
Throughout the city officers had corralled groups of protesters , but there was no sign of the balaclava - clad protesters who caused the carnage .
That renegade group of about 50 people left a trail of destruction down Queen Street West in the heart of the city as they targeted symbols of power , authority and capitalism .
Bank windows were smashed with hammers .
Rocks were thrown through several Starbucks coffee houses .
TV vans were smashed .
Mailboxes were flipped and chucked at windows .
One protester threw a pickaxe through the window of a bank tower like a tomahawk as his posse roared its approval .
" Bomb the Banks , " was spray painted on walls .
Another protester was seriously injured after suffering a head injury and was carried away by others .
Store owners were moved to tears on the sidewalks outside their vandalized shops , and parents hurried away carrying crying children .
An eclectic group of about 4,000 people ranging from greying seniors to families with strollers and tattooed hipsters had gathered at 1 p.m. to protest the summit .
Things turned violent about 90 minutes later when the smaller group dressed in black broke away .
Black Bloc is often mistaken for an organization , but it 's actually a protest tactic according to websites devoted to the method .
Protesters dressed normally infiltrate peaceful demonstrations , then change into black clothing and cover their faces in balaclavas or ski masks .
The uniform look makes it difficult for police to identify who perpetrated an act of violence , such as smashing a window or spray - painting a building .
Protesters can change back into regular street clothing and go unnoticed by police .
James Ruehle , a 49 - year - old contractor from Pickering , a half hour 's drive from Toronto , saw the burning of the three police cruisers .
Ruehle was stopped in his truck at the lights at the corner of King and Bay streets in the city 's financial district as the protesters approached .
Three police vehicles zipped past the line of traffic into the intersection , where they stopped with lights flashing .
A group of about 20 to 30 police then began to congregate but an officer Ruehle thought was a police captain ordered them back .
" The cop was yelling at them ' Back up ! '
' Put your batons down ! " ' said Ruehle .
The police in the cars , he said , then amazed him by backing off , leaving the cruisers running in the middle of the intersection with their lights flashing and doors open .
" It was like an invitation G ( to the protesters ) , " said Ruehle .
" One kid with a helmet and a black suit jumps on the trunk lid of the police car and jumps up and down like a madman . "
Ruehle said three or four others in similar garb quickly joined in .
CHALMETTE , La. – Sixty miles off the Gulf of Mexico , the shrimpers and the people who work for them here worry and wait in a world of hurt .
Their boats are tied up .
They are not heading out to get shrimp as they do every year in May .
Instead , they are waiting to be called by BP to help clean up the oil that is spreading over the waters following last month ’s oil rig explosion .
“ The people here make their living off those same Gulf waters they keep showing on television , ” said David Dixon , a boat captain who has been a Bayou shrimper for 48 years .
Dixon catches shrimp , minnows and crickets which he sells at his live bait shop here which , according to his business card , is “ open seven days , early til late . ”
“ Everybody is afraid , everybody is hurting and we feel that there will be no way to recover from this oil spill , ” he said .
“ We were very slow to recover from Katrina and just as we were starting to come around this had to happen . ”
A mile down the road Jeff Pohlmann , the owner of Today ’s Ketch , a small fresh seafood restaurant , said , “ The hurricane destroyed the boats of the people who delivered to me , but this oil spill can destroy the very product we depend upon . ”
Today ’s Ketch was the first place in St. Bernard ’s Parish where people could get hot food after Katrina .
Pohlmann was working his business “ around the clock ” even before he had a home to live in .
His employees lived in trailers in the parking lot .
“ People here have house and boat notes they have to pay , ” Pohlmann said .
“ They are the ones who came back after the storm .
Now they ca n’t fish .
You ca n’t pay the bills with no money .
This will destroy the economy and our way of life , maybe forever . ”
As he spoke , a dozen local people in his little restaurant were enjoying what he said could be the last fresh shrimp sandwiches of the season .
Captain Dixon said his only chance to make money this shrimp season will be if he gets called by BP to help lay the protective boons the company hopes will slow the oil slick ’s relentless movement toward the shores .
As he invited People ’s World reporters onto his boat this week , Dixon said he was not optimistic about anything BP is currently doing about the disaster .
“ I attended a training session this morning that BP held for us , thinking they might have some type of plan , ” he said .
“ Instead , they were asking us what we thought should be done – how much of the area did we think they should be protecting with those booms and so on and so forth . ”
He said , “ A BP representative drove me around in a golf cart to survey an area and when I asked him about how or if or when this leak might stop , he told me , ‘ We do n’t know .
It could be three months , it could be six months , it could be six years – we have no idea ’ . ”
As he showed us around his boat Dixon said he feared that fishing may be destroyed forever in the region .
“ The chemicals they are dropping to disperse the oil could end up destroying the ability of marine life to reproduce for many generations into the future , ” he said , “ and that would mean disaster even if they do stop the oil before it comes up into these marshes . ”
“ I need the money and I know they ’ll call me to lay those booms , ” he said , as we stepped off his boat .
“ But that ’s not what I was meant to be doing .
I do n’t want to do that .
I ’m supposed to be bringing in the shrimp . ”

Chinese inflation is n't quite at the point where you need a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy a loaf of bread .
And yet ...
Hong Kong blog
The Dark Side found the incredible story of a Chinese mine owner who ran up a 200,000 yuan ( $ 30,000 ) bill at a Shanxi restaurant before learning the resturant did not take credit card .
Angered by the incident , the mine owner got on the phone and within ten minutes had 200,000 single bills delivered to the restaurant .
The Dark Side notes the absurdity of China not printing any notes over 100 yuan .
And the deficiencies of China 's credit card infrastructure .
And the ridiculous behavior of China 's nouveau super riche .
3 Surprising Ways Your Credit Score Could be Costing You
The recent recession has given rise to a backlash against credit .
And it is true that an irresponsible use of credit , especially credit cards , can lead to financial ruin .
For some , it might make sense to do away with the temptation and have done with credit altogether .
It ’s a nice thought , but if you are n’t maintaining your credit score , you might find yourself paying for it in unexpected ways .
You already know that your credit score is a Big Deal when it comes to how lenders view you .
Your credit score has to pass muster in order for you to get a loan to begin with .
Then , your credit score is what lenders use to determine the interest rate you pay .
The lower your credit score , the higher the interest rate — and the more money you pay over the life of the loan .
Many figure that they can save up enough cash to buy most things ( except a home ) , and that once they have a home , there is no need to worry about a good credit score .
Unfortunately , this is n’t true .
Here are 3 non-lending ways your credit score could be costing you :
1. Insurance Premiums
Many insurance companies now pull your credit score in order to help determine your premium .
Credit scores are used to help determine the likelihood that you will put in a claim .
For auto insurance companies , there is an increasingly assumed correlation between how responsible you are with your finances and how responsible you are likely to be on the road .
While your credit score is n’t everything for setting an insurance premium , it is becoming a prominent factor .
I save $ 15.00 a month on my insurance because I have a good credit score .
While it does n’t seem like much , if you consider the savings over the several years that I will be paying premiums , it really starts to add up .
2. Employment
If you have a poor credit history , especially if you are applying for a sensitive job , employers may worry that you could be susceptible to the temptations of taking bribes and embezzlement .
Even though employers are n’t supposed to look at your score , they can get a pretty good idea of what your score might be by looking at your credit report .
My brother - in - law was rejected for a job as a security guard because of his poor credit history .
Even if you are n’t in a particularly sensitive position , employers may be concerned that showing an irresponsible bent with your finances could translate into poor work habits .
An employer ca n’t just pull your credit report without your authorization , though .
However , if you are unwilling to allow a credit check , an employer may decide you are n’t worth the risk .
3. Landlords
If you are looking to rent , you might be rejected on the basis of your credit .
Landlords like tenants who pay on time , in full , and do n’t make trouble .
Your credit history might indicate that you have trouble paying on time , and could signal potential problems .
Many landlords who rent to those with lower credit scores require larger up front security deposits , or may insist on first and last month ’s rent up front .

Professor says chemicals ‘ worse than oil ’ ; Corexit substance also known as ‘ deodorized kerosene ’ , poses risk to man and animal alike
After initially approving a chemical oil dispersant called Corexit , the U.S Environmental Protection Agency retracted it ’s allowance and ordered British Petroleum to stop dumping the mysterious chemical substance by Sunday .

However , the oil giant has ignored the government ’s deadline and was continuing to dump large volumes of Corexit into the Gulf on Monday , according to The New York Times , apparently to keep the massive sea floor oil plumes from surfacing and possibly washing ashore .
“ The company told the agency that no better alternative was available , ” the paper noted .
That ’s not exactly true , however .
Another substance , Dispersit , was found some 10 years ago to be twice as effective and half as toxic , according to Wired Magazine .
Yet , tests on Dispersit are progressing very slowly and it does not exist in as large a quantity as Corexit .
“ That Corexit would be the first line of dispersant defense in the Gulf makes sense .
Originally synthesized by Exxon , various formulations of it have been used for decades to dilute spilled oil and accelerate its natural breakdown , ” they added .
“ Corexit 9500 is the dispersant that was in all the stockpiles .
When something like this happens , you need hundreds and hundreds of tons , ” Alun Lewis , an oil spill consultant , told the magazine .

Corexit has come under massive scrutiny in recent weeks since BP began dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons into the Gulf — up to 800,000 gallons thus far , according to recent reports — as the chemicals are shown to accumulate in a variety of marine life , which in some cases is later consumed by humans and can cause a variety of illnesses .
“ The exact makeup of the dispersants is kept secret under competitive trade laws , but a worker safety sheet for one product , called Corexit , says it includes 2 - butoxyethanol , a compound associated with headaches , vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses , ” Pro Publica noted .
However , Fast Company magazine added : “ in a statement to the Gulf Oil Disaster Recovery Group , toxicology expert Dr. William Sawyer elaborated on the risks associated with Corexit .
According to Sawyer , Corexit is also known as deodorized kerosene–a substance with health risks to humans as well as sea turtles , dolphins , breathing reptiles , birds , and any species that need to surface for air exchanges . ”

The chairman of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council called it “ worse than oil ” .
By roughly two weeks into the now month - long gusher , BP had bought up more than a third of the world ’s supply and had contracted Nalco Energy Services , L.P. in Sugarland , Texas to produce more .
An EPA product summary of Corexit does not disclose the ingredients , which are a corporate secret .
The federal agency recommends avoiding any bare skin contact with the substance and notes that its fumes could be harmful .

Maximizing the oil plumes
The number one benefit of a product like Corexit for a company like BP is to push the most plainly visible pollutants to the sea floor and away from coastal areas , where the true ecological damage will remain out of sight .
While much of the company ’s use of the substance involves surface spraying , they are also injecting large volumes of Corexit into deep waters , where already massive oil plumes have spread over dozens of square miles , their thickness and perimeter growing by the hour .
The accumulation of oil at the bottom of the ocean presents a more startling threat to the Gulf ’s ecology than shallow - water spills .
Paul Montagna , a marine ecologist at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , explained to AFP : “ What that means is that basically life in the entire water column is now being exposed . ”
“ Clearly you ’d expect a huge die off in the water column as well as in the ( affected ) sediments , ” said Wilma Subra , a chemist and consultant who works with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network .

Another major concern is that the subsea oil and dispersants can be carried by currents in an entirely different direction that where the wind and waves send the surface slick , creating a “ much larger area of impact , ” she added .
The reservoir BP had tapped is estimated to hold tens of millions of barrels .
If it is allowed to fully deplete those reserves , the Gulf could literally become a massive dead zone for generations to come .
BP said on Monday it would try to plug the well with a “ top kill ” procedure , injecting mud and cement into the rushing torrent of oil and natural gas in hopes that it wo n’t simply be flushed out .
All the company ’s other efforts at stopping the sprawling disaster have failed , prompting U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to warn that the oil giant may soon be pushed out of the way by U.S. authorities .
On the contrary , Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen told media on Monday that BP is , in fact , the country ’s best hope for plugging the well .

“ There ’s no reason to make a change ” in leadership of the spill response , ” he said , according to MSNBC .
There are nearly 4,000 active offshore drilling platforms in the northern Gulf region , according to the NOAA .

Q. What is the new definition of “ Taliban ” ?
A. Anyone who lives above a lithium deposit
On Monday we learned something that the Pentagon has known for years : Afghanistan is sitting on a trillion dollars worth of valuable minerals .
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html?ref=world
I have literally never seen a news story more interesting than this one .
I barely know where to begin .
For starters , why were Americans looking for mineral resources in Afghanistan in 2007 ?
I try so hard to NOT become a conspiracy theorist , but COME ON !
Give me a frickin’ chance !!!
If you ’re wondering when the U.S. will withdraw its forces from Afghanistan , you now have your answer : Never .
Our worst case scenario is peace .
If war ends in Afghanistan , some subset of the Taliban would eventually become fantastically wealthy with the help of foreign mining operations .
Nothing good can come from Taliban billionaires .
That ’s the strategic risk that will keep us there forever .
Of all the mineral riches that Afghanistan could have , why oh why did it have to include lithium ?
Just when I was getting all hopeful about electric cars , which require batteries , which will probably require lithium , we find out that lithium is located where the Taliban poop .
What were the odds of that ?
It ’s like the plot of a poorly written movie .
Meanwhile , the friendly Swiss are being completely useless and producing nothing but chocolate and lederhosen .
I will only say this once : I CAN ’T RUN MY CAR ON CHOCOLATE !
Strategy - wise , these valuable deposits in Afghanistan are a major problem for U.S. defense .
It makes leaving impossible and staying even harder .
Any sense of military legitimacy will soon be smothered by talk of economics .
If there ’s one argument that you can be sure will never fly with the American voting public , it goes like this : “ Those vast mineral deposits are a total coincidence . ”
The moral questions in Afghanistan are fascinating .
If a country harbors terrorists that attack your country , creating the necessity of invasion at great expense , do you get to keep some of the minerals you find ?
Or is it fairer that some goat herder or war lord who happens to live above a copper deposit by pure chance gets to become a billionaire while his neighbors starve ?
Is it moral to establish a thoroughly corrupt Afghan government , which might be the only kind possible , and then leave ?
I contend that all paths are thoroughly immoral .
If every option is equally immoral , maybe the next filter should be practicality .
I say we turn Afghanistan into a corporation , with all of the citizens owning equal shares after the U.S. Treasury carves out its 25 % stake of preferred stock .
Our military would stay there in a paid security arrangement , transitioning over time to a private operation .
The corporate bylaws would require American security personnel for at least 100 years .
Sort of like the Swiss Guard and the Vatican .
Afghanistan might never work as a country , but maybe it could work as a corporation .
Arguably , the corporate model is what makes China work so well .
The Chinese Communist Party reminds me of a corporate structure , where the CEO serves at the pleasure of the board of directors , and building wealth is the main goal .
In China , the head guy does n’t have dictator powers .
He serves at the pleasure of the Communist Party leaders , and he needs to perform well or they replace him .
Some version of that model would probably work a lot better than democracy for Afghanistan .
Yes , I do realize that nothing I write in this blog is factually accurate or remotely practical .
Thank you in advance for pointing that out .

Since opening our doors in 2002 we have seen simple pardon applications take well over two years to complete .
That is after all of the paperwork is done and the file has already been sent to the Parole Board of Canada .
Of course back then it was called the National Parole Board but a politician decided , [… ]
Trisect the angles of any triangle and you ’ll find an equilateral triangle at its heart .

Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) -- Japan 's prime minister is in a world of political hurt right now .
The latest poll numbers by the country 's largest daily newspaper , The Yomiuri Shimbun , showed 24 percent of those polled approve of Yukio Hatoyama 's performance , a nine - point drop from a month earlier , while 67 percent disapprove of him .
So when Hatoyama recently opened the doors of his official residence to serve Japanese barbeque to ordinary voters for an event called the " Real Hato Café , " his earnest effort to talk to ordinary citizens did n't grab the attention of critic Don Konishi -- but his choice of clothing did .
A multi-colored , throwback to the 1980s fashion disaster , Konishi explained , as he noted the prime minister 's red , yellow , green , purple and blue - checked plaid shirt .
The critic wrote a public condemnation about the shirt in a national magazine and warned the country that the multi-colored get - up represented what the poll numbers already show : Hatoyama is out of touch .
" This shirt comes from the ' 80s or '90s .
His ideas and philosophy are old .
Japan is facing a crisis and we can't overcome it with a prime minister like this . "
It 's the latest crime in a long fashion rap sheet , said Konishi , as he highlighted other multi-colored shirts , mauve coats , and what Konishi calls the biggest faux pas -- the hearts and pink blazer outfit .
On the day Konishi spoke with CNN , he wore white - rimmed glasses , silver shoes and a small brimmed hat .
" A fashion designer like me can wear this , but not the leader of Japan , " he said .
Konishi feels so strongly about Hatoyama because the country felt passionately about the prime minister , who stormed into power last August in a historic wave of voter discontent .
The Democratic Party of Japan unseated the Liberal Democratic Party , a ruling party that held power in the country for nearly 50 continuous years .
In office , the prime minister and his wife have been a fascinating new sort of first couple for Japan .
Mrs. Hatoyama , a published author , had previously published a tale in which she wrote that she had lived a previous life and in it , met American actor Tom Cruise .
In another public admonition , she told a talk show that she gets energy by " eating the sun . "
The prime minister , shortly after his election , became a radio sensation when an old song of his -- a lounge tune recorded decades ago called " Take Heart " -- hit the airwaves .
In the early months , the country embraced the quirks of the Hatoyamas .
But then frustrating stalemates began to crop up in his administration -- primarily , criticism over Hatoyama 's handling of the move of a U.S. base on the island of Okinawa .
Those polled in The Yomiuri Shimbun said he has been wishy - washy on finding a solution for the Okinawans .
The criticism of the shirt may seem catty and unimportant , but it 's a bad sign , said Keith Henry , a government affairs consultant at Asia Strategy .
" As a politician , you want to have the focus on policy and your agenda .
I think the press and the Japanese people have lost patience with him ; patience to the extent that they 're no longer paying attention to his policy proposals because no one has faith in his ability to implement them . "
" The press and the media are starting to nitpick on , really , things that are irrelevant to the future of the Japanese people but I would expect that to continue .
Whether he's not dressing properly , goes to the wrong restaurants , spends too much on dinner , what his wife is wearing .
It goes from the politics of policy to the politics of personality .
And that does n't help Japan . "
The poll numbers are not lost on the man who is the subject of the study .
Hatoyama told reporters : " I take it seriously that my approval ratings are down significantly .
But I 'm not going to quit . "

While BP still struggles to turn off the gusher of oil seeping up from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , one of its partners in the Deepwater Horizon is already assessing blame :
BP ’s three - front oil spill war — on the seafloor , on the Gulf Coast and in Congress — turned into a four - front battle Friday when its main partner in the damaged exploration well blamed the oil giant ’s “ reckless decisions and actions ” for causing a disaster that was “ preventable . ”
It was the first time since the blowout in the Gulf of Mexico that Anadarko Petroleum had given its view of the accident , and its chief executive , Jim Hackett , did not mince words .
In a statement , Hackett said he was “ shocked ” by information that has emerged from investigations of the accident .
He said it “ indicates BP operated unsafely and failed to monitor and react to several critical warning signs during the drilling of the Macondo well . ”
Anadarko ’s statement contrasted with the testimony of BP ’s chief executive , Tony Hayward , who told a congressional committee Thursday that it was too soon to reach conclusions about the disaster ’s causes .
Hackett ’s comments have huge financial implications .
As a 25 percent partner in the well , Anadarko would ordinarily be responsible for a quarter of all cleanup and damage costs .
But , Hackett said , “ BP ’s behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct and thus affect the obligations of the parties under the operating agreement . ”
He said Anadarko would donate to charity and civic groups any proceeds it receives from the sale of oil collected during the cleanup .
BP said it “ strongly disagrees ” with Hackett ’s allegations , but Hayward said in a statement that they “ will neither distract the company ’s focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore ” the Gulf Coast .
BP ’s chief executive added that “ other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . ”
But regardless of how liabilities are allocated , he said , BP would still “ pay all legitimate claims . ”
For the BP bosses in the tailored suits , it was a bitter end to a grueling , embarrassing week , one in which they were scolded and hectored from the White House to the Capitol and wound up with a $ 20 billion bill for the oil spill .
And it overshadowed indications that , far from the spotlight , BP engineers had had a pretty good week by the standards of this relentlessly grim calamity .
“ I have n’t really addressed those rumors because why defend yourself against something that is n’t offensive ? ”

Dominated to death in a ' dungeon ' :
Body of motor racing boss found after session with S&M torturer
A British motor racing chief died after a sadomasochistic sex session with a woman claiming to be ' Europe 's most perverted dominatrix ' , police have said .
Robin Mortimer , 58 , was found dead at the villa of the self - styled torturer Mistress Lucrezia in a hamlet in Belgium on Tuesday .
The married father of one had paid £ 600 to be ' punished ' by two leather - clad women in a medieval - style ' dungeon ' , it was claimed .
The racing boss and the dominatrix : Left , Robin Mortimer , who died after a ' torture session ' with Mistress Lucrezia , right
He may have choked on a rubber ball or died after taking an anaesthetic designed to prolong sadistic sex sessions , investigators said .
According to police sources , he was found in a shower cubicle , trussed up and wearing a leather ' gimp ' mask with a ball on a chain around his neck .
But he is understood to have died in another part of the club .
An ambulance had been called after attempts to resuscitate him failed .
He is believed to have visited the venue on more than one occasion , but it is understood his wife of 30 years knew nothing of his penchant for S&M .
Neighbours of their £ 500,000 gated home in Rugby , Warwickshire , said Bridget Mortimer , 50 , has multiple sclerosis .
She was too ill to comment , but in a statement the family said Mr Mortimer died of natural causes in his sleep at a hotel in Belgium .
However , the public prosecutor in Antwerp said an initial investigation suggested he did not die of natural causes .
Mistress Lucrezia - in reality , 44 - year - old Ira van Damm - and her ' assistant ' Mistress Juno , 36 , have been arrested on suspicion of assault and battery leading to Mr Mortimer 's death , without intent to kill .
Mr Mortimer was a talented motorcycle racer before switching to sports car racing in 1989 and creating the RPM Motorsport team .
' No softie ' :
On her website , Mistress Lucrezia says : ' In my nature , I 'm a sadist of the worst kind '
His son Alex , 25 , a champion racer , still plans to compete in the International GT Open in Belgium this weekend in memory of his father .
It was while travelling to the venue that Robin Mortimer took a detour to the village of Sint - Job - in - 't - Goor near Antwerp , investigators believe .
He visited the villa named ' Torment Towers ' , where dominatrixes charge £ 250 an hour - or £ 4,000 for three days - to inflict ' extreme pain ' , ' humiliation ' and ' torture ' on clients using ropes , leather and rubber .
Police who searched the property said they found some of the most extreme S&M equipment they had ever seen , including a vacuum machine for wrapping men's bodies in air - tight cling film .
Mistress Lucrezia , who has been running S&M sessions at the ' dungeon ' for five years , says on her website : ' I am very good with CP ( corporal punishment ) and bondage with ropes , leather , rubber and cling film . . . and I have lots of tools to help me be creative to make each session one you will never forget .
' Beware , I am not a softie .
I 'm sadistic , intelligent and perverse .
In my nature , I 'm a sadist of the worst kind . '
She is a regular visitor to Britain , performing at clubs in London and Warwickshire .
The Antwerp prosecutor said Mr Mortimer could have died after being given nitrous oxide , used as an anaesthetic to make sex sessions last longer .
The results of a post - mortem examination are expected within days .
Mr Mortimer 's death comes after F1 boss Max Mosley was filmed taking part in an S&M session with prostitutes in which they acted out prison fantasies .
He was last year awarded £ 60,000 in damages against the News of the World over what a court decided were false claims that it was a ' sick Nazi orgy ' .
HEADING OFF FUTURE CRISES HEADING OFF FUTURE CRISES Q : Would the Senate and House bills ensure there would n't be another financial crisis ?
A : Consumer advocates say the proposals go a long way by tightening rules on the trading of risky securities such as derivatives , providing for an orderly liquidation of big failing Wall Street firms and creating a consumer watchdog group to oversee products such as mortgages and credit cards .
Critics cite loopholes .
For instance , hedge funds , though subject to some regulation , as well as private - equity firms , could largely operate in the shadows .
Q : Would the bills guarantee there would n't be any more big bailouts of Wall Street firms ?
A : The proposals would minimize the chances by providing ways to wind down large failing firms without endangering the financial system .
Secured creditors would be made whole , and unsecured creditors and shareholders would reimburse any upfront costs paid by taxpayers .
But a Senate amendment that would have limited the size of the firms failed , and some say that if a big Wall Street firm were teetering , the government might be hard - pressed not to come to the rescue .
Q : Why would the bills give more oversight powers to the Federal Reserve , which failed to prevent the financial crisis ?
A : Obama administration officials and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that only the Fed has the experience to take on the responsibilities of regulating large non-bank financial firms such as insurance giant AIG and identifying risks to the financial system .
The Senate bill would try to strengthen the Fed by allowing more audits of the central bank 's emergency lending , bolstering its oversight staff and barring member banks from electing directors .
Q : Do the bills address mortgage - finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ?
A : Not really .
Senate Republicans proposed an amendment that would have ended government subsidies for the troubled companies .
Democrats opposed it , saying no one has come up with an alternative financing source .
Last year , the government said it would cover unlimited losses of Fannie and Freddie through 2012 , waiving a previous limit of $ 400 billion .
They have received $ 145 billion .
The Senate agreed to submit a plan for ending taxpayer support for the firms .
Q:Would the bills hurt Wall Street and the economy ?
A : Some financial service firms say they would .
Requirements that banks hold more in capital would mean less money for loans .
Forcing banks to spin off their derivatives trading units could deprive the firms of revenue and drive those operations overseas , some critics say .
Joe Lieber of Washington Analysis says the Senate bill could cut Wall Street firms ' earnings by about 20 % , but the effect on economic growth would be relatively small .
By Paul Davidson Washington reins in Wall Street : What happens next ?
The sweeping overhaul of financial regulations passed the Senate last week after a sometimes - acrimonious debate .
Now , another battle begins : reconciling differences between House and Senate versions of the 1,500 - page bill in conference .
While the two bills are largely similar , there are key differences whose resolution could determine how tightly the reins on Wall Street will be pulled and how many safeguards are provided to consumers .
For example , the Senate bill requires banks to divest their derivatives trading units and encourages regulators to prohibit banks from using their own capital for high - risk investments .
The House bill does n't .
FINANCIAL REGULATION : House and Senate differences The Senate places a new consumer watchdog agency within the Federal Reserve .
The House measure calls for a stand - alone entity but exempts car dealers — which lawmakers say sometimes steer buyers into bad loans — from agency oversight .
The Senate bill provides for the orderly liquidation of failing financial firms but does n't set aside a specific amount of money to pay for it .
The House calls for a $ 150 billion fund , paid by assessments on financial institutions .
" We expect ( the conference ) to be contentious , " says Steve Adamske , spokesman for the House Financial Services Committee .
Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , will chair the conference committee , which will also feature Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , chief author of the Senate bill , and other members of committees with roles in financial regulation .
All told , about 20 lawmakers from each of the chambers and both parties will participate , though the makeup will reflect the Democrats ' majority .
The conference is expected to begin after Memorial Day and last about two weeks .
The legislation that emerges must then be passed again by the House and Senate .
Frank and Dodd said Friday that they expect to present a final bill to President Obama by July 4 .
Frank also said he would like the conference to be televised , though that will be decided by the entire committee .
Frank " wants to give the people the confidence that we are working to resolve the issues that led to taxpayer bailouts of the financial industry , " Adamske says .
Typically , the House passes stricter regulatory bills .
But the Senate overhaul was toughened as public outrage boiled after the government filed fraud charges against Goldman Sachs last month .
The House measure passed in December .
As a result , Joe Lieber of Washington Analysis believes the final product " is likely to look more like the Senate bill .
It 's likely to be less moderated . "
Key parts of the Senate financial overhaul bill and how they differ from the House bill passed in December .
Main issues
What Senate bill does How House bill is different Consumer protection Consumers have not been adequately protected against predatory mortgages , credit cards and other financial products .
Regulators such as the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are focused mainly on safeguarding the safety and soundness of the institutions they regulate , not looking out for consumers .
It would create an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the Federal Reserve that would write rules and oversee a range of financial products offered by myriad providers , including banks , mortgage brokers and payday lenders .
A new oversight council could veto its regulations with a two - thirds vote .
The bill helps consumers by :
 Making it easier for merchants to give discounts for paying cash .
 Capping fees merchants pay for debit transactions , savings that could be passed to consumers .
 Requiring that consumers get their credit scores free when they 're denied credit .
Consumer bureau would be stand - alone agency , rather than in the Fed .
Unlike the Senate bill , its rules would not be subject to a possible veto by the oversight council .
However , some small businesses such as auto dealers , which Democrats say sometimes steer buyers into deceptive or high - cost loans , would be exempt from oversight by the agency .
Ending " too big to fail "
During the financial crisis , the government had no way to wind down large non -bank financial companies such as Bear Stearns and AIG without threatening the entire economy , because institutions are so closely interconnected .
The firms took big risks , knowing taxpayers would foot the bill .
The government had to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail them out .
The firms would face tighter regulation , such as having to keep higher capital reserves .
If they failed , certain creditors would be made whole to protect the financial system , but shareholders and unsecured creditors would bear losses and pay the costs of winding them down .
It would create a $ 150 billion fund financed by large financial companies to pay for the dissolution of failing companies .
The Senate version originally included a $ 50 billion fund , but that was removed after critics said it would encourage bailouts and possibly limit the government 's ability to assess more fees on firms .
Executive pay Big Wall Street bonuses rewarded short - term profits over the long - term health of the firms .
That gave executives incentives to take big risks with high leverage as the housing bubble formed and stick taxpayers with the bill when their bets fizzled .
The bill would give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive pay and require public companies to claw back compensation based on inaccurate financial statements that do n't comply with accounting standards .
It would require directors to win by a majority vote in uncontested elections .
The House bill would require financial institutions with more than $ 1 billion in assets to disclose compensation structures that include any incentive - based elements .
Derivatives Derivatives , which are bets on the price movement of a stock , commodity or other security , were squarely behind the collapse of AIG , the most expensive government bailout in U.S. history .
Because they are often private agreements between parties , they are hard to value .
The volume of outstanding derivatives worsened some firms ' financial troubles as the mortgage market spiraled down .
The bill would require most derivatives to be traded on exchanges to increase transparency and to be cleared through third parties to ensure there 's collateral behind the deals .
A controversial provision would require Wall Street banks to spin off their derivatives trading units , which are very lucrative for them .
Many industry players such as farmers and utilities which purchase derivatives to hedge the risk of price changes for their products would be exempt .
Also , the bill would not require banks to spin off their derivatives units .
Oversight powers
No federal agency is in charge of monitoring the stability of the entire financial system .
A large interconnected company , such as insurance giant AIG , whose failure would have had wide ripple effects , might have been stopped from placing big bets on the mortgage market if such an entity existed .
Bill would create a nine - member council of regulators including officials from the Fed , the SEC and FDIC to identify risks posed by large financial firms .
It can recommend to the Fed that such a firm increase capital reserves and even approve , with a two - thirds vote , a Fed decision forcing the firm to divest some holdings if it poses a grave threat to the economy .
It would create a council to monitor risks to the system and make recommendations but would leave it to various relevant agencies to implement them rather than the Fed exclusively .
Credit - rating agencies Agencies such as Standard & Poor 's and Moody 's gave misleadingly high ratings to bad securities during the crisis .
A big reason , critics say , is that the agencies are paid by the financial firms issuing the debt , such as mortgage - backed securities .
A new independent board would randomly select the agency providing the initial rating to a security .
Agencies also would have to disclose more information about how they assign ratings .
Ratings agencies would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
There 's no stipulation for how an agency is selected .

Like Sacred Heart of Jesus School in Boulder Colorado did to two children in early March , a Massachusetts elementary school has denied admission to a boy because he has lesbian parents , the AP reports :
" The Massachusetts woman , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about the effect of publicity on her son , said she planned to send the boy to third grade at St. Paul Elementary School in Hingham in the fall .
But she said she learned her son's acceptance was rescinded during a conference call Monday with Principal Cynthia Duggan and the parish priest , the Rev. James Rafferty .
' I'm accustomed to discrimination , I suppose , at my age and my experience as a gay woman , ' the mother said .
' But I did n't expect it against my child . '
Rafferty said her relationship ' was in discord with the teachings of the Catholic Church , ' which holds marriage is only between a man and woman , the woman said .
She said Duggan told her teachers would n't be prepared to answer questions her son might have because the school 's teachings about marriage conflict with what he sees in his family . "

The shattered wreck of the Cheonan was winched to the surface in two pieces
The US state department says there " will definitely be consequences " for North Korea following the sinking of a South Korean warship in March .
The North is facing international condemnation after investigators blamed it for the sinking of the ship , in which 46 sailors died .
Pyongyang has rejected the claim as a " fabrication " and threatened war if sanctions were imposed .
China urged restraint and did not criticise the North .
The report - by a team including experts from the US , Australia , Britain and Sweden - concluded that a torpedo had sunk the Cheonan corvette .
The investigators said parts of the torpedo found on the sea floor had lettering that matched a North Korean design .

The US has some 28,000 troops stationed in the South following the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the US was in " close consultation " with South Korea , which would decide what action to take .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak has pledged to take " stern action " .
Britain , Australia and Japan also expressed anger at North Korea .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the report was " deeply troubling " .
' All - out war '
Pyongyang has said it would send its own inspection team to the South , to " verify material evidence " behind the accusation .

A North Korean defence spokesman said the country would " respond to reckless counter - measure with an all - out war of justice " , the state KCNA news agency reported .
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Beijing had " noted " the report and would also make its own assessment , but called on both sides to exercise restraint .
South Korea 's Vice - Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chun Young - woo , said Seoul was considering taking the matter to the UN Security Council .
" The Security Council will consider what is necessary as a response to North Korea 's act of aggression , " he told the BBC .
" North Korea can not get away from this . "
The Cheonan went down near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border , raising tension between the two nations which technically remain at war .
Earlier , a number of explanations had been suggested for the sinking - including an accidental collision with an unexploded sea mine left over from the Korean War .

Supermarket chain
Tesco says it wants to see curbs on the sale of cheap alcohol during this Parliament .
Tesco has welcomed a promise by the coalition government to ban below - cost sales of alcohol in England and Wales .
The UK 's biggest retailer goes further , saying it would back the more radical step of introducing a minimum price .
Tesco says polling for the company found excessive drinking and the anti-social behaviour it causes is one of the public 's most serious concerns .
Significant discounts
The idea of a minimum price is already being considered by the Scottish Parliament .
During the World Cup , most retailers - including Tesco - are expected to offer significant discounts on alcohol .
In an exclusive BBC interview , Lucy Neville - Rolfe , Tesco 's director for corporate affairs , says in the absence of government action they have to compete on price .
" As a result there is lots of cheap alcohol , so we thought let 's ask the government to look at should there be a minimum price for alcohol , or should there be a ban on low - cost selling .
" Could it be justified because it will deal with the problem at the lower end ? "
The British Liver Trust backed Tesco 's decision .
The coalition government has said it will ban the sale of alcohol below cost price .
Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he welcomed Tesco's " swift decision " to support the ban .
" There is a vast social and financial cost attached to irresponsible drinking .
We need to tackle not only issues of supply but also the behavioural drivers that lead to irresponsible behaviour " .
Cultural issue
It is not clear how the ban on selling alcohol below cost price could be enforced as retailers would be reluctant to reveal commercially sensitive details of deals with suppliers .
One option might be to set a nominal price for each type of alcohol , then add the cost of VAT and duty to reach a total .
It is an option which falls short of the minimum price which the British Medical Association and many other health charities and doctors ' organisations have been championing .
Mr Lansley said current evidence did not support its introduction .
Even the proposals for a ban on below - cost sales and a review of price and taxation have been attacked by other retailers .
The fact is that a lot of people drink to get drunk , and therefore if you make alcohol more available and cheaper it fuels that problem
Peter Fahy
Greater Manchester Police
Send us your comments Andrew Opie , from the British Retail Consortium , said : " Irresponsible alcohol consumption is not about price , it 's a cultural issue .
Below - cost selling is simply not the widespread practice portrayed . "
Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Peter
Fahy agreed that there was a British culture of excessive drinking that was encouraged by low prices .
" Culture is created by things like the price and we do have a culture in this country of people drinking to excess , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" The fact is that a lot of people drink to get drunk , and therefore if you make alcohol more available and cheaper it fuels that problem . "
He said he was very pleased that the price of alcohol was being addressed because of the " huge impact " it has " on both the police service and the health service " .
Mr Fahy also said there was a strong link between domestic violence and people drinking excessively at home .
' Big voice '
In Scotland a bill that would introduce minimum pricing per unit of alcohol is going through the Holyrood parliament and will face crucial votes later this year .
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon welcomed Tesco's change of heart on the issue .
" Tesco is a big voice and will make a difference .
What 's particularly encouraging is that Tesco are saying they 're making this shift in position as a result of the views of their customers - because I think there is a sea change under way in public opinion .
" People increasingly understand the damage that alcohol misuse is doing . "
Alcohol policy is a particularly challenging area for the Liberal Democrats .
In the run-up to the Westminster elections they backed the idea of minimum pricing , but in Scotland they have so far not declared their hand .
Lib Dem votes would effectively decide whether the minority SNP administration could get the measure through to become the first country in the world to have a minimum price per unit of alcohol .
We asked you for your views on alcohol pricing .
Please find a selection of your comments below .
I find this talk of minimum pricing or banning low cost drink sales abhorrent on the basis that these policies essentially say that alcoholism is a disease of the poor and that by raising the price you stop their drinking and thus the problem .
This attitude is patronising , classist and incorrect .
Drinking to get drunk is a cultural issue and is in no way confined to people on low incomes ; how many times do you see drunken middleclass nitwits or managerial types in town centres being obnoxious ?
A far more sophisticated course of action is required than this dangerously simplistic " lets legislate everything " approach that has become common in the past two decades .
Society as a whole needs more common sense , including the politicians , rather than finding scapegoats for issues and banning anything that moves .
Jamie , East Midlands
This move is not before time .
Pubs on the whole have got their act together , but supermarkets will sell well below cost just to get you in .
I know for a fact that people buy cheap beer and then sell it on to kids making a nice killing .
Do you see 10 , 12 and 14 year olds falling out of pubs hammered ?
No .
Go to any park on any night and you 'll see the above off their heads on supermarket lager , wine and cider .
Please do n't trot out the old " it hits the normal person " as that no longer works .
We have a problem and we need to get our heads out of the sand and do something and this is a start !
Tony H , Manchester
The abuse of alcohol , which is a dangerous drug , is now ridiculous .
Simply control price , only allow alcohol sales in pubs , clubs , and off - licenses , rather than in shops and supermarkets , and reintroduce licensing hours .
The abusers should not be allowed to impact on the lives of those who are not dependent on this drug for their enjoyment .
Tim Lyon , Ascott under Wychwood , Oxfordshire Government should be tough on alcohol sales if they are very serious about the harm caused by alcohol misuse .
Setting up a minimum price on alcohol and banning below cost sales of alcohol should be implemented .
Also , alcohol should be sold in a separate place where shopkeepers can validate the age of each customer .
On top of that , supermarkets should stopping selling alcohol after 10 pm .
Noriko Cable , Leighton Buzzard
There is no need for a supermarket to compete on price if they feel they have a moral obligation not to make alcohol available cheaply .
The reason Tesco is likely to enjoy a minimum price is that it increases the profit margins they make by law .
It is unlikely Tesco will pass this price increase on to its suppliers and brewers .
I 'd love it if the government passed it into law that I must be paid 50 % more money !
Charles , Oxfordshire I 'm not quite sure what the government is trying to achieve with these minimum prices , apart from obviously higher revenue through taxing .
In some places I 'm sure the statistics will show it to be quite effective and there will be less occurrences of binge drinking there , but I 'm sure that it will still happen , and when it does , it will be worse .
Rather than a couple of people going out on the town , it will become a large group as people wo n't have enough money to do it in small numbers regularly .
It will also displease a large number of low income families or individuals , for example young folk .
The majority of us - I happen to be 18 - are very responsible with alcohol , only going overboard occasionally at parties , but never in public , and that 's all part of growing up .
If this minimum price law is passed then all it will do is upset the responsible drinkers , while the binge - drinking alcoholics simply continue spending more and more money to feed their addiction , leaving less money to feed their families .
Chris Warden , Fareham , Hampshire
The suggested price of 50 p per unit of alcohol seems by far and away the best approach .
It would not affect drinkers of most mainstream drinks as they are already above this price .
It would affect the selling of the low cost / high strength beverages .
This would reduce consumption .
David Lording , Hereford I 'm not sure how many people have a drink problem and buy alcohol from supermarkets , but yet again , this appears to be a big hammer to hit a smaller nail .
I buy alcohol from supermarkets for occasional use at home and for social events from time to time .
My budget is limited , and a rise in price would hit me and everyone else who enjoys an occasional tipple but is sensible about drinking .
Those who want to drink will find the money , whatever the cost , just as they do for cigarettes and illegal drugs .
More may even turn to crime to fund it .
But still the government gets their tax , and retailers and suppliers make even more money .
Excellent idea ...!
Ria , Windsor
Whilst I applaud the initiative to curb binge drinking and moreover underage drinking , most of the public at large are responsible in their consumption of alcohol .
I feel that the government is punishing so many for the actions of so few .
They did a similar thing to this in Sweden during the 80s and as a result , put the everyday drinking of alcohol out of reach of the masses .
They are consequently a more sober nation but are paying £ 7 to £ 8 for a pint .
Given the tax revenue derived from the sale of alcohol , can the government afford to do this ?
It will lead to an immediate drop in consumption .
Dave Kelly , Kirkby , Liverpool
These rules come from a nanny state that penalises the majority of drinkers that can and do consume responsibly .
Why would a large supermarket firm driven by profits not want some sort of intervention on this issue ?
It allows them to no longer promote loss leaders and thus generates more profits for them .
We need to raise awareness of the issues of alcoholism instead .
Sadly the supermarkets wo n't be getting a contribution from me as I will be buying in bulk from France .

Many travelers head to Australia not realizing the scale of their destination .
THROUGHOUT MY TWO years of living in Melbourne and hosting Couchsurfing guests , I met many visitors with overly ambitious plans and not enough time .
So I asked contributing editor Juliane Huang to compile a graphic to show everyone just how big Australia really is .
Even I was surprised at what she came back with .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
Primatologist Brian
Hare wishes more people could discover what bonobos can teach us about human nature .
" I really think they are the smartest ape in the world , " he said .
" We have a lot to learn from them . "
Bonobos are genetically close to humans , yet most people know very little about them .
Through his ongoing research , Hare hopes to change that .
" Bonobos really are our less familiar cousin that we have kept at arm 's length , " Hare said .
" The general public is so unfamiliar with them that even many reporters who have interviewed me have written in their stories that they are bonobo ' monkeys , ' not realizing they are apes — like us .
So it is great when the bonobos can have some attention . "
Bonobos are often confused with chimpanzees , but actually are quite different .
In looks , bonobos are smaller , with black faces , pink lips and long black hair , neatly parted in the middle .
Chimps have low , loud voices , while bonobos ' voices are high - pitched .
More significantly , chimps make war , males take charge , and chimps can be quite violent , even to the extent of killing one another .
Bonobos , on the other hand , are governed by females , do n't ever kill one another , and use sexual activity to maintain a peaceful collective temperament .
Hare , assistant professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University , spends several months of the year in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where he studies bonobos .
He focuses on their behavior , specifically on how they solve problems and interact with other bonobos .
Recently , he and his colleagues found that bonobos are natural sharers .
Their work , published in a recent Current Biology and funded by the National Science Foundation and the European Research Council , described how bonobos enjoy sharing food with other bonobos , and never outgrow their willingness to do so — unlike chimpanzees , who become more selfish when they reach adulthood .
In one experiment , the animals in an enclosure were allowed to keep an entire food pile for themselves or open a one - way door that would allow another bonobo to enter the room to eat with them .
Invariably , they opened the door .
" What we found is that the bonobos voluntarily chose to open the door for their neighbor so they could share the food , " Hare said .
Another set of experiments , at the Tchimpounga Sanctuary in Congo , compared chimpanzees to bonobos .
The young chimps were quite similar to young bonobos in their willingness to share food , but researchers discovered that the chimps became less willing to share as they grew older .
Bonobos , on the other hand , continued to share like juveniles even after reaching adulthood , they said .
" It seems like some of these adult differences might actually derive from developmental differences , " said Victoria Wobber , a Harvard graduate student who collaborates with Hare .
" Evolution has been acting on the development of their cognition . "
Hare and his mentor , Richard Wrangham at Harvard , believe bonobos act this way because they always have enjoyed an abundant environment .
They typically live south of the Congo River , where there is plenty of food , and where they do n't have to compete with gorillas — as chimpanzees must — or with each other .
However , bonobos have human enemies , specifically hunters engaged in the illegal international trade in bush meat .
Conservationists are working to rescue bonobos who have been orphaned by these activities , sheltering them in sanctuaries , where they are protected for as long as they live .
" Unfortunately , bonobos are not immune to the bullets of hunters and often fall prey , " Hare said .
" Their meat is sold in big cities in Congo , but bush meat traders try to sell infants that survive their mothers ' deaths as pets .
Here in Congo , it is illegal to buy and sell bonobos , so when an infant is discovered in the market , or in the possession of a wildlife trafficker , they are confiscated . "
The animals live in a sanctuary called Lola ya Bonobo , located in Les Petites Chutes de la Lukaya , just outside of Kinshasa .
" Lola ya Bonobo " means " paradise for bonobos " in Lingala , the main language of Kinshasa .
Lola ya Bonobo cares for more than 60 bonobo orphans .
The facility is run by a staff of conservation and welfare experts who " do an amazing job quickly rehabilitating the infant bonobos , so that they quickly recover from the trauma of their capture , and live a very normal and happy life with other bonobos here at the sanctuary , " Hare said , adding : " They have a huge 75 acre forest they play in each day . "
Many of these rescued bonobos serve as Hare 's research subjects .
At the sanctuary , Hare and his fellow researchers use experimental techniques to test the bonobos , and observe their behavior .
" Essentially , we design fun games that the bonobos can play and enjoy , but at the same time can reveal how they solve problems , " he said .
" The study published in Current Biology is a great example of how experiments are important to understand the psychology of animals . "
After the games , " we let the bonobos back out into their giant outdoor enclosures so they can play with all the other bonobos in the primary tropical forest they live in during the day , " Hare added .
" Basically , they stay inside for an hour or so , and get a lot of yummy food , and they go back outside . "
Born and raised in Atlanta , Hare , 34 , was always interested in animals and biology , so a career studying animal behavior , " comes kind of naturally , " he said .
He went to Emory University , where , among other things , he studied chimpanzees .
" However , I 'd always wanted to study bonobos and compare them to chimpanzees , " he said .
" I did my PhD work at Harvard with Richard Wrangham , who encouraged me to start working in African sanctuaries , like Lola ya Bonobo .
This is exciting because our research dollars go to organizations in ape habitat countries working on welfare and conservation efforts . "
Hare 's wife , Vanessa Woods , is a research scientist in Biological Anthropology and Anatomy at Duke and has written a book about the bonobos , Congo , and their research on bonobos , entitled Bonobo Handshake , scheduled to be released in June by Gotham / Penguin .
" I do think it could be a great reference if people want to learn more about bonobos , " Hare said .
" She detailed a lot of the story about our research — maybe too much detail in some places — a good place to look for embarrassing stories . "
Lola ya Bonobo is the largest bonobo captive facility in the world that supports research , Hare said , which enables scientists " to do a number of comparisons between chimpanzees and bonobos that would otherwise be impossible , " he added .
Hare is especially pleased that one of his research colleagues , Suzy Kwetuenda , based at Lola ya Bonobo , is the first Congolese student ever to study the psychology of bonobos .
“ " Hopefully , she will be the first of many students studying bonobos ' behavior and psychology , " added Hare , " and that will get average Congolese citizens excited about saving the bonobo , which is only found in their country . "

Kabul , Afghanistan --
A young boy dressed in women 's clothing , his face caked in make - up , dances the night away for a crowd of men .
The bells on his feet chime away , mimicking the entertainment and sexual appeal of female dancers .
But there is no mistaking his pubescent body and face as he concentrates , focusing on every step in order to please his master and his master 's guests .
This all played out in a video that CNN obtained from a person involved in the parties .
The boy is but one youth among many throughout the country forced into an age - old underground tradition known as " bacha bazi , " or " boy play , " in which young boys are taken from their families , made to dance and used as sex slaves by powerful men .
The number of boys involved is unknown -- the practice has been going on for centuries , in a country where such practices are overshadowed by conflict and war .
[ utubew ] u71l74-7xUM [/utubew ]
" It 's pretty much unappreciated by [ the ] society , unaccepted and illegal , " said Mohammad Musa Mahmodi of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission , one of the few organizations in the country working to end " bacha bazi . "
Islamic scholars have denounced " bacha bazi " as immoral but the practice continues in Afghanistan , where the government is in the throes of an increasingly bloody battle with insurgent Taliban militants and is also working to recover from decades of conflict .
The abuse stays on the backburner of issues in Afghanistan .
People are aware of it , but they do n't really talk about it .
Almost everyone in the country is coping with some level of injustice , and they are just trying to survive .
It is widely known among the population that , most of the time it is commanders , high - ranking officials and their friends who partake in the abuse of the boys .
" It continues because of the culture of impunity and lack of legal provision against this practice , " Mahmodi explained .
Farhad,19 , and Jamel , 20 , are two grown dancers who were forced into " bacha bazi " about five years ago .
Farhad was 13 when his older neighbor tricked him into coming to his home .
He was made to watch a sex tape and then raped .
After the brutal assault , he was taken to another location where he was locked up and used as a sex slave for five months .
" I got used to him , " Farhad said , trying to explain why he stayed with his neighbor after the traumatizing experience .
" He would sometimes take me to parties , and sometimes other places .
I was with him all the time , " he said .
In Afghan society the victims of rape and assault --- both male and female --- are often persecuted and punished rather than the perpetrator .
The shame forces boys like Farhad to continue in leading such lifestyles , even when they have the chance to break away .
Jamel , Farhad 's friend and dance partner , is now married but he was the " bacha bereesh " -- or " boy without a beard " -- of a powerful warlord who has since left the country .
He said the only reason he continues to dance is to provide for his younger brothers and sisters .
" I make them study , dress them , feed them .
Any money I make I spend on my family .
I do n't want them to be like this , be like me , " he said , brushing his shoulder length hair away from his eyes , framing his thin oval face .
Farhad and Jamel say their families know what is going on now but are powerless to stop it -- in fact they need the money and income they make .
Both Jamel and Farhad look and act more like women than men , a trait that can be deadly in Afghanistan 's male - dominated society .
Even the police can't be counted on for protection .
Farhad said that he was taken from a party by four police officers one night and almost gang raped at the station Before their commander walked in and stopped the assault .
But then , " He said if I wanted to be set free I should give him my money and my mobile , " Farhad said .
" I had no real choice , so I gave him my money and mobile . "
The boys said they are continuously threatened , beaten and raped by men who attend the parties they dance at ; parties fueled by alcohol and drugs .
"
The nights we go out , we are scared , " said , Jamel , who is the more talkative of the pair and the one who more resembles a woman .
" We always think about how we will be able to get out without someone attacking us . "
Despite the dangers , they continue to dance , making $ 30 for the night -- a night that usually ends in assault -- because they say it is the only thing they know and their only way to make money .
There are no opportunities in Afghanistan for people like them .
And once branded as men who danced as women , there is no turning back .
" We are not happy with this line of work , " Jamel said .
" We say that it would be better if God could just kill us rather than living like this . "
planning to get a dog or dogs and you live in a townhouse , apartment , etc .
There are several things you need to check on if you ’re , etc .
Obviously you should be allowed to have a dog no matter where you live , but ….
I ’m a 10 year old yellow Lab so I have to think that !
Before you bring the dog home you need to find out :
If you can have dogs
If there is a limit on the number
If there is a limit on the size
If there are rules on pet waste disposal
Can You Have Dogs ?
I do n’t understand why , but I hear that there are some places where you ’re not allowed to have dogs .
Make sure you do n’t live in one BEFORE you decide to get a dog and bring it home .
I would guess that rules like these come from people a long time ago who had dogs , but did n’t take care of them and / or forgot that they had 6 billion neighbors .
They likely let their dogs bark too much and did n’t pick up their dog ’s poop .
Both of these things probably annoyed the neighbors which resulted in new rules that said dogs were no longer allowed in the complex .
The moral of the story is ….
if you do live in a townhouse , apartment , etc where your neighbors are close and you ARE allowed to have pets , make sure you are a responsible pet owner .
Is There A Rule Against Having A 2nd Dog ?
I ’ve heard that there are dogs around who actually like to live with other dogs .
Well … I ’m not one of them .
Check out The Real Story to see why but I can tell you the short story is that my life was great , then the boss brought home this new dog who bites my ankles all the time .
I ’ve heard that things get better once they get out of the puppy phase , but we ’re soooo not there yet .
Anyway , if you live in a place that has pet restrictions , make sure that having a two dogs is n’t one of them BEFORE you decide to take the plunge .
Is There A Size Limit ?
Another thing you need to consider is whether there are rules about the size of the dog .
You will definitely need to know what you ’re working with before you get the new dog .
Size can be a little tricky .
I was the runt of my litter and we thought I was mostly done growing when I came to live in the townhouse .
I ’m a small for being a Labrador Retriever , because I only weigh about 50 pounds ( depending on how much time I ’ve spent at grandma ’s house recently ) but that is still about 10 pounds more than we thought I would weigh .
Luckily our weight limit is 50 pounds so it ’s ok for me to live here .
I would be really , really crabby if I had to leave after I decided I liked it here just because I grew too much .
The other dog that lives with us now ( Scout , because I get in trouble when I do n’t use her name ) came from the Animal Rescue League .
She was part of an “ unwanted liter ” .
They knew she was half - Lab , but did n’t know what the other half was except to know that because of her size it was obviously much smaller than a Lab .
She only weighed 9 pounds when she came home at 10 weeks old .
At 11 months she ’s under the limit but has surprised everyone by growing to 45 pounds .
So while all dog breeds have average sizes , it ’s good to remember that each dog is different .
We have two female Labs in our house but instead of the average size of 65 pounds we ’re at 50 and 45 .
We could have just as easily been 65 and 70 .
Are There Rules About Pet Waste Disposal ?
Dealing with your dog ’s poop and getting enough exercise for dogs are the two biggest issues for dog owners who do n’t have a huge back yard .
We ’ve got a lot of information about both topics on the site to help you figure out the best ways to handle this .
It is critical that you have a plan for how you ’re going to handle pet waste disposal BEFORE you bring the dog home .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
You really can successfully live with dogs in an apartment , a townhouse or a house without a yard , it just takes a little preparation and planning .
So … make sure you know the rules and regulations from the apartment / townhouse Association before you bring home a new dog .
Also make sure you ’re willing to live with whatever rules they have .
Let us know what you think about having dogs in apartments , townhouses , etc .
Why Not? Weight Classes for Prisons By Bryan Caplan
Why do we have separate men’s and women ’s prisons ?
You do n’t have to envision the alternative for long to have your answer :
Co-ed prisons would be a living hell of rape and brutality .
Or perhaps I should say : Even more of a living hell of rape and brutality , because that already describes single - sex prisons today .
I ’m not raising this issue to ruin Mothers ’ Day .
It ’s a lead - in to a serious proposal for prison reform .
Once you know how to make prisons even worse , you know how to make them better .
Namely : Reduce the variance of strength and aggression within single - sex prisons by separating prisoners into something like “ weight classes . ”
In boxing , heavyweights do n’t fight featherweights .
It ’s not a fair fight .
But in prison , heavyweights serve their time side - by - side with featherweights .
A simple remedy for rape and brutality , then , is split up prisoners by size and strength .
You could assign the various classes of prisoners to different wings .
Or if that ’s too logistically difficult , you could assign each prison a weight class , then reallocate existing prisoners .
Admittedly , we already have prisons for different kinds of offenses – minimum security , maximum security , and everything in between .
Like separating men and women , this probably makes the prison experience a little less hellish .
But there ’s still a long way to go , and my proposal seems like an obvious and cheap improvement over the status quo .
Note :
The “ weight class system ” targets prisoner - on - prisoner abuse .
It has no direct effect on the comparable problem of authority - on - prisoner abuse .
Even there , though , my reform would do some good .
It ’s probably easier for a guard to get away with raping a prisoner in an environment where prisoners are raping each other on a regular basis .
On the surface , it seems like weight classes for prisons should appeal to people from many different ideological standpoints .
Unless you tacitly favor prison rape ( perhaps as an extra deterrent in an overly forgiving legal system ? ) , it ’s hard to see the downside .
Still , I do n’t expect my proposal to sweep the world .
Does anything other than status quo bias stand in its way ?
A leading adult entertainment promoter has described as " ridiculous " the conviction and $ 300 fine handed out to a skimpy barmaid for showing too much buttock .
Megan Brooks , 30 , pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent exposure after two undercover police officers took offence at the outfit she was wearing while working at the Market City Tavern in the Perth suburb of Canning Vale in November 2008 .
She was wearing black - lace French knickers which the officers decided exposed too much of her buttocks .
The head of the company Ms Brooks was working for on the night in question said the whole incident was " ridiculous " and said police should instead be chasing violent criminals and protecting the elderly .
Canada could technically meet all its electricity needs and dramatically lower greenhouse - gas emissions if it moved aggressively to develop enhanced geothermal power projects , according to the first comprehensive assessment of the country ’s deep geothermal resources .
The study , published online in the Journal of Geophysics and Geoengineering , reports on the potential of using enhanced geothermal systems ( EGS ) to tap hot temperatures kilometres below the earth ’s surface as a way of generating clean electricity .
It found that the most promising Canadian sites are located in parts of British Columbia , Alberta and Saskatchewan at depths ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 kilometres .
Drill deeper , however , and the potential extends right across the country – including parts of Ontario .
“ At 10 kilometres we can expect EGS temperatures in the 150 to 200 degrees C range across most of Canada , except some areas of the Canadian shield , ” wrote Stephen Grasby , a geologist with the Geological Survey of Canada , and co-author Jacek Majorowicz , an Alberta - based geothermal consultant .
“ Given the widespread distribution of geothermal energy , and the high energy content , the potential geothermal resource in Canada is significant , ” they concluded .
The findings are n’t surprising – I ’ve been pounding on this drum for several years now .
But it ’s encouraging to finally see it expressed in a peer - reviewed journal .
Canada , shamefully , is the only country along the so - called Pacific Ring of Fire that has yet to switch on a conventional geothermal power plant .
The irony is that Canada is home to several of the continent ’s leading geothermal power developers .
Problem is they ’re mostly developing in Nevada , California , Nicaragua , Iceland , Chile – everywhere except Canada , where no formal development program exists .
Maybe now the federal and provincial governments will take the issue more seriously .
This new Canadian study comes three years after the release of a groundbreaking U.S. study led by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Their research suggested EGS in the United States could realistically supply about 100,000 megawatts of power generation capacity by 2050 , assuming the proper policies and R&D investments were committed .
For comparison , 100,000 megawatts – or 100 gigawatts — is roughly 80 per cent of Canada ’s current power generation capacity .
It ’s about one - twelfth of current U.S. capacity .
And the MIT - led group predicted it could be built less expensively than building new nuclear plants or investing in carbon capture and storage technologies for coal plants .
When the MIT - led study came out I lamented that Canada did n’t have similar research to spur development of “ heat mining ” projects on our own turf , particularly in Alberta where most of the electricity comes from coal - fired power plants .
I should clarify that not all geothermal power plants are created equally .
Conventional geothermal projects , like those found in places such as California or Iceland , benefit from ideal rock conditions – that is , porous rock that water can penetrate .
They also have naturally occurring hot - water reservoirs .
EGS is more complex .
These “ enhanced ” projects must be engineered to create the conditions required for generating power .
Subsurface rock must be hydraulically fractured to create cracks that water can travel through .
An outside source of water is also required , adding to the cost of the venture .
Under the EGS scenario , water is pumped into a well and forced to seep into cracks and pores in the rock , where the temperature is ideally above 150 degrees C .
The water absorbs the heat in the rock and is pumped back to the surface through a return well .
Heat exchangers then extract the heat from the water to create steam , which turns an electricity - generating turbine .
The water is then pumped back underground as part of a continuous cycle .
The Canadian Geothermal Association believes Canada , if determined , could develop 5,000 megawatts of geothermal power by 2015 – and that ’s just conventional geothermal with temperatures above 200 degrees C and wells less than three kilometres deep .
This is the low - hanging fruit we ’ve left dangling for decades .
Add to the equation the new technologies that make EGS possible and geothermal power could play the kind of role that hydroelectric power has historically played in Canada , particularly in western Canada ’s many hot spots .
Grasby and Majorowicz estimate that 2 per cent of the entire resource could be recovered for electricity generation .
It may sound like a small number , and even that could take many decades to develop , but do n’t let that fool you .

Think the spreading oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico could drive some species to extinction ?
Put your money where your mouth is .
The gambling website PaddyPower.com placed odds today on what species would be first to become extinct as a result of crude belching from BP PLC 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico .
Odds are the Kemp 's ridley turtle , and endangered species that migrates to the Gulf this time of year , would go first .
A $ 5 bet on the turtle would win $ 9 if it 's listed as extinct at any time because of the spill .
Less likely species -- the gulf sturgeon , smalltooth sawfish and elkhorn coral -- have payout rates of 20 - to - 1 .
In a statement announcing the extinction pool , the Irish bookmaker said it hoped the betting would " highlight the environmental catastrophe " and the " sure bet " that it would lead to the loss of some marine species .
" We kind of have a very simple philosophy at Paddy Power -- within reason if there is a very newsworthy event that are people are talking about , people should be allowed to back up their opinion with some cash , " said Ken Robertson , a company spokesman .
The website is also taking bets on who will be the next CEO of BP , the company responsible for the spill .
It also took bets on when the Icelandic volcano would stop erupting , and offers gambling on when the Large Hadron Collider will reach full power and what it will discover first : black power or dark energy .
Odds on the collider discovering God? 100 - to - 1 .
In the first six hours of betting on the species extinctions , there were more than 50 bets placed , Robertson said .
Other online gambling sites have taken bets on the spill .
Earlier this month , sports gambling site Bookmaker.com took bets on how successful or unsuccessful BP 's massive concrete dome would be at gathering the oil .
Their bookies put odds on the dome 's collecting 80 percent of the spill ( Greenwire , May 7 ) .
The mercenary take on the disaster comes as crude continues to flow and begins to creep into Louisiana 's coastal marshes .
Oil has pushed at least 12 miles into the wetlands and coated two major pelican rookeries , according to news reports .
Oil in marshes and wetlands is what local officials and scientists have long feared , saying it could place severe stresses on wildlife and harm marine nurseries and breeding grounds .
" Once it gets into the marshes , it will be very difficult to get rid of , " National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco told reporters last week .
" It is very toxic to many species at young stages , and fish and wildlife depend on estuaries as nursery habitat . "
Group wants listing for bluefin tuna
Concerned that the spill could have devastating effects on deepwater fisheries , the Center for Biological Diversity today petitioned the government to protect the bluefin tuna as an endangered species .
In a formal scientific petition submitted to NOAA , the group said oil will have devastating effects on eggs and larvae floating in the sheen and will harm adult tuna breathing oil into their gills .
Bluefin tuna populations have already declined because of overfishing in international waters .
The Obama administration supported a failed bid to ban the export of bluefin tuna as a part of international wildlife negotiations in March .
" Bluefin tuna encounter thousands of deadly hooks while migrating across the Atlantic , and now an oil spill will welcome home the survivors , " said Catherine Kilduff , an attorney for the group .
Marine biologists have said that tuna are at risk from oil and dispersants ( Greenwire , May 14 ) .
There are two populations of bluefin tuna :
One spawns in the Mediterranean and the other in the Gulf of Mexico .
The center wants endangered status for both .
Bluefin tuna is second on the bookies ' list in the PaddyPower.com pool , with a payout rate of 6 - to - 4 .

Barack Obama 's move is designed to quell an uproar over border security and immigration policy .
Guard ordered to Mexican border
In a move to quell growing public anger and mounting fear over illegal immigration along the Southwest border , President Barack Obama is ordering up to 1,200 additional National Guard troops to the border area and requesting an additional $ 500 million from Congress to slow the flow of migrants .
In addition to the troops , the funding will be used to increase Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security activities at the border with Mexico “ to include increased agents , investigators , and prosecutors , as part of a multi- layered effort to target illicit networks trafficking in people , drugs , illegal weapons , and money , ” an administration official said Tuesday .

The announcement seemed designed to blunt an amendment in the Senate by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to provide $ 250 million for deployment of 6,000 National Guard troops to the border .
And the White House move was quickly denounced by Republicans , who criticized it as insufficient , and by immigration reform advocates , who accused the White House of engaging in “ political theater . ”
“ It ’s simply not enough .
We need 6,000 , ” complained McCain , who is opposed by immigration foe J.D. Hayworth in a GOP primary .
“ The guard troops have had a very salutary effect .
That ’s why we need 6,000 of them , ” McCain said in a speech on the Senate floor .
He said such troops were needed to head off violent incidents such as one in March where an Arizona rancher was allegedly killed by someone crossing the border illegally .
Just before word of the border aid package emerged Tuesday afternoon , McCain squared off with the president over the issue during the closed - door session at the Capitol .
“ We need to secure the borders first , ” McCain said afterward .
“ He did n’t agree . "
Later Tuesday , the White House released a toughly worded letter directly criticizing McCain ’s proposal to dispatch 6,000 troops to the border .
“ There is no modern precedent for Congress to direct the president to deploy troops in the manner sought by the Amendment , ” National Security Adviser James Jones and Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser John Brennan wrote to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . )
“ It represents unwarranted interference with the Commander - in - Chief ’s responsibilities to direct the employment of our Armed Forces and thus infringes on the President ’s role in the management of the Total Force , " they wrote .
Immigrants ’ rights advocates , who have been grumbling for months about lackluster support from the White House for immigration reform legislation , said Obama ’s decision to send 1,200 troops amounted to pandering that would n’t do much to solve the border area ’s problems .
“ Deploying additional National Guard without a clear strategy to end arms or drug smuggling is a response to tired talking points , ” said Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum .
“ Without true immigration reform , the political theater will continue and billions will continue to be wasted on misguided border security measures . ”
“ We are outraged , ” Pablo Alvarado , director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network , said .
“ Instead of addressing a domestic human rights crisis , the president appears to be caving into extremists who are further shattering and already broken immigration system .
Any legitimate concerns about border security cannot be resolved until undocumented people are given full equality in our society . “
Obama aides insisted that the administration remains committed to passing immigration legislation .
“ We will also continue to work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system through comprehensive reform , which would provide lasting and dedicated resources by which to secure our borders and make our communities safer , ” one official said .
And in his meeting with Senate Republicans , Obama told Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) that the administration would not to be able reform immigration laws without some support from Republican lawmakers .
The White House pledge to add money and troops comes in wake of Arizona ’s passage of a tough immigration - related law that triggered warnings from Obama and others that it could result in Latinos legally in the U.S. being racially profiled by police .
McCain complained Tuesday that administration officials “ badly mischaracterized ” the legislation .
While Obama has indicated he believes the measure is ill - advised , he said understood the frustration of border residents with the flow of migrants and episodes of serious violence .
In a roundtable discussion with reporters in March , Obama said he did not want to “ militarize ” the border but that he was considering National Guard deployments and other measures to stem violence spilling over from Mexico .
“ I think if one U.S. citizen is killed because of foreign nationals who are engaging in violent crime , that 's enough of a concern to do something about it , " Obama said .
President George W. Bush sent 6,000 troops to the border in 2006 , though almost all of them were eventually withdrawn .
That deployment came after border state governors , such as Arizona ’s Janet Napolitano , demanded troops to deal with what they said was an emergency caused by illegal immigration .
Napolitano is now secretary of Homeland Security , the federal agency that implements immigration policy .
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , a Democrat who represents an Arizona district along the Mexican border , broke the news of Obama ’s plan in a statement she released Tuesday afternoon
“ The White House is doing the right thing , ” said Giffords , who has been asking for federal assistance since an Arizona rancher was killed in March .
“ Arizonans know that more boots on the ground means a safer and more secure border .
Washington heard our message . ”

Lord of The Rings actor Elijah Wood has reportedly signed to play a lead role in the Hollywood remake of controversial SBS comedy series Wilfred .
In a second major coup for the Australian creators of the series , Wood will play the male lead Ryan in the US pilot , leading entertainment website The Hollywood Reporter revealed today .
A feline - costumed Kestie Morassi with Wilfred , played Jason Gann .
In May it was announced that US cable network FX had picked up the rights to the show , which centres on the fraught relationship between a woman 's pet dog Wilfred , played by co-creator Jason Gann dressed in a dog suit , and Ryan , the woman 's new boyfriend .
Gann will reprise the role in the US pilot , which has been written by Family Guy 's David Zuckerman and is to be directed by Randall Einhorn , of the UK - adapted comedy series The Office and Parks & Recreation .
Zuckerman has described Wilfred as being " about a guy , the girl next door and a mixed - breed dog , Wilfred , who is part Labrador Retriever and part Russell Crowe on a bender . "
The gig is a first for Wood , who became known worldwide as hobbit Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson 's fantasy juggernaut but has never had a starring role in a TV series .
THR reports filming is due to begin towards the end of the year .
Wilfred was conceived by Australian actor - writer Adam Zwar , who entered it as a seven minute short film at Tropfest 2002 .
It won best comedy and best actor ( Gann ) and ran for two seasons on SBS .
Wilfred was criticised in March by the conservative politician Senator Steve Fielding because it was funded using public money .
" I do n't think taxpayers ' money should be used to finance film projects that display acts of bestiality , " he said .

Senator Benigno Aquino III ( " Noynoy " Aquino ) campaigns in Manila .
By Reihana Mohideen
( Based on interviews with leaders of the Philippines left , Frank Pascual , Sonny Melencio and Ric Reyes . )
June 13 , 2010 -- On June 9 Senator Benigno Aquino III ( " Noynoy " Aquino ) of the Liberal Party , the son of former President Cory Aqunio , was proclaimed president by the Philippines Congress .
Noynoy was a former senator “ with little legislative record to speak of ” , according to the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper , which nevertheless campaigned hard for Noynoy Aquino ’s presidency , soon after Cory Aquino ’s death in August 2009 .
Paradoxically , with the restoration of the Aquinos to the presidency , the elections have also resulted in the restoration of the Marcoses to national politics , with the former dictator 's son Bongbong Marcos being elected to the Senate , Imelda Marcos winning a seat in Congress and her daughter Imee Marcos winning the governorship of their political bailiwick , the province of Ilocos Norte .
Almost 25 years after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship and the installation of Cory Aquino ’s " revolutionary government " in 1986 , what does the Noynoy presidency mean for Philippines politics ?
Mass expectations
According to a Social Weather Station survey conducted in March , the number of registered voters who are optimistic that their lives will improve in the next 12 months has increased across all classes .
The survey confirms what we already knew : the expectations of the masses have increased as a result of the Noynoy victory .
This is in a context where mass expectations had been crushed under the insatiably corrupt presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ( known as GMA ) and the people , especially the middle classes , demoralised by the regime 's ability to hold on to power .
Hence people 's expectations are now rising , but from a state of very low expectations .
The sullen hatred of the people for the GMA regime and their desire for an honest government are the key political factors that led to Noynoy 's victory .
This is also what Nonoy has promised : an end to corruption and for a clean government .
For a people who expected literally nothing from the GMA government , who were demoralised and even fearful of the prospects of GMA prolonging her rule , this promise alone was enough .
As Sonny Melencio points out :
“ Noynoy ’s victory is a confirmation that the main issue in the election was the high - handed corruption of the Arroyo regime .
People voted for Noynoy because they were sick and tired of the never - ending cases of graft and corruption involving the Arroyo family and their sycophants .
Noynoy ’s campaign slogan ` Kung walang corrupt , walang mahirap ' [ No corruption , no poverty ] may not be true ( as poverty emanates not mainly from corruption but from class exploitation and class rule ) but it rings a bell and has attracted a broad number of people to support Noynoy in the election .
“ During the campaign , it was not only Noynoy who represented the people ’s ire against Arroyo .
‘ Erap ’ Estrada [ former president ousted by people 's power in 2001 ] also thrived on it , and the fact that he landed number two in the count despite his perennial number - three status in the surveys proved the validity of the anti-Arroyo sentiments . ”
Melencio also points to the media support for Noynoy :
“ What Erap lacked was media support -– the support of some of the media moguls -- and it was this support that catapulted Noynoy to a very early lead in the surveys and in the people ’s minds .
The media campaign for Noynoy started immediately after Cory ’s body had been laid to rest on August 5 , 2009 , or nine months before the elections .
After this , almost not a day passed that Noynoy was not mentioned in the media , or graciously featured in the ABS - CBN TV stations that supported his presidential campaign to the hilt . ”
Unifying the ruling class
A key agenda of the Noynoy presidency will be to unify the hitherto badly fractured ruling class .
The Estrada camp has already publicly declared it 's willingness to make amends .
Even the Marcoses are putting out feelers , and according to newpaper reports Imee Marcos and Noynoy Aquino have been exchanging " text " messages .
Given that the Liberal Party is a minority in the Senate , there is pressure on Noynoy from the Liberal Party machine to bring on board senators from other elite factions , including Bongbong Marcos .
The possibility of compromises with the Arroyo political clan and its trapo [ traditional politicians ] backers , who still have substantial clout in the new Congress , should not be ruled out either .
Nonoy also has the backing of big business , represented by the Makati Business Club .
He has the support of the governments of the United States , Europe and Japan , as indicated by the " courtesy calls " paid by their ambassadors even before Noynoy was officially declared the winner .
Their message to the Filipino elite was clear :
He 's the man and make sure that the result is proclaimed without any disruptive bickering .
According to Frank Pascual :
“ While the Liberal Party , historically a party of the landlord class , is a major player and the biggest faction influencing Noynoy , there are other forces , including extremely conservative forces around him , such as big business …
Noynoy has also earned a lot of good will from Western nations : the same pheonomena as during Cory 's time .
This is an indicator of renewed big business confidence , as the previous regime was very difficult to deal with , even in bourgeois terms .
“ For the ruling class , Noynoy is the best choice , especially after GMA .
Reducing corruption can be good for big business , but whether it translates into benefits for the people is another matter …
The Cory presidency was installed by a different phenomena [ a mass upsurge against the dictatorship ] .
Noynoy does not have that kind of flexibility to pursue the peoples agenda . ”
Of course Cory Aquino herself compromised with Marcos cronies in order to stabilise elite rule .
She compromised with Marcos ' generals , for example , several of whom are still in place .
As a result of this she was unable to bring the perpetrators of her husband 's assassination to justice , as this would have involved challenging the military hierarchy .
The same dilemma haunts Noynoy Aquino .
While various factions of the elite have indicated their willingness to smoke the peace pipe , for the moment , it is extremely unlikely that this will continue beyond the initial phase of the Noynoy presidency .
Major divisions will continue to persist and right now the issue of bringing GMA and her cronies to justice for corruption and plunder needs to be resolved .
Meanwhile the unresolved historical legacy of the Marcoses , will continue to persist , even in the background .
The Marcos revival : a Cory legacy
According to Frank Pascual :
“ The Marcoses have never been out of power in Ilocos , but at the national level it 's been a different story .
Powerful political clans such as the Escuderos of Bicol [ who were former Marcos cronies ] are aligned with Noynoy , but brought along Bongbong Marcos in their campaign .
This is classic elite politics as they wheel and deal within their own class . ”
Sonny Melencio explains :
" The crony system put in place by Marcos was restored by Cory with a liberal - democratic façade .
This system continues today .
The assets of the Marcoses and their cronies were not confiscated and their economic weight was never comprehensively undermined .
Even their political space , especially in their local bailiwicks tied to land and trapo politics in Ilocos , was not seriously contested .
Cory placed some local government officials and administrators in Illocos who continued to make deals with the Marcoses .
There were real possibilities that opened up to undermine elite rule , but Cory never acted on this and it was never her intention to do so .
This and her legacy of the system we have today , shows the serious limitations of the Cory revolution . ”
This troublesome Cory legacy is poignantly described in an open letter to Noynoy by F. Sionil Jose , a well - known author and publisher , who writes , “ Prosecute the crooks .
It is difficult , thankless and even dangerous to do this .
Your mother did not do it –- she did not jail Imelda who was the partner in that conjugal dictatorship that plundered this nation .
Watch her children … heirs to the billions which their parents stashed aboard .
Now the Marcoses are on the high road to power , gloating , snickering at our credulity and despicable amnesia . ”
In times like these , it pays to have a long memory .
There can be no trapo politics without corrupt trapo elections , and the May 10 elections witnessed some of the biggest vote - buying in election history .
The election of a popular president , who won by a landslide , has obscured the level of the election - related corruption .
The media and the Catholic Church hierarchy praising the election process has also made it harder to expose the extent of vote buying .
While Noynoy was elected on an anti-corruption platform , ironically , the two most honest elected public officials in the entire country , governors Grace Padaca ( in Isabela ) and Ed Panlilio ( in Pampanga ) , were voted out as a result of a sustained campaign against them by the political clans in their respective provinces .
It is estimated that some 1 billion pesos was spent against Grace Padaca in Isabela with P500 and P1000 notes being distributed like leaflets .
Prospects
According to Ric Reyes :
“ We can expect Noynoy to run after GMA and her cohorts who are responsible for all those gargantuan corruption scandals which marred the latter 's presidency .
His chances of success ?
Fifty - fifty is my estimate given GMA 's continuing clout in Congress , the Supreme Court and the Ombudsman .
“ We can also expect Noynoy to take steps to rationalise the bourgeois state 's functions and operations in accordance with the demands for `transparency and accountability ' -- a major plank of the agenda to modernise the Philippines state , the same agenda espoused by forces which supported him like powerful sections of the big bourgeoisie , namely the Makati Business Club and one or two media moguls and which gained currency among the middle classes .
This is also the agenda being pressed on those at the helm of the Philippines state for years -- the US , European and Japanese governments and global multilateral agencies which lost no time in recognising his victory .
I can also see a 50 - 50 chance for him to succeed here in the face of the resilience and stubbornness of the rentier capitalists and semi-feudal warlords and politicians who comprise a significant section of the national elites and who dominate the local elites .
“ As to the national dream of deliverance from poverty for the majority and the huge social inequity of wealth and opportunities , the Noynoy presidency has more limitations than the watch of his mother , Cory Aquino , to accomplish anything significant in this direction .
For one , he studiously avoided making any tangible promise to solve the Hacienda Luisita agrarian reform case .
He did not touch the labour contractualisation issue .
His promise to provide decent jobs to the millions of unemployed and underemployed simply cannot be realised without a radical departure from the neoliberal framework of the Philippinea state , without industrialisation and strong social justice measures , all of which he never touched in his campaign .
The huge votes he got from the masses are unorganised and are not reflective of working - class power and clout . ”
To end poverty the poor must be in power , to paraphrase Hugo Chavez , president of the revolutionary government in Venezuela .
The result of the May 10 elections has been to deeply entrench elite rule .
Both houses of Congress are dominated by the traditional political clans who have held sway over Philippines society and politics for decades .
They have reproduced themselves through newer generations of sons and grandsons , daughters and granddaughters , who now sit in Congress .
The expectations of the masses do not aspire so high that they believe that the Noynoy government will eliminate poverty .
Corruption
What about corruption ?
Will the Noynoy government be able to eliminate corruption , which is what it has promised to do ?
Noynoy himself , unlike GMA , will no doubt attempt to set an example of an honest presidency , but what about the rest of them ?
Corruption has been the essence of elite rule , of the trapo system , in this country .
To get rid of corruption Noynoy has to confront the system of elite rule itself .
To believe otherwise will be a fundamental error .
This will require a revolutionary government , not of the Cory type -- which was declared a revolutionary government but did nothing revolutionary -- but of the Latin American type , i.e. that of Bolivia and Venezuela .
These governments have not only put in place new constitutions with substantial political reforms , they have also rejected outright the neoliberal economic agenda and have implemented economic programs that massively increase expenditure on social welfare programs , such as health and education , and have also taken a series of measures that have increased the standard of living of the working class and the poor , including through the granting of substantial wage increases .
Presidents Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez openly espouse the need for an alternative economic and social system based on socialist principles .
Noynoy ’s record as a senator gives us very little confidence that he is a Morales or Chavez or even a Lula de Silva [ president of Brazil ] .
And the Liberal Party is a far cry from the Workers ' Party of Brazil , both in terms of its origins and political record .
As the author F. Sionil Jose states in his open letter to Noynoy : “ To succeed you have to betray your class . ”
There is no reason to believe that Noynoy is prepared to do so and any such " hope " will be dangerously misplaced .
Given the forces around him –- the Liberal Party , the Makati Business Club and other secret and less - secret factions of the elite –- his best shot is more likely to be an attempt to -- in the words of the infamous Romula Neri , the former National Economic Development Authority director - general and GMA ally -- “ moderate their greed ” , i.e. to modulate the worst excesses of plunder and corruption of the system of elite rule .
With the prospects of a more united ruling class and perhaps a more moderate and less rapacious exploitation of the masses , does this mean that we are now facing a lengthy and stable period of a renewed and more benign Philippines capitalism ?
Frank Pascual argues that this is not the case :
“ Noynoy still has to spell out for the ruling class how exactly it will benefit from his rule .
And given the sorry state of the Philippines economy , there 's not much to divide up among the greedy elite .
The Philippines economy will also suffer from the crisis of the capitalist system as a whole and this will be a problem faced by the Noynoy government in trying to stabilise the system .
After a brief honeymoon period , the usual infighting among the elite will start again . ”
In weighing up the relationship of forces that will impact on future prospects , it must be acknowledged that a progressive coalition partner of the Noynoy presidency is Akbayan , which could be in a position to influence the new government .
However , the Liberal Party is refusing to back measures to ensure the election of an Akbayan senator .
This is a problematic start and does not bode well for the progressive forces around Noynoy .
Ultimately , Akbayan 's ability to shift the relationship of forces in a progressive direction will depend on the strength of the independent mass movement .
The mass movement and the left
What are the prospects for the mass movement under the Noynoy presidency ?
And what is the character of the mass movement that we need to develop in the period ahead ?
These will be some of the key questions and ongoing challenges that will have to be addressed by the left , specifically in the context of a honeymoon period of a popular president .
An important starting point for the left and the mass movement is how to relate to the raised expectations of the masses ?
Raised expectations can be a double - edged sword for the left , because it simultaneously represents the misplaced illusions of the masses in bourgeois rule , but also indicates their increased confidence .
Sonny Melencio points out :
“ Higher expectations can be a positive factor for the left .
The left needs to build on these mass expectations and at the same time develop them .
The character of the mass movement that the left needs to develop today is one that will challenge the Noynoy government to keep its promises , however vague these might be , but as interpreted by the mass movement , and at the same time extend it to include the more substantial demands of the masses .
“ For example , the masses expect that Noynoy will go after GMA and follow through with the cases of plunder against her .
The mass movement must ensure that this takes place , but also put demands on the Noynoy government to go after the corrupt practices of other trapos and big business .
He is also replacing some GMA appointees in the military , such as General Bangit [ the chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ] , but the mass movement must also demand that this be extended to get rid of other corrupt generals who plunder the economy , carry out the cheating for the trapos during elections and who are responsible for extra-judicial killings .
“ A joint declaration of labour unions was also made with Noynoy , which is extremely weak and full of motherhood statements about benefits for workers .
It does not include any concrete demands .
The workers ' movement needs to mobilise to concretise these general policy statements into demands for the repeal of anti-strike and anti-union laws and against contractualisation . ”
According to Ric Reyes :
“ There will be plenty of issues -- social , economic , political , cultural , globally linked , which can objectively rouse mass movements among the working classes .
But as shown by the experience of the past two decades , such mass movements can never rise to significant proportions , much less become a successful challenge to the bourgeois state , without a real political vanguard -- a class - conscious , immersed among the people , competent , effective leading force that can connect with the aspirations of the people and the new standards of contemporary politics and culture .
Without this vanguard , popular resistance and mass outbreaks can only become captives of reformism which will get more hype from the bourgeois media , the churches ' hierarchy and the NGO movement , which has become more of a movement for palliatives than anything else . ”
A problem that is posed is the cooptation of the mass movement and the left .
It will be a major problem if left leaders accept key positions in the Noynoy government and become responsible for implementing neoliberal policies .
In general , however , Philippines capitalism is too weak to be able to co-opt large sections of the progressive movement .
i.e. a Western - style , social - democratic agenda , is not viable in the Philippines setting .
Mass movements and parties with integrity will stand by their demands and programs and maintain their independence from capitalist governments , including those of the Noynoy variety .
If they do n't , there is no middle road for them .
They will have to join the elite and become a part of the system of elite rule , as has been the case with social - democratic formations in the Philippines .
There will be no turn around of the objective situation under a Noynoy presidency .
The economic and social crises will continue .
The masses will continue to be beleaguered by grinding poverty in their daily lives .
The real question is the capability of the left to respond .
The left is preparing to mobilise around the state of the nation address in July .
The capability of the left will also be strengthened to the extent that it can unite its forces in the streets .

Americans , I have some bad news for you :
You have the worst quality of life in the developed world – by a wide margin .
If you had any idea of how people really lived in Western Europe , Australia , New Zealand , Canada and many parts of Asia , you ’d be rioting in the streets calling for a better life .
In fact , the average Australian or Singaporean taxi driver has a much better standard of living than the typical American white - collar worker .
I know this because I am an American , and I escaped from the prison you call home .
I have lived all around the world , in wealthy countries and poor ones , and there is only one country I would never consider living in again : The United States of America .
The mere thought of it fills me with dread .
Consider this : you are the only people in the developed world without a single - payer health system .
Everyone in Western Europe , Japan , Canada , Australia , Singapore and New Zealand has a single - payer system .
If they get sick , they can devote all their energies to getting well .
If you get sick , you have to battle two things at once : your illness and the fear of financial ruin .
Millions of Americans go bankrupt every year due to medical bills , and tens of thousands die each year because they have no insurance or insufficient insurance .
And do n’t believe for a second that rot about America having the world ’s best medical care or the shortest waiting lists : I ’ve been to hospitals in Australia , New Zealand , Europe , Singapore , and Thailand , and every one was better than the “ good ” hospital I used to go to back home .
The waits were shorter , the facilities more comfortable , and the doctors just as good .
This is ironic , because you need a good health system more than anyone else in the world .
Why ?
Because your lifestyle is almost designed to make you sick .
Let ’s start with your diet :
Much of the beef you eat has been exposed to fecal matter in processing .
Your chicken is contaminated with salmonella .
Your stock animals and poultry are pumped full of growth hormones and antibiotics .
In most other countries , the government would act to protect consumers from this sort of thing ; in the United States , the government is bought off by industry to prevent any effective regulations or inspections .
In a few years , the majority of all the produce for sale in the United States will be from genetically modified crops , thanks to the cozy relationship between Monsanto Corporation and the United States government .
Worse still , due to the vast quantities of high - fructose corn syrup Americans consume , fully one - third of children born in the United States today will be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at some point in their lives .
Of course , it ’s not just the food that ’s killing you , it ’s the drugs .
If you show any sign of life when you ’re young , they ’ll put you on Ritalin .
Then , when you get old enough to take a good look around , you ’ll get depressed , so they ’ll give you Prozac .
If you ’re a man , this will render you chemically impotent , so you ’ll need Viagra to get it up .
Meanwhile , your steady diet of trans - fat - laden food is guaranteed to give you high cholesterol , so you ’ll get a prescription for Lipitor .
Finally , at the end of the day , you ’ll lay awake at night worrying about losing your health plan , so you ’ll need Lunesta to go to sleep .
With a diet guaranteed to make you sick and a health system designed to make sure you stay that way , what you really need is a long vacation somewhere .
Unfortunately , you probably can’t take one .
I ’ll let you in on little secret : if you go to the beaches of Thailand , the mountains of Nepal , or the coral reefs of Australia , you ’ll probably be the only American in sight .
And you ’ll be surrounded crowds of happy Germans , French , Italians , Israelis , Scandinavians and wealthy Asians .
Why ?
Because they ’re paid well enough to afford to visit these places AND they can take vacations long enough to do so .
Even if you could scrape together enough money to go to one of these incredible places , by the time you recovered from your jetlag , it would time to get on a plane and rush back to your job .
If you think I ’m making this up , check the stats on average annual vacation days by country :
Finland : 44
Italy : 42
France : 39
Germany : 35
UK : 25
Japan : 18
USA : 12
The fact is , they work you like dogs in the United States .
This should come as no surprise : the United States never got away from the plantation / sweat shop labor model and any real labor movement was brutally suppressed .
Unless you happen to be a member of the ownership class , your options are pretty much limited to barely surviving on service - sector wages or playing musical chairs for a spot in a cubicle ( a spot that will be outsourced to India next week anyway ) .
The very best you can hope for is to get a professional degree and then milk the system for a slice of the middle - class pie .
And even those who claw their way into the middle class are but one illness or job loss away from poverty .
Your jobs are n’t secure .
Your company has no loyalty to you .
They ’ll play you off against your coworkers for as long as it suits them , then they ’ll get rid of you .
Of course , you do n’t have any choice in the matter : the system is designed this way .
In most countries in the developed world , higher education is either free or heavily subsidized ; in the United States , a university degree can set you back over US $ 100,000 .
Thus , you enter the working world with a crushing debt .
Forget about taking a year off to travel the world and find yourself – you ’ve got to start working or watch your credit rating plummet .
If you ’re “ lucky , ” you might even land a job good enough to qualify you for a home loan .
And then you ’ll spend half your working life just paying the interest on the loan – welcome to the world of American debt slavery .
America has the illusion of great wealth because there ’s a lot of “ stuff ” around , but who really owns it ?
In real terms , the average American is poorer than the poorest ghetto dweller in Manila , because at least they have no debts .
If they want to pack up and leave , they can ; if you want to leave , you can ’t , because you ’ve got debts to pay .
All this begs the question :
Why would anyone put up with this ?
Ask any American and you ’ll get the same answer : because America is the freest country on earth .
If you believe this , I ’ve got some more bad news for you : America is actually among the least free countries on earth .
Your piss is tested , your emails and phone calls are monitored , your medical records are gathered , and you are never more than one stray comment away from writhing on the ground with two Taser prongs in your ass .
And that ’s just physical freedom .
Mentally , you are truly imprisoned .
You do n’t even know the degree to which you are tormented by fears of medical bankruptcy , job loss , homelessness and violent crime because you ’ve never lived in a country where there is no need to worry about such things .
But it goes much deeper than mere surveillance and anxiety .
The fact is , you are not free because your country has been taken over and occupied by another government .
Fully 70 % of your tax dollars go to the Pentagon , and the Pentagon is the real government of the United States .
You are required under pain of death to pay taxes to this occupying government .
If you ’re from the less fortunate classes , you are also required to serve and die in their endless wars , or send your sons and daughters to do so .
You have no choice in the matter : there is a socio-economic draft system in the United States that provides a steady stream of cannon fodder for the military .
If you call a life of surveillance , anxiety and ceaseless toil in the service of a government you did n’t elect “ freedom , ” then you and I have a very different idea of what that word means .
If there was some chance that the country could be changed , there might be reason for hope .
But can you honestly look around and conclude that anything is going to change ?
Where would the change come from ?
The people ?
Take a good look at your compatriots : the working class in the United States has been brutally propagandized by jackals like Rush Limbaugh , Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity .
Members of the working class have been taught to lick the boots of their masters and then bend over for another kick in the ass .
They ’ve got these people so well trained that they ’ll take up arms against the other half of the working class as soon as their masters give the word .
If the people cannot make a change , how about the media ?
Not a chance .
From Fox News to the New York Times , the mass media in the United States is nothing but the public relations wing of the corporatocracy , primarily the military industrial complex .
At least the citizens of the former Soviet Union knew that their news was bullshit .
In America , you grow up thinking you ’ve got a free media , which makes the propaganda doubly effective .
If you do n’t think American media is mere corporate propaganda , ask yourself the following question : have you ever heard a major American news outlet suggest that the country could fund a single - payer health system by cutting military spending ?
If change ca n’t come from the people or the media , the only other potential source of change would be the politicians .
Unfortunately , the American political process is among the most corrupt in the world .
In every country on earth , one expects politicians to take bribes from the rich .
But this generally happens in secret , behind the closed doors of their elite clubs .
In the United States , this sort of political corruption is done in broad daylight , as part of legal , accepted , standard operating procedure .
In the United States , they merely call these bribes campaign donations , political action committees and lobbyists .
One can no more expect the politicians to change this system than one can expect a man to take an axe and chop his own legs out from underneath him .
No , the United States of America is not going to change for the better .
The only change will be for the worse .
And when I say worse , I mean much worse .
As we speak , the economic system that sustained the country during the post - war years is collapsing .
The United States maxed out its “ credit card ” sometime in 2008 and now its lenders , starting with China , are in the process of laying the foundations for a new monetary system to replace the Anglo - American “ petro - dollar ” system .
As soon as there is a viable alternative to the US dollar , the greenback will sink like a stone .
While the United States was running up crushing levels of debt , it was also busy shipping its manufacturing jobs and white - collar jobs overseas , and letting its infrastructure fall to pieces .
Meanwhile , Asian and European countries were investing in education , infrastructure and raw materials .
Even if the United States tried to rebuild a real economy ( as opposed to a service / financial economy ) do think American workers would ever be able to compete with the workers of China or Europe ?
Have you ever seen a Japanese or German factory ?
Have you ever met a Singaporean or Chinese worker ?
There are only two possible futures facing the United States , and neither one is pretty .
The best case is a slow but orderly decline – essentially a continuation of what ’s been happening for the last two decades .
Wages will drop , unemployment will rise , Medicare and Social Security benefits will be slashed , the currency will decline in value , and the disparity of wealth will spiral out of control until the United States starts to resemble Mexico or the Philippines – tiny islands of wealth surrounded by great poverty ( the country is already halfway there ) .
Equally likely is a sudden collapse , perhaps brought about by a rapid flight from the US dollar by creditor nations like China , Japan , Korea and the OPEC nations .
A related possibility would be a default by the United States government on its vast debt .
One look at the financial balance sheet of the US government should convince you how likely this is : governmental spending is skyrocketing and tax receipts are plummeting – something has to give .
If either of these scenarios plays out , the resulting depression will make the present recession look like a walk in the park .
Whether the collapse is gradual or gut - wrenchingly sudden , the results will be chaos , civil strife and fascism .
Let ’s face it : the United States is like the former Yugoslavia – a collection of mutually antagonistic cultures united in name only .
You ’ve got your own version of the Taliban : right - wing Christian fundamentalists who actively loathe the idea of secular Constitutional government .
You ’ve got a vast intellectual underclass that has spent the last few decades soaking up Fox News and talk radio propaganda , eager to blame the collapse on Democrats , gays and immigrants .
You ’ve got a ruthless ownership class that will use all the means at its disposal to protect its wealth from the starving masses .
On top of all that you ’ve got vast factory farms , sprawling suburbs and a truck - based shipping system , all of it entirely dependent on oil that is about to become completely unaffordable .
And you ’ve got guns .
Lots of guns .
In short : the United States is about to become a very unwholesome place to be .
Right now , the government is building fences and walls along its northern and southern borders .
Right now , the government is working on a national ID system ( soon to be fitted with biometric features ) .
Right now , the government is building a surveillance state so extensive that they will be able to follow your every move , online , in the street and across borders .
If you think this is just to protect you from “ terrorists , ” then you ’re sadly mistaken .
Once the shit really hits the fan , do you really think you ’ll just be able to jump into the old station wagon , drive across the Canadian border and spend the rest of your days fishing and drinking Molson ?
No , the government is going to lock the place down .
They do n’t want their tax base escaping .
They do n’t want their “ recruits ” escaping .
They do n’t want YOU escaping .
I am not writing this to scare you .
I write this to you as a friend .
If you are able to read and understand what I ’ve written here , then you are a member of a small minority in the United States .
You are a minority in a country that has no place for you .
So what should you do ?
You should leave the United States of America .
If you ’re young , you ’ve got plenty of choices : you can teach English in the Middle East , Asia or Europe .
Or you can go to university or graduate school abroad and start building skills that will qualify you for a work visa .
If you ’ve already got some real work skills , you can apply to emigrate to any number of countries as a skilled immigrant .
If you are older and you ’ve got some savings , you can retire to a place like Costa Rica or the Philippines .
If you ca n’t qualify for a work , student or retirement visa , do n’t let that stop you – travel on a tourist visa to a country that appeals to you and talk to the expats you meet there .
Whatever you do , go speak to an immigration lawyer as soon as you can .
Find out exactly how to get on a path that will lead to permanent residence and eventually citizenship in the country of your choice .
You will not be alone .
There are millions of Americans just like me living outside the United States .
Living lives much more fulfilling , peaceful , free and abundant than we ever could have attained back home .
Some of us happened upon these lives by accident – we tried a year abroad and found that we liked it – others made a conscious decision to pack up and leave for good .
You ’ll find us in Canada , all over Europe , in many parts of Asia , in Australia and New Zealand , and in most other countries of the globe .
Do we miss our friends and family ?
Yes .
Do we occasionally miss aspects of our former country ?
Yes .
Do we plan on ever living again in the United States ?
Never .
And those of us with permanent residence or citizenship can sponsor family members from back home for long - term visas in our adopted countries .
In closing , I want to remind you of something : unless you are an American Indian or a descendant of slaves , at some point your ancestors chose to leave their homeland in search of a better life .
They were n’t traitors and they were n’t bad people , they just wanted a better life for themselves and their families .
Is n’t it time that you continue their journey ?
Rep. King : Spot Illegal Immigrants by Their ‘ Shoes , ’ ‘ Grooming , ’ ‘ Accent ’ or ‘ a Sixth Sense ’
Created : June 15 , 2010 14:25 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
In defense of Arizona ’s immigration crackdown , Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) said he believes appearance - based profiling can play a valuable role in law enforcement .
“ It ’s not wrong to use race or other indicators for the sake of identifying that people are violating the law , ” King said on the House floor , calling for “ common sense indicators ” to be used in the process .
“ Those common sense indicators , ” he explained , “ are all kinds of things , from what kind of clothes people wear — my suit , in my case — what kind of shoes people wear , what kind of accent they have , um , the , the type of grooming they might have , there are all kinds of indicators there and sometimes it ’s just a sixth sense and they ca n’t put their finger on it . ”
King said he was once a victim of profiling when a cab driver stopped for him without request because he was wearing a suit .
Watch the video from Media Matters :
The remarks came the same day King alleged that President Obama has a “ default mechanism in him ” that “ favors the black person . ”
The killing of 14 civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 was “ unjustified ” , Lord Saville 's inquiry into the incident has concluded .
The inquiry 's 5,000 page report was heavily critical of the behaviour of the British army in Derry on the day and found that all those killed were innocent .
The report states some of those who were killed or injured were clearly fleeing from the British paratroopers or going to the assistance of others who were dying .
The release of the report was greeted by loud cheers and applause by family members and their supporters gathering outside the Guildhall in Derry .
The inquiry concluded that several of the troops who provided testimony about the events lied to the inquiry and was particularly critical of one paratrooper regiment , which was deemed to have fired the 100 or so shots on the day .
Delivering the findings of the report , British prime minister David Cameron said it had found none of the casualties posed any threat to British troops .
He told the House of Commons no warnings were given , and that some of the soldiers lost control .
“ The Government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces , " he said .
" And for that , on behalf of the Government , indeed on behalf of our country , I am deeply sorry . ”
The report , completed over 12 years , investigated the mass killing of members of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association by members of the Parachute Regiment during a during a march in Derry on January 30th , 1972 .
The men killed on the day were Patrick Doherty ( 32 ) , Hugh Gilmour ( 17 ) , Jackie Duddy ( 17 ) , John Young ( 17 ) , Kevin McElhinney ( 17 ) , Michael Kelly ( 17 ) , Gerald Donaghey ( 17 ) , William Nash ( 19 ) , Michael McDaid ( 20 ) , Jim Wray ( 22 ) , William McKinney ( 27 ) and Bernard " Barney " McGuigan ( 41 ) .
John Johnston ( 59 ) , one of the first to be shot on the day , died from his injuries four months later .
Lord Saville 's report said the soldiers of the support company who went into the Bogside , where the march was taking place , did so “ as a result of an order which should not have been given ” by their commander .
None of the casualties was carrying a firearm and while there was some shooting by IRA gunmen , “ none of this firing provided any justification for the shooting of civilian casualties ” , it found .
It concluded that “ on balance ” the first shot in the vicinity of the march was fired by British soldiers and no warning was given to civilians .
The support company “ reacted by losing their self - control ... forgetting or ignoring their instructions and training ” and the result was a “ serious and widespread loss of fire discipline ” .
The key finding were :
- “ The firing by soldiers of 1 Para caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number , none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury . ”
This also applied to the 14th victim , who died later from injuries ;
- “ Despite the contrary evidence given by soldiers , we have concluded that none of them fired in response to attacks or threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers . ”
The report added that no one threw , or threatened to throw , nail or petrol bombs at soldiers ;
- The accounts of soldiers were rejected , with a number said to have “ knowingly put forward false accounts ” ;
- Members of the official IRA fired a number of shots , though it was concluded it was the paratroopers who shot first on Bloody Sunday ;
Lord Saville , who also investigated the activities of Provisional and Official IRA members on the day , concluded that Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was probably armed with a Thompson sub - machine gun during the march , but that , although he may have fired the weapon , it was not possible to say so for certain .
“ He did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire . ”
Later this afternoon the public is being asked to assemble at the Bloody Sunday memorial on Rossville Street in the Bogside and then to proceed to the Guildhall , symbolically breaking through Barrier 14 at William Street where the original anti-internment march was stopped and the shooting began .
An earlier inquiry into the events of the day by Lord Widgery was declared a whitewash and in 1998 British prime minister Tony Blair called for a fresh inquiry .
In the Widgery Report , Lord Widgery concluded “ that there was no reason to suppose the soldiers would have opened fire if they had not been fired upon first ” .
It said that while some soldiers showed a high degree of restraint in opening fire , the firing of others bordered on the reckless .
Lord Widgery said there would have been no deaths if those who had organised the illegal march had not , as this created a “ highly dangerous situation in which a clash between demonstrators and the security forces was almost inevitable ” .
The Saville inquiry is the longest in UK judicial history and had cost £ 190.3 million up to February this year .
It sat at the Guildhall , Derry , and Central Hall at Westminster in London , to accommodate military witnesses .
About 2,500 people gave testimony , with 922 of these called to give oral evidence , including 505 civilians , nine experts and forensic scientists , 49 journalists , 245 military , 35 paramilitaries or former paramilitaries , 39 politicians and civil servants , seven priests and 33 Royal Ulster Constabulary officers .
Evidence ran to 160 volumes of data with an estimated 30 million words , 13 volumes of photographs , 121 audio tapes and 10 video tapes .
News organisations from the US , Italy , France , Russia , Nigeria , Australia and from the Middle East have gathered in Derry to hear details of the incident , as well as journalists from Ireland and Britain .
Mary Crowley would rather be at sea .
But she 's not .
Instead , she is in a small conference room at a roadside Marriott in this landlocked town north of Sacramento .
Around her are mainly men , many with beards , and many with baseball caps pulled down low and arms crossed tight .
They are listening .
Many of them would also rather be at sea .
Can these wishes be joined ?
We shall see in the next month or so .
Ms. Crowley has long hair , a ruddy outdoor complexion , and a sincere manner .
She wants to sail west in the next month or two , out to what is called the North Pacific Trash Gyre .
Her goal is to start cleaning up the plastic trash that has leaped into social consciousness over the past couple of years .
And she is urging some of the independent fishermen meeting here for the annual gathering of the Western Fishboat Owners Association to join her , using their boats to haul back garbage .
Whether they do or not , and it seems possible some will , Crowley leaves little doubt she will set sail this spring , regardless .
That determination is bringing her cleanup effort , called Project Kaisei , attention and resources to combat what strikes many as an overwhelming problem .
" It 's audacious because the scale is so intimidating , " says Matt Tinning , a spokesman for the Ocean Conservancy in Washington , D.C. , a nonprofit group that mounts an annual global volunteer effort to clean the world 's beaches .
" Project Kaisei has captured the public spotlight by shining a light on the problem . "
The exact dimensions of the North Pacific Trash Gyre are n't known .
Some say it 's the largest concentration of plastic debris in the world , a huge plastic garbage patch estimated to be either the size of Texas or twice that size .
Either way , there is general agreement that there is lots of plastic out there .
But it is not a solid or even semisolid mass , as might be suggested by some descriptions .
Nor is there any real data on the exact volume .
" Due to the limited sample size , as well as a tendency for observing ships to explore only areas thought to concentrate debris , there is really no accurate estimate on the size or mass of the ' garbage patch ' or any other concentrations of marine debris in the open ocean , " according to NOAA , the US government 's National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration .
But Crowley has all the proof she needs .
Last summer , her Project Kaisei launched a month - long expedition to the North Pacific Gyre .
Its tall , majestic sailing ship , the Kaisei , was accompanied by the New Horizon , a vessel from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego .
Given the vastness of the ocean , some of the graduate students heading the voyage for Scripps were prepared to find less debris than forecast .
But after the voyage the Scripps team reported : " The plastic indeed was there in the gyre .
And there was lots and lots of it . "
The Kaisei covered 3,000 nautical miles from Aug. 4 to 31 .
It conducted several surface trawls every day and night .
Every trawl came up with plastics of various sizes , shapes , and colors .
The discovery disturbed Crowley , who had been in the area 30 years earlier as a sailor .
A native of Illinois , she spent her formative years sailing on Lake Michigan .
" I grew up with a vision of doing long - distance sailing , " she says , recalling efforts as a youngster to convince her parents to " give up everything and just sail . "
After college Crowley became involved in the boat delivery business and eventually boat chartering , which is still what she does from her offices in Sausalito , Calif .
She is also an educator , one of the founders in 1979 of the Ocean Voyages Institute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to teaching the maritime arts and sciences .
Three decades ago , Crowley and Peter Sutter , a renowned San Francisco yachtsman and sailmaker , took the 33 - foot sailboat Spirit into the North Pacific , not toward some distant shore but out to the equivalent of ocean wilderness .
Their destination was the North Pacific Gyre .
Over four or five days in the becalmed mid-ocean , Crowley says , they saw only a handful of pieces of plastic and one small abandoned fishing net .
Fast - forward to 2009 , and Crowley 's alarm at the concentration of trash she found last summer is understandable .
Yet as she sits in her Sausalito office with the San Francisco Bay visible over her shoulder , Crowley does not come across as an alarmist .
" The big challenge for us is to get the word out that we do have the technology to figure out how to solve " this problem , she says .
She is raising money and enlisting support for a two - month expedition this summer , costing about $ 1.7 million .
She envisions a small flotilla comprising a couple of fishing boats , a tug or marine supply ship , a barge , and the Kaisei .
John Varel , founder and CEO of FusionStorm , which provides back - end technology for businesses , has kicked in $ 100,000 .
Mr. Varel has started the FusionStorm Foundation to address ocean pollution .
He was impressed with Crowley 's solution - oriented attitude .
" I was looking for someone who wanted to take this from the activist stage to the execution stage , " he says .
Crowley wants to recycle the plastic , not just relocate the trash onshore .
She knows there are no quick fixes here and that any cleanup needs to be combined with tougher maritime laws , as well as tougher recycling laws on the mainland to curtail the flow of garbage .
Some 60 to 80 percent of the plastic in oceans is not released by ships but originates onshore before being swept out to sea via coastal waterways .
Enormous questions remain about the best ways to collect ocean plastics without harming sea life .
Large fine - mesh nets might do the job , but would also scoop up marine creatures .
But Crowley does n't seem overwhelmed .
" We want to make this everyone 's problem , and everyone 's solution , " she tells the fishermen meeting in Rocklin .

Searching for Interest in the Daily Commute
» As gondolas catch on in South America , should other cities search for ways to make transit trips more interesting ?
When I lived in New York , I took the subway from Atlantic Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn to my office at Union Square everyday .
It ’s easy to get between the two — there are several different lines that make the trip in about fifteen minutes — but I would inevitably choose to walk out of my way to take the N Broadway train rather than the closer 4 and 5 Lexington Avenue lines .
There ’s a simple explanation : whereas the N soars high above the East River along the Manhattan Bridge as it leaves Brooklyn , the Lexington Avenue lines run underwater .
The three minutes it takes to cross that bridge brought to my mornings the light of the sun and magnificent views of New York ’s skyscrapers , parks , and riverfront .
I ’m not sure how much the other people riding with me cared , but it certainly woke me up .
The experience of riders on the subways that run across the Manhattan Bridge — the B , D , N , and Q trains do so — is a rarity .
Few typical commutes on transit include aerial views of the city or the natural environment .
Most transportation rights - of - way in central cities are either hidden below ground or surrounded by ugliness .
Most daily transit commutes , if they are n’t downright sad , certainly are n’t particularly inspiring .
Should that change ?
Steven Dale , who publishes the Gondola Project , a year - long exploration of cable - propelled transit , toured South America earlier this year to gain insight into efforts to connect often out - of - the - way neighborhoods with broader transportation networks .
In Medellin , Columbia , the local transit system wanted to connect isolated barrios on mountaintops to the metro lines below , so it built a two kilometer initial line that hovers above the city and now carries 40,000 riders a day .
What began as a bit of an experiment has expanded into an eight kilometer network at a much cheaper price than would cost an equivalent rail system .
Caracas , Venezuela , among other cities , has begun developing similar technologies .
Dale has proposed a series of gondolas for his home city , Toronto .
Gondolas — like the télécabines found at ski resorts — and aerial tramways — such as New York ’s Roosevelt Island tram or the Portland Aerial Tram featured in the image above — are different technologies , but they offer the same advantages of carrying commuters above instead of through the city .
What Dale describes as a “ Disruptive Technology ” — a “ simple , convenient - to - use innovations that initially are used by only unsophisticated customers at the low end of markets , ” a result of difficult geography and limited local funds — is to me a prime example of cities thinking differently about how to make the daily lives of their inhabitants more interesting .
Would n’t you like to be able to glide above the city on the way to work ?
There are of course major limitations to aerial vehicles like the gondolas Dale has highlighted ; their maximum running speeds are relatively slow and they lack the ability to handle anywhere near the capacity of traditional train systems .
But those issues are besides the point : the issue here is that these South American cities are improving public transit in a way that brings an element of joy to the daily lives of their users .
How frequently can you say that about most bus lines ?
Earlier this year , Jarrett Walker pointed to what he refers to as transit ’s “ Zoom - Whoosh Problem . ”
Noting San Francisco ’s BART regional rail system , he suggests that transit benefits when it feels fast , modern , powerful — qualities it too often lacks .
But that sensation is ephemeral — once you know the BART sensation , it loses some of its excitement :
It becomes mundane .
Washington ’s Metro , designed in a similar era , is an underground architectural monument — a fantastic play on the use of concrete and light — but after a while , it begins to feel a bit gray and boring .
Indeed , that ’s the problem with any form of transportation that generates interest as a result of its newness ; at some point , that feeling wears off .
The efficiency of urban subways , after all , does have its downsides .
That ’s why the perspectives offered by South America ’s aerial gondolas are so marvelous .
They suggests that modern public transportation can be made interesting not so much because of its technological advancement , but rather because of the views it offers onto the beauty of the human and natural environments that surround our cities .
The mountains or river in the distance will never grow tiring ; nor will looking at the people staring out from their balconies or the stores hawking their wares .
It ’s true , of course , that it makes little sense to build a gondola in many cities — many places lack major elevation changes or large natural obstacles that preference an investment in a mode of transportation that simply goes over everything that ’s around it .
The two North American examples I cited above — in Portland and New York — are both responses to geographical difficulties .
But you do n’t need to build aerial trams to give people a more interesting , joyous experience when they ’re making their daily commutes to and from work — you do n’t even have to have that great of a view .
To coincide with the complete renovation of Philadelphia ’s Market Street Elevated , artist Stephen Powers created dozens of beautiful murals on the sides of decrepit surrounding buildings in a series entitled A Love Letter for You visible primarily by train riders .
We should see more of the same .
One of the great advantages of riding transit is that you actually have the chance to take in what ’s outside the window ; you do n’t have to pay attention to the “ road . ”
We just need to give people something to look at .
Update , 15 June : Steven Dale responds on The Gondola Project to this post , arguing that gondolas “ can exploit rather than just deal with natural obstacles ” — they are n’t as limited as I suggest above .
I think this makes sense :
It is true that you can install an aerial transportation system much more easily than a ground - based one , and this means that barriers to transportation for other modes suddenly become opportunities .
Dale also suggests that I underestimate the ridership potential of cable - propelled transit ; I admit that it ’s unfair to compare capacity of a gondola with a metro , since they do n’t address the same markets .

Without aggressive action to reduce soot emissions , the time table for carbon dioxide emission reductions may need to be significantly accelerated in order to achieve international climate policy goals such as those set forth in last December 's Copenhagen Accord , according to a study published online June 21 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The Princeton University researchers assessed the climatic contribution of " carbonaceous aerosols , " fine particulates emitted into the atmosphere and commonly known as soot .
Soot is produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter and comes from a variety of sources , ranging from diesel engines and coal combustion to biomass cook stoves , crop burning and wildfires .
Soot has complex effects on the global climate when airborne or deposited on snow .
It has two main components : black carbon and organic carbon .
Black carbon is dark and absorbs radiation , thus warming the atmosphere ; organic carbon is light colored and reflective , so tends to have a cooling effect .
Their effects on climate are complicated , in part because they depend on how they are mixed with other particles in the atmosphere , and in part because both types of aerosols can cool the climate through their effects on cloud formation .
Black carbon also warms the Earth 's surface when it is falls out of the atmosphere and lands on snow or ice , darkening it .
" Because of uncertainties in these many effects , and because of differences in whether and how these effects get incorporated into various models , past studies of soot 's contribution to global warming have ranged widely , " said Robert Kopp , a post - doctoral researcher jointly in Princeton 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public & International Affairs and its Department of Geosciences .
" We took several key studies , put them all on a common footing , and assessed what emerged . "
Using four sets of highly cited but disparate studies that span the range of past estimates , Kopp and Denise Mauzerall , associate professor of environmental engineering and international affairs , attempted to reconcile and standardize the results into one , common global metric .
Their best estimate indicates that eliminating soot pollution from " contained combustion " sources such as diesel engines and poorly - controlled coal sources would provide the world with an additional eight years ( with an uncertainty range of about one to 15 years ) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
Conversely , if these sources of carbonaceous aerosols continued at levels seen in the 1990s , more aggressive reductions in carbon dioxide emissions than previously recognized would need to occur for the world to meet the goal of avoiding " dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . "
" Unfortunately , most climate change mitigation scenarios used in policy contexts have focused exclusively on heat - trapping gases , " Mauzerall said .
" This means those eight years are n't actually eight years we can gain by cutting soot emissions ; rather , our results suggest that we need to accelerate carbon dioxide emissions by about eight years relative to these scenarios if we do n't also act to reduce soot emissions . "

Not all soot emissions have the same effect on climate .
Effects can vary depending on both where the emissions take place and what sources they come from .
Black carbon that can travel to the Arctic and heat Arctic ice during the spring and summer months , for instance , has a stronger warming effect than soot confined to lower latitudes .
Further , different soot sources have different ratios of light - absorbing black carbon to light - reflecting particles like organic carbon and sulfate ; sources that emit a greater amount of black carbon generally have a greater warming effect .
Reducing emissions from low - sulfur diesel engines and industrial coal therefore has clearer benefits for the global climate than reducing emissions from sources such as biomass cookstoves and crop burning .
" But effects on global climate are n't the only reason to reduce soot emissions , " Mauzerall cautioned .
" The public health case for reducing emissions of fine particles , including soot , is unequivocal , and aerosol pollution can have significant regional climate effects .
For instance , soot pollution from India and China that is transported to the Himalayan glaciers can enhance glacier melting and hence influence water supplies in India , China and Bangladesh -- potentially contributing to increased flooding in some regions in the short - term and reduced water availability in the longer term . "
Whereas carbon dioxide emissions tend to increase with income , some of the largest soot sources are in middle - income countries .
In 1996 , for example , China and India are believed to have accounted for about 40 percent of global black carbon emissions .
" Because some of the largest sources are in middle - income countries , and because the co-benefits of soot emission reductions can be felt quickly locally , black carbon reductions could serve as a catalyst for engaging these countries in climate change mitigation efforts , " Mauzerall suggested .
The wide range in the study 's estimate of the soot contribution to warming emphasizes the need for further research .
" There 's a great deal of uncertainty remaining , both in the inventories of aerosols emissions and in the physical processes -- particularly those involving cloud formation -- by which aerosols affect climate , " said Kopp , who is currently a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow in Washington , D.C .
The study just published in PNAS grew out of a fall 2008 Woodrow Wilson School graduate policy workshop that was led by Mauzerall and for which Kopp provided technical expertise .

All video codecs are covered by patents .
A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other “ open source ” codecs now .
Unfortunately , just because something is open source , it does n’t mean or guarantee that it does n’t infringe on others patents .
An open standard is different from being royalty free or open source .
Other codecs often come up in these discussions .
The distinction between the availability of source code and the ownership of the intellectual property in that available source code is critical .
Today , intellectual property rights for H.264 are broadly available through a well - defined program managed by MPEG LA .
The rights to other codecs are often less clear , as has been described in the press .
Of course , developers can rely on the H.264 codec and hardware acceleration support of the underlying operating system , like Windows 7 , without paying any additional royalty .
A great experiment is about to get under way , and it will tell us much about the future of journalism and the willingness of readers to pay for it .
In Wapping last night , News International showed off the new websites for The Times and Sunday Times which have opened to the public this morning .
Four weeks from now , a paywall will go up in front of the sites and , by News international 's own calculation , more than 90 % of their audience will melt away .
Both new sites look engaging and attractive .
They are very different - after years of operating online under the same banner , each newspaper now wants to reassert its identity .
The Times has a clean , simple look , much like the paper itself , with the accent on news , complemented by interactive graphics and video .
The Sunday Times looks far more like a magazine , emphasising the kind of material that has a shelf life beyond the day of publication .
Among the special online offerings are a weekly satirical look at the news by the video artist Alison Jackson , and a culture planner , which you can use to book theatre or cinema tickets direct from the site , or even to set your Sky Plus recorder .
' If you want a quick hit of in - depth news you go to the Times , " a Sunday Times executive explained , " if on a Monday , Tuesday or Wednesday you want to tour a little , you come and snack on what the Sunday Times has to offer . "
If , that is , you are willing to pay £ 1 for a day or £ 2 for a week 's access .
This is more than just an experiment in whether people will pay for news , it 's a strike against the prevailing philosophy of online journalism , which says that the most important thing is to make your material shareable to the widest possible audience .
Look at the bottom of most online news articles these days and you will see a share button encouraging you to pass on what you 've just read to friends , via e-mail or a social network .
Go to a site like Twitter and you will see an orgy of self - promotion from journalists tweeting links to their latest stories or blog posts .
Over the weekend , the social network was alive with discussion of a piece about Lady Gaga by the Times ' extremely entertaining feature writer Caitlin Moran .
During the election , the Times ' chief leader writer and political columnist Daniel Finkelstein reached a far wider audience via social networks and Google searches than actually paid to read him in the paper .
Now all that will stop .
Google searches will no longer turn up Times stories , and links posted on social networks will only take you to the papers ' sign - in page .
News International has opted for the most extreme form of paywall - others let search engines crawl their sites , or offer non-paying visitors a few free articles to entice them in .
The paper says there will be advantages to readers in thinning out the crowds .
Online chats with the football or cricket writers , for instance , will be more intimate , and as comments will now be by named readers , there will be an end to the tedious anonymous ranting that plagues many news sites .
I asked Danny Finkelstein whether it bothered him that from now on none of his journalism would " go viral " , with the risk that he'd be left invisible on the sidelines as the online debate raged through news sites without paywalls .
" No , " he insisted , " I want my employer to be paid for my intellectual property . "
Executives from The Times and Sunday Times weighed in with the perfectly sound argument that it was unsustainable for the two papers to go on doing what they are doing now - quality journalism is an expensive business and they made a loss of £ 87 m last year .
It will take a lot of subscriptions to fill that hole , but the company is convinced that advertisers will find the smaller audience of committed readers more attractive than the 21 million promiscuous passers - by who flit through the free Times Online site each month at present .
While there 's been plenty of sniping from the sidelines by News International 's rivals , I suspect they are all glad that someone is at least testing the waters .
If the two papers do attract enough paying customers to start eating into the company 's losses , that will give heart to the whole newspaper industry .
But for Times journalists who are getting used to the idea that they can build their own brands by sharing their wares far and wide online , these are going to be a difficult , and perhaps lonely , few months .

The Pope 's reaction to the raids was more measured
Last week 's police raid in Belgium which broke up a meeting of the country 's Catholic bishops - who were discussing how to deal with the paedophile priest crisis - took the Vatican by complete surprise .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican Secretary of State - Pope Benedict 's number two - was furious when he learned about how the police prevented the bishops from leaving the building where they had been meeting for nine hours , and took away their mobile telephones to prevent them communicating with their staff or with the Vatican .
The police seized files not only from the headquarters of the Catholic Church in Brussels but also took away the laptop belonging to the former head of the Church in Belgium , Cardinal Godfried Danneels .
They also allegedly profaned the tomb of at least one former Belgian cardinal at the cathedral in Mechelen during what seems to have been a frenetic search for possible incriminating documents .
Cardinal Bertone angrily told reporters during a conference he was attending at a Catholic University in Rome that not even communist states dared to treat Church authorities and Church property in this way .
He summoned the Belgian ambassador to the Vatican and handed him a formal protest note .
Change of tone
Pope Benedict 's own reaction in a letter to the head of the Belgian Church was more measured .

An inquiry into church sex abuse in Belgium has been running for years
While deploring the way in which the Belgian police had conducted their search for evidence of possible crimes of sex abuse committed by Belgian clergy , he said he was happy to let justice take its course provided the rights of all parties , victims of alleged abuse and accused priests , were respected .
This marked a definite change of tone in Vatican reaction to the clerical sexual abuse crisis which has hit the Catholic Church in Europe and the Americas in recent years and particularly in recent months .
Some high - ranking Vatican officials have habitually dismissed media coverage of predator priests as " idle gossip " .
Belgium , like many other countries in Europe , has a strong Catholic history but is also subject to strong secular influences .
Although the Vatican claims 75 % membership of the Catholic Church , regular Sunday Mass attendances have dwindled dramatically in recent years to about 5 % .
Last year , the Belgian parliament made a formal diplomatic protest to the Vatican over the Pope 's remarks about the use of condoms to combat Aids .
The Pope was on his way to Africa , the continent most seriously affected by Aids , and his remarks aroused a storm of protests - including one by the prestigious British medical journal , the Lancet .
The Vatican rejected the Belgian protest as an " attempt to silence the Pope 's moral teaching " .
' Recognised religions '
Official relations between the Vatican and Belgium are clouded with a certain ambiguity .
No concordat , or treaty , governs relations with the Holy See .
Belgium was part of France between 1795 and 1815 , and the Napoleonic Concordat between France and the Vatican signed at the beginning of the 19th Century lapsed after Belgium became an independent state and separated from the Netherlands .
But the practical effects of the Napoleonic Concordat were profound .
Its recognition of the Catholic religion paved the way later for full state subsidies for other " recognised religions " .
The Belgian state pays salaries for teachers of religion in state schools and stipends and pensions for Catholic clergy and the renovation of Church buildings .
Last week , Pope Benedict appointed a new Bishop of Bruges to replace Roger Vangheluwe - the longest serving bishop in the country who resigned in April after admitting that he had been sexually abusing a boy for years .

In the past two years , as regular readers in this space would know , thanks to my gracious hosts in the U.S. government , I have had what could be called extensive hands - on experience of the American correctional system .
I have been tutoring and teaching fellow prisoners in English , and in U.S. history .
And some of them have taught me how to read music , play the piano , keep fit , diet sensibly and assimilate some local folkways , while I have been fighting my way through the courts toward a just disposition of the few remaining ( unfounded ) charges that bedevil me .
The fact that all my life any definition of Canada 's virtue and distinctiveness has prominently included references to civility and decency explains my alarm and outrage at finally reading the three - year - old report on the Correctional Service of Canada , misleadingly titled " A Roadmap to Strengthening Public Safety . "
As so often in other fields , this document seeks to import to Canada much of the worst of American practice , and none of the best , unless Canada now idealizes gratuitous official severity .
I have not succumbed to an inverse Stockholm Syndrome , and become an apologist for the convicted community .
But I disbelieve even more fervently than I did before my sojourn among them , in the Manichaean process of baiting , dehumanization and stigmatization promoted by the Roadmap , and similarly inspired correctional nostrums .
In my present abode , I have met many rather dodgy people , but none whose ethics I consider inferior to some prosecutors and judges I have encountered in the last few years .
And I have met many fine , as well as some mediocre and poor correctional officers , but few who rise above the level of benign non-skilled labour , profoundly under qualified to practise untrammeled social engineering on those entrusted to them .
I believe , civilly and theologically , in the confession and repentance of wrongdoing ; in the prosecution and punishment of crime , and in a maximum reasonable effort by the state to protect the public , especially from threats to person and property .
But I also believe that everyone has rights , including the unborn , demented , incurably ill , military adversaries and the criminal , and that the rights of those whose entitlements are for any reason circumscribed , are not inferior for being narrower , and should be as great as they practically can be , without violating the rights of others .
This Roadmap -- which was released in 2007 , and which the Harper government began officially responding to in its budget in 2008 , setting out a five - year plan -- turns the humane traditions of Canada upside down .
It implicitly assumes that all who are convicted are guilty and have no remaining claim to decency from the state , and that treating confinees accordingly is in the interest of the legally unexceptionable majority .
The Roadmap does not mention prisoners ' rights , beyond basic food , shelter , clothing and medical care , and assumes that they are probably not recoverable for society and that the longer they are imprisoned , the better it is for society .
Almost no distinction is made between violent and non-violent offenders .
Of course , great caution must be shown in the reintegration into society of violent criminals .
But the objective of the penal system must be to return those capable of functioning licitly in society as quickly as practical , allowing also for straight punitive or retributive penalties , but not for mindless vengeance .
The whole system must be guided by the fact that the treatment of the accused and confined has been recognized by ethicists and cultural historians for centuries as one of the hallmarks of civilized society .
The Roadmap holds that anything beyond the necessities for physical survival must be " earned . "
Traditionally , the punishment is supposed to be the imprisonment itself , not the additional oppressions of that regime , and the proverbial debt to society is paid when the sentence has been served ; it does not continue as a permanent Sisyphean burden .
In the interests of eliminating illegal drugs in prison , the authors of the Roadmap want all visits to be glass - segregated , no physical contact .
This is just a pretext to assist in the destruction of families and friendships .
The importation of contraband by prisoners ' visitors can be stopped by strip - searching the prisoners before they leave the visitors centre , as happens to us here , unless the prison staff , who have the unfathomable delight of inspecting us au naturel , are on the take , which is , of course , the problem , as correctional officers in many prisons are frequently caught smuggling , and are n't well enough trained to command higher salaries to make them more resistant to temptation .
It is a problem , but it will not be solved by targeting unoffending relatives of inmates .
The Roadmap also has naively exaggerated confidence in certain types of scanning devices .
It also recommends unspecified concentration on generating employment skills , which is sensible , except that it is specifically foreseen that they will shoulder aside other programs of more general education , substance abuse avoidance and behavioural adaptation .
I am no hemophiliac bleeding heart , but non-violent people can sometimes be helped to abandon illicit practices by some of these programs .
No useful purposes will be served by cranking back into the world unreconstructed sociopaths who can fix an air conditioner or unclog a drain .
The Roadmap even asks for research to be undertaken that will support this recommendation , an inversion of the usual sequence in the determination of policy .
There is a demand for investment of over $ 1 - billion in new and larger prisons , ( an insane extravagance ) , and for sharply longer sentences , mandatory minimum sentences , and " earned parole " in place of supervised release after two - thirds of the sentence , in the absence of misconduct that would militate against such comparative liberality .
In practice , this means imprisonment at the pleasure of the carceral establishment for the maximum time possible .
( Prisoners cost $ 40,000 per year to keep . )
All of these draconian measures have been tried and have failed in the United States .
As Michael Jackson and Graham Stewart point out in their excellent essay in the current Literary Review of Canada , " Fear - Driven Policy , " this plan would fall especially heavily on native people , who already comprise nearly seven times the percentage of imprisoned Canadians than they do of the whole population .
“ Turkey is trying to become a major player in the region , which means it has to rebalance its relationship with the U.S. , ” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli , director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States .
“ In the case of Iran , Turkey does not want a U.S. or Israeli strike .
It does not want sanctions .
Turkey knows that sanctions did not work against Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq during the 1990s . ”
Turkey had another reason in trying to pull off this diplomatic gamble .
It is now one of the rotating members of the U.N. Security Council , along with Brazil .
It does not have a veto .
But it will have to accept the new sanctions , oppose them or simply abstain next month when the sanctions are put to a vote .
“ Turkey does not want to be pushed into taking sides , ” Mr. Unluhisarcikli said .
“ It could abstain , saying it tried to find a diplomatic solution . ”
That is one of the reasons President Barack Obama spent more than an hour last week talking by telephone to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan about Ankara ’s diplomatic initiative .
Turkey is a NATO member and an E.U. candidate , and Washington cannot afford to dismiss Ankara ’s foreign policy ambitions .
Mr. Erdogan and his new foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , are spearheading this policy .
If they succeed , it will mean prestige and respect for a mostly Muslim , Western - oriented country that is determined to bring stability to a volatile region on Turkey ’s borders .
So far , the policy has had mixed results .
Take Armenia , with whom Turkey cut all diplomatic relations in 1993 and closed the border .
Two years ago , as part of Ankara ’s zero - problems strategy , Turkish and Armenian diplomats held secret talks culminating in direct negotiations between their presidents .
In August , the countries agreed to normalize relations in what was hailed as a major breakthrough for promoting stability in the Caucasus .
The baseball nerd who used his genius for statistics to make startlingly accurate predictions in the 2008 US presidential race has weighed into the British election – and his conclusions make chilling reading for Labour .
Nate Silver , who correctly predicted the result between Barack Obama and John McCain in 49 out of America 's 50 states , argues that the most popular method for translating opinion poll results into numbers of seats in parliament greatly overstates how well Labour will perform , giving the false impression that the party " has a fairly large buffer zone before facing total Armageddon " .
The concept of uniform swing assumes that the projected national swing to or away from any given party will be manifested in identical vote swings in every constituency .
If an opinion poll suggests that the Conservatives are up six points on 2005 , for example , the assumption is that they will do six points better in each constituency .
The method has long been criticised as flawed , especially in elections with strong third parties .
But on his blog FiveThirty Eight.com , Silver goes one step further , presenting his own alternative methodology that suggests a disastrous May 6 performance for Labour .
Silver 's method breaks up the monolithic uniform swing and instead assigns specific percentages of the parties ' votes in 2005 to other parties in 2010 .
Using a recent polling average of the three main parties – with the Conservatives on 34 % , the Lib Dems on 29.1 % , and Labour on 26.9 % – the differences between the two methods become stark .
Using uniform swing , those percentages translate into 253 Labour MPs , 271 Conservatives , and 93 Lib Dems .
Using Silver 's method , Labour ends up with just 214 , with the Conservatives surging to 304 , and the Lib Dems on 101 .
Another scenario considers what would happen if 10 % of those who voted Labour in 2005 switched to the Conservatives and 15 % to the Lib Dems , while 10 % of 2005 Tory voters also switched to the Lib Dems .
Under uniform swing , Labour would have 254 seats , nearly neck - and - neck with the Tories on 256 .
Silver 's method gives the Conservatives 276 to Labour 's 218 .
Last year ,
Time magazine named Silver one of the world 's 100 most influential people for the accuracy and impact of his presidential predictions .
The Labour party may will be hoping that he has lost his touch .

Just days after its wildly successful Pac - Man logo , Google has changed its banner once again .
Today , the company turns to budding artist Makenzie Melton , the 9 - year - old winner of this year 's Doodle 4 Google contest .
The annual competition collects thousands of student submissions and millions of votes from Google users .
Poll results crowned Makenzie , a third grader from El Dorado Springs , Mo. Along with the honor of ruling Google 's homepage for a day , Makenzie will receive a $ 15,000 college scholarship , a new computer , and $ 25,000 for her school to build a new computer lab .
Makenzie says that her Doodle 4 Google drawing , called " Rainforest Habitat , ” aims to raise awareness that " the rainforest is in danger and it is not fair to the plants and animals .
I love everything except spiders and snakes , but I would still save them . ”
While the contest is open to students in kindergarten through grade 12 , elementary schoolers have dominated the competition .
Both of the previous Doodle 4 Google winners were in sixth grade .
Today 's special logo shows again that Google is committed to increasingly frequent novelty banners .
Before Pac - Man ( which you can still play for free , by the way ) , there was the Tchaikovsky dancers , the Thumbelina flipbook , the Topeka April Fools ' joke , and several others – all within a month of each other .
If Google asked you to draw your own doodle , what would you include ?
A holiday theme ?
A tribute to your favorite artist ?
Or maybe something crazy ?

By 2030 , Perennial Grains Could Revolutionize Agriculture , Save Humanity
Could be the most important advance in agriculture since the invention of farming
James Madison ( drafter of the US first amendment ) once wrote that " government , without popular information or the means of acquiring it , is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy ; or perhaps both " .
This is certainly true of Afghanistan , where the US - led coalition has been able to avoid a true audit of the impact of its presence via tight control of the media combined with manipulated patriotism .
To avoid greater tragedy in Afghanistan we may have to rely on a new generation of whistleblowers who are making huge personal sacrifices to challenge the official narrative .
Julian Assange , founder of WikiLeaks , is well aware of the impact made by the film Collateral Murder , which featured US Apache gun camera footage of the killing of 12 Iraqi civilians .
Since the arrest of one of his whistleblowers , Assange has been keeping a low profile but is preparing to release the footage of a US airstrike in Afghanistan that may have killed up to 145 civilians .
Like Daniel Ellsberg before him , Assange may be the whistleblower that could help change the direction of the conflict .
Such individuals represent a necessary last resort to check the powers of government .
Ellsberg was once described as " the most dangerous man in America " , yet his actions in publishing the Pentagon Papers were driven by his realisation that the greater danger was the fact that there were no longer effective checks and balances to a war in Vietnam that was entirely detached from reality .
In his book , Secrets , Ellsberg describes how once , travelling back from Vietnam , defence secretary Robert McNamara assessed his visit by saying that " things are n't any better at all .
That means the underlying situation is really worse " .
However , 10 minutes later in front of a press conference , he announced : " I 'm glad to be able to tell you that we 're showing great progress in every dimension of our effort . "
Ellsberg 's decision to become a whistleblower was based on his answer to the question he asked himself : " How could we possibly have justified doing this ? "
It is likely that the departure of Britain 's special envoy to Afghanistan , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , was prompted by a similar dilemma .
Yet Cowper - Coles may embrace the very British syndrome of officials maintaining a dignified silence until years later when an autobiography is released one day describing how they knew it was a complete mess all along .
Foreign Office lawyer Elizabeth Wilmshurst followed a similar pattern , resigning quietly after deciding that war would be illegal , before emerging much more forthrightly to speak at the Chilcot inquiry seven years later .
Meanwhile US General Stanley McCrystal 's honest description of the serious disunity at the head of Afghanistan operations may cost him his job , but beyond being a blow to the image of Barack Obama 's conduct of the war is unlikely to change its central tenets , as the focus will remain on the general 's naivety rather than the substance of his argument .
Speaking truth to power is too important to be left to such outdated methods .
We are all complicit in the actions of our democratically mandated government and as Ghandi once observed , " coercive power , legitimate or otherwise , depends on the co-operation , on the obedience and support , on the assent or at least passive tolerance of many people " .
Katharine Gun of GCHQ refused to tolerate the secret US spying on UN security council members in 2003 , yet her whistleblowing cost her job and almost her freedom .
Constitutional US lawyer Glenn Greenwald outlined recently how " the Obama administration 's assault on whistleblowers is more extreme than any prior administration , including the Bush administration " .
Greenwald pointed out that the US security establishment is deeply concerned with how the release of footage highlighting civilian casualties damages people 's trust in their government 's prosecution of the war .
This fear drives governments to throw the book at those individuals who raise their head above the parapet and speak out .
US army specialist Bradley Manning , the rumoured source of the Apache video , has disappeared into US custody in Kuwait .
WikiLeaks 's Assange claims that he is now under tight surveillance and is afraid to travel to the US .
Although these individuals can be easily smeared with accusations of treason and being unpatriotic , more often than not history vindicates their actions .

It 's beginning to emerge that the two men who shot and killed two police officers and wounded two more before being killed themselves in West Memphis , Arkansas , on Thursday were probably white supremacists from a small operation in southern Ohio .
Why they opened fire on the cops remains a mystery , but this could be an important developing story :
Two police officers were fatally shot and another two were wounded Thursday in two separate shootings allegedly by the same suspects in West Memphis , Arkansas , police said .
The two suspects , who were using an assault weapon , were themselves fatally shot , said Inspector Bert Shelton , who is assigned to city hall for the West Memphis Police Department .
The incident began around 11:36 a.m. ( 12:36 p.m. ET ) , when West Memphis patrolman Bill Evans made a traffic stop on a white minivan traveling eastbound on I - 40 at Airport Road , said Bill Sadler , public information officer for the Arkansas State Police .
After the vehicle exited the Interstate onto an off - ramp near College Avenue , Sgt. Brandon Paudert arrived on the scene as backup , Sadler said .
" It is our belief that Officer Evans was shoved to the ground by one of the suspects in the minivan and gunfire was directed at both officers , " Sadler said .
The suspects then fled , driving east in the minivan , leaving one man dead and the other fatally wounded .
Within minutes , officers from other agencies -- including the Arkansas State Police and the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission -- began to converge on the area , looking for the suspects , he said .
About 90 minutes later , a minivan believed to be the one that had been seen leaving the shooting site was spotted in a parking lot of a nearby Wal - Mart , Sadler said .
There , it was approached by Crittenden County Sheriff Dick Busby and Chief Enforcement Officer W.A .
Wren , who were traveling in the same vehicle , he said .
Both men were wounded in a gunbattle initiated by the suspects , who were using a long rifle and a handgun , Sadler said .
It turns out that the white van you see in the video was registered to an old Aryan Nations church in the small town of New Vienna , Ohio :
The two gunmen connected to the shootings in West Memphis that left two West Memphis police officers dead Thursday , drove a van that 's registered to a church in Ohio .
According to records with the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles , the plates on the gunmen ’s van are registered to “ House of God ’s Prayer ” in New Vienna , Ohio .
The church was once affiliated with Harold Ray Redfeairn , a white supremacist preacher who died in 2003 .
Redfeairn was a leader of the Aryan Nation .
He was also convicted of trying to kill a cop in 1979 .
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks hate groups across the country , Redfeairn was sentenced to four consecutive seven - year minimum terms for attempted aggravated murder , but was paroled in 1991 .
It can not be proven the gunmen are tied to the Aryan group , but the van used by the suspects in this shootout was never reported stolen .
The vehicle ’s plates were renewed last summer , and set to expire next month .
The two shooters have been identified , but not much is known about them yet :
People claiming to be relatives of the two , however , told The Commercial Appeal they could identify them from numerous videos and photographs taken at the crime scene and available on Memphis media websites .
They identified the men as Jerry Kane , 45 , of Ohio and his 16 - year - old son , Joseph .
Kane 's own website this morning bears a note indicating the two were " shot down " by law enforcement in West Memphis .
The Commercial Appeal could not independently confirm the suspects ' identification .
Attempts to verify the information led to a woman named Donna Lee in central Florida who said she was married to Jerry Kane and that Joe , as she called him , was her 16 - year - old stepson .
She wanted to emphasize Joseph Kane is a minor .
She said the white minivan belonged to Jerry and was positive from photos and videos from the scene that the two unidentified dead suspects were Jerry and Joe Kane -- and that the dog she saw exiting the minivan was a labrador - rottweiler mix named Olie .
Another man , Jake Jefferson , said he was a nephew of Jerry Kane 's and said he was positive that the dead person he saw in news accounts was 16 - year - old Joe Kane , that the white minivan had belonged to Jerry for some time and they traveled the country helping people with mortgage and foreclosure issues .
He also said he recognized the dog , and that Jerry and Joe had spent a month with him at his home in the Phoenix area over Christmas .
Jefferson and Lee both said Joe 's mother had died previously .
Jefferson said they traveled with a box of her ashes in the van .
" That 's them , " he said .
" And why do I think they fired on police ?
Because they must have believed the police were going to fire on them . "
The Internet company that hosted a website devoted to Jerry Kane 's business has now published a memorial page that says " Jerry Kane & Joe Kane .
Father and son killed in W. Memphis . "
At the top of the site it says , " Funds are now needed to bring Jerry and Joe back to Florida and for their funeral costs . "
A local TV station reports :
Kane 's business website , which lists information and classes on how to fight mortgage fraud and get around government regulations and taxes , has a memorial section dedicated to Joe and Jerry Kane .
The website also says the two were on their way back from Florida , where they were now living with Jerry Kane 's new wife and claims their initial traffic stop was unlawful and unjust .
The website lists Jerry 's business address and phone number in Springfield , Ohio .
Jerry and Joe were riding in a van with Clinton County plates , registered to a now defunct church in New Vienna , Ohio - it 's not clear yet why they had the van .
...
The Kane 's website says , " Jerry Kane and his beautiful son Joe ( age 16 ) were shot to death during an alleged traffic stop by law enforcement on Thursday , May 20th , 2010 .
Jerry , Joe and their two dogs , while on their way back to their home in Florida have been made out to be everything from drug smugglers to hispanics , which we all know is typical of the media spinners .
The police said it was a traffic stop .
But their van had more bullet holes in it than Bonnie and Clyde's . "
It goes on to say , " Last month , Jerry was stopped on I - 40 in New Mexico and arrested for not having a drivers license .
He recently completed his administrative process for the unlawful arrest .
Coincidence ?
I - 40 sounds like the good ole boy stretch - of - highway , where if they spot you , and they already dont like you , you 'could get killed .
Even if you are just a Dad and son with your two dogs on your way home , minding your own business . "
The local Fox affiliate in Ohio has more on the van :
The van is registered in New Vienna , in Clinton County , about 60 miles north - east of Cincinnati .
The Mayor , Keith Collins and the Police Chief , James Holcomb , both told FOX19 they 've never seen that van around town .
It is a small enough community , people pretty much know who 's doing what , driving what and where things are happening .
And , our FOX19 investigation of public records shows the van could be linked to a white supremacist group that was once here in Ohio .
New Vienna , Ohio was the home of the Jesus Christ Christian Church , led by a self proclaimed white supremacist , the Aryan Nation Church and its leader Ray Redfairn , made headlines 13 years ago .
The van involved in Thursday 's shooting in West Memphis , AR , was registered to the House Of God 's Prayer , and that address is 143 West Main Street in New Vienna .
Clinton County , OH records show the New Vienna property is owned by something called The Universal Life Of The Good Shepherd Church .
It has an address 50 miles away in Middletown , OH .
Butler County records show the Middletown property is owned by Hoge and Mary Tabor .
A man named Hoge Tabor is prominently mentioned in a book about the Aryan Nation in Ohio .
Tabor told FOX19 on the phone that he indeed owns the New Vienna property , but then hung up the phone .
FOX19 tried knocking on the front door at 143 west Main Street and also tried beating on the rear door , but the police chief and the mayor said have n't seen anybody walk in or out of that building in years .
" Right now it 's vacant , " said Chief Holcomb .
" There 's nothing in that building at all . "
" They were part of the Aryan Nation clear back in the 90's but they were n't really active because I think they 're main headquarters was somewhere down in Clermont county , " Collins said .
" So they used this just basically for a base and just a mailing address and held church services back in the 90's . "
While the information so far does not definitively confirm that the two dead shooters were white supremacists , both the van registration and their response to being approached by law enforcement are powerful indicators that this is the case .
Also , you can see Jerry Kane conducting a seminar here .
As you can see , this appears to be a Freeman - style operation based on old Posse Comitatus garbage .
We 'll have more information as it emerges .
Meanwhile , we hope Michelle Malkin adds these to her list of police officers felled by extremists .
As we noted back when she and the rest of the right - wingers were loudly complaining about the DHS bulletin for law - enforcement officers warning of the threat posed by resurgent white - nationalist extremists :
A recent study by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism lays out in painful detail the very real threat that right - wing extremists pose to people in law enforcement :
MONTREAL — Listen up , people .
Your job Monday night is so simple , even a Toronto Maple Leafs fan could do it .
When the horn sounds and this Game 6 is over , no matter if the Canadiens win or lose , you ’re to roll out the standing O , Montreal - style .
Think Rocket Richard in 1996 .
Think Saku Koivu , his head shaved , making a proud return after battling cancer .
Do n’t wait for some gravel - dumb voice from the sound system to urge you to “ make some noy - oyse . ”
This is strictly do - it - yourself decibels .
Make the earth shake .
Make the press box sway .
Make it sound as though that big , ugly barn is about to levitate , go airborne and fly all the way to Pittsburgh .
Make the Bell Centre , for once , about something other than extracting the maximum number of dollars from the maximum number of fans in the minimum amount of time .
Make it yours , even if it ’s for just one night .
Why ?
Because what you have seen over the past month , ladies and gentlemen , has been extraordinary .
Not because this is the best edition of the Canadiens we have ever seen — it ’s not even close .
Not because they have gone farther than anyone anticipated .
No , these guys deserve it because they have overcome so much .
For openers , this is a team that was supposed to make a quicker exit than your 14th hotdog .
They ’ve lost their best defenceman and , at this point , three of the top five .
They ’ve dealt with officiating that belongs in a Friday night beer league .
You know , the kind of league where the players drink with the refs . . . before the game .
They ’ve faced scheduling that would dismay the ’ 77 Habs .
Playing a Game 7 in Washington on a Wednesday night , flying to Pittsburgh to start the second round less than 48 hours later , then playing an afternoon game on the Sunday .
They ’ve had a player , Sergei Kostitsyn , who has ticked off his kindly old coach so badly that he ’s been kicked off the team — during the playoffs .
They ’ve yanked their goalie twice and replaced him as the starter once .
They have a 20 - year - old defenceman whose previous NHL resume was a decaf latte , now playing 22 minutes a game — and starring .
They were supposed to be wielding six - irons by now , but the Canadiens are still hurling their bruised and battered bodies in front of pucks , still battling for every square centimetre of the ice , still making this sometimes jaded town sit up and take notice .
Not only are they still standing , the Canadiens are playing .500 hockey against the two most dangerous teams in the Eastern Conference : A dozen games into the second season , they have won six and lost six .
Years from now , bleary - eyed coaches in video rooms will still be deconstructing the tactics Jacques Martin and his grew have used against Alexander Ovechkin , Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby .
They ’re frustrated Ovechkin to distraction , contained Malkin and brought out the vintage whine in Sid the Kid.
After Ovechkin was “ held ” to five goals and five assists in the first round , everyone said that Crosby would teach them a lesson .
The result ?
Crosby has no goals , three assists , and 1,037 complaints to the referee .
For the second time in recent weeks , the Obama administration 's environmental policies have clashed with its efforts to boost American jobs .
The U.S. Export - Import Bank , a federal body charged with promoting U.S. exports with loan guarantees , decided against backing a sale of coal - mining equipment to an Indian company .
The guarantees were denied amid the agency 's concerns about the mine 's environmental impact .
Bucyrus International Inc. said it was likely to lose orders totaling as much as $ 600 million for mining machinery from a subsidiary of Reliance Power Ltd. of India because of a decision by the Ex - Im Bank against providing loan guarantees to help finance the purchase .
The orders were contingent on obtaining the guarantees , which would cut the cost of financing for Reliance , part of a conglomerate headed by Anil Ambani .
A person familiar with the situation in India said Reliance has chosen not to purchase the mining equipment from Bucyrus because of the bank 's decision .

Iker Casillas has not been impressed with predictions that Jose Mourinho will become Real Madrid 's coach in the summer
Real ' keeper does not believe Mourinho will become Real coach
Iker Casillas has not been impressed with predictions that Jose Mourinho will become Real Madrid 's coach in the summer just because his Inter Milan side beat Barcelona .
The Spain international goalkeeper is unhappy with all the talk about the change of trainer at the Bernabeu while current incumbent Manuel Pellegrini tries to guide the team to the title .
" The name Mourinho is on everyone 's lips because Inter are playing Bayern in the Champions League final and I think it would be a mistake to think he will be our coach next season , " Casillas commented .
" To talk about Mourinho is out of order and I am not contemplating him coming here .
" It is too easy to think that he should be Madrid coach because he has beaten Barca .
" Whatever has just happened is the hot topic and it just so happens that Inter eliminated Barcelona but a lot can happen . "
Casillas was also not happy to see Madrid 's arch rivals Barca go out of Europe at the semi-final stage .
" People were saying that Barca were the best team in the world and now it seems that everything has collapsed , " he continued .
" I do not think anything like that .
" I am disappointed that Barcelona did not reach the final of the Champions League because they are a Spanish league side . "

Last month , with his veto of the Downtown Seattle Association - backed " aggressive panhandling " legislation , Mayor Mike McGinn sent a clear message to the downtown interests that the civil rights of Seattle 's most poor would not be sacrificed to the insatiable god of urban fear .
The proposed legislation was panned 9 - 0 by the Seattle Human Right Commission , and would have allowed police to issue $ 50 citations to those who invoke fear or a " compulsion to give " among those whose tolerance for the misery of others has , after nearly four decades of widening inequality , worn too thin .
The law was written with awareness that these tickets , targeted to the city 's most indigent , would not be paid .
They would become missed court dates and almost surely default to warrants .
These warrants would mean that any offense

For the US Coast Guard , the mighty Mississippi River is its “ best friend ” in the fight against the oil spill .
Trying to keep the spreading oil at bay , authorities have diverted the river into dozens of canals .
But fishermen and ecologists are concerned an environmental disaster could be in the offing .
After crossing the United States from north to south , the 2,350 - mile ( 3,800 - kilometer ) long river delivers its waters to the Gulf of Mexico through a sprawling delta formed by dozens of canals .
ADVERTISEMENT
With the outflow measuring between 7,000 and 20,000 cubic meters of water per second , the Mississippi represents a powerful natural ally of US authorities scrambling to control what could become the worst oil spill in US history .
“ The Mississippi River , it is our best friend , ” US Coast Guard Captain Edwin Stanton told AFP .
“ Because it ’s pushing and keeping the oil away from the delta . ”
The BP - leased Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank in the gulf last month , rupturing a riser pipe that has been spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude into the sea each day .
The US Coast Guard told AFP that oil was washing ashore in at least two new locations — Whiskey Island , Louisiana and Long Beach , Mississippi .
“ We sent crews to assess what type of oil , and we determined it ’s ‘ soft patties ’ on Whiskey Island and ‘ tar balls ’ on Long Beach , ” said Petty Officer Erik Swanson .
ADVERTISEMENT
Oil globs have also washed ashore on barrier islands in Alabama .
The appearance of oil in new locations highlights the urgency of efforts to contain the spill , which experts warn may be growing at a rate close to 70,000 barrels ( 2.9 million gallons ) a day , more than 10 times faster than previous Coast Guard estimates .
The new findings suggest the spill has already eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , the worst environmental disaster in US history .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the face of the catastrophe , US authorities have decided to open the locks at some of the canals to increase the outflow to maintain the oil slick away from the ecologically fragile delta .
But ecologists and fishermen worry this decision could backfire at a time when many fish and shellfish have entered their reproductive season .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It pushes the juvenile shrimp right into the oil , and we are going to lose them all , ” complained Clint Guidry , president of the Louisiana Shrimpers Association .
He said the water coming out from the Mississippi was of low purity and untreated .
“ Because of the flooding in the north , you have chemical products that are on the ground , in the communities , and go in the Mississippi , ” Guidry explained .
“ And I really do n’t agree with this decision . ”

Aron Viles , a campaign director for the Gulf Restoration Network also warned that the increased flow of Mississippi water was pushing shrimp right into the oil .
“ We would like to have better answers before we proceed , ” he said .
“ Better answers about the impact on shrimp , about the impact on oysters , about the impact on the larvae . ”
Viles said his organization had asked the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) some of these questions but had not received any answers yet .
Paul Horsnan , an oil expert for Greenpeace , acknowledged that everybody was working in an unknown situation , but urged caution with any steps that are being taken .

“ Whether it ’s injecting dispersants , whether it ’s spreading booms around , or diverting the Mississippi , everybody tries to see what to do to improve the situation , ” he said .
“ We must not do any oil spill response technics that cause further damages to the environment . ”
Several European countries have debated banning the veil
An armed robbery allegedly carried out by a man wearing a burka has sparked a row in Australia on whether the full - face Islamic veil should be banned .
Opposition Liberal Sen Cory Bernardi said the robbery showed the burka was " emerging as the preferred disguise of bandits and ne'er - do - wells " .
Both PM Kevin Rudd and Liberal leader Tony Abbott dismissed the comments and said they would not support a ban .
The row follows similar debates on the burka in European countries .
Last week , Belgian politicians voted for a ban which would outlaw the full - face veil in public .
Mr Bernardi , senator for South Australia , made his comments after a man was held up at gunpoint in a car park in Sydney on Wednesday and robbed of a bag of cash .
The victim said his attacker had been a man wearing sunglasses and a burka , meaning he could not be identified .
Writing in his blog , Mr Bernardi said the burka was " un-Australian " and should be banned on safety grounds and for the good of society .
" To me , the burka represents the repressive domination of men over women which has no place in our society and compromises some of the most important aspects of human communication , " he said .
" It also establishes a different set of rules and societal expectations in our hitherto homogenous society . "
' Confronting ' Mr Abbott said party member Mr Bernardi was " entitled to a personal view " but that he did not personally support the idea of a ban .
" I think a lot of Australians find the wearing of the burka quite confronting and I wish it was not widely worn , " he told ABC News .
" But the point is we do n't have a policy to ban it and we have always respected people 's rights in this area . "
Mr Rudd has accused the opposition of expressing contradictory views on the issue .
" He [ Bernardi ] goes out there and says that 's what he wants to do .
Mr Abbott then says it 's not their policy , " he told the Seven network .
" They are walking both sides of the street . ''
Belgium 's lower house of parliament voted unanimously last week for a law banning the public wearing of any clothing that obscures the identity of the wearer .
If passed by the country 's senate , the ban would be the first move of its kind in Europe .
France is close to introducing a similar ban .
Muslim headscarves
The word hijab comes from the Arabic for veil and is used to describe the headscarves worn by Muslim women .
These scarves come in myriad styles and colours .
The type most commonly worn in the West is a square scarf that covers the head and neck but leaves the face clear .
The niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear .
However , it may be worn with a separate eye veil .
It is worn with an accompanying headscarf .
The burka is the most concealing of all Islamic veils .
It covers the entire face and body , leaving just a mesh screen to see through .
The al - amira is a two - piece veil .
It consists of a close fitting cap , usually made from cotton or polyester , and an accompanying tube - like scarf .
The shayla is a long , rectangular scarf popular in the Gulf region .
It is wrapped around the head and tucked or pinned in place at the shoulders .
The khimar is a long , cape - like veil that hangs down to just above the waist .
It covers the hair , neck and shoulders completely , but leaves the face clear .
The chador , worn by many Iranian women when outside the house , is a full - body cloak .
It is often accompanied by a smaller headscarf underneath .

Mexico on Tuesday asked a federal court in Arizona to declare the state 's new immigration law unconstitutional , arguing that the country 's own interests and its citizens ' rights are at stake .
Lawyers for Mexico on Tuesday submitted a legal brief in support of one of five lawsuits challenging the law .
The law will take effect July 29 unless implementation is blocked by a court .
The law generally requires police investigating another incident or crime to ask people about their immigration status if there 's a " reasonable suspicion " they 're in the country illegally .
It also makes being in Arizona illegally a misdemeanor , and it prohibits seeking day - labor work along the state 's streets .
Until recently , Mexican law made illegal immigration a criminal offense -- anyone arrested for the violation could be fined , imprisoned for up to two years and deported .
Mexican lawmakers changed that in 2008 to make illegal immigration a civil violation like it is in the United States , but their law still reads an awful lot like Arizona's .
Arizona 's policy , which President Felipe Calderon derided during a recent U.S. trip as " discriminatory , " states police can't randomly stop people and demand papers , and the law prohibits racial profiling .
Mexican law , however , requires law enforcement officials " to demand that foreigners prove their legal presence in the country before attending to any issues . "
Amnesty International recently issued a report claiming illegal immigrants in Mexico -- typically from Central America -- face abuse , rape and kidnappings , and that Mexican police do little to stop it .
When illegal immigration was a criminal offense in Mexico , officials were known to seek bribes from suspects to keep them out of jail .
But Mexico said it has a legitimate interest in defending its citizens ' rights and that Arizona 's law would lead to racial profiling , hinder trade and tourism , and strain the countries ' work on combating drug trafficking and related violence .
Citing " grave concerns , " Mexico said its interest in having predictable , consistent relations with the United States should n't be frustrated by one state .
" Mexican citizens will be afraid to visit Arizona for work or pleasure out of concern that they will be subject to unlawful police scrutiny and detention , " the brief said .
It will be up to a U.S. District Court judge to decide whether to accept the brief along with similar ones submitted by various U.S. organizations .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer , who signed the law on April 23 and changes to it on April 30 , has lawyers defending it in court .
In a statement issued late Tuesday , Brewer said she was " very disappointed " to learn of Mexico 's filing and reiterated that " Arizona 's immigration enforcement laws are both reasonable and constitutional . "
" I believe that Arizona will ultimately prevail and that our laws will be found constitutional , " Brewer added .
Brewer and other supporters of the bill say the law is intended to pressure illegal immigrants to leave the United States .
They contend it is a needed response to federal inaction over what they say is a porous border and social problems caused by illegal immigration .
They also argue that it has protections against racial profiling .
Mexican officials previously had voiced opposition to the Arizona law , with Calderon saying June 8 that the law " opens a Pandora 's box of the worst abuses in the history of humanity " by promoting racial profiling and potentially leading to an authoritarian society
U.S. officials have said the Obama administration has serious concerns about the law and may challenge it in court .
Secretary of State Hilary Clinton recently went further by saying a lawsuit is planned .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Iran is holding its own nuclear summit after one in Washington Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has labelled the US an " atomic criminal " at a conference on nuclear disarmament in Tehran .
He also said that the use of nuclear weapons was prohibited by religion .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said an independent body should be set up to oversee nuclear disarmament .
Iran has been angered by a recent US review of nuclear policy , which Tehran sees as a threat to use nuclear weapons against it , a BBC correspondent says .
Iran 's leadership has used this conference on nuclear disarmament to underline what it says is its moral opposition to nuclear weapons , says our Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , reporting from London .
He says it is clearly meant as an answer to those who fear Iran is itself trying to develop its own nuclear arsenal .
Nuclear arms ' prohibited ' Ayatollah Khamenei said in a message read out at the conference : " Only the US government has committed an atomic crime .
" The world 's only atomic criminal lies and presents itself as being against nuclear weapons proliferation , while it has not taken any serious measures in this regard , " he said .
He also told the conference that the use of nuclear weapons was " haram " - prohibited under Islam .
President Ahmadinejad called for the US and all countries who possessed nuclear weapons to be suspended from the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
He said there should be an independent international body set up to oversee nuclear disarmament .
Our correspondent says the debate will no doubt intensify as a conference approaches that will review the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , just at a time when Washington rallies support for new sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme .
The US hosted a big international conference of 47 nations last week to discuss nuclear security .
Iran was not invited as the US fears Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Tehran says its nuclear programme is for purely peaceful purposes .

Ductile iron , also called ductile cast iron or nodular cast iron , is a kind of cast iron invented in 1942 .
Ductile iron is composed of spherical graphite instead of flakes which is visible in grey iron and is made by treating molten iron with magnesium .
While most varieties of cast iron are brittle , ductile iron is much more ductile .
This is attained through multifaceted metallurgy and foundry process control .
Ductile Iron has been successful as it offers a blend of versatility and properties not available in any of its rivals .
Its castability , machinability , dampening properties , and economy of production are almost equal to those for which Gray Iron is famous , but its mechanical properties – strength , wear resistance , fatigue strength , toughness and ductility are competitive with many cast , forged and fabricated steel components .
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) are the nationally recognized standards organization for the analysis of lighting structures .
They allow the bending strength of ductile iron to be 3 to 4 times that of cast aluminum and grey iron .
Spring City is self - assured that their ductile iron lamppost will last the lifetime of our project .
Their ductile iron products are practically durable and have been known to endure some of the most extreme moments in American history .
If we choose to buy Spring City ’s ductile iron lamppost for steel shafts , we will be investing our money in a value product that will look new for many years to come !
This wide - ranging warranty covers the products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and operation for twenty - five years .
The Benefits of Choosing a Ductile Iron Lamppost
• 25 Year Warranty Available
• Quickly replacing cast steel in structural applications
• Stronger than cast iron and cast aluminum
• High impact strength
• Does not become brittle unlike aluminum
• Excellent dampening qualities – Perfect for bridge applications
• Service life is 3 times as long as that of cast aluminum

Image caption Japan says its whale hunt is legal under the international convention
Australia has said it will begin legal action against Japan over its whaling in the Antarctic .
It will argue that the annual whaling hunt in the Southern Ocean is in violation of an international ban on commercial whaling .
Japan , which kills hundreds of whales ever year , says the hunt is carried out for scientific research purposes .
Critics say this is a cover for commercial whaling and that whale meat not used in research is sold for food .
The Australian government says it will lodge formal proceedings at the International Court of Justice in The Hague next week .
The move comes ahead of a meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) in Morocco next month , where agreement is being sought on a new approach to whaling , which would allow commercial hunting but with strict quotas .
Australian Environment Minister Peter Garrett and Attorney General Robert McClelland said in a joint statement that the move underlines their " commitment to bring to an end Japan 's program of so - called scientific whaling " .
' Disappointing '
There has been a ban on commercial whaling for 25 years , but a Japanese whaling fleet heads to the Southern Ocean each southern summer to harpoon hundreds of whales as part of what it calls lethal research , which is allowed .
Australia had tried to negotiate an end to these forays and had given Japan until November to stop this form of whaling .
It then brought forward its plans to take the matter to court .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway
Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan
Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat Culture clash over Japan whaling Whales - ' resource ' or ' right ' ?
Conservationists have broadly welcomed the legal action , praising the government of Prime Minster Kevin Rudd for standing up to Japan .
But the BBC's Sydney correspondent Nick Bryant says that the Australian Greens have said it is essentially a political move from a prime minister , who has been slipping in the polls , to make good on a election promise made three years ago .
Japan is Australia 's second biggest trading partner , and Canberra says it hopes the move will not damage their friendly relations .
The Japanese fisheries ministry has described the legal action as " very disappointing " .
" We will continue to explain that the scientific whaling that we are conducting is lawful in accordance with article eight of the international convention for the regulation of whaling , " said the ministry 's deputy press secretary Hidenobu Sobashima .
Mr Sobashima said the issue " should n't jeopardise the overall good relations between Japan and Australia " .
The Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said the two countries have agreed to treat the matter as " an independent legal arbitration of a disagreement between friends " .
Strikeforce welterweight champion Nick Diaz has a reputation as being one of the sports quintessential ‘ bad boys ’ .
That image was only enhanced recently when he became involved in the now infamous brawl at Strikeforce : Nashville in April which occurred during a live broadcast on network television .
Diaz team - mate Jake Shields has revealed a different side to the stockton native ’s character though in a new interview with the FiveKnuckles website .
“ People always see Nick acting crazy , you know , flipping people off .
But , that ’s his way of psyching himself up to fight .
People do n’t understand .
It ’s not easy to get in there and go fight someone in a cage , and that ’s kind of his way of dealing with it .
But he ’s got this reputation , and it ’s really not deserved .
Everyone always meets
Nick and they ’re surprised at how nice he is outside the cage .
He ’ll spend more time with white belts than anyone I know .
He ’ll be there for hours after training helping white belts out with their technique .
And he does n’t get anything out of it , it ’s just he ’s a helpful guy and he wants to help people get better .
It ’s not very often that you ’ll see a professional athlete spending hours and hours of his personal time just to help people get better .
And not for any gain , just to help people succeed .
When was the last time you saw a professional basketball player or football player spending hours and hours of their personal time just to help other regular guys get better ? ”
Is Shield ’s right ?
We decided to gather up evidence of his good side and his bad side , and let you be the judge .
Let ’s start off by reminding ourselves how Diaz earnt his bad boy reputation .
First off we ’ve got to mention his legendary mean - mugging .
Check out the pictures below to see what we ’re dealing with .
—
—
It ’s not easy looking this mean though , it takes hours of work in the gym to get it looking just right .
Here he is with his trainer perfecting the pose …
—
—
The truth though is that even as a kid growing up both Nick and his brother Nate were well on their way to mastering the mean mug …
—
—
In case you were thinking that was just a bad photo and they can’t possibly have been like that back then , how about this photo from elementary school .
Yep , that ’s Nick in the back row clenching his fist .
—
—
It goes further back than that though .
Here ’s the Diaz brothers sending out a message to all the haters whilst they were still in diapers .
—
—
…ok , so maybe those two baby photos are n’t really them …although I ’m not completely willing to dismiss the possibility .
Let ’s face it , it does fit their M.O .
—
—
Moving beyond mere mean - muggery there ’s also Diaz drug use to consider .
Despite Marijuana being a banned substance in MMA , Diaz has never hid the fact that he likes to gets high on his own supply .
In fact he once tested positive for weed after a fight with Takanori Gomi in PRIDE back in 2007 , causing his win to be amended to a no -contest .
Undeterred Diaz has continued to get his smoke on , and in fact was actually heard taking hits from a bong during a Strikeforce conference call .
During an interview with the L.A Times before his fight with Frank Shamrock he described how he would beat the California State Athletic Commissions tests prior to the bout .
“ I ’m more consistent about everything being a cannabis user .
I ’m happy to get loaded , hear some good music . . . I remain consistent .
And I have an easy way to deal with [ the drug tests ] .
“ I can pass a drug test in eight days with herbal cleansers .
I drink 10 pounds of water and sweat out 10 pounds of water every day .
I ’ll be fine . ”
With that comment Diaz was in essence sticking his finger up at the commission … how appropriate !
—
—
What really gives Nick his bad boy persona however is that essentially trouble seems to follow him wherever he goes .
Take the brawl that erupted with KJ Noons at an Elite XC event in 2007 for instance .
It ’s hard to make out in the clip below but it ’s worth noting two things about it :
Diaz flips the bird to Noons just moments before the commotion occurs .
He starts fighting with Noons 67 year - old father .
—
—
And of course there ’s the recent brawl at Strikeforce : Nashville in which Diaz took exception to Jason ‘ Mayhem ’ Miller interrupting Jake Shields post - fight interview , and quickly found himself igniting another riot in the cage .
—
—
If you were in any doubt about who threw the first punch then this picture should clear it up for you .
—
—
His ability to spontaneously create fights does n’t end in the cage though .
He ’ll basically get into it anywhere – even if it ’s during a visit to the hospital .
After a fight with Joe Riggs in the UFC back in 2006 the story goes that the two men both required treatment , and ended up bumping into each other in the ER room and immediately started talking smack .
Here ’s Rigg ’s description of what happened next .
“ He starts coming up to me .
I just never in a million years thought he ’d throw a punch .
He threw a right hook and hit me right in the chin .
I mean it hit me right on the button .
I seriously can’t say that I was knocked out , but I kind of went down to a knee . ”
Riggs adds that , “ I had an IV going .
My blood was spraying everywhere .
It was like a horror movie , ” and finishes by saying , “ Nick Diaz is legitimately nuts .
He ’s crazy . ”
That ’s an assessment that even Nick ’s brother Nate Diaz does n’t entirely disagree with .
In an interview with Fight !
Magazine he noted , ” “ He ’s serious about everything .
I guess he ’s crazy .
With Nick , it ai n’t no act .
That ’s who he is .
And he do n’t take shit from anybody .
—
So it ’s fair to say that Diaz reputation is well earned .
What about this nicer side of Diaz that Jake Shields is talking about though ?
Is there any evidence that it exists ?
After doing some digging around I believe it might .
For instance , check out this rare picture below of Diaz turning that frown upside down .
—
—
Is it a coincidence that Gina Carano happens to be standing next to him at the time ?
– I think not .
It ’s not just a one off either .
Here ’s our man looking like a cool dude in a loose mood with UFC President Dana White .
—
—
If that was n’t enough , check out this video of Diaz actually engaging in normal civil conversation with members of the public without causing a public disorder .
Will wonders never cease ?
—
—
And we ’ve even tracked down footage of Diaz doing just what Shield ’s says he does – sticking around to help teach students in the gym how to beat up other people .
—
—
So there you have it , maybe there ’s more than meets the eye to Nick after all .
Truth be told though , whether you love him or hate him , I have a sneaky suspicion that he probably does n’t give a rats ass .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
In the sometimes opaque world of statistics , Alan R. Templeton , Ph.D. , professor of biology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis , has found that it 's good to know your ABCs .
Templeton , with a doctorate in human genetics and a master 's in statistics , has determined that a recently published genetic analysis of deep human DNA evolution is mathematically erroneous and formally illogical .
The flaws of the analysis are due to the incorrect application of a statistical method known as approximate Bayesian computation ( ABC ) , which led Nelson J. R. Fagundes of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul , in Porto Alegre , Brazil , and colleagues to support the validity of the controversial “ Out of Africa ” replacement hypothesis in a 2007 paper .
This hotly debated hypothesis claims that modern humans emerged out of Africa thousands of years ago and replaced or wiped out existing human populations .
Templeton has done an acclaimed 2005 analysis that disputes this model , showing instead a trellis relationship between different human populations , supporting gene “ admixture , ” or intermingling .
Templeton got the notion to re-address the Fegundes paper when he noticed claims in a student ’s paper using Bayes factors that were just too good to be true .
Researching Bayes factors in the primary statistics literature , he found a 1999 paper that the probabilities generated by Bayes factors can be incoherent ( result in conclusions that violate logic ) .
He then re-read the Fegundes paper .
“ When I first read the paper , I thought something was wrong with it , but I ’ve got to admit I did n’t see the incoherence , ” Templeton says .
“ I just saw these probabilities , and they did n’t make any sense to me , but I could n’t quite pin it down .
As soon as I read the 1999 paper , I went back to the 2007 one , and I saw that it was massively incoherent .
It arrives at probabilities for different models of human evolution that violate the constraints of formal logic . ”
Templeton published his analysis , “ Coherent and incoherent inference in phylogeography and human evolution , ” in a March 22 early addition online issue of PNAS .
In this paper Templeton points out that two models Fegundes examined , the out - of - Africa replacement model and the assimilation model are not independent of one other .
The replacement model is just a special case of assimilation model with interbreeding falling to zero .
The problem is says , is that the authors found the probability of the replacement model being true , which is the special case , to be three orders of magnitude greater than the probability that the assimilation model , which is the general case , is true .
“ These probabilities are in the wrong direction because they used a technique that was not designed to test nested models and used it on nested models , ” Templeton explains .
“ I show in my paper that the fundamental equation that they used was logically incorrect and mathematically incorrect whenever you have logically overlapping models .
In every case where you apply ABC to overlapping models it will give you a mathematical error . ”
Templeton is not saying that Bayes factors or ABC can not be used coherently .
In fact , when it ’s run on the simulated model B , a general model that is not nested , or not “ the special case , ” you get a coherent conclusion .
“ The ABC method can be used legitimately to test nested hypotheses , but you ca n’t use the mathematically incorrect equations they use by simulating these models as if they were separate logical entities , ” he says .
“ You can do the general model and then look at the parameter that defines the special case , and when you do that you have a complete reversal . ”
Surprise of surprises , when the coherence is corrected in the Fegundes model , “ it ’s completely compatible with my earlier trellis model , ” Templeton says .

The Harper government used a pervasive message - control tool to persuade Canadians their foremost purpose in Afghanistan was building schools and fostering democracy rather than waging a war that was turning bloodier by the day .
An investigation by The Canadian Press shows
The Conservatives systematically drafted “ Message Event Proposals ” as part of a quiet campaign to persuade Canadians their country was primarily engaged in development work to rebuild a shattered nation rather than hunting down and killing an emboldened insurgency .
The government used MEPs to literally script the words it wanted to hear from the mouths of its top diplomats , aid workers and cabinet ministers in 2007 - 2008 to divert public attention from the soaring double - digit death toll of Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan .
While the message was being massaged in Ottawa , the reconstituted Taliban unleashed a fresh wave of attacks on NATO troops and innocent Kandaharis .
“ Desired soundbite : ‘ Canada ’s mission in Afghanistan is refocusing its mission towards development , reconstruction and diplomatic efforts , ’ ” says an MEP prepared by the Privy Council Office , the bureaucratic wing that serves the Prime Minister ’s Office .
The document , among hundreds of MEPs obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act , was prepared for a 2008 media tour by Arif Lalani , then the Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan .
Other records show the government went so far as to script an identical set of quotes and talking points for two returning aid workers , who were supposed to be giving separate interviews on their “ personal perspective ” on progress in Afghanistan .
The government also tried to soft - pedal deployment of the first group of Quebec - based troops in 2007 by giving them a “ compassionate ” send - off that was designed to “ showcase the achievements in development . ”
“ That was clearly what the message was — Afghanistan is about development , CIDA , building schools , building roads , helping Afghans , which is all good stuff ... but not necessarily to the exclusion of reality , ” said a senior government official who worked in the PCO but asked not to be named because of fears of career reprisals .
There is nothing new about a wartime government trying to mould public opinion .
But for the first time , documents detail how the Harper government attempted to shape perceptions of Canada ’s fiercest combat mission since the Korean War .
The Conservatives introduced the MEP , a relatively new information - management tool , that enables Harper ’s office to centrally control a wide array of government communication .
Federal departments are required to submit proposals to the PCO for public events and responses to media inquiries .
The PMO ultimately decides what can occur and what should be said .
A PCO spokeswoman has defended the government ’s use of MEPs , saying they are a tool for communication .
The Prime Minister ’s Office has declined comment .
The strategy does n’t sit well with Nipa Banerjee , who headed Canada ’s aid program in Kabul from 2003 to 2006 before the Canadian Forces moved to Kandahar .
“ It bothers me a bit now because I think we were used politically at that time , ” said Banerjee , a visiting professor at the University of Ottawa graduate school of public and international affairs .
In May 2008 , with 83 soldiers and one diplomat dead , Lalani returned to Canada for a four - day blitz aimed squarely at reshaping the public ’s view of the war .
A three - page MEP prepared by the PCO outlined 10 sets of possible interviews that Lalani could give May 26 - 30 with major television , radio and print organizations across the country .
CTV ’s Sunday political talk show Question Period topped the list .
“ This appearance would serve to move the national narrative forward beyond the parliamentary arena and refocus Canadians interest in Canada ’s civilian efforts in Afghanistan , emphasizing development , reconstruction and diplomacy efforts , ” the MEP says .
An interview with the CBC ’s Peter Mansbridge was also recommended , noting that because his program “ styles itself as a window into the lives of Canadian decision makers and influencers , Ambassador Lalani can leverage this opportunity to stress Canada ’s increased civilian focus , emphasizing development , reconstruction and diplomacy efforts . ”
CIDA , meanwhile , tried to put forward its returning Kandahar - based employees for interviews to highlight development efforts .
“ First - hand accounts by Canadians who have lived and worked in Afghanistan add credibility to Canada ’s role , ” states one MEP .
Helene Kadi , in Kandahar from September 2006 to August 2007 , was cleared to do several interviews .
“ Helene has gained experience and confidence in giving on - air statements , ” says a Feb.
5 , 2008 , MEP .
The document laid out the desired “ headline ” for a proposed 10 - minute interview by Kadi on a CBC Radio morning show in Thunder Bay , Ont. : “ Perspective from the ground : Canada makes progress in terms of development and reconstruction in Afghanistan . ”
But Kadi ’s MEP contained the same key messages — word for word — as one prepared for another CIDA employee , whose own “ personal perspective and reflections ” were scripted for him .
On Feb. 12 , 2008 , returning CIDA manager Kevin Rex gave an interview to weekly Alberta newspaper the Airdrie Echo .
The separate MEPs for Kadi and Rex specified the same “ key message ” for each : “ As a returned CIDA field staff , I have seen and experienced first - hand the accomplishments and results achieved in Afghanistan , thanks to Canada ’s role in that country . ”
Their respective MEPs repeated other messages — verbatim .
One highlights Canada ’s polio vaccination campaign as “ another example of success I have seen on the ground . ”
Another says : “ It has been gratifying to be part of that collective effort and to know that if our commitment to governance and development is sustained we can generally make a difference in the lives of Afghans . ”
Yet another , scripted for both Kadi and Rex , says : “ While the pace of progress may appear to be slow to those on the outside , I can personally attest to the reality of progress and the results of positive advancement in Afghanistan . ”

In the Echo ’s story , Rex offers little personal reflection .
“ Rebuilding a nation takes time , but we are saving lives and making a difference every single day , ” he told the newspaper .
Banerjee said Canada drifted from true assistance work when the country ’s troops moved from Kabul to Kandahar in 2006 , and began concentrating on signature projects that focused on making locals admire Canadian soldiers , “ not the development of Afghanistan . ”
“ When we went to Kandahar our intent was winning the hearts and minds of the people for our Canadian Forces , for the Canadian troops , ” she explained , “ to keep the troops safer , so that the people support the troops . ”
Bureaucrats point out there were close to 3,000 troops in theatre versus 50 civilians .
“ They had a problem with the narrative .
It did n’t jibe with reality , ” said another senior government official who spent time in the PCO , also speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ There was an awful lot of emperor - has - no - clothes moments . ”
Early 2008 was a pivotal time in Canada for the Afghanistan mission .
In January , the independent panel on Afghanistan chaired by John Manley criticized the government for not clearly communicating its involvement to the Canadian public .
CIDA , meanwhile , was slammed for having a very low profile in Kandahar .
Politically , the Conservatives needed the support of the Liberals to pass a motion that would extend the mission two more years , to 2011 .
After much backroom jockeying , the two parties agreed in March 2008 on wording that played down the combat role and stressed reconstruction .
Afghanistan exposed the Conservatives ’ vulnerability in Quebec , the province where anti-war sentiment runs deepest , and where the Conservatives must make deep electoral gains if they hope to win a majority .
But only a year after winning power , the Conservatives faced a potential political landmine ­— the first Quebec - based troops were to go to Afghanistan in summer 2007 .
By June 22 , when troops from the Royal 22nd Regiment from CFB Valcartier , Que. , were to head overseas , the Conservatives had presided over the deaths of 52 Canadian soldiers and one diplomat in Afghanistan , compared with eight under the previous Liberal government .
The MEP for the Van Doos ’ sendoff specified that then - international co-operation minister Josee Verner would represent the government .
The “ strategic objectives ” were to “ create awareness of the development efforts in Afghanistan by Canada ” and “ showcase the achievements in development by CIDA . ”
“ Quebec media ” and “ Quebec general public ” were identified as “ target groups ” ahead of all “ Canadians . ”
The desired tone of the event was to be “ compassionate ” and “ optimistic . ”
The political reality today is that with more than 140 soldiers killed in Afghanistan , the war remains unpopular with a large number of Canadians .
Harper has vowed there will be no extensions of the combat mission beyond next year ’s withdrawal date .
The prime minister maintains Canada ’s involvement in Afghanistan after 2011 will focus on development and diplomacy — not fighting .
Harper made it clear during a news conference in the Netherlands last month that he is done with debating the mission in Parliament .
“ The plan is for the military mission to end next year and we will be pursuing a humanitarian and development and governance mission after that .
We ’ve been building our civilian capacity in that regard over the past two years to get ourselves prepared for that transition , ” Harper said .
“ Parliament can debate whatever it wants to debate .
Typically in the past we ’ve only debated military missions .
The government has n’t proactively debated civilian missions . ”

Scientists at Germany 's Ruhr - Universitaet - Bochum have succeeded to genetically modify Drosophila ( fruit fly ) larvae allowing them to smell blue light .
The research team can activate single receptor neurons out of 28 olfactory neurons in the larvae for this sensory perception .
Normally animals avoid light .
However , blue light simulates in genetically modified larvae the smell of an odorant , e.g. , banana , marzipan or glue -- odors which are all present in rotting fruit and attractive to fruit fly larvae .
The team of scientists from Bochum and Göttingen , working under the auspices of Prof.
Klemens Störtkuhl , hopes to gain insight into the processing of the neural network .
They have published their findings in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience Behavior .
Light has a “ tasty ” odor
The olfactory neurons of the only one millimeter sized genetically modified Drosophila larvae are all capable of producing the protein that is activated by light .
The researchers can freely select which of the 28 cells will ultimately be light - sensitive using genetic markers .
Prof .
Störtkuhl explained that they were able to either activate cells which normally register repulsive odors and subsequently cause an aversion response , or cells that sense attractive odors such as banana , marzipan or glue .
The activated neurons send an electrical signal if they are stimulated with blue light at a wavelength of 480 nm .
The larva thus has the impression that it perceives odors .
The experiment shows that it is possible by inserting photo activated proteins into neurons photo stimulation can produce an olfactory behavior in these larvae , whereas genetically unchanged larvae generally avoid light .
Animals are not hurt
Moreover , the researchers could measure the effect electrophysiologically .
Thin electrodes can detect the signal of the light - activated neurons .
The transmission of the nerve signal can be followed all the way into the brain , thus enabling non-invasive observation of neural networks .
Prof .
Störtkuhl pointed out that this method has the great advantage of enabling tests to be carried out on living animals without an injury .
The research scientists hope to gain an insight into the network and mode of action of the brain .
It must moreover be pointed out that the olfactory sense of the genetically modified fly larvae remains normal .
Same principle applies to other animals
The researchers now plan to use the same principle to undertake further studies on adult Drosophila , equipping them with photo - activated proteins to cause targeted isolated cerebral neurons to react .
These successfully employed methods are now also being used in model systems i.e. mice in other laboratories including a work group at the RUB , to investigate similar issues using mice .
Labour has made some big changes to Britain and achieved considerable successes .
But during its 13 years in office there have been grave disappointments , too
“ WE'RE still looking at the photos , ” says Sue Morton , an IT trainer , “ and it still gives me a glow when I think about it . ”
Ms Morton and Anna Richards , a social worker and her long - term partner , celebrated their civil partnership last year , under legislation introduced by Britain 's Labour government in 2004 .
“ I 'd got so used to being marginalised , ” says Ms Richards .
“ Ten years ago it did n't seem possible … it was a very joyous day . ”
In this era of globalisation , politicians often appear mere bystanders to the shifts and trends that define society .
During Labour 's 13 - year stint in office , Britain has been reshaped by the rise of al - Qaeda and the ascent of Asian manufacturing ; by mass immigration and the continued fracturing of the nuclear family ; by the advent of the internet and budget airlines .
In all this , government has played a largely passive role .
Labour 's civil partnerships , however , and other social reforms that have made life easier and better for gay people , ethnic minorities and parents , are an example of how government can drive — and has driven — change rather than just finessing or ameliorating it .
They are also a reminder of how some of Labour 's bolder policies have become uncontroversial features of British life .
In thinking about its long rule — which may end next week , depending on the unpredictable and potentially messy outcome of the general election on May 6th — there is a natural tendency for recent events , such as the recession and Britain 's parliamentary - expenses scandal , to loom larger than more remote history .
A fair assessment of Labour 's record must begin by acknowledging that , amid its mistakes , it has managed some big and lasting achievements .
That “ wasted ” first term in full
It has become a truism of political commentary that , after their election landslide of 1997 , Tony Blair and his government “ wasted ” their first term .
It is n't true .
Among other things , they enacted a series of constitutional reforms that transformed the way Britain is governed , and which historians of the future may well regard as Labour 's most important domestic legacy .
They booted out most of the hereditary peers from the House of Lords ; passed the Human Rights and Freedom of Information Acts ; and devolved power to Wales and Scotland , which got its first parliament for 300 years .
Much of this was done cack - handedly : Mr Blair seemingly had n't realised that devolution meant giving power away .
But the changes Labour did make were historic , and broadly beneficial .
Power has also been devolved , of course , if with interruptions , to Northern Ireland .
Many people were involved in the making and keeping of peace there , notably Bertie Aherne , Ireland 's former prime minister , as well as Ulster 's own politicians , some of them exceptionally brave .
The work began before Labour took office .
And it is n't altogether complete : there is still suspicion and bitterness between Northern Ireland 's rival communities , plus intermittent violence by rejectionists .
But Belfast today is a smart , relaxed city , whose prosperity is shared by both Protestants and Catholics .
The days of tit - for - tat murder and mainland bombing campaigns feel like ancient history .
Mr Blair deserves considerable credit for both the Good Friday agreement of 1998 and the 2007 deal between once - irreconcilable unionists and republicans that he secured shortly before he left office .
Labour 's main pledges when it came to power concerned more bread - and - butter issues .
It promised , for example , to reduce poverty and increase “ fairness ” .
It is fashionable these days — including among Conservatives — to contend that it has failed to meet that goal .
And indeed , according to one basic measure of income inequality , the Gini coefficient , Britain today is a marginally less equal society than the one the government inherited .
It is fairer to say , however , that Labour has taken the edge off economic trends that threatened to increase inequality further : the Institute of Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) concludes that inequality “ would have been even higher ” in the absence of Labour 's tax and benefit measures .
Its quiet redistribution helped many impoverished pensioners , among others .
That headline inequality measurement is skewed by the rocketing incomes of the very richest .
Moreover , in 1999 the government introduced a minimum wage , arousing now - forgotten but vociferous opposition from the Tory party and businessmen .
No one much complains about the minimum wage today ; it has improved the meagre lot of hundreds of thousands of low - paid workers .
“ They tried many things ” to deal with poverty , says John Hills of the London School of Economics ( LSE ) , “ and most worked .
The difficulty was that the scale of the problems was often greater than the scale of the action taken . ”
Another of Labour 's big promises was to “ save ” the country 's public services , whose management , along with that of the economy , is the main domestic challenge for any British government .
Here , too , Labour suffers from the popular amnesia that comes with such long incumbency : voters have forgotten what Britain 's “ public realm ” looked like before 1997 , even as their expectations for it have become more demanding and consumerist .
The once - crumbling physical infrastructure of schools , job centres and hospitals , such as the one in Birmingham in which the party recently launched its election manifesto , has been thoroughly renovated ( though that particular hospital , like many others , was built under the private - finance initiative — ie , on the never - never — and so has n't been fully paid for yet ) .
Some important public - service outcomes have unquestionably improved too .
The proportion of young people going to university has risen .
Almost all patients are now seen in hospital within 18 weeks of referral by their family doctor , and most much more quickly ( see chart 1 ) ; once , some waited 18 months .
It is an irrational quirk of public opinion that while record numbers of National Health Service patients are satisfied with their care , many tell pollsters that the NHS is deteriorating .
The same disjuncture between personal experience and general perceptions is evident when it comes to crime , fear of which has increased even as incidence has fallen .
Labour has also introduced a new and welcome institution : Sure Start children 's centres , nurseries - cum - playgroups - cum - advice centres designed to improve the life chances of under - fives , a cause which ought to be as dear to liberals as to social democrats .
“ We 're an oasis in a concrete desert , ” says a carer at one London centre , as 30 children of assorted ethnicities and nationalities cavort around him .
As Matthew Taylor , formerly head of Mr Blair 's policy unit , now of the Royal Society of Arts , says , it is impossible to know how much of this legacy would survive a change of government , or — another key test — how much opposition would be provoked if someone tried to dismantle it .
But , to judge from the rhetoric of Labour 's adversaries , it has succeeded in making compassion for the poor compulsory , and enthusiasm for early - years intervention and the NHS politically universal .
That is some of what might appear in the positive column of a Labour reckoning .
But , like any government , it must partly be judged against the opportunities history afforded it .
Few in Britain have been blessed with such happy circumstances : a decade of economic growth , two landslide election victories followed by a respectable third , and an astonishingly feeble opposition until the end of 2005 .
In that context , Mr Taylor compares Labour 's record to that of a gambler , who wins , but afterwards thinks he ought to have won bigger , considering the hand he was dealt .
Another way of putting it is that alongside Labour 's accomplishments have been failures and mistakes : sins of both omission and commission .
Investment minus reform
It is one thing to say that the public services have improved ; another that they are as good as they could or should have been , considering Labour 's investment in them .
Health spending has doubled in real terms , as has funding per secondary - school pupil .
But the reform Labour said would accompany this investment materialised patchily and belatedly .
Peter Hennessy , Britain 's best historian of Whitehall , concludes that Mr Blair “ did n't understand how institutions worked .
He thought that willpower and rhetoric were enough , and was shocked when they turned out not to be . ”
That naivety reflects the loss of executive acumen incurred in an 18 - year spell in opposition ; the rise of professional politicians , which has left a dearth , in all parties , of leaders who have actually run things ; and , perhaps , a residual , inflated left - wing faith in the easy power of the state .
It was only in 2003 , says Julian Le Grand of the LSE , that Mr Blair had his epiphany .
He saw that the target regime that had characterised Labour 's approach to public services was distortionary ; that monolithic services fail those who need them most ; and that the remedy , as Professor Le Grand puts it , was “ independent institutions in a quasi- market system ” .
Unfortunately , for Mr Blair and for Britain , this realisation coincided with the sharpening of hostility between him and his chancellor of the exchequer , Gordon Brown .
This tension — driven by Mr Brown 's impatience to take over the top job — was more debilitating for the government than any external opposition .
Part of the tragedy of the saga is that , when Mr Brown finally got his wish and became prime minister in 2007 , it was soon apparent that the rivalry had been born less out of any meaningful ideological dispute , than out of ego and faction .
Labour , in fairness , did manage some creditable reforms — some of which , perhaps , on the “ Nixon - to - China ” principle , only a centre - left government could have implemented .
It introduced university tuition fees and a bigger role for private providers in publicly funded health care , a reform that may , in time , dramatically alter the shape of the NHS .
But the Blair - Brown rift stalled the reform process , and it more or less ceased during Mr Brown 's three - year premiership .
“ New Labour will be wise spenders , not big spenders , ” claimed the party 's 1997 manifesto .
But too often extra cash has been a substitute for reform , rather than lubrication for it .
It is in education , allegedly Mr Blair 's priority , that the results of this inertia have been starkest and most disappointing .
The improvements in pupils ' exam results that Labour likes to tout have been undermined by both the proliferation of the exams themselves , and the fact that the scores have been devalued by grade inflation .
Worse , Britain 's long tail of educational underachievement has persisted .
The proportion of 16 - to - 18 - year - olds not in education , employment or training ( so called NEETs ) has remained unchanged at roughly 10 % .
Too many children still leave primary school unable to read and write properly .
As Michael Gove , the Tory education spokesman , likes to point out , a poor boy educated in a state school has almost as much chance of playing for Manchester United as going to Oxford or Cambridge .
( Mr Gove 's plan for Swedish - style “ free ” schools , set up by anyone , in the state system is a policy Mr Blair might have adopted , had others not frustrated him . )
Under Labour , Britain has slipped down the international education rankings .
Another grave failure has been in welfare .
When Labour took over , more than 5 m working - age adults subsisted on state benefits .
That scandalous figure has barely shifted .
( The vast majority of the jobs created in Britain since 1997 have gone to foreign - born workers . )
For all Mr Brown 's tinkering with the benefits system , a serious push to reform its misaligned incentives began only recently .
The spending splurge prefigured the most toxic aspect of Labour 's domestic record : vaulting debt ( see chart 2 ) and a fiscal deficit that equalled 11.6 % of GDP in 2009 - 10 .
Labour did n't use the fat years to shore up the public finances as much as other governments did .
The IFS calculates that between 1997 and 2007 , among comparable rich countries , only South Korea 's public spending grew more as a share of national income .
That laxity helped to leave the exchequer badly exposed when the lean period arrived — with the financial turmoil that began in 2007 .
As chancellor , Mr Brown seemed to some to have worked a kind of economic alchemy .
Britain 's economy grew by an average of 2.9 % a year for a decade .
Living standards rose and inflation was tamed , with the help of an independent Bank of England .
Mr Brown boasted of abolishing “ boom and bust ” ; and if Labour had lost the election of 2005 , that claim , and his reputation for economic management , might have escaped intact .
Instead , he has been humbled .
True , in 2008 he implemented a wise bank bail - out that was admired and emulated elsewhere .
But he has since presided over a deeper and longer recession than in many of Britain 's peers .
The previous prosperity under Labour now looks somewhat illusory .
It was too reliant on a financial - services sector that the government , transfixed by a kind of post - socialist awe at the magical workings of the City , failed to regulate properly , and on rising public debt and perilous private borrowing : British citizens are more heavily indebted than those of any other rich country .
Labour argues that the mistakes evident in retrospect — in financial regulation , for example — would have been made by a Tory government too .
Perhaps .
But they happened on Labour 's watch .
The impact on the public finances has been severe .
Britain 's fiscal plight may not be as apocalyptic as that of Greece , but it is dire all the same : the next government will be obliged both to slash spending and , probably , raise taxes .
Carl Emmerson of the IFS says that , under the deficit - reduction plans that Labour has itself announced , by 2014 Whitehall spending on public services will make up the same share of national income as it did in 2000 , when Labour 's splurge truly began .
So , while Labour intended to safeguard the “ public realm ” , it has instead made the opposite inevitable : public services and the state ( now equivalent in size to almost half the nation 's economic output ) face an inevitable and painful retrenchment .
Tony 's wars
If the huge deficit seems likely to overshadow British politics in the immediate future , historians in coming years may concentrate on its conduct of foreign affairs — the field in which Mr Blair , who in other ways never seemed to shake off the nerves of opposition , was most bold , and most rash .
The moral and military vindication of the Kosovo campaign of 1999 went to his head .
The speech he gave in Chicago that year , outlining his doctrine of humanitarian intervention , may well come to seem the most important , and most fateful , of this Labour administration .
This newspaper supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
But it is now clear that Mr Blair committed British forces to it with vanishingly few reassurances from George Bush about how that country was to be reconstructed .
Moreover , the way Mr Blair made his case for war — focusing on the alleged threat posed by Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction — turned out to be cavalier at best .
Mr Blair 's wars , and Iraq in particular , have , rather like Labour 's public - spending overstretch , had the opposite effect on Britain 's foreign - policy and national standing from the one he intended .
It is n't only the animosity incurred in the Muslim world or the strain on the country 's European alliances .
Truth be told , when British forces finally left Iraq in 2009 , they went with their tail between their legs , raising questions about Britain 's continued ability to project military power globally , and its usefulness as a military ally to America .
The electorate is now so queasy about foreign adventures that future governments are likely to be wary of embarking on new ones ; the ongoing , bloody campaign in Afghanistan , the other long - term deployment of the Labour era , is increasingly unpopular .
And although the Iraq war did n't instigate the Islamist terrorist threat to Britain , which already featured in the ranks of al - Qaeda 's infidels , the conflict exacerbated it .
This has been a selective account of Labour 's long , eventful tenure .
( Among other things , it leaves out , on the positive side of the ledger , the government 's stance on international aid , and , on the negative one , its erosion of civil liberties . )
But what should a fair overall judgment of Labour be based on ?
What it has done , or what it has n't ?
What other governments achieved , or what this one could have ?
Perhaps the fairest way to assess it is against its own promises and aspirations .
“ A new dawn has broken , has it not ? ” , Mr Blair declared in May 1997 .
“ Tolerance and respect ” , he said , “ will be the order of the day ” ; and , in those ways , Britain has improved .
He also promised “ a Britain that stands tall in the world ” , educational opportunity for all and a modernised welfare state .
On those counts , Labour has flopped .
Its overall promise was embodied in its 1997 election anthem , “ Things can only get better ” .
In many ways , for many people , they have .
For some of those advances , Labour deserves credit for moulding the zeitgeist , rather than simply accommodating it ; some of the gains are now forgotten or taken for granted .
At the same time Labour has failed to tackle the entrenched social problems it hoped to , and has created some new ones .
Thirteen years is as fair an innings as it has a right to expect .
Last month , in two separate reports , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) corroborated what the Palestinian private sector has been saying for years , that the hope for sustainable economic development in the West Bank , as well as East Jerusalem and Gaza , is being structurally stymied by the Israeli government .
The World Bank report qualified the oft - observed growth in the Palestinian Authority by noting that the growth comes , in part , via “ large inflows of donor assistance … Sustainability of the growth , given the reliance on donor assistance , is a cause for concern . ”
This “ concern ” should be shared by all involved , particularly President Obama as he contemplates what to do next .
The World Bank ’s analysis did not shy from next steps when it asserted , “ the largest impediment to private sector investment in the West Bank and Gaza remains the restrictions on movement and access to resources and markets imposed by the Government of Israel ( GoI ) . ”

The international community seems more determined than ever to undo the Gordian knot created between Israelis and Palestinians over the past several decades .
This comes not a moment too soon , at a truly decisive crossroads both politically and economically .
So long as Israel ’s military occupation remains in place , serious progress for investment in Palestine requires an intention – on the part of all stakeholders , including the occupier – to permit development to happen .
I manage the Palestine Investment Fund ( PIF ) – a publicly - owned investment company with an independent board and transparent governance system .
PIF invests in Palestine ’s future through an investment strategy focused on value creation .
PIF is the national incubator of several strategic investment initiatives and a major contributor to building Palestine as the Middle East ’s new “ startup ” nation .
The PIF has developed and is currently implementing an ambitious US $ 4 billion investment program which aims to create over 100,000 jobs in the private sector .
Yet Israel ’s complete control of our movement and access stifles job creation and upholds a choking dependency : Palestine ’s airports , seaports , and bridge crossings – the gateways to world trade – are not under our control .
Without control of our economic gateways , the task of building an economic foundation for statehood is daunting .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’ vow to breathe economic life into the notion of “ viable ” ( as in a viable Palestinian state ) , however , inspires investment today for the post - occupation era .
Economic Viability
Palestine does not intend to remain dependent on donor handouts .
As the Palestinian government painstakingly proceeds with public institution building , a parallel dynamic is underway – this one aiming to upgrade the Palestinian economy and make it competitive and economically integrated , both regionally and internationally , by incubating the development of several leading companies .
Our strategic projects are diverse , ranging from natural gas extraction from the seacoast off Gaza to affordable housing , including in areas currently designated as “ Area C ” ( the 60 percent of the occupied West Bank remaining under full Israeli military and administrative control ) , and development of our tourism markets in Jericho , the Dead Sea , and East Jerusalem .
These are live projects being implemented today .
However , until the Israeli occupation is rolled back , these projects also share a common bottleneck – they require the international community ’s support to obtain the necessary Israeli approvals .
Every strategic economic initiative we launch contributes to improving the quality of life across Palestine .
Economic development cannot replace a political resolution to the conflict that provides full Palestinian freedom .
But such development can tangibly reduce tensions and build much needed confidence between the parties so long as it ’s not used by Prime Minister Netanyahu as a means to postpone Palestinian aspirations by giving the false appearance of substantive political movement .
Moving Forward
If allowed to succeed , our economy is poised to take its natural place in the community of nations .
Palestinians , with their economic partners , are ready to change the economic reality in their cities , starting today .
Unlock the gates and watch it happen .
The international community and President Obama have repeated their full commitment to realizing a free , viable and independent Palestinian state alongside Israel .
The mantra of a viable Palestinian state , however , only acquires significance when joined to an economic program restoring Palestinian economic life and integrating us with the global economy .
From our side , we stand ready with capital , labor , know - how and an open invitation for partners in these state - in - the - making endeavors .
Beyond the facilitation of our economic development while under occupation , our long - awaited independent statehood will ultimately allow us to reach new trade arrangements and establish our own gateways to the world .
The missing ingredient is the requisite political will from the international community – and the Quartet in particular – to assist us in building a new Palestine .
Dr. Mohammad Mustafa is CEO of the Palestine Investment Fund and Economic Advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
George Donnelly , Political Prisoner
Among advocates of the stateless society it is considered a truism is that there ’s no past “ golden age ” in which a limited state eschewed the temptation of tyranny and fulfilled its alleged promise as guardian of people ’s rights .
It does not follow from that , however , that there is no continuum of evil along which states travel from bad to worse in terms of actual / ongoing ( rather than potential / future ) behavior .
There is indeed such a continuum , and there are probably empirical methods for establishing a state ’s position on it .
Let ’s imagine that continuum .
At one end is a hypothetical ultra-minimal state which somehow manages to secure rights without violating them .
I ’m unaware of any such actual state in mankind ’s history , and doubt that such a state is even possible , but no matter — its purpose here is to serve as a left - end anchor .
The right - end anchor is the ultimate totalitarian state .
That state , or something approximating it , is a lot less hypothetical ( think Soviet Russia , East Germany , North Korea ) , but instead of dealing with possible anomalies , let ’s keep it hypothetical and go with Orwell ’s Oceania : Everything in the state , nothing outside the state ; violation of rights as policy , not side effect ; even one ’s thoughts are subject to supervision and to punishment for deviation from the party line .
All real - world states fall somewhere along this described continuum , and are at any given moment moving in one direction or the other along it .
The middle of that continuum represents the tipping point at which a state becomes more likely to violate rights than to protect them .
How do we tell which side of that tipping point a particular state falls on ?
In the case of the United States , I suggest that the state ’s attitude toward “ jury nullification ” may be the indicator we ’re looking for .
Jury nullification is a practice firmly established in law since the late 17th century ( and developing toward that establishment for centuries prior ) .
Its basis is simple : Juries are empowered to try not only the facts of a case , but the justice of the law alleged to have been broken .
This acts as a safeguard of rights against bad law .
In America , juries nullified the fugitive slave laws of the mid-19th century by refusing to convict persons accused of harboring and aiding runaway slaves .
They also largely nullified alcohol prohibition by refusing to convict bootleggers and the operators of “ illegal ” drinking establishments .
At some point those laws became “ null and void ” for lack of enforceability .
The police could arrest and charge someone with breaking them , but they ’d ultimately be freed by a jury which refused to convict .
A state more concerned with securing rights than with violating them would presumably cherish jury nullification as a safeguard against its own tendencies to respond to the siren song of tyranny .
A state at the “ balance point ” of the issue might not carefully educate its jurors as to their prerogatives , but neither would it hide those prerogatives from them .
The state which actively conceals the prerogative of nullification from jurors can certainly be said to have moved to the right of the “ tipping point of tyranny . ”
This has been the case in the United States for decades now .
Judges routinely instruct juries that they are required to apply the law as he or she gives it to them , without regard to their personal convictions on the subject of the law ’s rightness or wrongness .
The next tick mark toward tyranny would become noticeable when the state actively works to prevent non-state actors from informing prospective jurors of their right to judge the law as well as the facts .
We ’re well past that point , too — and notice the Soviet - style approach .
No jury would ever convict someone accused of attempting to protect jurors ’ rights , so the solution is to treat the advocate as insane and drag him off for involuntary “ treament . ”
Which brings me to George Donnelly ( and , earlier , to Antonio Musumeci , a /k / a “ bile ” ) .
Donnelly was kidnapped off the streets of Allentown , Pennsylvania ( interestingly , a state named for a man who helped establish the principle of jury nullification as a defendant ! ) by agents of the federal state earlier this week , and at this time remains caged in his abductor ’s lair .
Donnelly ’s “ crime ” was not declining , as a juror , to merely apply the law rather than follow his conscience .
Nor was his “ crime ” attempting to inform prospective jurors of their right to do so themselves .
Donnelly ’s “ crime ” was shooting video of state agents as they attempted to intimidate activists who were distributing jury nullification literature .
This state does n’t just conceal jurors ’ prerogatives ; it does n’t just persecute those who advise jurors of their prerogatives .
It kidnaps those who document its persecutions .
That ’s how far the agents of the state are willing to go to keep jurors ignorant — and that ’s one BIG tick to the right on the tyranny continuum .

“ I do n’t know what he means by that , ” Texas Sen .
John Cornyn , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , told POLITICO on Thursday .
“ I support nondiscrimination of people , so I would need to talk to him to see what precisely his concerns were . ”
Kyl — the No. 2 Republican in the Senate — said he watched Paul ’s exchange with Maddow on Wednesday night and suggested that Paul should have avoided “ engaging in a theoretical debate with her . ”
“ I think the two of them were having a bit of good time having a debate like you had at 2 a .m. in the morning when you ’re going to college , but it does n’t have a lot to do with anything , ” Kyl said .
Asked if he agreed with Paul ’s view , Kyl said : “ You ’re trying to go back to the 1960s and redebate all that , and I ’m just not going to go to it .
I think he was trying to say that . ”
Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said Thursday that he can understand how Paul reached that conclusion – based on his libertarian - leaning views – but he said that the law is settled , should not be changed and the country should not reopen the “ painful ” period in American history .
“ My view is that issue has been settled – the courts have ruled on it , ” Sessions said .
“ If you open a restaurant , a hotel to the public then you ca n’t discriminate on who you allow to come in and out , I think that ’s settled .
I think America is better off that the segregation views are over , and that played a role in it .
...
But if you take a more libertarian view , a stronger view of private party , you could reach the conclusion he reached . ”
Asked if he agreed with Paul ’s conclusion , Sessions said : “ I do n’t support that . ”
On Thursday , Paul went into overdrive to contain the fallout of his damaging statements from the night before .
Speaking with Ingraham , Paul chalked up the focus on his comments to unfounded attacks by the “ loony left . ”
" I ’ve never really favored any change in the Civil Rights Act , " he said .
He reiterated that view in his statement – although he did not say explicitly that he thought the federal government should have stepped in to prevent discrimination by private businesses as opposed to government agencies .
“ The issue of civil rights is one with a tortured history in this country .
We have made great strides , but there is still work to be done to ensure the great promise of Liberty is granted to all Americans , ” Paul said .
“ This much is clear :
The federal government has far overreached in its power grabs .
Just look at the recent national healthcare schemes , which my opponent supports .
The federal government , for the first time ever , is mandating that individuals purchase a product .
The federal government is out of control , and those who love liberty and value individual and state 's rights must stand up to it . ”
He dismissed the flap over his comments as proof that “ the liberal establishment is desperate to keep leaders like me out of office , ” and he said that there are sure to be more “ more wild , dishonest smears during this campaign . ”
Bangkok , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Military troops on Wednesday morning began entering a park in central Bangkok , where thousands of opposition protesters have been camped out in defiance of a government order to vacate the area .
Armored personnel carriers were seen smashing into bamboo and tire barricades lining Lumpini Park , the site of the main demonstration area for the so - called Red Shirt protesters .
Soldiers were also seen shooting sporadically as they entered the northwest edge of the park .
The large show of force appeared to be the beginning of a large military operation to root out remaining protesters two days after a government - issued deadline expired with many Red Shirts still holding ground .
" This will be the last operation by the government , " Thai senator Lertrat Ratanavanich said on local television .
" It is impossible to avoid the loss . "
The prime minister 's office issued a statement blaming the crackdown on failed talks between the two sides .
" Negotiations failed because core ( opposition ) leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves , " the statement said , alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters .
" ( We ) ask core leaders to stop the rally and surrender . "
A government statement read on Thai television announced that the operation will continue throughout the day and sought to assure residents that security officers were working to secure their safety .
" The Royal Thai government would like to inform the residents of Bangkok that today the security officers will operate in several areas to secure a perimeter , " the statement said .
" We are going to make sure that within the perimeter security and safety will be provided to the public . "
Earlier Wednesday a CNN correspondent positioned on a building overlooking the park said it appeared that most of the protesters had dispersed by the time the troops entered around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday ( 9:30 p.m. Tuesday ET ) .
The park had been housing as many as 5,000 protesters just a day earlier .
At least four people were injured in the initial crackdown , medical officials said .
Several hundred troops began amassing just as dawn broke over the city .
It was the largest movement of forces since clashes broke out last Thursday between opposition protesters and government security officials .
The troops , many of whom were armed , were seen walking in a long column and carrying razor wire and fire extinguishers near the park where the protesters have been launching demonstrations .
Armored personnel carriers also were spotted near the protest site , and gunfire could be heard nearby .
A large plume of black smoke billowed into the sky from one of three large tire fires the opposition was using as shields .
A bank building was also reported to be on fire on the main road where protesters and security forces have traded gunfire for the past six days .
Meanwhile at the main staging area in the middle of the park , opposition operations apparently continued as normal with speeches going on , music being played and leaders telling protesters they can stay as they please , even while saying they want to continue negotiations with the government .
Local television reports said protesters were being told to seek shelter at a nearby temple if they were concerned about the growing troop presence .
At least 36 people have been killed since clashes intensified Thursday .
The violence prompted the United Nations ' top human rights official to implore anti-government protesters and government officials to resume talks .
Satit Wongnongtoey , the Thai prime minister 's office spokesman , said negotiations can be held when the opposition , the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship , ends its protest .

" I can confirm that the government has always wanted to talk , but it has been let down by the UDD , due to the intervention of a mastermind abroad , " said Satit , who did n't identify the person .
The opposition members , also known as Red Shirts , support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a 2006 bloodless military coup .
The capital was notably calmer Tuesday .
But after more than five days of violent standoffs , debris and piles of tires littered battle - scarred streets , and the sound of gunfire still regularly punctuated the air .
Police spokesman Col. Songphol Wattanachai told reporters Tuesday that police had seized 9,021 tires from the city 's streets .
Burning tires have been used by protesters to create shields of black smoke during recent clashes .
Songphol said police had arrested and were interrogating a Red Shirt protester who was a close aide to Maj .
Gen. Khattiya Sawatdiphol , better known as Seh Daeng -- a renegade leader of a violent anti-government faction who died this week after being shot in the head by a sniper .
As troops continued their crackdown on protesters , Amnesty International criticized the government 's approach .
Timeline of Thailand 's political crisis
Benjamin Zawacki , the organization 's Thailand specialist , told CNN that 35 of the people killed since Thursday were unarmed , including a 17 - year - old boy and two medics .
" Our concern is that the government is using live ammunition or live rounds preemptively , rather than as a last resort , and using them against persons who are unarmed and present no credible threat to the soldiers or anyone else , " he said .
i Report : Video sparks discussion
But government officials maintained that they were following rules of engagement .
Troops only use live bullets when first attacked by terrorists with war weapons , Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd told reporters .
Two main groups of anti-government demonstrators have been demanding that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections : the Red Shirts , whose leaders claim that protesters are peaceful , and the Black Shirts , who advocate a more violent approach .
What are the protests about ?
The government ordered all demonstrators to leave their protest site by 3 p.m. Monday , but thousands continued to hold their ground .
" As the latest government deadline passes , there is a high risk that the situation could spiral out of control , " UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Monday .
i Report : Tending to a sniper wound
" To prevent further loss of life , I appeal to the protesters to step back from the brink , and the security forces to exercise maximum restraint in line with the instructions given by the government .
Ultimately , this situation can only be resolved by negotiation . "
The Ministry of Public Health reported that 65 people have died and more than 1,000 have been wounded since the Red Shirt anti-government protesters began flooding the streets of Bangkok on March 12 to demand new elections .

Immediately after the DOW plunged 999 points last Thursday , explanations started coming fast and furious .
It was a " fat finger error ! . "
Some idiot typed " billion " into a sell order when he meant " million " !
Then , when that explanation was debunked , the crash was blamed on all sorts of other computer glitches ( stocks trading at a penny ! ) .
Then it was blamed on high - frequency traders .
And so on .
And now Congress has called hearings to investigate , so surely they 'll get to the bottom of it .
Except that we already know the real reason the market crashed : Because , for a panicked 15 - 20 minutes , people stopped buying stocks .
Why did they stop buying stocks ?
Because , among other fundamental concerns , the market was in freefall .
That fact would make a lot of sane folks hesitate before hitting the " BUY " button , especially with Europe imploding , the US recovery disappointing the bulls , and stocks already at least 25 % overvalued .
But do n't take our word for it .
Read some words describing what happened in OTHER market crashes .
Because the way the market behaved on Thursday is how the market usually behaves under such circumstances .
Buyers disappearing ?
Stocks trading for absurdly low prices ?
That 's just how markets crash .
Here are John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Russell , as quoted by fund manager John Hussman .
JKG is writing about the crash of 1929 , Russell about the the aftermath of the ' 73 - 74 crash .
Note that there was no " electronic trading " in those days .
" Of all the mysteries of the stock exchange there is none so impenetrable as why there should be a buyer for everyone who seeks to sell .
October 24 , 1929 showed that what is mysterious is not inevitable .
Often there were no buyers , and only after wide vertical declines could anyone be induced to bid ...
Repeatedly and in many issues there was a plethora of selling orders and no buyers at all .
The stock of White Sewing Machine Company , which had reached a high of 48 in the months preceding , had closed at 11 on the night before .
During the day someone had the happy idea of entering a bid for a block of stock at a dollar a share .
In the absence of any other bid he got it . "
John Kenneth Galbraith , 1955 , The Great Crash
" I started accumulating stocks in December of ' 74 and January of ' 75 .
One stock that I wanted to buy was General Cinema , which was selling at a low of 10 .
On a whim I told my broker to put in an order for 500 GCN at 5 .
My broker said , ' Look , Dick , the price is 10 , you 're putting in a crazy bid . '
I said ' Try it . '
Evidently , some frightened investor put in an order to ' sell GCN at the market ' and my bid was the only bid .
I got the stock at 5 . "

Of course , the Mail ( and so many other vehicles ) reports the story with a slightly different take :
“ Crop circle hiding ‘ beautiful ’ maths formula appears in rape seed field
An extraordinary crop circle based on the ‘ world ’s most beautiful maths theorem ’ has appeared in a field next to a windmill in Wiltshire .
The complex disc , which measures 300ft across , appeared to the east of Wilton Windmill near Marlborough in a blazing yellow rape seed field .
It appeared on Saturday [ May 23 ] just 25 miles from another circle that popped up a fortnight ago by the Iron Age hill fort of Old Sarum . ”
They quote Lucy Pringle , who says that “ Working from the centre outwards , people are suggesting it has a connection to Leonhard Euler ‘s theorem e^( i ) pi+1=0 which is thought to be one of the most beautiful theorems in mathematics . ”
What they did n’t quote was who first suggested this decoding , and as Greg Taylor remarked on UfoUpdates , it was Daily Grail editor Richard Andrews ( “ Grailseeker ” ) .
This is important not only for crediting where credit is due , but because Andrews explains how he decoded the formation .
It was simply a matter of decoding the radial lines : starting from the center , notice how each have 8 bars going either up or down .
This can be interpreted as an 8 - bit binary code , not unlike the kind of barcode used for mail in the US and other countries .
And 8 - bits can be always interpreted as encoding ASCII characters , especially when we have previous formations using ASCII .
And that ’s how you get the message “ e ^( hi ) pi ) 1=0 ” .
Click the image below for a nice animation by Andrews explaining the decoding :
Now , as Andrews explains , “ e ^( hi ) pi ) 1=0 ” is not exactly Euler ’s identity , which can be written as “ e ^ ( ( i ) pi ) +1=0 ” .
He suggests this was intentional : Planck found in ‘ Euler ’s Identity ’ Crop Circle ?!
“ One thing bothered me though , and that was the inclusion of the anomalous ‘ h’ in the message / formula .
Certainly , with the absent ‘+’ , it made up the number of characters to twelve , which would make the crop circle easier to produce on the ground and more windmill - like , as well as referencing a highly symbolic number .
More significantly though , with the adjacent ‘ i ’ , it reads ‘ hi‘ – an embedded message from the maker perhaps ?
It was only when Jim Gilliland suggested in this Facebook thread that ‘h’ could be a reference to the Planck constant , taking us from the world of maths into the world of physics , that I realised what could be the full meaning of the embedded message .
Could the makers have left a ‘ Planck ’ in the design as a subtle joke on all the croppies who might pronounce this a ‘ genuine ’ crop circle as opposed to a circle made with a plank ? ! ”
It would be an elegant Trojan Horse joke by the circlemakers .
It would not be the first time , the 1991 Milk Hill script can also be decoded with a very humorous message ( which you can read on ‘ The Field Guide ’ ) .
And perhaps even more elegant because it can also be interpreted as an error : there ’s only one flipped bit between the ascii code for ‘ h’=01101000 and the correct ‘( ’=00101000 .
Flipping the bit happens in the best families .
Now , could this be a deliberate error ?
Notice how even if they did n’t flip the bit , the formula equation would still be incorrect because it ’s missing a ‘+’ , as Andrews noticed .
A mathematician would be quick to point out how this missing plus sign is perhaps one the most important parts of the equation , because that means that transcendental numbers and the imaginary unit can equal a number as comprehensible as a negative integer –1 .
The correct equation “ e ^( ( i ) pi ) + 1=0 ” takes 13 characters .
Could it be encoded in 12 ?
Yes , you could also write the equation as “ e^( i * pi ) + 1=0 ” , for instance .
Why would the circlemakers choose a deliberately wrong rendition of the “ most beautiful theorem in mathematics ” *?
Another error ?
Perhaps , but this could also be interpreted as part of the joke , a blatantly clear message that this is no perfect message .
If for nothing else , it should be clear that intergalactic aliens would hardly use the ASCII code established in 1968 , with a mathematical notation of parenthesis , Euler ’s number , the imaginary unit and even how one would write the Greek letter ‘ pi ’ in roman characters , just the way one would enter such equation in Google .
A clear message that the only mystery here is that created by humans , for humans .
With a Plan( c ) k , perhaps .
– – –
* As Max Reinhold Jahnke points out , “ this expression is known as Euler ’s identity , Euler ’s theorem is another thing ( there are several of them , the most famous refers to algebra / number theory ) .
It ’s also not correct to call it a formula , since it only has constantes . = ) ” .

Fearful cries welled up from animal and man alike .
The lions threw themselves at the bars of their cage as the flames raced up the central beam to the canvas above us .
It was all I could do not to laugh when the clowns ran .
It was an effort I lost when I saw that one of them was a midget .
The strongman shook his head , trying to clear it of the blow Iâd knocked him down with .
I donât mean to imply that Iâm a prize - fighter here ; he had absolutely pummeled me before I landed that shot .
Every inch of exposed flesh swelled with the dull ache of rising bruises , and I was pretty sure Iâd lost my front left canine in his knuckle .
But eventually he stopped .
Eventually he left me for dead , figuring that the puddle of oozing meat beneath his boot - heel couldnât possibly hold any semblance of life .
And so I seized my opportunity .
But here he was now , coming around , and I was again trying to take in enough oxygen to ignite the kerosene in my mouth before he could reach me .
He strode forward in purposeful , furious bounds , and just before his arcing roundhouse connected , I tossed the lighter up into the air between us .
His blow connected , and the contents of my mouth exploded outwards .
The abrupt trauma caused my perception of time to slow temporarily : I saw the first shining droplet contact the flickering lighterâs flame ; the tiny , almost imperceptible explosion soon mirrored a dozen times over ; a hundred ; a thousand .
As the fireball engulfed the two of us , I embraced the baffled strongman and put my lips to his ear .
â For Dio , â  I whispered .
" Dio " is the fourth most common word heard just before death .
The other three are " Oh shit , it's . "
*** Coffee .
My mouth tasted like coffee and a little bit like cheese Danish , probably because it was full of coffee and a little bit of cheese Danish .
The constant , clattering rattle of my fellow office workers typing was somehow amplified and made hollow , bouncing off the walls of my cubicle .
One half of my hand was asleep , split down the middle vertically :
The ring and pinky fingers gone numb .
Something about the height at which I held my mouse did that , I presumed .
I fumbled it over and closed Firefox .
I swallowed my coffee ; it was the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life .
â Shit , â  I mumbled in shock .
â Whatâs up , man ?
Everything OK?â 
Stanley , my friend in the cubicle opposite me , poked his head over the wall like the neighbor from

There are of course all kinds of reasons that people stop attending Church .
I ’m sure some people simply do n’t like it or do n’t care all that much .
And of course , the people who got offended by something ( we hear about these people in Sunday School all the time ) .
But there are also a great many people who want to believe , or do n’t really know what they believe , who perhaps care a lot , but find certain aspects of the institutional church or church culture too difficult or painful .
And of course there are quite a number of people who after careful and heartfelt soul searching find they simply do not believe .
For the most part , in current Mormon parlance people who no longer go to church on a regular basis , usually qualify their Mormonness somehow , “ I was raised Mormon ” “ I used to be Mormon ” or “ I ’m not active . ”
It has long been bandied about the bloggrnacle the idea that many cultural Mormons wish to / should be able to embrace their Mormonism in much the way that Jews identify as Jews regardless of their ‘ activity ’ status .
I ’m generally in favor of this , as I know all kinds of “ not active ” Mormons who are just so thoroughly Mormon in their world outlook that it seems awkward or not truish or something to call them ‘ former ’ or ‘ ex ’ or whatever .
I guess for many saying “ I ’m a cultural Mormon ” pretty much covers it .
But I was just listening to the Mormon Stories podcast of Richard Bushman ( author of Joseph Smith bio Rough Stone Rolling ) in which they discuss some of the more difficult aspects of Brother Joseph at great length , and he had this whole different approach to the idea that I found fascinating .
Toward the end , Bushman discusses his view that people who encounter a lot of problems , who do n’t know quite what they believe anymore , or who are perhaps angry and want to dump the prophet , for whatever reason they feel like they are not ‘ in ’ the church anymore , that it does n’t work that way .
He thinks that Mormonism is more than just the institutional church and the churchy busy work we do .
But rather that Mormonism is all the souls , all the individuals struggling and searching for what is right and good and true within the overall Mormon context .
And people who struggle , who are obsessed with these questions , even people who might be considered antagonists , show a kind a devotion .
So long as they are sincerely searching for what they think is right ( and not tying to harm anyone ) , and they are doing so within the context of Mormonism , studying Joseph Smith or whatever , they they ca n’t be outside of Mormonism , because they are in the cultural boundaries of Mormonism .
Then he mentions something he ’d like to see discussed and I did too ( and we ’re good at that discussion thing here ) , about what happens to a person , morally and spiritually , after going through a struggle over Joseph Smith and the Gospel ( or whatever church thing threw you for a loop ) .
If Mormon faith does n’t / has n’t yet work out for you , where do you go ?
So if this describes you , if you ’re no longer active and / or Mormon and you feel like sharing :
How your spiritual focus change ?
Is God still a part of your life ?
Do you pray ?
Did you perhaps become more Christ centered ?
Or did you become atheist / agnostic ?
Did you go through a period of or give up entirely on living Mormon standards ( drinking smoking tithing ‘n stuff like ) ?
How much is Mormonism still a part of who you are and how you think ? ( because you would n’t be reading this if it were n’t non at all )
Is there a statute of limitations on citizenship ?
Afrikaners in South Africa may soon find out .
Three hundred years after their forefathers left Europe for a new life in Cape Town , some Afrikaners are lobbying the Dutch government to grant them citizenship .
The descendants of the Boer settlers are looking for an exit plan .
They say white people have become targets of crime with tensions rising since the murder of right - wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging ( AWB ) leader Eugene Terreblanche last month .
They want the Dutch authorities to enact a " Jus Sanguinis " or right of blood law allowing Afrikaners to return to what they claim is their original home .
After the end of apartheid in 1994 , many white South Africans fled the country fearing a racial backlash .
Many emigrated to Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the US , and the United Kingdom .
A recent report by the South African Institute on Race Relations said nearly 800,000 whites had left during that period , citing employment discrimination and the high crime rate .
South Africa sees an average of 50 murders a day – most of the victims are black .
The emerging Afrikaner " Right of Return " campaign echoes the concerns of 1994 , and is indicative of a rising fear among some white farmers .
The effort is being co-ordinated by Lara Johnstone , who claims South Africa is heading down the path taken by Zimbabwe with whites bearing the brunt of economic and civic collapse .
“ I do n’t know whether it will be five years , 10 years or whenever – it depends on the Malema factor , " said said , referring to Julius Malema , the African National Congress youth leader who was fined $ 1,300 last week for singing a song that urged ANC members to “ shoot the Boers . ”
" But I think we are going to become another Zimbabwe . "
Ms. Johnstone traces her Afrikaans heritage to the Bosmans who left Amsterdam for the Cape in 1707 .
Her Facebook - led campaign has so far attracted nearly 600 members .
Many of her members are also supporting an online petition for South African Brandon Huntley , who prompted a diplomatic spat after applying for asylum in Canada on the basis of racial persecution here .
Johnstone 's site also explains how to apply for Dutch citizenship .
But for most , the chances of receiving Dutch citizenship are almost non-existent , say Dutch officials and analysts .
Johnstone , who lives in George in the Western Cape , says many whites are fearful for the future .
“ Like a lot of people I ca n’t afford to emigrate so my options are limited .
When I speak to people it feels like we ’re between a rock and a hard place with little room to maneuver .
I think Western Europe does have a duty of care towards white South Africans because most of us come from there originally .
Because of our Dutch heritage , I think we should be allowed to return there . "
No Rainbow Nation
“ I ’m not sure people in Britain , Holland , or the US appreciate what is happening here towards whites because they still believe in the Rainbow Nation and everything ’s fine .
But it ’s not , " Johnstone said .
Johnstone says she 's not a racist .
" I was married to an African / American for 13 years and do n’t have any problem with black people , Chinese people or whoever .
What I have a problem with is violent people who burn people with irons for their cell phones , ” says Johnstone , an environmentalist who sells gear to grow worms for composting .
She has written to the Dutch consulate in Cape Town , the Dutch royal family , and prominent members of the Dutch parliament , including controversial Geert Wilders , leader of the right - wing Party for Freedom ( PVV ) .
Mr. Wilders wants to see the end of Islamic influence in Holland and across Western Europe and a halt to non-Western immigration into the country .
His spokesman says the white - haired leader is too busy on the campaign trail for next month ’s general election to comment on the citizenship issue .
But another Dutch member of parliament , Kees van der Staaij , chairman of the conservative - Protestant Staatkundig - Gereformeerde Party ( SGP ) , responded to the Johnstone 's emailed questions .
“ The violence against whites in South Africa is a large problem .
If they are targeted by violence , they should also be accepted as asylum - seekers in the Netherlands , ” Mr. Van der Staaij wrote .
He said The Netherlands has " a very special responsibility towards the often very religious South Africans of Dutch descent ... if those people do not feel safe in their own country and want to settle here in The Netherlands , our country should consider those requests with a positive approach . ”
There 's been no official response to Johnstone 's campaign from The Netherlands government .
No return likely
Jan Rath , a professor of sociology at the Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies at the University of Amsterdam , says that the Right of Return campaign has little chance of success .
“ It is quite unlikely that the government would want to change the rules that would make it easier for the descendants of old Boer settlers to ‘ return ’ to their ‘ patria ’ , ” he says .
“ They are regarded as foreign citizens and treated accordingly .
The very fact that they are descendants of Dutch citizens or returnees from a former colonial area is seen as totally irrelevant .
“ The bottom line is that the government would not be willing to make an exception to the quite firm rule that all foreign citizens should be treated as foreign citizens .
In the light of the fact that the Netherlands has been pursuing a restrictive immigration regime , the Afrikaners have no other option than solving the situation in their own country or moving to another one . ”
There are around 5 million white people in South Africa ( out of a total population of 50 million ) with most either having an Afrikaans or English heritage .
Many with English descendants have access to British passports .
But the Afrikaner population does not , prompting president Jacob Zuma last year to say : “ Of all the white groups that are in South Africa , it is only the Afrikaners that are truly South Africans in the true sense of the word . ”
Many of the farmers here are white and Afrikaans .
With an estimated 3,000 killed in farm attacks since 1994 , some of the remaining 40,000 are fearful .
RELATED STORIES :
The German intelligence officials responsible for one of the most important informants on Saddam Hussein ’s suspected weapons of mass destruction say that the Bush administration and the CIA repeatedly exaggerated his claims during the run-up to the war in Iraq .
Five senior officials from Germany ’s Federal Intelligence Service , or BND , said in interviews with The Times that they warned U.S. intelligence authorities that the source , an Iraqi defector code - named Curveball , never claimed to produce germ weapons and never saw anyone else do so .
According to the Germans , President Bush mischaracterized Curveball ’s information when he warned before the war that Iraq had at least seven mobile factories brewing biological poisons .
Then - Secretary of State Colin L. Powell also misstated Curveball ’s accounts in his prewar presentation to the United Nations on Feb. 5 , 2003 , the Germans said .
Curveball ’s German handlers for the last six years said his information was often vague , mostly secondhand and impossible to confirm .
“ This was not substantial evidence , ” said a senior German intelligence official .
“ We made clear we could not verify the things he said . ”
The German authorities , speaking about the case for the first time , also said that their informant suffered from emotional and mental problems .
“ He is not a stable , psychologically stable guy , ” said a BND official who supervised the case .
“ He is not a completely normal person , ” agreed a BND analyst .
Curveball was the chief source of inaccurate prewar U.S. accusations that Baghdad had biological weapons , a commission appointed by Bush reported this year .
The commission did not interview Curveball , who still insists his story was true , or the German officials who handled his case .
The German account emerges as the White House is lashing out at domestic critics , particularly Senate Democrats , over allegations the administration manipulated intelligence to go to war .
Last week , Vice President Dick Cheney called such claims reprehensible and pernicious .
In Congress , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is resuming its long - stalled investigation of the administration ’s use of prewar intelligence .
Committee members said last week that the Curveball case would be a key part of their review .
House Democrats are calling for a similar inquiry .
An investigation by The Times based on interviews since May with about 30 current and former intelligence officials in the U.S. , Germany , England , Iraq and the United Nations , as well as other experts , shows that U.S. bungling in the Curveball case was worse than official reports have disclosed .
The White House , for example , ignored evidence gathered by United Nations weapons inspectors shortly before the war that disproved Curveball ’s account .
Bush and his aides issued increasingly dire warnings about Iraq ’s biological weapons before the war even though intelligence from Curveball had not changed in two years .
At the Central Intelligence Agency , officials embraced Curveball ’s account even though they could not confirm it or interview him until a year after the invasion .
They ignored multiple warnings about his reliability before the war , punished in - house critics who provided proof that he had lied and refused to admit error until May 2004 , 14 months after the invasion .
After the CIA vouched for Curveball ’s accounts , Bush declared in his 2003 State of the Union speech that Iraq had “ mobile biological weapons labs ” designed to produce “ germ warfare agents . ”
Bush cited the mobile germ factories in at least four prewar speeches and statements , and other world leaders repeated the charge .
Powell also highlighted Curveball ’s “ eyewitness ” account when he warned the United Nations Security Council on the eve of war that Iraq ’s mobile labs could brew enough weapons - grade microbes “ in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people . ”
The senior BND officer who supervised Curveball ’s case said he was aghast when he watched Powell misstate Curveball ’s claims as a justification for war .
“ We were shocked , ” the official said .
“ Mein Gott !
We had always told them it was not proven ....
It was not hard intelligence . ”
In a telephone interview , Powell said that George J. Tenet , then the director of central intelligence , and his top deputies personally assured him before his U.N. speech that U.S. intelligence on the mobile labs was “ solid . ”
Since then , Powell said , the case “ has totally blown up in our faces . ”
Many officials interviewed for this report , including the German intelligence officers , spoke on the condition they not be identified because they were bound by secrecy agreements , were not authorized to speak to the news media or because the case involved classified sources and methods .
Curveball lives under an assumed name in southern Germany .
The BND has given him a furnished apartment , language lessons and a stipend generous enough that he does not need to work .
His wife has emigrated from Iraq , and they have an infant daughter .
The BND has relocated him twice because of concerns that his life was in danger .
They still watch him closely .
“ He is difficult to integrate ” into local society , said a BND operations officer .
“ We are still busy with him . ”
Curveball could not be interviewed for this report .
BND officials threatened last summer to strip him of his salary , housing and protection if he agreed to meet with The Times .
“ We told him , ‘ If you talk to anyone on the outside ... you are out and you get no more help from us , ’ ” the BND supervisor said .
CIA officials now concede that the Iraqi fused fact , research he gleaned on the Internet and what his former co-workers called “ water cooler gossip ” into a nightmarish fantasy that played on U.S. fears after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Curveball ’s motive , CIA officials said , was not to start a war .
He simply was seeking a German visa .
German journey
The Curveball chronicle began in November 1999 , when the dark - haired Iraqi in his late 20s flew into Munich ’s Franz Josef Strauss Airport with a tourist visa .
The Baghdad - born chemical engineer promptly applied for political asylum in Arabic and halting English .
He told German immigration officials he had embezzled Iraqi government money and faced prison or worse if sent home .
The Germans sent him to Zirndorf , a refugee center near Nuremberg once used for Soviet defectors , where he joined a long line of Iraqi exiles seeking German visas .
Abruptly , his story changed .
He once led a team , he told BND officers , that equipped trucks to brew deadly bio-agents .
He named six sites where Iraq might be hiding biological warfare vehicles .
Three already were operating .
A farm program to boost crop yields was cover for Iraq ’s new biological weapons production program , he said .
Germany provided Europe ’s most generous benefits to Iraqi refugees , and several hundred arrived each month .
But few had useful credible intelligence on Baghdad ’s suspected weapons programs .
Intelligence agents became accustomed to exaggerated claims .
“ The Iraqis were adept at feeding us what we wanted to hear , ” said a former official of the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency who helped debrief about 50 Iraqi emigres in Germany before the war .
“ Most of it was garbage . ’'
But for this defector , the Germans assigned two case officers as well as a team of chemists , biologists and other experts .
They debriefed him from January 2000 to September 2001 .
Since the Iraqi had arrived in Munich , U.S. liaison with German intelligence was assigned to the local DIA team .
Their clandestine operating base was an elegant 19th century mansion known as Munich House .
There he was assigned his codename : Curveball .
The base cryptonym “ ball ” was used to signify weapons , two former U.S. intelligence officials said .
An earlier informant in Germany , for example , was called Matchball .
In DIA files , Iraqi sources were listed as “ red ” if U.S. intelligence could interview them .
Curveball was a “ blue ” source , meaning the Germans would not permit U.S. access to him .
Curveball said he hated Americans , the Germans explained .
As a result , the DIA -- like the BND -- never tried to check Curveball ’s background or verify his accounts before sending reports to other U.S. intelligence agencies .
Despite that failure , CIA analysts accepted the incoming reports as credible and quickly passed them to senior policymakers .
The reports had problems , however .
The Germans usually interviewed Curveball in Arabic , using a translator , although the Iraqi sometimes spoke English .
“ But a case officer wants to speak directly to his source , ” said the senior BND officer .
“ Curveball began to learn German , and thus there was a big mix [ of languages ] that went on .
This explains some of the confusion . ”
It got worse , like a children ’s game of “ telephone , ” in which information gets increasingly distorted .
The BND sent German summaries of their English and Arabic interview reports to Munich House and to British intelligence .
The DIA team translated the German back to English and prepared its own summaries .
Those went to DIA ’s directorate for human intelligence , at a high - rise office in Clarendon , Va .
Clarendon passed 95 DIA reports to the Weapons Intelligence , Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center , known as WINPAC , at CIA headquarters in nearby Langley .
Experts there called other specialists , including an independent laboratory , to help evaluate the data .
Spy satellites were directed to focus on Curveball ’s sites .
CIA artists prepared detailed drawings from Curveball ’s crude sketches .
The system led to confusion , not clarity .
“ Analysts were studying drawings made by artists working from descriptions by a guy we could n’t talk to , ” explained a former senior CIA official who helped supervise the case and the postwar investigation .
“ It was hard to figure out . ”
“ Our fear is that as it was analyzed and translated and reanalyzed and retranslated , and comments got added , it could have gotten sexed up by accident , ” agreed a former CIA operations official .
The British Secret Intelligence Service , known as MI6 , blamed the BND for omitting what a Parliamentary inquiry called “ significant detail ” in the reports they sent to London .
At issue were Curveball ’s trucks .
In an e-mail to The Times , Robin Butler , head of the British inquiry into prewar intelligence , said “ incomplete reporting ” by the BND misled the British to assume the trucks could produce weapons - grade bio-agents such as anthrax spores .
But Curveball only spoke of producing a liquid slurry unsuitable for bombs or warheads .
At the CIA , bio - warfare experts viewed the defector ’s reports as sophisticated and technically feasible .
They also matched the analysts ’ expectations .
After the 1991 Gulf War , U.N. inspectors struggled to unravel Baghdad ’s secret biological weapons program .
They speculated that the regime produced germs in mobile factories to evade detection .
American U - 2 spy planes looked for suspicious vehicles , and U.N. teams raided parking lots .
In 1994 , acting on tips from Israeli intelligence , U.N. inspectors even stopped red-and - white trucks in Baghdad marked : “ Tip Top Ice Cream . ”
Inside they found ice cream .
“ We thought they could easily transport other materials around , ” said Rolf Ekeus , who headed the U.N. inspectors from 1991 to 1997 .
Finally , in mid-1995 , Iraq officials admitted that before the Gulf War they had secretly produced 30,000 liters of anthrax , botulinum toxin , aflatoxin and other lethal bio-agents .
They had deployed hundreds of germ - filled munitions and researched other deadly diseases for military use .
They denied they ever had mobile production facilities .
Curveball ’s story to the Germans in 2000 and 2001 neatly dovetailed with that history and continuing CIA suspicions .
The Iraqi defector said he was recruited out of engineering school at Baghdad University in 1994 by Iraq ’s Military Industrial Commission , headed by Saddam Hussein ’s son - in - law Hussein Kamil .
He said he went to work the following year for “ Dr. Germ , ” British - trained microbiologist Rihab Rashid Taha , to build bio - warfare vehicles .
Kamil and Taha had headed the pre-1991 bio-weapons program .
Curveball said he was assigned to the Chemical Engineering and Design Center , behind the Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad .
That also fit a pattern , as the center provided a cover story for Iraq ’s first bio - warfare program .
Curveball said he had helped assemble one truck - mounted germ factory in 1997 at Djerf al Nadaf , a tumble - down cluster of warehouses in a gritty industrial area 10 miles southeast of Baghdad .
He helped the Germans build a scale model of the facility , showing how vehicles were hidden in a two - story building -- and how they entered and exited on either end .
He designed laboratory equipment for the trucks , he said , providing dimensions , temperature ranges and other details .
He sketched diagrams of how the system operated , and identified more than a dozen co-workers .
But the story had holes .
“ His information to us was very vague , ” said the senior German intelligence official .
“ He could not say if these things functioned , if they worked . ”
Curveball also said he could not identify what microbes the trucks were designed to produce .
“ He did n’t know ... whether it was anthrax or not , ” said the BND supervisor .
“ He had nothing to do with actual production of [ a biological ] agent .
He was in the equipment testing phase .
And the equipment worked . ”
David Kay , who read the Curveball file when he headed the CIA ’s search for hidden weapons in 2003 , said Curveball ’s accounts were maddeningly murky .
“ He was not in charge of trucks or production , ” Kay said .
“ He had nothing to do with actual production of biological agent .
He never saw them actually produce [ an ] agent . ”
But the CIA and the White House overlooked the holes in the story .
In a February 2003 radio address and statement , Bush warned that “ first - hand witnesses have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile factories ” for germ warfare .
With these , Bush said , “ Iraq could produce within just months hundreds of pounds of biological poisons . ”
Curveball had told the Germans that Taha ’s team planned to build mobile factories at six sites across Iraq , from Numaniyah in the south to Tikrit in the north .
But he visited only Djerf al Nadaf , he said .
His information about the other sites , he told the Germans , was second - hand .
Flawed witness
Curveball ’s reports were highly valued in Washington because the CIA had no Iraqi spies with access to weapons programs at the time .
One detail particularly impressed the CIA : Curveball ’s report of a 1998 germ weapons accident at Djerf al Nadaf .
Powell cited the incident in his prewar U.N. speech .
An “ eyewitness ” was “ at the site ” when an accident occurred , and 12 technicians “ died from exposure to biological agents , ” Powell said .
Lawrence B. Wilkerson , then Powell ’s chief of staff , said senior CIA officials told Powell the “ principal source had not only worked in mobile labs but had seen an accident and had been injured in the accident ....
This gave more credibility to it . ”
But German intelligence officials said the CIA was wrong .
Curveball only “ heard rumors of an accident , ” the BND supervisor said .
“ He gave a third - hand account . ”
The incident led to the first questions inside the CIA about Curveball ’s credibility .
In May 2000 , the Germans allowed a doctor from the CIA ’s counter - proliferation branch to meet Curveball and draw a blood sample .
Antibodies in the blood could indicate if he had been exposed to anthrax or other unusual pathogens in the accident .
The medical tests were inconclusive , but the meeting was memorable .
The BND , insisting Curveball spoke no English and would not meet Americans , introduced the doctor as a German .
The CIA physician remained silent , because he was not fluent in German .
He was surprised , he later told others , that Curveball spoke “ excellent English ” to others in the room .
Moreover , Curveball was “ very emotional , very excitable , ” the doctor told one colleague .
And although it was early morning , Curveball smelled of liquor and looked “ very sick ” from a stiff hangover .
German intelligence officials said Curveball did n’t have a drinking problem .
But they had other concerns .
Like many defectors , Curveball at first seemed eager to please .
He thanked his new friends and laughed at their jokes .
He was charming and clearly intelligent , providing complex engineering details .
But as the questions intensified , Curveball grew moody and irritable .
His memory began to fail .
He confused places and dates .
He fretted about his personal safety , about his parents and wife in Baghdad , and about his future in Germany .
“ He was between two worlds , sometimes cooperative , sometimes aggressive , ” said the BND supervisor .
“ He was not an easy - going guy . ”
Curveball largely ceased cooperating in 2001 after he was granted asylum , officials said .
He would refuse to meet for days , and then weeks , at a time .
He also increasingly asked for money .
“ He knew he was important , ” said the BND analyst .
“ He was not an idiot . ”
Defectors are often problem sources .
Viewed as traitors back home , many embellish their stories to gain favor with spy services .
In the shadow world of intelligence , Curveball ’s inability or reluctance to provide many details actually helped convince analysts he was telling the truth .
Had Curveball claimed expertise with biological weapons or direct access to other secret programs , said the BND analyst , “ It would be easier to assume he was lying . ”
A former British official involved with the case said Curveball ’s behavior should be seen through another lens .
He is convinced that Curveball was under intense stress , terrified both that his visa scam would be exposed , and that his lies would be used to start a war .
“ He must have been scared out of his mind , ” he said .
But concerns about Curveball ’s reliability were growing .
In early 2001 , the CIA ’s Berlin station chief sent a message to headquarters noting that a BND official had complained that the Iraqi was “ out of control , ” and could n’t be located , Senate investigators found .
MI6 cabled the CIA that British intelligence “ is not convinced that Curveball is a wholly reliable source ” and that “ elements of [ his ] behavior strike us as typical of ... fabricators , ’' the presidential commission reported .
British intelligence also warned that spy satellite images taken in 1997 when Curveball claimed to be working at Djerf al Nadaf conflicted with his descriptions .
The photos showed a wall around most of the main warehouse , clearly blocking trucks from getting in or out .
U.S. and German officials feared that Ahmad Chalabi had coached Curveball after the defector said his brother had worked as a bodyguard for the controversial Iraqi exile leader .
But they found no evidence .
Curveball “ had very little contact with his [ bodyguard ] brother , ” the BND supervisor said .
“ They are not close . ’'
More problematic were the three sources the CIA said had corroborated Curveball ’s story .
Two had ties to Chalabi .
All three turned out to be frauds .
The most important , a former major in the Iraqi intelligence service , was deemed a liar by the CIA and DIA .
In May 2002 , a fabricator warning was posted in U.S. intelligence databases .
Powell said he was never warned , during three days of intense briefings at CIA headquarters before his U.N. speech , that he was using material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false .
“ As you can imagine , I was not pleased , ” Powell said .
“ What really made me not pleased was they had put out a burn notice on this guy , and people who were even present at my briefings knew it . ”
But BND officials said their U.S. colleagues repeatedly assured them Curveball ’s story had been corroborated .
“ They kept on telling us there were three or four sources , ” said the senior German intelligence official .
“ They said it many times . ”
Behind the scenes , the CIA stepped up pressure to interview Curveball .
The BND finally accepted a compromise in the fall of 2002 .
They let CIA analysts send questions , but they could not interview the Iraqi .
The frustration was intense at the CIA .
But it was n’t surprising .
Relations long have been rocky between the CIA and BND , officials in both spy services acknowledged .
The friction dates to the Cold War , when the BND complained it was treated as a second - class agency .
Spy services jealously guard their sources , and the BND was not obligated to share access to Curveball .
“ We would never let them see one of ours , ” said the former CIA operations officer .
Intelligence shift
Despite the lack of access or any new reports from Curveball , U.S. intelligence sharply upgraded its assessments of Iraq ’s biological weapons before the war .
The shift is reflected in declassified portions of National Intelligence Estimates , which are produced as the authoritative judgment of the 15 U.S. intelligence agencies .
In May 1999 , before Curveball defected , a national intelligence estimate on worldwide biological warfare programs said Iraq was “ probably continuing work to develop and produce BW [ bio - warfare ] agents , ” and could restart production in six months .
In December 2000 , after a year of Curveball ’s reports , another national intelligence estimate cautiously noted that “ new intelligence ” had caused U.S. intelligence “ to adjust our assessment upward ” and “ suggests Baghdad has expanded ’’ its bio-weapons program .
But the caveats disappeared after the Sept. 11 attacks and the still - unsolved mailing of anthrax - laced letters to several U.S. states .
Iraq “ continues to produce at least ... three BW agents ” and its mobile germ factories provide “ capabilities surpassing the pre-Gulf War era , ” the CIA weapons center warned in October 2001 .
The CIA followed up with a public White Paper and briefings for the White House and three Senate committees .
The CIA had n’t seen new intelligence on Iraq ’s germ weapons .
Instead , analysts had estimated what they believed would be the maximum output from seven mobile labs -- only one of which Curveball said he had seen -- operating nonstop or six months .
But even Curveball ’s description of a single lab was a fiction .
Similar misjudgments filled the most important prewar intelligence document , the National Intelligence Estimate issued in October 2002 .
It was sent to Congress days before lawmakers voted to authorize use of military force if Hussein refused to give up his illicit arsenal .
For the first time , the new estimate warned with “ high confidence ” that Iraq “ has now established large - scale , redundant and concealed BW agent production capabilities . ”
It said “ all key aspects ” of Iraq ’s offensive BW program “ are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War . ”
The assessment was based “ largely on information from a single source -- Curveball , ” the presidential commission concluded .
It was one of “ the most important and alarming ” judgments in the document , the panel added .
And it was utterly wrong .
A handful of bio-analysts in the weapons center , part of the CIA ’s intelligence directorate , controlled the Curveball reports and remained confident in their veracity .
But across the CIA bureaucracy , the clandestine service officers who usually handle defectors and other human sources were increasingly skeptical .
Tyler Drumheller , then the head of CIA spying in Europe , called the BND station chief at the German embassy in Washington in September 2002 seeking access to Curveball .
Drumheller and the station chief met for lunch at the German ’s favorite seafood restaurant in upscale Georgetown .
The German officer warned that Curveball had suffered a mental breakdown and was “ crazy , ” the now - retired CIA veteran recalled .
“ He said , first off , ‘ They wo n’t let you see him , ’ ” Drumheller said .
“ ‘ Second , there are a lot of problems .
Principally , we think he ’s probably a fabricator . ’ ”
The BND station chief , contacted by The Times during the summer , said he could not “ discuss any of this . ”
He has since been reassigned back to Germany .
His BND supervisors declined to discuss the lunch meeting .
Drumheller , a veteran of 26 years in the CIA clandestine service , said he and several aides repeatedly raised alarms after the lunch in tense exchanges with CIA analysts working on the Curveball case .
“ The fact is , there was a lot of yelling and screaming about this guy , ” said James Pavitt , then chief of clandestine services , who retired from the CIA in August 2004 .
“ My people were saying , ‘ We think he ’s a stinker . ’ ”
The analysts refused to back down .
In one meeting , the chief analyst fiercely defended Curveball ’s account , saying she had confirmed on the Internet many of the details he cited .
“ Exactly , it ’s on the Internet ! ” the operations group chief for Germany , now a CIA station chief in Europe , exploded in response .
“ That ’s where he got it too , ” according to a participant at the meeting .
Other warnings poured in .
The CIA Berlin station chief wrote that the BND had “ not been able to verify ” Curveball ’s claims .
The CIA doctor who met Curveball wrote to his supervisor shortly before Powell ’s speech questioning “ the validity ” of the Iraqi ’s information .
“ Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or did n’t say and the Powers That Be probably are n’t terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he ’s talking about , ” his supervisor wrote back , Senate investigators found .
The supervisor later told them he was only voicing his opinion that war appeared inevitable .
Tenet has denied receiving warnings that Curveball might be a fabricator .
He declined to be interviewed for this report .
Powell said that at the time he prepared for his U.N. speech in early 2003 , no one warned him of the debate inside the CIA over Curveball ’s credibility .
“ I was being as careful as I possibly could , ” he said .
Working from a CIA conference room adjoining CIA Director Tenet ’s seventh - floor office suite , Powell and his aides repeatedly challenged the credibility of CIA evidence -- including the mobile germ factories .
“ We pressed as hard as we could , and the CIA stood by it adamantly , ” Powell recalled .
“ This is one we really pressed on , really spent a lot time on ....
We knew how important it was . ”
No smoking gun
On Feb. 5 , 2003 , Powell told the packed U.N. chamber that his account was based on “ solid sources ” and “ facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence . ”
“ We thought maybe they had the smoking gun , ” recalled the BND supervisor , who watched Powell on TV .
“ My gut feeling was the Americans must have so much from reconnaissance planes and satellites , from infiltrated spotter teams from Special Forces , and other systems .
We thought they must have tons of stuff . ”
Instead , Powell emphasized Curveball ’s “ eyewitness ” account , calling it “ one of the most worrisome things that emerge from the thick intelligence file . ”
A congressional staffer on intelligence said she realized the case was weak when she saw Powell display CIA drawings of trucks but not photos .
“ A drawing is n’t evidence , ” she said .
“ It ’s hearsay . ”
Powell ’s speech failed to sway many diplomats , but it had an immediate impact in Baghdad .
“ The Iraqis scoured the country for trailers , ” said a former CIA official who helped interrogate Iraqi officials and scientists in U.S. custody after the war .
“ They were in real panic mode .
They were terrified that this was real , and they could n’t explain it . ”
An explanation was available within days , but U.S. officials ignored it .
On Feb. 8 , three days after Powell ’s speech , the U.N. 's Team Bravo conducted the first search of Curveball ’s former work site .
The raid by the American - led biological weapons experts lasted 3 1/2 hours .
It was long enough to prove Curveball had lied .
Djerf al Nadaf was on a dusty road lined with auto repair shops and small factories , near the former Tuwaitha nuclear facility and a sewage - filled tributary of the Tigris River .
Behind a high wall , a two - story grain silo adjoined the warehouse that Curveball had identified as the truck assembly facility .
“ That ’s the one where the mobile labs were supposed to be , ” said a former U.N. inspector who worked with the U.S. and other intelligence agencies .
“ That ’s the one we were interested in . ”
The doors were locked , so Boston microbiologist Rocco Casagrande climbed on a white U.N. vehicle , yanked open a metal flap in the wall , and crawled inside .
After scrambling over a huge pile of corn , he scraped two samples of residue from cracks in the cement floor , two more from holes in the wall and one from a discarded shower basin outside .
Back at the Canal Hotel that afternoon , he tested the samples for bacterial or viral DNA .
He was searching for any signs that germs were produced at the site or any traces of the 1998 bio-weapons accident .
Test results were all negative .
“ No threat agents detected , ” Casagrande wrote in his computer journal that night .
“ Got to climb on a jeep and crawl into buildings and play second - story man , but otherwise spent the day in the lab . ”
A British inspector , who had helped bring the intelligence file from New York , found another surprise .
Curveball had said the germ trucks could enter the warehouse from either end .
But there were no garage doors and a solid , 6 - foot - high wall surrounded most of the building .
The wall British intelligence saw in 1997 satellite photos clearly made impossible the traffic patterns Curveball had described .
U.N. teams also raided the other sites Curveball had named .
They interrogated managers , seized documents and used ground - penetrating radar , according to U.N. reports .
The U.N. inspectors “ could find nothing to corroborate Curveball ’s reporting , ” the CIA ’s Iraq Survey Group reported last year .
On March 7 , 2003 , Hans Blix , the chief U.N. inspector , told the Security Council that a series of searches had found “ no evidence ” of mobile biological production facilities in Iraq .
It drew little notice at the time .
The invasion of Iraq began two weeks later .
Phantom labs
Soon after U.S. troops entered Baghdad , the discovery of two trucks loaded with lab equipment in northern Iraq brought cheers to the CIA weapons center .
Curveball examined photos relayed to Germany and said that while he had n’t worked on the two trucks , equipment in the pictures looked like components he had installed at Djerf al Nadaf .
Days later , the CIA and DIA rushed to publish a White Paper declaring the trucks part of Hussein ’s biological warfare program .
The report dismissed Iraq ’s explanation that the equipment generated hydrogen as a “ cover story . ”
A day later , Bush told a Polish TV reporter : “ We found the weapons of mass destruction . ”
But bio-weapons experts in the intelligence community were sharply critical .
A former senior official of the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research called the unclassified report an unprecedented “ rush to judgment . ”
The DIA then ordered a classified review of the evidence .
One of 15 analysts held to the initial finding that the trucks were built for germ warfare .
The sole believer was the CIA analyst who helped draft the original White Paper .
Hamish Killip , a former British army officer and biological weapons expert , flew to Baghdad in July 2003 as part of the Iraq Survey Group , the CIA - led Iraqi weapons hunt .
He inspected the truck trailers and was immediately skeptical .
“ The equipment was singularly inappropriate ” for biological weapons , he said .
“ We were in hysterics over this .
You ’d have better luck putting a couple of dust bins on the back of the truck and brewing it in there . ”
The trucks were built to generate hydrogen , not germs , he said .
But the CIA refused to back down .
In March 2004 , Killip quit , protesting that the CIA was covering up the truth .
Rod Barton , an Australian intelligence officer and another bio-weapons expert , also quit over what he said was the CIA ’s refusal to admit error .
“ Of course the trailers had nothing to do with Curveball , ” Barton wrote in a recent e-mail .
The Iraq Survey Group ultimately agreed .
An “ exhaustive investigation ” showed the trailers could not “ be part of any BW program , ” it reported in October 2004 .
The now - discredited CIA White Paper remains on the agency ’s website .
A CIA spokesman said the report was posted because it was part of the historical record .
After U.S troops failed to find illicit Iraqi weapons in the days and weeks after the invasion , the CIA created the Iraq Survey Group to conduct a methodical search in June 2003 .
Tenet appointed Kay to head it .
The pugnacious Texan was convinced that Baghdad had hidden mobile germ factories .
Kay ’s teams returned to Djerf al Nadaf and other sites identified by Curveball .
One CIA - led unit investigated Curveball himself .
The leader was “ Jerry , ” a veteran CIA bio-weapons analyst who had championed Curveball ’s case at the CIA weapons center .
They found Curveball ’s personnel file in an Iraqi government storeroom .
It was devastating .
Curveball was last in his engineering class , not first , as he had claimed .
He was a low - level trainee engineer , not a project chief or site manager , as the CIA had insisted .
Most important , records showed Curveball had been fired in 1995 , at the very time he said he had begun working on bio - warfare trucks .
A former CIA official said Curveball also apparently was jailed for a sex crime and then drove a Baghdad taxi .
Jerry and his team interviewed 60 of Curveball ’s family , friends and co-workers .
They all denied working on germ weapons trucks .
Curveball ’s former bosses at the engineering center said the CIA had fallen for “ water cooler gossip ” and “ corridor conversations . ”
“ The Iraqis were all laughing , ” recalled a former member of the survey group .
“ They were saying , ‘ This guy ?
You ’ve got to be kidding . ’ ”
Jerry tracked down Curveball ’s Sunni Muslim parents in a middle - class Baghdad neighborhood .
“ Our guy was very polite , ” Kay recalled .
“ He said , ‘ We understand your son does n’t like Americans . ’
His mother looked shocked .
She said , ‘ No , no !
He loves Americans . ’
And she took him into [ her son ’s ] bedroom and it was filled with posters of American rock stars .
It was like any other teenage room .
She said one of his goals was to go to America . ”
The deeper Jerry probed , the worse Curveball looked .
Childhood friends called him a “ great liar ” and a “ con artist . ”
Another called him “ a real operator . ”
The team reported that “ people kept saying what a rat Curveball was . ”
Jerry and another CIA analyst abruptly broke off the investigation and took a military flight back to Washington .
Kay said Jerry appeared to be nearing a nervous breakdown .
“ They had been true believers in Curveball , ” Kay said .
“ They absolutely believed in him .
They knew every detail in his file .
But it was total hokum .
There was no truth in it .
They said they had to go home to explain how all this was all so wrong .
They wanted to fight the battle at the CIA . ”
Back home , senior CIA officials resisted .
Jerry was “ read the riot act ” and accused of “ making waves ” by his office director , according to the presidential commission .
He and his colleague ultimately were transferred out of the weapons center .
The CIA was “ very , very vindictive , ” Kay said .
Soon after , Jerry got in touch with Michael Scheuer , a CIA analyst who felt he had been sidelined for criticizing CIA counterterrorism tactics .
Scheuer would quit within a year .
“ Jerry had become kind of a nonperson , ” Scheuer recalled of their meeting .
“ There was a tremendous amount of pressure on him not to say anything .
Just to sit there and shut up . ”
A CIA spokeswoman confirmed the account , but declined to comment further .
Jerry still works at the CIA and could not be contacted for this report .
His former supervisor , reached at home , said she could not speak to the media .
“ What was done to them was wrong , ” said a former Pentagon official who investigated the case for the presidential commission .
“ But we did n’t see it so much as a cover - up as an expression of how profoundly resistant to recognizing mistakes the CIA culture was . ”
Kay ’s findings
In December 2003 , Kay flew back to CIA headquarters .
He said he told Tenet that Curveball was a liar and he was convinced Iraq had no mobile labs or other illicit weapons .
CIA officials confirm their exchange .
Kay said he was assigned to a windowless office without a working telephone .
On Jan. 20 , 2004 , Bush lauded Kay and the Iraq Survey Group in his State of the Union Speech for finding “ weapons of mass destruction - related program activities ....
Had we failed to act , the dictator ’s weapons of mass destruction program would continue to this day . ”
Kay quit three days later and went public with his concerns .
In Germany , the BND finally agreed to let the CIA interview Curveball .
The CIA sent one of its best officers , fluent in German and gifted at working reluctant sources .
They met at BND headquarters in Pullach , a suburb of Munich , in mid-March 2004 -- one year after the Iraq invasion .
Alone with Curveball at last , the CIA officer steadily reviewed details and picked at contradictions like a prosecutor working a hostile witness .
He showed spy satellite images and other evidence from the sites Curveball had identified .
Each night , he would file an encrypted report to CIA headquarters on his computer , and then call Drumheller .
“ After the first couple of days , he said , ‘ This does n’t sound good , ’ ” Drumheller recalled .
“ After the first week , he said , ‘ This guy is lying .
He ’s lying about a bunch of stuff . ’ ”
But Curveball refused to admit deceit .
When challenged , he would mumble , say he did n’t know and suggest the questioner was wrong or the photo was doctored .
As the evidence piled up , he simply stopped talking .
“ He never said , ‘ You got me , ’ ” Drumheller said .
“ He just shrugged , and did n’t say anything .
It was all over .
We told our guy , ‘ You might as well wrap it up and come home . ’ ”
It took more than a month to track and recall every U.S. intelligence report -- at least 100 in all -- based on Curveball ’s misinformation .
In a blandly worded notice to its stations around the world , the CIA said in May 2004 :
“ Discrepancies surfaced regarding the information provided by ... Curveball in this stream of reporting , which indicate that he lost his claimed access in 1995 .
Our assessment , therefore , is that Curveball appears to be fabricating in this stream of reporting . ”
The CIA had advised Bush in the fall of 2003 of “ problems with the sourcing ” on biological weapons , an official familiar with the briefing said .
But the president has never withdrawn the statement in his 2003 State of the Union speech that Iraq produced “ germ warfare agents ” or his postwar assertions that “ we found the weapons of mass destruction . ”
U.S. , British and German intelligence officials still debate what Curveball really saw , and what he really did .
One possible answer was buried in records the Iraq Survey Group recovered at the engineering and design center in Baghdad .
They show that Iraqi officials considered installing seed handling gear on trucks in 1995 , but instead put the machinery in warehouses , like those at Djerf al Nadaf .
Perhaps Curveball heard about the modified trucks and spun them into a bio-weapons system for gullible intelligence agencies .
“ You ’re left at the end with uncertainty , ” said the former CIA official who helped supervise the Curveball case and the postwar investigation .
“ We know what he said .
We know we do n’t believe him .
But was he making it all up ?
Was he coached ?
Did he hear something and then embellish it ?
These things are still unresolved . ”
Not for Curveball .
“ He is convinced his story is true , ” said the BND analyst .
“ He has no doubts to this day . ”
